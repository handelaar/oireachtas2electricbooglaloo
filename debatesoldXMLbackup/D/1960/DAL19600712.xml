      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that the people in tourist resorts are under great pressure this year and would he not consider meeting a representative deputation from the hoteliers of the tourist resorts in view of what happened last Sunday when they had to close down their hotels and licensed premises in the height of the tourist season?  I think this is something of great significance. I would suggest now to the Minister that he should say that he would be prepared to meet a representative deputation from the hoteliers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I would not be prepared to meet such a deputation because it would serve no useful purpose. As the Deputy knows, this matter has been discussed in the House for a period of over six months and this question was in the forefront of the <Col N="1256" /> discussion.  In addition, I met numerous deputations while the Bill was going through the House and this question was discussed with one of the deputations.</P>

      <P>The Department of Agriculture does not engage in the business of bacon-curing, but, apart from that, since the capacity of the bacon factories in this country is more than sufficient to deal with the supply of pigs, no useful purpose would be served by the erection of a bacon factory in West Cork.</P>

Information relating to these deposits is contained in the Geological Survey Office publication entitled &ldquo;Barytes in Ireland&rdquo;.  The exploitation of the deposits, to the extent to which they are commercially workable, is, of course, a matter for private enterprise under and in accordance with the necessary licences or leases under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 and 1960.  In the past three years one prospecting licence and one State mining permission have been issued for the exploration and development of these deposits; and a State mining lease of <Col N="1258" /> the deposits is now in course of preparation for issue to a company which has applied for a lease in order to work the deposits.</P>

Is it not true that, in fact, since that time the agreement by which Crown Colony Sugar is preferred through the medium of a levy on sugar from other sources has materially interfered with the advantages guaranteed to us under that section of the 1948 Trade Agreement?

We are prolonging the term within which the Minister may give a direction that the pension should be paid.  That is all.  At the moment under the 1911 Act, the period is three months.

The Minister is extending the period for which an old age pension can fall into arrears and still be recovered by the pensioner by his direction, if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances surround the case.  Is there anything irrelevant when dealing with this Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to ask, if the Minister intends to do this in respect of old age pensions, would he not consider extending this power to other analogous payments? If it is right to meet the problem of an old age pensioner who does not collect his pension regularly for good reasons, then if there is a case of a person who is drawing a widow's pension, or a person who is drawing children's allowances, would it not be quite justifiable to extend the time generally for such people?  Analogous circumstances can arise and I am prepared to concede that it is reasonable to fix a general time limit in respect of the encashment of old age pension orders, and children's allowances and other orders, and that after that date these orders will be deemed to be out of date.  If special circumstances are brought to the attention of the Minister in regard to any of these social security payments, should he not have discretion to allow them to be revised and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I simply do not know what the Social Welfare Act, 1952, relates to but I do know that in the Bill we are dealing not only with old age pensions but unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions and a variety of other matters relating to the Social Welfare Acts.  The only point I am trying to raise is this: if in respect of <Col N="1285" /> old age pensions, which is one part of the general social welfare code, we have found by experience that it is desirable to extend the period in which the validity of old age pension warrants can be revised, would the Minister review the procedure in relation to payments made by him on foot of orders of this kind with a view to seeing whether it might not be desirable to extend a similar concession to other payments under the social security code?  In addition to that, it is proposed to extend the payments under the old age pensions chapter of that code.  I think it is a very relevant point and to tell the truth, I think the prudent approach of the Parliamentary Secretary would more closely approximate to my approach than the temperamental reaction of the Minister.</P>

I have often asked this question and I must confess I do not know the right answer.  An old age pensioner, a mother, for example, is invited to Britain for a holiday, as many of them are.  If she goes and if her stay extends over three months, she will be in trouble over her weekly dockets.  If she goes there and stays for six months and becomes ill for six months, as many of them do, has the Minister now power to allow payment to her in respect of the six months period when she was in Britain?  If she goes now and returns within three months, I think she may collect her old age pension for the three months.  Is it now proposed to allow her to collect it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is leaving it to the discretion of the R.M.S. Surely the majority of relatives are good and surely if they got that money, they would bring comforts to the patients which they would not ordinarily get.  Perhaps the Minister could have the power to do that by regulation if he thought it desirable, as in some cases it will be at the discretion of the R.M.S.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if I could deal with that situation by regulation. After all, we are legislating on this matter and no power is given to the Minister for Social Welfare to vary the terms of subsection (2) of this section. The Parliamentary Secretary knows the administrative end of this matter much better than I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I put this point? I agree with the principle of this section, but what I am concerned to ensure is that the purpose of the section will be faithfully served.  Subsection (2) provides that the Resident Physician and Governor may &ldquo;in his absolute discretion, pay to the person for his own use such portion (not exceeding ten shillings per week) of the pension as he considers proper in the particular circumstances, if, in his opinion, the person is capable of making proper use of the portion so paid&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a very difficult and delicate situation.  We must bear in mind that in a mental hospital there are a good many patients and it is not in the power of the R.M.S. to give his personal attention to the use made of every 10/- allowance that may be available under this section of the Bill. Suppose the R.M.S. forms the conclusion that the person concerned is not himself capable of making proper use of the 10/-, is the section wide enough <Col N="1288" /> to allow the R.M.S. to use the 10/- for the benefit of the patient by purchasing tobacco, sweets, or some other comforts which a patient might like to have?</P>
    <P>I envisage a situation possibly arising where the R.M.S. might feel that a particular patient would derive benefit from tobacco, sweets, or something like that, but if he gets the 10/- he might lose it, or burn it or light his pipe with it or do with it as children might do.  At the same time, the R.M.S. might feel that he would like to buy some comforts with the 10/- but that the terms of the section so restricted him that he was not free to hand the 10/- to any patient who was not himself capable of making proper use of it. Perhaps the Minister would look into it.  Is it practical to leave it to the discretion of the R.M.S. to use the 10/- on behalf of the patient or must we confine it to such persons only as the R.M.S. believes are &ldquo;capable of making proper use of the portion so paid&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is, of course, that many patients in mental hospitals are rational within certain limits and can be trusted to spend the 10/- usefully or carefully in canteens, perhaps, which most hospitals now have.  There are others, of course, who would be quite incapable of making any rational use of any money given to them.  Therefore, it is necessary to give this discretion to the Resident Physician and Governor, or the R.M.S., as he is generally known.  So far as the purchase of tobacco is concerned I think that is already part of the ration provided for patients in mental hospitals and, therefore, the question of buying tobacco does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is whether a person whom the resident physician judges not to be capable of using money rationally would be capable of enjoying anything&mdash;in the sense in which that term is generally used&mdash;which he might buy for the cash which the Resident Physician might allot him.  The section is a highly experimental one and I think we should let it stand and see how it works out.  I am sure, in practice, where a patient is likely to <Col N="1289" /> benefit by the expenditure of 10/-, the Resident Physician will find a way and will not be cabined and confined by the exact text of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should show appreciation of the Minister for the inclusions he has made in this legislation. In recent years, when an increase was given to such people as we are providing for now, just that was given and that alone, but even though the Minister is to be applauded for introducing changes, his mind should be flexible on many of these proposals. This one is a case in point.  The Minister himself has said that this is an experimental section, and we all appreciate that it is and must be experimental, but I still think he ought to make provision for the payment of some of this money to some relative who would be recommended and trusted by the R.M.S.</P>
      <P>I know of dozens of couples in this country today where the husband has the old age pension of, say, 28/6d. a week but, as the wife is 68 years of age, she has nothing.  She has no regular income but she may have 10/- or £1 from the local authority by way of home assistance, so that between the old age pension and the extra £1, they have £2 8s. 6d. per week.  If the husband is committed to a mental hospital, his 28/6d. per week goes with him and his wife is left with £1.  Public assistance authorities are not inclined to step up their assistance payments, and in such cases, therefore, it means there is a very serious loss of income for the partner left.  For that reason the Minister should take power in this section to allow the R.M.S., at his discretion, to make some payment to a near dependant.  If the Minister so wishes, he can specify husband or wife.</P>

Even old age pensioners have a hope of being rehabilliated, and giving them the old age <Col N="1290" /> pension helps to give them the power of thinking for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This business of having them go in under the national health scheme and having so much retained for the institution and so much handed over to a relative for the patient is something that has been much abused.  The relatives, perhaps, may be third or fourth cousins, and their first consideration is certainly not the patient.  The provision in this Bill leaves it to the discretion of the R.M.S. whether or not to give the 10/- to the patient.</P>
      <P>When we talk of the R.M.S., we must include the staff of efficient specialists under him who deal with various aspects of mental health and who have a personal approach to the patient.  If I might use the term as it is used in charitable institutions, the patient becomes a child of the particular doctor dealing with him.  Whether it is a question of sending the patient out to a football match, to a circus or for a walk around the town, that doctor is the best judge of what is in the patient's interest.  Therefore, I would advise the Minister to adhere to this principle in the Bill and let those who know what is best for the patient deal with this matter of the provision of money.</P>

I did not question at all the ability of those who treat mental patients.  I do not want to deal with the question of treatment.  I asked only that the R.M.S. be given a discretion to give part of the old age pension to a wife left at home who has nothing except, perhaps, 10/- or a £1 from the home assistance authority. I see one ray of light.  The R.M.S. may give 10/- to the old age pensioner who, in turn, will pass it on to the husband or wife, as the case may be.</P>

      <P>There are two aspects of this.  First, you must consider the welfare of the healthy person outside the institution, the husband or the wife, and then the curing of the person inside the institution.

Until that approach is made, I do not think the provisions of the Bill should be interfered with.</P>

      <P>In this case I think the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are right and Deputy Corish mistaken; but I think Deputy Corish put his finger on a very urgent matter that has often caused me many sleepless nights, both when he himself was Minister for Social Welfare and in the days of his predecessors in our Government and in the Fianna Fáil Government. Deputy Corish says that where a widow or a wife is left with only 20/- a week, local authorities are disinclined to step up their rate of assistance. I wonder would the Minister for Social Welfare avail of the opportunity to state am I wrong in, believing that there is a statutory obligation on the public health authority in every area to protect every citizen of this State from destitution and to step in with home assistance to bridge the gap between whatever income that individual has and what may be necessary to provide a very modest standard of comfort for that person?  I believe that to be the law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if it is not the law, it ought to be the law.  If it is the law, I do not understand how any of us can say that if an afflicted person has to be removed to a mental hospital and leaves after him a wife who has only £1 a week, the local authority is slow to raise the allowance.  Nobody can maintain that an elderly woman with £1 a week has a sufficiency to keep body and soul together.  I understand the local authority has a statutory obligation to go into the case of that aged person with 20/- a week and <Col N="1292" /> to determine in a humanitarian manner what supplement is requisite to protect her from destitution and to provide that sum forthwith through the means of home assistance.</P>
      <P>If that is not being done&mdash;and I have said this on more than one occasion to Ministers for Social Welfare and not particularly to the present Minister &mdash;surely the Minister for Social Welfare has an obligation, if nobody else takes the initiative, to constitute himself the champion of any destitute person anywhere in Ireland and to say: &ldquo;The law makes provision and fixes responsibility and if those on whom responsibility is fixed by law do not do their duty, it is my duty as Minister to take such steps as may be requisite to compel them to do so.&rdquo; Is that not the situation at present?</P>

      <P>That is a question I shall not answer <i>extempore.</i>  The situation is this.  Where the person is unable by his or her own efforts to secure the necessaries of life, then the local assistance authority has the obligation of preserving him or her from destitution, but do not forget the qualifying phrase &ldquo;Where persons are unable by their own efforts to provide for themselves.&rdquo;  Then, and only then, does the obligation fall on the public assistance authority.</P>
      <P>With regard to the case which Deputy Corish has raised, the first thing we have got to bear in mind is that the old age pension attaches to the pensioner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It does attach to him because he is the only person who fulfils the condition.  The next thing is this, and it is, perhaps, a change 50 years overdue.  As the law stands at present, if an old age pensioner becomes a patient in a mental hospital, he loses his pension.  He forfeits it; and if he is released from the hospital, he has to apply for it again and prove qualification.</P>
      <P>The change I am making is that he will carry that pension with him into the mental hospital and if he should be released within a period, he carries his pension out of the hospital so that he does not forfeit it at any time and does not have to go through the procedure of making a fresh application for it.  The pension is attached to the old age pensioner. If an old age pensioner goes into a county home or a home for the aged and infirm, he carries the pension with him and it is appropriated by the authorities of that home to maintain him and not to maintain any person whom he may have left outside, because the assumption in law is&mdash;and I think it is a valid one&mdash;that the person he has left outside has not been dependent on him. The old age pension is given in relief of a person in necessity and not to help him to discharge any obligation that may attach to him personally beyond that of keeping himself alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a person goes into a mental hospital as a patient, I am putting him in precisely the same position as he would be in if he were going into a county home or into a charitable home for the aged.  Just as in the case of the county home, the pension which he carries into the hospital with him is appropriated to help maintain him there.  I think that is fair to him and <Col N="1294" /> to the community of which he is a member&mdash;that what is given to him should be used for his maintenance and not for the maintenance of any other person.</P>
    <P>That is the principle which is in this section and the principle upon which I hope the House will permit me to stand.  The concessions it is proposed to give to him are, in fact, the same concessions as are made to a person who enters a county home, that he carries with him the full amount of the old age pension, 28/6d. It will not be appropriated entirely by the county home or by the local authority or by the authority which manages the charitable institution of which he is an inmate but he will have first claim on the old age pension to an extent not exceeding 10/-.</P>
    <P>I think there is nothing more equitable than that and I do not think that I should be required to defend this section against criticism such as we have heard.  We are going very far in this section.  It will impose on the Exchequer a burden which has been estimated at something over £100,000 and I think that is very generous indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to criticise&mdash;nor do we criticise&mdash;the Minister for what he is doing.  I began my speech on this section by congratulating the Minister on the very welcome change he is making and I merely asked him to go a little further.  He has given us the law as far as old age pensions are concerned and says that the pension is attached to the pensioner. That may be true legally, but, as Deputy Dillon says, the Minister has a responsibility toward the old people and so have the local authorities.  In my opinion, the local authorities do not discharge their obligation towards old people but I do not want to pursue that on this section as I do not think it is absolutely relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to disillusion the Minister so far as old age pension allowances are concerned.  The local authority does not consider that the pensions are attached solely to the individual.  My experience is that some local authorities believe the £1 per <Col N="1295" /> week per individual is sufficient on which to live and in the case of a couple if one has 28/6d. per week as an, old age pension, invariably the local authority will say: &ldquo;Another 11/6d. will bring that up to £2; now you have £1 each per week.&rdquo;  I have no quarrel with the Minister on that. I realise the obligation that has been placed on local authorities to look after poor persons but I say they do not do it.  I believe it is the local representatives, the people who were elected in, the past week or two, who do not face up to their responsibilities and who should do so.  That is a responsibility they have had for the past 21 years, a responsibility given to them, possibly by the Minister, in the Public Assistance Act, of 1939. The Minister has made an improvement and while I am sorry that he will not go any further and allow the R.M.S. to consider a near dependant outside I shall not pursue the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is, as stated in the Long Title, to enable the corporation of a county borough to provide, or to assist in the provision of a concert hall, theatre or opera house.  Last September the Cork Corporation passed a resolution agreeing in principle to give a grant of £25,000 to the Cork Opera House Trust Fund and requested the Government's permission to do so.  I may say that this resolution was passed on the understanding that State assistance by way of a loan towards the rebuilding of the opera house would be provided. I informed the corporation that while existing legislation did not empower them to make the proposed contribution of £25,000, the necessary steps would be taken to enable them to give effect to their resolution.  The Bill, however, is not being restricted to Cork Corporation.  It is proposed that the corporations of the four county boroughs will be given the powers set out in the Bill.  A request was received from Limerick Corporation that any concessions being made to Cork should be made to Limerick, so that they might consider the making of a grant to the executive committee of Féile Luimnighe towards the provision of a theatre and concert hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) of Section 1 sets out the procedure which must be followed where a corporation propose to operate the provisions of the Bill.  It entails the publication in the press of a copy of the resolution.  A waiting period of between 60 and 180 days is then allowed so that any person who objects can make representations.  The resolution must then be confirmed by a <Col N="1297" /> further resolution and becomes operative when it has been confirmed by an Order made by the Minister for Local Government.  This procedure may seem cumbersome but it is desirable that the maximum publicity should be given to any proposal to provide for expenditure from the rates on projects of the nature contemplated in the Bill. A similar procedure, is contained in the Harbours Act, 1947, which enables local authorities to provide financial assistance to harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>In addition to enabling the four county borough corporations to assist bodies in providing such halls, the Bill gives them power to provide, operate and maintain such buildings themselves and sets out the purposes for which they may be used, for example, concerts, stage plays, operas, meetings, lectures, exhibitions and general recreation or other similar social objects. Where assistance is given by a corporation to a body providing such a building, such assistance may be conditional on an agreement between the corporation and the body as to the use and disposal of the building.</P>
    <P>A building provided under this Bill may also be used for purposes other than those specifically mentioned in the Bill provided such use is occasional only, and a part of the building may be used continually for other purposes provided such part does not form a substantial part of the whole building. The building could thus be availed of for such purposes as election counts.</P>
    <P>The Bill also enables approved expenditure for the purposes in question to be defrayed by way of loan from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a desirable proposal.  There are just a few points that strike me about it.  Is there any reason why it should be limited to the four county boroughs?  It is conceivable that few county councils would wish to adopt a proposal of this sort but it is just possible that in some county council areas a town or towns might be suitable for proposals such as are envisaged in the Bill.  I cannot say what the reaction of, say, Dún Laoghaire Corporation would be to a proposal of this sort but it might be <Col N="1298" /> wise to include in the Bill a provision to enable the corporation, if they saw fit or if occasion warranted, to consider such a proposal.  Dún Laoghaire is an important tourist area, as are certain other resorts, which, while not coming within the statutory definition of a county borough, nevertheless, have an attraction from the tourist point of view.  It is possible that towns in these county council areas might be anxious to avail of facilities of the sort provided in the Bill, if it were possible for them to do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish, possibly, will speak about the extraordinary success of the Wexford Festival which, as I understand the legislation at the moment, would be precluded from benefiting under this proposal.  Subject to these considerations, I believe that the proposals enshrined in the Bill will have general acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on introducing the Bill. I congratulate him on the idea as far as it goes, but, like Deputy Cosgrave, I wonder why the Bill does not go farther.  It is the members of the local body who will decide whether or not assistance will be given and I do not know why the provisions of the Bill are confined to the four county boroughs.  They ought to be extended to other bodies.  I do not know whether one needs to go down as far as town commissioners or not but, if they have the power, within the limit of their own resources, they will certainly decide whether they should or should not assist the type of projects which are included in this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify a matter for me?  Have not the local bodies power, under a peculiar name&mdash;the Sanitary Services Act&mdash;to do similar things?  Can they not provide money or provide a building, a concert hall, for example, in a particular place, with conditions as to its use?  I am sure the Minister and his officials have explored that possibility and have discovered that as far as the Cork Opera House Trust Fund is concerned, the Cork Corporation are not empowered to make a grant.  Perhaps the difference is that the Cork Corporation <Col N="1299" /> could, under the Sanitary Services Act, 1948, build a concert hall or opera house and set down the conditions for its use and the manner in which it is to be used and that under this Bill, the local body may give a grant and the use of the hall is a matter to be determined by agreement between the owners of the hall and the local body.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave anticipated that I would mention a place like Wexford town which is a borough corporation, not a county borough corporation.  I do not know what is in the minds of the members of the Wexford Corporation but it may arise in respect of the Wexford Festival Committee that a grant for the building, renovation or reconstruction of a concert hall or theatre would be desirable.  Therefore if this Bill gives power to borough corporations to make grants, Wexford Corporation, Drogheda Corporation, Kilkenny Corporation, Clonmel Corporation or any of the other borough corporations might act in a similar manner for the purpose of having a reasonably good opera house or concert hall in their functional area.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, this is a good Bill, but I wonder whether or not these powers are not embodied in the Sanitary Services Act of 1948 under the terms of which any local body can provide a concert hall, an opera house, a playground, an amusement park, or any of these things.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I was not here for the Minister's introductory speech but I should like to ask him if there is any power whereby one of the specified county boroughs can acquire an existing hall.  Section 1 (5) says:</P>
      <P>The corporation of a county borough may acquire by agreement land for or including a concert hall...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that means the concert hall <Col N="1300" /> could be on the land in question. When the Cork Opera House project was mooted I and others made representations to the Minister to have Limerick included in, this Bill. Our legal adviser told us, wrongly I submit&mdash;but the local authority must accept the advice of its law agent&mdash; that as the law stood we were not empowered to give a grant to Féile Luimnighe which body purchased the Coliseum Cinema.  I am not conversant with the matter raised by Deputy Coogan and Deputy Corish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood there was very little reason for complaint in Galway because it has the Taibhdhearc which serves the needs of Galway, the capital of the Gaeltacht. Wexford has set a headline for the whole country with its annual festival and it certainly does not seem to be short of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other sections under which Wexford could benefit and Limerick could not.  The Wexford Festival apart from being an international festival is looked upon as being a national festival as well, embracing the whole of Ireland.  The body in Limerick which purchased the Coliseum was regarded purely as a local organisation and even, though there were entries from outside, the organisation was composed of people in Limerick city.</P>
      <P>There are three ways that one of the specified county boroughs can help in having a hall erected.  It can, make a free grant; it can make a loan or the approved local body can go to the bank and the Limerick Corporation can guarantee that body at the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the county borough gives a free grant from what source will it be payable? Will it be from the rates? You will not put up much of a building for £20,000 and if we gave a grant of £20,000 it would amount to about 2/- on the rates.  Although this is a very desirable project the rates are high enough as they are, if not too <Col N="1301" /> high.  Therefore Section 1 (b) (i) which makes provision for a free grant is not realistic.</P>
    <P>With regard to making a loan, is it envisaged that the council of a county borough which wishes to make a loan to an approved body would borrow from the Local Loans Fund?  I understand it can and everyone will probably snatch at that way out.  It is a much fairer way and if I were the Minister I would cut out the provision in respect of a free grant.  Why should there be a free grant when a loan is available that can be repaid? The Limerick Corporation could borrow from the Local Loans Fund at, say, 5¾ per cent.  That could be lent to the approved body which is building this hall at, say, six per cent., an extra quarter per cent. to cover administrative costs.  If this were spread over 35 years like the S.D.A.A. loans or over 50 years like the Housing of the Working Classes loans, there would be no burden on the rates.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting possibility in this Bill.  Section 1 (1) (a) says:</P>
    <P>The corporation of a county borough may resolve either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to provide and maintain a concert hall, theatre or opera house,</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that, for the first time in the history of local government, an approved county borough may now under the provisions of this Bill run a concert hall, theatre or opera house.  For the sake of argument, Limerick may decide that one of the most desirable amenities required in Ireland today is a convention hall.  Would such a hall come within the provisions of this measure? We have lost&mdash;the Director General of Bord Fáilte will confirm this, and the Chairman will bear it out&mdash;much tourist business in the past couple of years because we had not, first of all, a large enough hall in which international conventions could be held and, secondly, we had not sufficient hotels.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the question of accommodation does not arise under this Bill but perhaps the Minister will inform the House as to whether or not <Col N="1302" /> it would be possible for a corporation&mdash;be it in Cork, Dublin or Limerick &mdash;to build such a hall.  Not so very long ago, a very large international medical congress was held in Dublin. Were it not for the co-operation and good offices of Irish Hospitals Trust, that congress would have been a complete fiasco.  We had the spectacle of groups having to go to halls in different parts of the city.  The provision of a convention hall, then, is my first point.</P>
    <P>Secondly, will it be open to a local authority under this Bill to run, for the benefit of the ratepayers, a concert hall, an opera house, or a theatre?  I can see trouble there.  Such an undertaking might prove of substantial benefit to the ratepayers, but I can visualise a clash with private enterprise. At the moment, if I apply to the I.D.A. for a loan and/or grant for a new industry, I shall not get financial assistance if there is any danger that I might compete with an existing industry.  It would, therefore, appear to be somewhat unfair to enable a local authority to build a ballroom, a cinema or a dancehall through the medium of moneys borrowed at a quite reasonable rate of interest from the Local Loans Fund, or possibly a free grant, in order to compete with already existing private enterprise. Such an investment by a local authority might be of an inestimable benefit to the ratepayers.  It might also put out of business both the small man and the big man, and we might find ourselves in the position of taking away employment, on the one hand, while providing it, on the other.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that this measure is long overdue.  It is a very welcome one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by the first three speakers&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Corish and Deputy Coogan&mdash; was one that was considered by my Department and myself before bringing this measure to the House.  The question was asked as to why the provisions of this Bill should not apply to county councils, and others, apart from the four named borough corporations. The answer is that county <Col N="1303" /> councils, urban councils, and town commissioners enjoy at the moment certain facilities in relation to the provision of halls.  Town halls are provided for in the 1936 Act.  Under that Act, a hall may be provided by urban councils or town commissioners.  Under the 1941 Act, provision was made enabling parish halls to be provided by county councils.  The 1941 Act was subsequently amended in 1955 to include county borough councils.  The 1955 Act gave to county councils the facilities enjoyed by others under the 1941 Act.  While these three Acts have been available to local bodies, I should say that no real use has been made by local bodies, whether town commissioners, urban councils, or county councils, of their provisions.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill became necessary because of the situation which had arisen in Cork Corporation. When it became known that the Government intended to introduce legislation for the purpose of clarifying the situation in Cork, representations were made by Limerick Corporation for the extension to them of whatever powers might be given to Cork Corporation. No real demand was made by any other local authority, then or since, for the extension of the provisions of this measure to them.  Having considered both Cork and Limerick, it was decided that the facilities being given to Cork should also be extended to Limerick.  That left us with two Corporations, Waterford and Dublin, and we decided to deal with all four Corporations under this Bill by giving all four this power to make grants or provide the particular facilities mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only new departure as against the provisions already available to county councils, urban councils and town commissioners, is that grants may now be made by the four corporations to any body for the purpose of providing a hall, theatre, or opera house. But again, as I say, if the demand were there and the requests were made, and there had been any effort in the past 25 odd years really to use these facilities, or that there was a need for them, we possibly might have been <Col N="1304" /> discussing the application of these terms to those other local authorities. At this stage, however, I would say that should the Bill create a demand throughout the country for the extension of the new facilities, such demand will be sympathetically received and it will not be a very difficult measure to extend the provisions of this Bill to cover any of the local authorities in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked whether the corporations would not be empowered to acquire the land for the purpose of erecting and providing any of the facilities such as I have mentioned. The answer is that they will be empowered to acquire land, but only by an agreement.  There is no suggestion that they are being given compulsory acquisition powers to deal with this matter.  The Deputy also asked whether they might be empowered to acquire or purchase an existing premises, building or hall, for any of the purposes that we have been discussing. Again the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I take it that the wording &ldquo;they may provide&rdquo; means that they can provide a building from the ground up, or take over an existing building and add, extend, improve or do what they may with it.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy also asked from what source the moneys provided by way of grant will come.  The moneys will come from the rates in any area in which a corporation proposes to make a grant, and may be raised by way of loan from the Local Loans Fund, which is a facility to help such bodies in these ventures.  I was also asked whether a hall, opera house, theatre or otherwise could be run for the benefit of the ratepayers.  Again the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and I only hope that if they propose to run any such project it will be for the financial benefit of the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The question of objections that might arise from the promoters of a private enterprise, whose livelihood or business might be interfered with is one of the reasons which has prompted the provision in the Bill for formal publicity and notices, in order that objections may be made and considered by all concerned before any <Col N="1305" /> final decision is made in any particular instance.  I think the commonsense and goodwill of the corporators in all four corporations will ensure that there will be no real clash in regard to this matter and that we shall not have various places of entertainment in competition with one another, some run by a corporation and others by private enterprise.  I do not think that is something about which we need worry too much.  That, I feel, is as far as I need go on this at the moment but if I have overlooked any point raised by any Deputy I shall try to elucidate it as far as possible.</P>

      <P>Part VIII of the Local Government Act of 1941 empowers a county council to provide a building for use by a local council&mdash;that refers to local parish councils as they then were in existence&mdash;of which they have approved by resolution, and they may entrust the care and management of such building to such a local council. The county council may also assist the local council by providing them with furniture, office equipment and stationery and may pay a caretaker to look after the hall.  That, roughly, is the situation in regard to the 1941 Act as it was, but it was further extended and amended in 1955.  Under the 1955 Act it is provided that county councils may make grants to approved local councils towards the cost of providing a hall, and further, a county borough council may declare councils, committees or other bodies established by the local inhabitants of a locality in a county borough to be approved local councils, and may provide and make grants towards them for the provision of halls.</P>

The law in regard to the provision of town halls by urban districts <Col N="1306" /> is somewhat complicated.  The section which is generally relied on is Section 6 of the Local Authorities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1936 which provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the council of a borough or an urban district to provide and maintain a fit and convenient building for use as a town hall (whether also containing or not containing offices for the transaction of the business of such council) and to provide and maintain in such building all necessary and proper furniture and fittings.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Deputies will probably remember that, some time ago, there was a certain amount of public disquiet here and in Britain because of the fire hazards associated with particular types of oil heaters.  There were, unfortunately, a number of fatal accidents in Britain which emphasised the necessity to examine this problem at once.  Many of the oil heaters which are in use in this country have been imported from Britain, and some contain features which are recognised as representing a fire hazard in certain conditions of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had under consideration for some time past the action which might best be taken here to deal with the fire hazard associated with oil heaters, and I have had the benefit of discussions with assemblers, importers and distributors of oil heaters.  The action taken in Britain in this matter has, of course, been helpful in our consideration of the problems associated with the use of these heaters.  It will be recalled, perhaps, that a report on oil heaters was furnished to the British Government in March of this year by <Col N="1308" /> the British Joint Fire Research Organisation. Subsequent to this, a British Standard Specification was prescribed for oil heaters, and a Bill is now going through Parliament, the effect of which will be to prohibit the sale of dangerous oil heaters in Britain.</P>
    <P>While the danger attaching to the use of oil heaters can, perhaps, be exaggerated, nevertheless, I think that the situation is one which requires action on the part of the Government. We appear to have had very few accidents resulting from the use of these heaters, but it must be recognised that under certain operating conditions, some of these heaters do represent a serious fire hazard, and the public interest requires that whatever corrective action may be possible ought to be taken as soon as practicable.  A situation is likely to develop in which large numbers of sub-standard oil heaters manufactured in Britain the sale of which will henceforth be prohibited in Britain will become available for export markets.</P>
    <P>It would be a very unfortunate development if large numbers of defective oil heaters were imported and sold to the public here.  I am sure that the introduction of this Bill will make it clear that the Government intend to take action to deal with the types of oil heaters which represent a fire hazard, and importers and firms engaged in the manufacture or assembly of oil heaters here will be expected to make sure that the heaters which they are placing on the market are of a safe type and do not incorporate the features which have made some of these heaters a hazard to human life and property.</P>
    <P>The broad effect of the Bill will be to empower the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make regulations requiring that oil heaters which are offered for sale comply with an approved specification which will ensure that the risk of fire will be eliminated as far as possible.  There will be a requirement to attach to oil heaters instructions about their use so that the public will be properly informed about the correct use of these heaters.  There will, also, be a requirement that heaters should have attached <Col N="1309" /> to them an indication that they comply with the specification prescribed by the Act.  This will facilitate the purchasing public, since it will be an easy matter for persons to assure themselves that an oil heater which they propose to purchase complies with the approved specification.</P>
    <P>I do not think that for the present it is necessary to do more than to give the Bill a Second Reading.  The trade and the public will be aware of what is proposed in this measure, and they will have noticed that, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, the remaining stages of the Bill will be taken after the summer recess.  I will endeavour to ensure that a draft of the specification will be prepared as soon as possible, and copies will be made available to all interested parties.  It will obviously be of assistance to manufacturers and the trade generally to have a copy of the draft specification in their hands at the earliest possible moment, so that whatever arrangements may be necessary may be put in hands to meet the situation which will be created when the Bill becomes law towards the end of the year.  I am sure that traders generally will be conscious of their responsibilities in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>Apart from the heavy financial losses which would be likely to result from stocking heaters which will have become unsaleable on the enactment of the Bill, the sale of defective heaters may involve traders in difficulties in relation to the Sale of Goods Act.  Furthermore, traders who supply dangerous heaters expose themselves to the risk of an action for damages in the event that personal injury or material damage results from the use of such heaters.</P>
    <P>I think that it is important that the dangers associated with the use of oil heaters should not be exaggerated. Indeed, we cannot be unmindful of the fact that accidents are frequently associated with the use of gas fires, electric heaters and coal fires, and they can arise in many other ways as well. The exercise of reasonable care by everyone is probably the most important factor in accident prevention, and <Col N="1310" /> this is especially true in the home where unfortunately so many accidents occur.</P>
    <P>I hope that the proposals contained in this Bill will be acceptable to the House and that there will be general agreement concerning the course of action which is proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, this Bill will generally be approved. It represents what might be described as desirable legislation which the House can consider in a completely non-political manner and which depends to a considerable extent on the co-operation of all sections to see that it is properly and efficiently implemented. This matter has received very considerable publicity in Britain. The British Home Secretary considered a report furnished by the Joint Fire Research Organisation and I think other reports that had been made to his Department.  As a result, legislation is before the British Parliament.</P>
      <P>This is only one of a variety of desirable pieces of legislation which might be enacted to deal with accidents which occur and which in many cases could be avoided if the public were properly instructed and informed of the dangers.  In this country, so far, very few cases have occurred due to defective oil-burning heaters but, as the Minister remarked, fires occur from time to time which could be avoided if proper precautions were taken.  While it may not be a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in considering a measure of this sort we are entitled to take into account accidents which occur in other spheres of activity.  I am thinking particularly of accidents where tractors are involved or where defective electrical appliances are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accidents sometimes occur because the people concerned are not properly trained in the driving of tractors or are not obliged to pass any test which would justify them in having a licence to drive a tractor.  Quite a number of fatal accidents could have been avoided.  Similarly, fatal accidents have occurred because people dealt with electrical wires or electrical appliances without any training or certainly without adequate training and <Col N="1311" /> without taking the essential precautions which trained personnel would take as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that these are just two cases which in relation to legislation of this kind might be considered. So far as this measure is concerned, we approve entirely of the proposal which will, as the Minister said, focus attention on the dangers involved.  Specific regulations will be drafted before the remaining Stages of the Bill are taken and any amendments or alterations which are desirable can be considered in the meantime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Cosgrave says, this is a Bill which is eminently suited for objective discussion.  There are two points which I think require attention.  We agree with the proposal to take precautionary measures to prevent fire hazards arising from oil burners.  As Deputy Cosgrave says, the whole question of fire hazards must not be overlooked.  We are taking precautions today against a very limited sphere of these hazards.</P>
      <P>I want to submit to the Minister that, having put his hand so promptly to this particular type of fire hazard, he ought really to turn his mind to another fire hazard of a closely analogous kind which I think constitutes a far more formidable threat, that is, the hazard of highly inflammable material of which light clothes are apparently manufactured.  The Minister pointed out that the number of accidents we have here from oil stoves is very few. That is something upon which we can congratulate ourselves.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of publicity in England about the accidents resulting from defective oil burners there.  Possibly the Minister's attention was directed recently to a medical congress in England where it was pointed out that more than 50 per cent. of third degree burns which are brought to British hospitals derive from children and women having their night attire set on fire owing to the highly inflammable materials from which the attire is manufactured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that up to recently it was hard to provide against that but <Col N="1312" /> that now there are very few, if any, fabrics which cannot be impregnated with a suitable medium which renders the fabric indistinguishable from the original material but at the same time non-inflammable.  I do not think it would constitute any serious hardship on the manufacturers if persons offering flannelette and certain artificial fabrics made them non-inflammable before selling them to distributors.  I can conceive of certain retail interests complaining that they should have the right to have access to supplies of untreated materials of this character but I would be prepared to recommend to the Minister that such a claim should be denied.  People may claim to have the right to distribute live cartridges and guns but we do not hesitate to restrict that right because generally to distribute such things constitutes a hazard to the public out of all proportion to the advantage of the individual dealer who wishes to handle them promiscuously.</P>
    <P>I think that the horrible character of the burns sustained by people whose clothing takes fire is great enough to justify us in restricting access to such materials in the way which I now suggest.  While I do not want to belittle the Minister's Bill, I believe that reform on the lines suggested by me would be a very much more valuable contribution to the public welfare than the Oil Burners (Standards) Bill. It is to be borne in mind that the hazards with which this Bill deals largely consist of the destruction of premises.  That is a matter against which insurance can be purchased. The fire hazard I have described in connection with inflammable night clothes is of a character that no insurance can cover because it involves grave personal injury and very often it is of a gravely disfiguring and crippling kind.</P>
    <P>The second matter I want to deal with arises, first, under Section 3 of this Bill.  It provides:</P>
    <P>If any person in the course of a business sells, or lets under a hire-purchase agreement or on hire, or has in his possession for the purpose of selling or letting, an oil heater...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> The same proviso is reproduced in sub-section (2) of that section in relation to component parts of an oil heater.  I think that goes too far. There still survives in this country a considerable body of respectable citizens who have a deep antipathy to finding themselves in violation of the statute law.  Quite apart from the penalties provided in the Bill, they do not want to find themselves successfully prosecuted for a breach of the law.  Therefore, you should not make the law of such a kind that no rational creature can comply with it.  If there is any Deputy who has any experience of the hardware trade, he will know that in the course of a year's trading, you will accumulate a considerable quantity of spare parts.  From time to time, you go through that stock and weed out those spares that have become obsolete and you throw them out or destroy them.</P>
    <P>In a country hardware business especially you are liable to find spares which have been there for 18 months or two years and which have not been carefully gone through recently.  Under this Bill, if a spare part of a condemned type of oil burner is on your shelf, you are guilty of an offence.  I think that is going too far.  I think it is right to provide that if you sell the spare part of a defective burner or sell a defective burner, you are guilty of an offence but nobody only one who is extremely negligent or recklessly careless would deliberately sell or pass through his hands a prohibited article within the meaning of this Bill without having his attention drawn to what he was doing.</P>
    <P>It is not uncommon for a conscientious shopkeeper to have a spare part which does not comply with the requirements of the Bill.  He should not be made guilty of a criminal offence for having such a spare part. I think a suitable remedy for that would be to provide that if any person in the course of business sells, or lets under a hire-purchase agreement or on hire an oil heater which does not comply with the safety standards, he shall be guilty of an offence and if any person has in his possession for the purpose of selling such an oil heater <Col N="1314" /> or component part thereof after 1st January, 1961, he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say to me that if a man makes the defence that he had the part but not for the purpose of selling it, I assure him that that kind of defence is hard to sustain in public courts.  The substance of my case is that people should be given due notice and a fair time to put their house in order.  Then, if some conscientious person has failed to do that, having being given due notice and fair time to clear out any obsolete part in stock, it is his own funeral if he is subsequently charged and convicted under this Bill.  But he ought to get time to go through his stock and get notice of what he has to do before he can become an offender within the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the third point I want to make I want to refer to subsection (3) of Section 3, paragraph (b) where it is set out that it is a good defence, in regard to the sale of an oil heater prohibited under the terms of this Bill, to say that the vendor believed that the oil heater would not be used in the State.  I do not think that should be a good defence.  If you have an oil heater on your premises which you now know to constitute a hazard to anybody who uses it, I do not think that you should have the right to sell it for use in Spain, Devonshire or France on the ground that if you burn a Spaniard, a Frenchman or a Briton that is no concern of the Government of the Irish Republic.  I think it is. I imagine that this has been put in at the instance of some zealous trade association for the protection of its members.  I have sympathy with the zeal of the organisation which made this proposal but on reflection I do not think this Legislature will wish to go on record as saying it is a good defence in regard to the sale of an oil burner which constitutes a serious fire hazard to say that we sold it to a Spaniard, a Frenchman or a resident of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is in regard to a matter which I have no doubt relates more appropriately to <Col N="1315" /> drafting rather than to the substance of the Bill.  A long association with the Committee of Public Accounts and with colleagues whom I shall not describe as pedantic but with colleagues who were exacting in their demands on the draftsmen, leads me to examine Section 2 critically.  The section says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by regulations provide&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) for requiring oil heaters of such class or description...</P>
    <P>and so on, and</P>
    <P>(b) requiring oil heaters of such class or description as may be so specified to bear by means of such a label...</P>
    <P>Why is it appropriate to declare that regulations may be made &ldquo;for requiring&rdquo; oil heaters in paragraph (a) and in (b) just &ldquo;requiring oil heaters&rdquo; and in (c) &ldquo;for any other matter for which regulations are authorised under this Act&rdquo;?  Does paragraph (b) require re-drafting?  If so, I have no doubt it will be within the competence of the Minister to secure it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a simple Bill and I welcome it.  I have a little experience in this matter because I stock articles such as these, calor gas and so on.  I have seen these heaters working and I realise the dangers involved in their use.  With all these different classes of heaters, the extent of the danger depends on who is handling them.  An expert can handle a faulty heater without risk.  The danger arises when women and children come to handle them.  With a faulty heater you may get flames a foot high and that is what we are trying to guard against.  Even with a primus stove, if the burner is faulty you may get a flame three or four feet high which could set fire to a house.  There is a danger with all these heaters and some kind of control is called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the vendors and people who have large stocks of heaters.  They should have some kind of safeguard.  I do not think it should be an offence to sell heaters if they are marked &ldquo;secondhand&rdquo;.  The vendors <Col N="1316" /> have a way out.  They can dump them in the auction rooms and then I assume it would not be an offence because generally everything at an auction is faulty, whether it is an electrical or a gas fitting.  They should have that escape or otherwise a tremendous amount of loss will be incurred.</P>
    <P>I agree that there should be some control.  However, there is another danger which I think is greater than that of oil heaters and that is the electric fire.  Some such fires have proper guards.  Some of them have several wires some distance from the actual bar but others have only a single wire which is not more than a quarter of an inch from the bar.  Such electric heaters cause more fires and tragedies than oil heaters, especially among women who wear long clothes.  This happens particularly to those who wear the new balloon type of dress.  When they move towards the fire, perhaps, to look at themselves in a mirror, the dress goes right in on top of the fire.  That has happened to children and girls who have been burned to death when their long frocks are set aflame.</P>

      <P>On one occasion I saw a woman in a shop and although she was a foot distant from the electric fire, when she bent down to pick up something her long skirt swung into the fire and was set alight.  That happened because there was no protection.  Every electric fire should have a proper guard with a number of wires in front of the bar, not a single wire.  In other words the fire should have a guard which would be such that even if clothing comes in contact with it the clothing will be a sufficient distance from the bar not to catch fire.</P>

      <P>You may not be able to do that because you cannot control what women will buy, but you can control the manufacture of electric fires.  On the subject of hazards, I often intended to raise a question here in regard to the hazards of gas. Tragedies occur week after week <Col N="1317" /> through gas explosions.  Do the gas companies periodically examine these fittings?  They do not, so far as I am aware, and people are carted away regularly as a result of slow poisoning from gas.  The gas companies should be compelled to examine their apparatus because gas is a source of great danger.  In fact, we hear of only occasional accidents involving oil heaters, but we hear of accidents involving gas practically every week of the year. Electric fires are another source of accidents so I ask the Minister when this question of hazards is being considered, to consider also the hazards from gas and electric fires.</P>
      <P>I also ask him to agree that it should be permissible to sell the heaters if they are marked distinctly as being secondhand, because the dealers have to get rid of their stocks some way.  As I have said, if they cannot sell them, they will put them in the auction rooms.  All sorts of things find their way to auction rooms and I have even seen guns there which if found in a person's hand would probably lead to prosecution.  We should at least stipulate that the heaters may be sold if they are marked &ldquo;secondhand&rdquo; or &ldquo;risky&rdquo; or marked in some way.  May I suggest again that when the Minister is considering fire hazards he should consider all the hazards and not just one?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. In my native city, we are on the threshold of the establishment of a major industry for the manufacture of these oil burners and I am sure that industry will be helped to a good start by this Bill.  Naturally, they will comply with the provisions of the Bill and they will be ahead of the other industries across the Channel.  I wish them every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Bill has been accepted in such an objective manner by the House and that the need for this legislation has been seen, as it must have been seen by anyone who took seriously the reports we have received from across the Channel in recent months.  The necessity for the Bill at this very moment, and the reason for its being restricted to oil <Col N="1318" /> burners, arises from the danger of oil burners which do not conform with British standard specifications but which have been manufactured in Britain being put on sale in this country.</P>
      <P>It would perhaps have been possible to deal with this matter in another way, by the imposition of a prohibitive tariff, but on consideration, it was realised that that was not really the function of a tariff.  Therefore, when we learned that certain steps were being taken in the British Parliament to deal with the problem in that country, we felt we could not ignore the possibility of many of these oil heaters, which might now prove to be defective in Britain, finding their way into our market, and it was decided to take action on the lines proposed in this Bill to ensure that adequate notice will be given, first of all, to the trade which might, in the ordinary course of business, think of stocking these oil heaters in preparation for the winter trade and, secondly, to give adequate notice to the public that a certain type of oil heater was unsafe and would be required to conform to certain standards.</P>
      <P>It is the intention to publish immediately to the trade, and in fact to all interests concerned, the standards which will be on the lines of the British standard specifications so that at the earliest moment the trade will know the type of oil heaters and component parts that it will ultimately be illegal for them to sell in their establishments.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Cosgrave, and other Deputies who referred to the subject, that there are hazards in other forms of heaters, be they gas heaters, electric heaters or ordinary open fires, and that the best way to ensure that the hazards will not arise is for the ordinary person to take care, but despite the best conditions, the best will in the world, and the taking of the greatest care, fires will inevitably occur. However, this Bill is limited to dealing with a problem which may become urgent by reason of the action being taken in Britain, and for that reason it is being limited to this particular problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention, and in fact, it is <Col N="1319" /> well known, that a Bill is in course of preparation&mdash;and quite considerable progress has been made&mdash;to amend or replace the Industrial Research and Standards Acts 1946 and 1954.  The Bureau of Research and Standards is being reconstituted.  Further facilities are being provided for research work and work which is preliminary to deciding the standard specifications of certain commodities.  In that Bill, there will be a provision to provide that where the Minister is satisfied it is necessary in the public interest, he may by Order prescribe in relation to a commodity that it shall be an offence to manufacture, assemble, import or sell that commodity unless it complies with the standard specifications set out in the Order.  In a short time, we shall have a means of providing safety standards for further commodities as the need is shown to arise.</P>
    <P>The problem of clothing taking fire was dealt with recently in the report of a committee which was set up in Britain by the President of the Board of Trade on Consumer Protection. The problem of inflammable clothing material was specifically dealt with, and the conclusion reached was that it would not be practical at that stage, at any rate, to prescribe that fabrics should by statute be flame-resistant. It was admitted that the idea had some appeal, but the committee found that by reason of the fact that, on washing, flame-resistant fabrics lose their&mdash;I do not want to be positive on this&mdash;flame-resistant qualities, it would not be of much advantage to prescribe that flame-resistant fabrics should be so described, and that it should be an offence to sell flame-resistant fabrics which were so described because of the possibility of their losing, in a short time, those qualities as of that particular time at any rate.  It was only in April of this year that this report was presented to the President of the Board of Trade.  The committee which examined the problem decided that nothing need necessarily be done at that stage because of the practical difficulties involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is apparently an Act in existence in Britain entitled the Fabrics (Misdescription) Act, 1913.  Regulations have been made in 1959 under that Act, and this report dealt with the Act from the point of view of fabrics being described as flame-resistant which ultimately lose those qualities in ordinary washing.  Therefore, they found there was a certain difficulty in imposing a statutory condition requiring such fabrics to be described as &ldquo;flame-resistant&rdquo; because of the danger of their losing that quality after washing.  I shall refer the Deputy to the Report, dated April, 1960, which should be available to him.</P>
      <P>Another point made by Deputy Dillion referred to the shopkeeper who in the ordinary course of business has certain spare parts and who, perhaps quite unconsciously, might retain those parts in stock, even though they would now come within the ambit of a regulation prohibiting their sale.  Such parts can be exempted under the regulations, and I would refer the Deputy to subsection (5) of Section 3 which authorises the Minister to insert provisions in the regulations &ldquo;as appear to the Minister necessary or expedient for authorising the sale, letting or possession of oil heaters or component parts manufactured before the coming into operation of the regulations...&rdquo;. Therefore, the Deputy will see that there is already provision in the Bill to exempt in the regulations such parts as those to which he has referred.  The other point made by the Deputy in reference to the drafting was quite right, and I can assure him that will be taken care of when the Bill is going through the Committee Stage in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned tractor accidents and suggested that, perhaps, preventive measures might come within the power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am sure the Deputy will have seen that recently a symposium on farm machinery was conducted by the Agricultural Institute.  I, personally, was happy to note that one <Col N="1321" /> of the subjects discussed, and on which I am sure appropriate action will be taken by the proper authorities, was the safety in operation of farm machinery. I feel sure also that they had very close to their minds the number of accidents that have occurred in recent times resulting from the use of tractors on both farms and highways.</P>
    <P>In regard to the points made by Deputy Sherwin, I think they would be covered by what I said in regard to amending legislation to enable the Bureau of Research and Standards to deal with commodities that may be put on sale generally.</P>
    <P>I should like to say in reply to Deputy Coogan that the type of oil burner to be manufactured in Galway will not be the same type as referred to in this Bill.  The oil heaters to be manufactured there will be much larger and to some extent will be like the type used in the central heating of a house.  They will not be the small mobile oil heater envisaged in this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I overlooked one point made by Deputy Dillon in regard to subsection (3) of Section 3, the selling of such oil heaters as a person reasonably believed would not be used in this State.  I should like to put to the Deputy the case of a manufacturer of such a heater in this country who is given an order by somebody in France, say, to manufacture a line of oil heaters which satisfies certain specifications in France but not those in Ireland.  I suggest that in those circumstances it would be proper for that manufacturer or the dealer to fulfil that order so long as the heater complied with French specifications, <Col N="1322" /> and to delete a provision like that might affect, at least to some extent, the export of certain lines of manufacture in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Minister if I may, first, that I have a doubt as to the wisdom of leaving this Bill over until the autumn, because I think it is a standing invitation to anybody with defective oil heaters to sell them to innocent persons.  I do not see how we can stand over that. Secondly, I do not think a young industrial country can afford to manufacture, even at the behest of a foreign purchaser, a dangerously defective apparatus.</P>
      <P>The Minister has as much knowledge as I have of countries like Morocco, Ghana and Libya.  If some unscrupulous person in these sovereign States asks us to produce a dangerous commodity, the resulting injury to Ireland would be very great if that commodity turned up in a foreign country with our trade mark upon it.  I need only remind the Minister of what happened recently in Morocco where the surplus stocks of a Government were disposed of under full warning to the people who got them that they were to be used only for a certain purpose and ended up in the deaths of dozens and dozens of people.  All the bad publicity went back, not to the dealers who improperly sold these surplus stock, but to the Government which, as is known to most people, had made the most stringent reservations about their use.  I do not think it fits our book at all to make provision for the sale of oil burners which, by our own experience, constitute a fire hazard. Even if a foreign purchaser asks us to undertake that, I think we do ourselves a great injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case mentioned by Deputy Coogan, who points out that a large industry is to be established for the manufacture of oil burners of an entirely new design which has been proved in international tests to constitute no hazard at all.  Suppose some gimcrack establishment in some other centre in Ireland proceeds to sell in the foreign market of the Galway factory defective apparatus, I see a situation arising in which oil burners from Ireland <Col N="1323" /> will be regarded as extremely dangerous and people in the foreign market will be warned not to touch them.  I suggest the Minister ought to look at that proviso again.  There seems to be no justification for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister is there not a danger of a clearance sale, that these defective heaters will be put on the market at quarter cost between now and the autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Inevitably there will be a certain amount of stock in the country&mdash;I am certain of that&mdash;and you would have to measure the hazard against the hardship that would be caused to traders who have certain stocks.  As far as the time for the enactment of the Bill is concerned, I have already caused to be issued a public warning as to the danger of certain oil burners and reminding traders, who might have sold them notwithstanding the pending introduction of legislation, of their obligations under the Sale of Goods Act.  The purpose of the legislation is to ensure that any oil burners that might be imported between now and perhaps October&mdash; when the trade in the sale of these goods might be expected to be resumed &mdash;would fulfil the required specifications. Sufficient warning has been given, not only by the statement to which I have referred but by the introduction of this Bill and almost at once there will be circulated to all the interests concerned &mdash; assemblers, traders and others&mdash;a copy of the specification, with which they will be expected to comply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have pointed out there is provision in Section 3 (5) for exceptional regulations to be made in respect of heaters and component parts already in stock, but traders who will, perhaps, feel that they have the opportunity of getting from Britain a cheap range of these heaters will know that these regulations will come into force when the time comes in the ordinary way for these goods to be sold on the market. It will by then, I hope, have become an offence and we shall be in a position&mdash;in the event of their importing between now and then any range of <Col N="1324" /> oil heaters which are now described as defective in Britain&mdash;through examining the invoices to decide exactly when these heaters were imported here.  The traders now know that they will import and sell these goods, when the time for selling them arrives, at their peril.</P>
    <P>I shall look into the point Deputy Dillon has made in regard to paragraph (b) Section 3 (3) to which he objects. He has made a good point but there is perhaps the other view which I have put to him.  However I think it is a point worth further investigation and I promise to have it investigated before the Committee Stage is presented to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is the ninth of its kind <Col N="1325" /> since the transfer of services in 1922. Its purpose is, briefly, to authorise the Minister for Finance to advance further moneys up to a limit of £10 million for continued development of the telephone service.  The money will be borrowed as required over a number of years.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, expenditure on the telephone service falls under two broad heads.  The ordinary running expenses on day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system are met out of moneys voted annually by the Oireachtas under the Post Office Vote.  On the other hand, expenditure on extension and development of the system&mdash;for example, on the erection of new exchanges, the provision of additional trunk lines and the installation of subscribers' telephones&mdash;is met out of funds provided by the Minister for Finance under the Telephone Capital Acts.</P>
    <P>These Acts empower the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund sums not exceeding a stated amount for the development of the telephone service.  The issues are subject to estimates of expenditure being submitted to and approved by the Minister for Finance.  The Acts also authorise the Minister for Finance to borrow in order to meet or repay the issues from the Central Fund and for that purpose to create terminable annuities extending over a period not exceeding 25 years.  The annuities are paid annually in six-monthly instalments out of moneys provided in SubHead M. of the Post Office Vote.</P>
    <P>The total amount authorised to be raised under the previous Irish Telephone Capital Acts to finance works carried out since 1st April, 1922, is £22.75 million, of which £21.93 million approximately had been expended up to March 31st last.  Of the latter amount some £15.9 million still remained to be repaid on that date.</P>
    <P>The last Telephone Capital Act, that of 1956, was for £6 million.  At that time expenditure on national development schemes had to be severely restricted because of shortage of capital. The Post Office, in common with other Departments, had to accept the situation <Col N="1326" /> that it could not obtain all the money required for its purposes including development of the telephone service, and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs explained when presenting the 1956 Bill to the Oireachtas that the capital funds available would not be sufficient to meet all anticipated demands of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that it would not therefore be possible to install all the subscribers' lines that could otherwise be provided, to undertake all the underground development schemes needed to meet and to anticipate demands for telephones in built up areas, or to do all the various other works such as new automatic exchange schemes and major trunk works that the Department would otherwise endeavour to undertake if there were no capital shortage; further, that new schemes involving substantial expenditure which could be postponed without materially affecting the standard of service to subscribers would be deferred.  Notwithstanding that development on this restricted basis had to be continued over the greater part of the last 4 years, it has been possible to meet in very large part the steadily increasing demands for new telephones and to maintain a good standard of service for subscribers generally.  In short, it can be fairly claimed that the moneys made available by the Oireachtas for telephone capital purposes have been used to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>Of the funds previously authorised £0.42 million remained on 31st March, 1956, making a total of £6.42 million. Over the 4 years to 31st March, 1960, the money was spent under broad headings approximately as follows:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> The total expenditure on development works, including the value of stores used which were already in stock, was £6.7 million approximately.</P>
    <P>Since 1st January, 1956, over 47,700 exchange lines and some 60,000 telephones have been provided and the number of telephones is now over 150,000; 46 new automatic exchanges have been provided including those at Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Mullingar and Naas; 582 exchanges have been extended; 261 telephone kiosks have been erected; and the trunk network has been increased by over 37,000 circuit miles.  The total number of telephone calls handled increased from 105.7 million in 1956 to 132 million last year. Continuous service has been introduced at 101 exchanges where the service was formerly restricted and the hours of service at 151 other small exchanges have been extended.</P>
    <P>Apart from the provision of new automatic exchanges at various centres, significant advances have been made in the field of automatic working of telephone calls.  Direct dialling was formerly limited to local calls but the facility has been extended far beyond the local range.  Dublin subscribers can now dial directly to all automatic exchanges within a radius of 20 miles and similar facilities exist in the reverse direction.  Subscribers at Cork and Athlone can dial directly to Dublin and to other larger automatic exchanges.  These are really pilot schemes which have worked very satisfactorily and they have encouraged us to go ahead with extension of trunk dialling by subscribers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>During the past four years, the great bulk of trunk calls have been connected with little or no delay.  On many routes it was found possible to defer very heavy expenditure on permanent schemes by less expensive short term solutions but we have now reached the stage where heavy expenditure to meet both immediate and long term needs must be incurred.  The need to increase the capacity of the trunk system generally was shown by the difficulty in handling the sharp rise in traffic at <Col N="1328" /> certain peak periods recently.  Actually certain relief measures were already in hand and more are proposed but the capacity of the trunk system will need to be expanded very greatly within the next few years.  Particular attention will be given to improvement on the shorter distance routes.</P>
    <P>Last year the basis of charging for trunk calls was radically altered.  Under the new system exchanges are arranged in groups for charging purposes and a simplified scale of charges is now in operation.  Local call areas have been considerably extended and subscribers have the benefit of local charges for calls to all exchanges within their own groups.  Simultaneously with the introduction of group-charging, the radius within which standard rentals apply was increased from two to three miles and the provision of telephones at residence rental rate was conceded to certain farmers.</P>
    <P>The introduction of group charging, the primary object of which was to prepare the way for the extension of subscriber dialling of trunk calls, and the other concessions have resulted in a marked increase in the demand for telephones.  Applications received in the 12 months ended 30th June last exceeded the average for the preceding three years by 57 per cent.  The increase in demand outside Dublin has been particularly high; it exceeded the average for the previous three years by 83 per cent.  Although the rate of installation of telephones is now higher than ever, there is still a waiting list of about 4,570 applications but more than half of these are with the engineers for early attention.</P>
    <P>Financially, the telephone service is in a healthy condition.  The charges are reasonable by comparison with those of other services or on any other standard and the service has been operated at a profit after providing for interest charges, depreciation and superannuation.  In 1958/59 the surplus was £413,000 and for 1959/60 it is expected to be of the order of £350,000, notwithstanding the concessions in rentals and call charges a year ago. While these profits may appear to be large, they are modest in relation to the capital employed.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is intended to provide <Col N="1329" /> for the needs of the next 5 years approximately.  The amount for which authority is sought is £10 million which will allow of an average yearly expenditure of about £2 million.  The programme proposed provides for the installation of 65,000 additional subscribers' lines and 80,000 extra telephones the net effect of which will be to increase the number of existing telephones by about one-third.  It also provides for a considerable improvement in the trunk network including the permanent circuiting by means of cable and radio links of numerous main and intermediate distance routes as well as an extensive scheme of improvements on shorter routes.  The maximum progress achievable will be made in the conversion of exchanges to automatic working and the subscriber trunk dialling will be extended on a wide scale.  Contracts have already been placed for equipment to provide trunk dialling facilities for subscribers at Dublin and the principal provincial automatic exchanges and for the conversion of some 50 exchanges to automatic working.</P>
    <P>The estimated break up of the proposed expenditure is: Subscribers installations and local underground schemes, £6.42 million; Exchanges&mdash; new and extended, £2.24 million; Trunk and junction circuits, £2.13 million; Buildings, £0.53 million, making a total of £11.32 million.  Allowing for a carry over of a balance of approximately £0.82 million on hand on 31st March last, and some possible overestimation, the sum required is, in round figures, £10 million.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to expand upon the value of the telephone system in the commercial and social life of the country.  It is, I think, generally agreed that apart from telephone capital expenditure being self-liquidating, extension and improvement of the service contributes to greater efficiency in production and distribution. The service also provides a very desirable social amenity.  In addition, it gives worthwhile employment to thousands of our people.  We have still considerable arrears of development work to make up and we must be prepared to cater for continued and <Col N="1330" /> steady demand for telephones.  It is for these purposes that the grant of the extra funds is proposed under this Bill which I confidently recommend to the House for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to some extent true that, as the Minister said, there has developed in recent years more and more of what one might call telephone awareness.  Considerably more business is being done by telephone than used to be the case and, inevitably, when there is more business done in that way, considerable pressure is brought on the existing system.  All of us have met from time to time in relation to the use of the telephone periods when its delays and non-functioning are infuriating.  They are not, we hope, of too frequent occurrence.</P>
      <P>I have often felt myself in some doubt, when something has gone wrong with the dialling system, whether it is better to have the impersonal system or the personal system going wrong.  It is a matter of considerable doubt as to which is the more aggravating.  I am bound to say, however, that the installation of the dialling system from Naas has brought very considerable advantages and has certainly convinced me of the necessity for coming on to a general dialling system all around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was at one time a view that it would be better to have a series of semi-automatic small exchanges around the country.  I hope that view has now been abandoned.  It seems to me that the essential thing about a telephone is to have a continuous all round the clock service and such a service can be provided in any satisfactory way only by connecting the outlying telephones to the main centre. It is a mistake, therefore, that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs seem occasionally to prefer to connect a telephone to a small exchange rather than to an exchange with automatic and continuous service at a slightly greater distance.  As a short-term policy, it is a cheaper one but it is bad and shortsighted as well as being a short-term policy.  The one thing that will really popularise the use of the telephone <Col N="1331" /> in rural Ireland is an all-round-the-clock service.  Until such time as it is an all-round-the-clock service throughout Ireland, it will not be so popular and not so much use will be made of it.  It should therefore be one of the prime objects of the Minister to ensure that nothing is done, even as a short-term policy, that prevents that long-term operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister did give us some indication on his Estimate as to what he proposed during the coming year.  I did not press him then for more details because I knew this Bill was coming up the hill and I thought we would have got more information on it.  We should like to know from the Minister in greater detail what is the likelihood of ensuring that in some places one can get a no-delay trunk service. In certain places, one can get an excellent no-delay service; in others, it is far from being so good.</P>
    <P>In relation to the manual operation of the trunk service, there is one thing I have never been able to understand. If you ring Cork and it happens that the circuits are engaged at the time or that the number is engaged, and you ask that the call be put through again as soon as possible, it never seems to be put through without an inordinate delay.  I have on frequent occasions booked a call down the country and been told, which is understandable, that the circuits were engaged and that I would be called back.  I have not once, but on many occasions, put the call through again on another line and got it straight away before I had been rung back.  I understand there is some rule in the operation of the telephone exchange that in certain circumstances a call may not be tried again for a period of fifteen minutes.  I do not quite understand how that can operate. Apparently when you book a call through, there is some kind of queuing system operated in the exchange.  That should be done away with and I should like the Minister to give us some indication that the new machinery to be purchased will take care of that.</P>
    <P>I hope also that part of this money will be spent on installing additional switchboard facilities in this House. <Col N="1332" /> We are lucky in having a most obliging staff but at peak periods they just cannot cope and the result is that one has to wait an inordinate length of time for calls.  The delay is entirely due to lack of switchboard facilities because of which more staff cannot be put in for peak periods.  If it were not for the fact that the staff have been here for a long time and are exceptionally good, the situation would be chaotic.  The Minister is, I am sure, as aware as I am that there are periods when Deputies of all Parties must get calls through in a great hurry but the strain on the switchboard is such that it is impossible to do so.  I hope, therefore, that new switchboard facilities for the House will be considered when this capital is being expended.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable difficulty and delay in my constituency in relation to trunk dialling from north county Kildare.  It has been most unsatisfactory from Maynooth and from Celbridge in particular.  I can assure the Minister that it is not a question of reports being given to me; I have experienced it myself.  I do not know whether Deputy Dooley came up as far as that or not, but when one was moving around in the last month trying to get a trunk call through from north Kildare, which means one has to dial Dublin before it is put through, it was a matter not of a minute or two but a quarter of an hour.  On one occasion I tried to get a call through the exchange at Celbridge, dialling into Dublin from the exchange.  I was 22 minutes in the box before I could get an answer from the exchange.  I want to be quite fair: I was not the whole 22 minutes hanging on waiting on the same buzz; I became infuriated three or four times, cut it off and tried again.  I was told in Celbridge by a friend of mine that that was quite a common occurrence there.  It is a matter that requires reorientation of the equipment for receiving trunk dialled calls from the smaller places in which one is able to dial direct.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the financial cost of telephones was very reasonable in relation to other services.  If he means in relation to the telegram service, that is nothing to boast about. The cost of telegrams is appalling.  I <Col N="1333" /> should like the Minister to tell us, as we are on this subject, whether there is any method by which, if necessary, on payment of an additional fee, one can get a return more often than three months of local calls and trunk calls. By paying an additional amount, I understand one can at present get the numbers to which the trunk calls are made but sometimes we get a bill at the end of a quarter that seems outrageous and creates the suspicion at the back of our minds that there is something wrong with the automatic recording apparatus.</P>
    <P>I am bound to admit that when it happened to me on one occasion I made a check and found that the recording apparatus was correct, that it was at the sending end in my own house that the breakdown, shall I describe it, occurred.  However, I think people would prefer a more frequent system of payment, if it were available, to waiting for three months.  While, on the one hand, it may cause some additional administrative cost, on the other, the money flowing into the Exchequer more promptly and more quickly should offset any such cost to a large degree.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more annoying than to get an appalling bill at the end of three months and discover that it has arisen through some cause that could have been discovered&mdash;through some unauthorised use that nobody can guard against since it is impossible to keep the telephone under lock and key&mdash;and steps taken to remedy the position, had the bill arrived earlier.  I have heard that complaint not merely in relation to private telephones but also in relation to telephones in guest houses when the guests do not want to go through the coin box method of phoning.  If my suggestion were accepted, one would at least get earlier notice of the trend.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister state when he hopes telephone density here will approximate to that across the water? How many years is it likely to be before we catch up with their toll and direct trunk dialling system?  Can he tell us the places where it is likely an automatic service will be in operation <Col N="1334" /> in the country within the next two or three years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents a good and sound investment.  The Minister is certainly taking the right step.  I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the engineering staff on the wonderful work they have done and are doing throughout the country.  One can feel proud of our technicians.  They are as good as and possibly better than their opposite numbers elsewhere.  That is high commendation.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the need for giving priority in relation to the installation of phones in tourist areas.  Tourism plays a very important part in our economy and tourist areas should, therefore, get priority.  I appeal to the Minister also to give early attention to applicants who are still waiting for phones in Galway.  We were told some time ago that the delay was due to the fact that new cables had to be laid.  The new cables have been laid and I see no reason why the telephones should not be installed promptly.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the courtesy of the staff in Galway.  In my opinion, they are doing excellent work, at a disadvantage.  Steps should be taken to remedy these disadvantages. Again, I appeal to the Minister to erect telephone kiosks on every new housing estate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, first of all, to reiterate what Deputy Sweetman has said: it would be impossible to praise too highly the staff who operate the telephones in Leinster House.  It is, I think, true to say that the exchange accommodation is so restricted it is not possible to provide the staff with adequate apparatus to deal with peak loads here.  If, and when, it is possible to do that, I trust the Minister will be free to attend to it.  Mark you, it would be quite wrong to exaggerate the problem.  The service in Leinster House is, as a rule, quite adequate, but at certain peak periods, the equipment does not seem to be equal to the demands made upon it, with consequent delays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to renew now a proposal which I submitted to the Minister before, and which would operate to lighten the burden of capital expenditure.  I believe you could improve the weight of the demand on trunk services if, instead of having two periods, a day-time break for trunk services and a night time break for trunk services, you had an intermediate break from, say, six to nine in the evening, followed by a very cheap rate from nine at night until nine in the morning.  I believe that would operate to postpone until after 9 o'clock a lot of jovial conversation on the telephone, which is an admirable thing in itself, but which may operate to overload trunk lines when more urgent business awaits transaction.</P>
      <P>Now that we have passed out of the period of world scarcity, we ought, I think, disembarrass our minds of some of the puritanical reactions that develop in time of scarcity.  There was abroad at one time a general feeling that one should not delay on the telephone.  Now I was conversing cheerfully recently at about 10 o'clock at night with a friend in a neighbouring town when a voice intervened and said: &ldquo;Yes will have to stop.&rdquo;  Why we should have to stop I could not make out and, indeed, the intervener, on being closely questioned, could assign no reason either, except possibly that he felt generally it was improvident to be clattering away on a trunk line in that fashion at night.  I, on the contrary, believe it would be a very good thing to permit that type of personal communication, particularly when the trunk lines are there with nothing to do.  I suggest to the Minister that he should induce people to use the telephone for social conversation by offering a peculiarly attractive rate after 9 p.m.  That is the first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> The second point is that in other countries, notably in Great Britain and the United States of America, it has been found that a service providing information is widely availed of and is regarded as a considerable convenience, to say nothing of bringing a good deal of business to the telephone system.  If you dial TIM on the telephone in London you get the correct time, and I know that in America if you ring up a certain four figures you can get the current weather report. There is a lot of other miscellaneous information of that kind that can be provided by recorded information and made available for the expense of a local call, and I think an extension of that type of service is worth consideration by those in charge of our telephone system, but I should like to give one note of warning to the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are already certain types of information available by recorded messages.  For instance, if you ring a number that is gone out of use and for which another number has been substituted, a lady's voice of a rather frigid character says: &ldquo;This number has been changed; please ring Information.&rdquo;  I have known respectable old ladies almost to get a stroke because they addressed a cogent supplementary question only to have the lady's voice repeat: &ldquo;This number has been changed; please ring Information.&rdquo; They have been enraged because of this repetition in reply to their supplementary questions, and that difficulty could be overcome if there could be incorporated in the recorded message a statement saying: &ldquo;This is a recorded message.&rdquo;  That is a trifle but good service is designed to cater for the simple and the easily scandalised, and the more courtesy we can display the better it will be.  I am bound to say, as I said on previous occasions, that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs set an example in that matter for all other Government Departments and, as a result of the skill with which they maintain their public relations, I think they manage to get a far greater volume of appreciative co-operation from the public than many other State or semi-State institutions succeed in getting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> If I may for a moment refer to the parish pump, could we have a direct line between Dundalk and the five principal towns in County Monaghan? We have it already in respect of Carrickmacross and I think we have it in respect of Castleblayney, but we have not got it in respect of Ballybay and I doubt if we have it in respect of Clones. I think we have it in respect of Monaghan but I can assure the Minister that there is nothing more exasperating than having to go through a number of country exchanges, passing along a series of ladies in charge of them, who could pull out the plug at a psychological moment and cut off the call you are making.  If you could direct calls from a central point like Dundalk, the intervention of that catastrophe would be much more infrequent.  If you have called a man from a considerable distance and he says &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and you identify yourself, and the lady pulls out the plug, considerable misunderstanding could result to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>It is right that we should hand out bouquets when bouquets are in order but it would be wrong not to make complaints where they are in order too.  Has the Minister heard any complaints about the occasional delay in answering when you dial &ldquo;O&rdquo;?  If there is anything more enraging than dial &ldquo;O&rdquo; and listen to the blooming bell buzz and nothing else happens, I would be glad to be told of it.  There is only one thing more outrageous and that is when you ring up the supervisor and say: &ldquo;The bell has now rung 22 times,&rdquo; and she says: &ldquo;The staff are very busy tonight.&rdquo;  The presumption is that they are busy but the answer is that it is supposed to be somebody's job to provide more staff if they are.  I would suggest to the Minister that the most stringent instructions should be given to supervisory staff in large exchanges that if there is a pressure which the staff is finding hard to cope with, then the supervisory staff have a duty to call in extra staff at whatever expense is involved in order to avoid that maddening delay.  I do not want to elaborate on that because it is not a very common complaint, but it does exist and if on inquiry the supervisor says: <Col N="1338" />&ldquo;The staff is very busy tonight,&rdquo; she would be much better employed calling in relief staff than giving that information.</P>
    <P>The last matter I wish to mention was raised recently in a Parliamentary Question.  I do not know if the capital provision we are now making includes the publication of the telephone directory. I know the Minister is looking into the question of the binding of the directory but the information, he had when he answered the Question was that the binding was not proving unsatisfactory generally.  That is fantastic. Since he made me that answer, because I apprehended that perhaps my personal experience had been peculiar, I have been noticing the condition of directories in various houses and establishments where I have had business to transact, and I am sure that 25 per cent. of the directories in Dublin are in flitters.  The backs are broken and the directories themselves are now in two or three bits.</P>
    <P>Clearly there has been some failure correctly to estimate the quality of binding which is requisite to secure adequate survival for a telephone directory.  It is a mistake into which, I suppose, anybody could fall in one year, but it is wrong simply to assume that it has not happened because, if you do, then it will happen again.  I can assure the Minister that in addition to the ink and print employed it would be necessary to call for a review of the durability of the binding employed, not with reference to the two covers primarily, but with reference to the spine of the directory which is quite unsatisfactory as at present provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an encouragement to find the Opposition, through Deputy Sweetman, pressing on me to proceed as quickly as possible with the change-over to automatic dialling all over the country.  That has been the policy of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for quite some time now and they have already completed the changes in a number of exchanges. Deputy Sweetman wished me to inform him what was the programme for this year.  The programme for the current year includes the extension of <Col N="1339" /> a number of automatic exchanges&mdash; two new automatic changes in Cork City, and the conversion, of the following exchanges to automatic working: Aughnacliffe, Ballisodare, Ballymahon, Clonsilla, Finea, Granard, Leabeg, Loch Gowna, Rochfortbridge, Skerries&mdash;which has been opened already&mdash;and Tyrrellspass.</P>
      <P>A contract has been placed for the conversion to automatic working, with subscriber trunk dialling facilities, of 50 manual exchanges, but delivery of the equipment by the contractors will not be effected until 1961. These include exchanges in the Tuam, Midleton, Roscommon, Curragh Camp, Kildare, New Ross, Balbriggan, Kinsale and Bundoran groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an exchange itself.  The intention is that all exchanges, large and small, will be automatic with, of course, a 24 hour service. Deputy Sweetman mentioned delays in North Kildare in short trunk calls and in calls to Dublin.  The same state of affairs applies in many other exchange areas, when traffic increases at busy hours, and the extension of the local call area has contributed to this increase in traffic.  The delays occur only during the busy periods.  The question of finding additional circuits will have attention as soon as possible. The matter is being considered by the officials of the Department but the question will have to be approached on a planned basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conjunction with the work that is planned in connection with the change-over to automatic working of a number of exchanges I have mentioned, this other work of providing extra circuits in areas that are not due for immediate treatment in the change&mdash;over to automatic working will be considered.  The areas in which the delays are greater will as far as possible get priority treatment.  The Department have the matter very much in mind and are giving it constant attention.  When the Bill has been passed, every effort will <Col N="1340" /> be made by the Department to catch up with arrears of work in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman raised the question of the three-monthly account. There is provision for monthly trunk accounts but not for monthly local call accounts.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon suggested the introduction of the automatic time service.  This has been considered from time to time but it would require a considerable amount of <Col N="1341" /> planning and has had to be deferred in favour of more urgent essential works. The same applies to the desirable but not essential information service mentioned by Deputy Dillon.  Instead of the charges that are made at present, he wants an intermediate rate for telephone calls in the evening and a very cheap rate later at night.  That question has been examined by the Department.  While there is merit in the suggestion, we find it would not be in the interests of the telephone service to adopt it now.  If we gave serious consideration to such a suggestion, with a view to having it implemented, as matters stand, it would mean we would have a very substantial increase in the late evening or night traffic.  That would involve extra late attendances by the operating staff.  In short, it would be a doubtful financial proposition, involving staffing difficulties for the Department.  Its consideration will be left over until we have the automatic working, so that it is a question that can be considered then.  What decision will be arrived at at that time, I shall not be able to say.  I do not believe I shall have anything to do with the decision at that time.</P>

      <P>The binding of the telephone directory has created a problem for many years past.  There were a number of complaints regarding the unsuitability of the binding, prior to the decision last year to make the book smaller.  The number of names appearing in the directory was increasing at such a rate that it was found that in order to keep the book in a single volume, it was not possible to have it bound by the printers here.  The decision then had to be taken whether to have two books or one book.  The Stationery Office and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs decided that with the introduction of the new Bell Gothic type, the size of the book could be reduced considerably and that it could be a single volume.  The decision was taken and the book was bound as we see it now.</P>
      <P>I do not know if there is any way in which we can improve the binding of the directory.  I think it is not possible to have the book bound in a more lasting or more efficient way.  There are technical difficulties facing the contractors.</P>

      <P>We have not received the complaints the Deputy appears to have in relation to the deterioration of the directory over the years.  We had <Col N="1343" /> somewhat more complaints in relation to the binding of the previous directories.  To try to meet the complaints made in connection with the previous volumes, the decision was taken to have the smaller volume so that it would be more manageable, more useful and more permanent.  That is the idea behind the decision taken in that regard.</P>

      <P>In connection with the telephone directory, a decision was also taken during the year to try to improve it by a change in the type used.  That in itself will cause some delay in the issue of the directory this year.  This delay cannot be avoided. I hope the directory will meet my wishes and the wishes of subscribers generally in the country and that they will regard it as an improvement on the directory issued last year but we have to wait, I think, about two months longer for the issue of the directory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>The most disturbing feature of this Estimate is the magnitude of the increase which we have to face every year.  The increase is now very high.  The provision for the coming year is £17,800,000.  It is all the more significant and all the more surprising when we realise that we are a very small community of some 2,850,000 people, and that only a small percentage of our people benefit from the health services.  Perhaps, the Minster in his reply will give us the exact figures.  From a reply to a question here during the year, I think the figure is 28,000 in the lower income group.  I must say that I am ignorant of these facts and I should like to have them from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the Minister I sympathise in his expressed desire for economies in health administration.  I fail to see where they are to come from because health administration, from its very pattern, will inevitably be costly.  If we could segregate the figures for administration <Col N="1345" /> from the figures actually paid out in benefits, we would be in a better position to understand where economies could be effected.</P>
    <P>We have to realise that health legislation is operated through a whole system of officials down the country. Every county council has its health authority and in that health authority there are officials who have to make records, inquiries, investigations.  They have interviews of various kinds so that it is a long and involved process. It is very tedious and complex for the officials who have to face up to these responsibilities.  We have a health authority in Cork and what is amazing about the officials in that health authority is the complete intimacy with which they handle the various problems and the extraordinary objectivity and impartiality they show.  They are also efficient and competent.  It is a tribute to the officials both in the health authority and the sanatoria. The sanatoria section have been amalgamated since the 1st July.  I cannot see, therefore, where we are to secure economies in view of that pattern in the service.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a booklet which he intends to provide.  I am sure he is aware that some local authorities have already provided a very simple little booklet giving in their respective local areas the names of the hospitals and the types of service available.  I humbly suggest that if the Minister is going to issue a booklet now, the cost will run into thousands of pounds.  He says he will see that there is one in every home.  I can assure him that 70 per cent. of these will not be read.  Many of them will not be understood by the people who claim benefits. Eventually, the people looking for information about the health services will have to go to the officials concerned or to the public representatives for the area.  Therefore, I think it is a waste of time and money.</P>
    <P>I should say that if such a booklet were issued by the respective local authorities, it would have a local appeal.  It would be local in its character, containing the names of the hospitals and so on and the location <Col N="1346" /> of the services would all be set out in that booklet.  For that reason, it would have a far greater attraction than the booklet which the Minister contemplates issuing in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the idea behind the issue of the booklet is the very best.  The Minister wants to be helpful and to give the information to the people seeking it.  I do not think they will look for it in a text book of any kind.  No matter how simple the book is, it is for those people an abstract text book and they will not be inclined to follow it.  We ourselves get reams of reading matter connected with the various Departments.  Personally, I do not read a fraction of them.  I have not got the time.  Many of the people will be preoccupied with business. Their wives will be preoccupied with domestic matters.  They will simply not have the time.  With the radio, the advent of television and all the reading material, such as magazines, available, they are not going to fall back on such a heavy subject as health legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave encouraging figures about the incidence of tuberculosis. We are all very glad that the measures taken in recent years obviated the danger of a scourge from that disease again.  The figures given in regard to heart disease and cancer are rather disquieting and offset to a considerable degree the very encouraging position in relation to tuberculosis in this country today.  Of course we shall have to wait for greater research to get the real line on those, but I hope eventually, like tuberculosis, the scourges may be conquerable, to a certain degree at all events.</P>
    <P>The Minister dwelt at length on his hospital building programme and his policy is to be cautious and to build up a certain reserve fund, except for expenditure for essential needs.  I agree with the Minister on that.  I think his policy is sound and correct.  We do not want to see hospitals dotted all over the country.  We have redundant sanatoria now and they will be gradually converted to uses for people suffering from other diseases.  In the course of time many of those may become redundant with the advances of medical science and with the advanced <Col N="1347" /> treatment we now have in regard to various diseases.  It is true that there is overcrowding at the moment in some hospitals but doctors have told me, in Cork at any rate, that if only they could get rid of the chronic patients there would be no overcrowding problem.  Some of those patients remain on for months and even for years.  Some of them have no homes to go back to or, if they have homes, there is nobody there competent to take care of them, or the people in the home do not want to have them back.</P>
    <P>That is a problem that focuses attention on the necessity for finding homes for aged persons.  I am glad that the Minister has that in mind.  It is one way of relieving pressure in the hospitals and providing some comfort for these people in their old age, away from the hospital atmosphere.  These homes could be run by a community or by committees and they would be places in which these people would be very happy.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to mental hospitals.  There is urgent need for extensions to some of these hospitals. He also mentioned the voluntary hospitals.  Considering that the voluntary hospitals have given such valued service to the people for centuries they should be an important consideration with the Minister and his Department. I know that some voluntary hospitals have plans for contemplated extensions and are awaiting grants or sanction to go ahead with these extensions. Would it not be more sensible, and a better method of meeting their demands, to get them to reassess their plans so that they could be carried out over a period of years and would not impact too heavily on the Hospital Trust Funds.  These demands could be implemented gradually over a period of years, and, at the same time, save the reserve which the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>I was rather disappointed that the Minister did not put greater emphasis on the voluntary health insurance scheme.  I know many people in the middle income group who are participants in the voluntary health insurance scheme <Col N="1348" /> and they believe that the independence and the security it gives them for the future is an attraction.  They are quite happy and content to remain on in the scheme even though they may be eligible for benefits under health schemes for the middle income category. It was a pity that this scheme did not take precedence over the Health Act.  We would be in a much happier position to-day if that had been done.  However, I suppose we learn by degrees.</P>
    <P>In the Civil Service they had a health service of their own.  They made a contribution to the health services and it was a magnificent one but unfortunately it had been known for years that the health services were to be made available and those who wanted dentures or medical treatment waited until this scheme was in operation and, I have been informed, the demands impacted so heavily on the fund that chaos resulted.  The teachers' organisation have a magnificent health scheme and, for a very paltry sum, the benefits are most generous.  I think the only way we can economise in health legislation is to encourage those groups and organisations to look to the individual, independent insurance scheme of their own.  In that way, they will be making provision for themselves and they will be helping to restore that independence and dignity of the human person which these health regulations have tended to destroy so much over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been helpful in some respects.  Before I deal with some of the heavier matters touched upon by some Deputies, I should like to dispose of some of the less complex questions which have been raised.  Before doing so I should like to say how much I appreciate and welcome some of the contributions.  Nothing can be more helpful to a Minister who is faced, as I am, with the difficult problem of making a system work, which very many of those who have to work it dislike heartily, than healthy and constructive criticism.  Even if the critics merely spotlight weaknesses in the system and administration of which I, myself, am <Col N="1349" /> keenly aware, it is no waste of effort on their part to point them out again to me.  At least they afford me the opportunity of explaining the position, as I see it, in regard to the particular matters they raise.  The special approach of their several minds to difficult issues scarcely ever fails to bear fruit and in this context and from this context I do not exclude the sounder portions of the speeches made by my predecessor and even those made by the Leader of the Opposition. The friends of Deputy O'Higgins had to be gratified by a flagellation act and as for the Leader of the Opposition, he has still to establish himself as an effective leader and hence the display of stage thunder to which an empty House echoed almost a fortnight ago.</P>
      <P>In my opening remarks on the Estimate, I pointed out that diseases of the heart and various conditions of malignancy had created very serious problems for our health services. Speaking on that matter, Deputy Esmonde, with the support of Deputy Booth, argued that as freedom from worry was of great therapeutic value in the treatment of heart conditions, those afflicted with coronary and cancer conditions should receive monetary help as they would if they were suffering from an infectious disease. What the Deputies lost sight of in this connection was the simple fact that the community was prepared to tax itself heavily in order to encourage tubercular individuals to undergo isolation and treatment, and that the public at large had a very substantial interest in the success of any scheme to eradicate tuberculosis for the reason that it lessened the risk to everyone of becoming infected.  I venture to say that the public in general would not be moved in the same way and certainly not to the same degree in regard to cancer or heart diseases. A member of a household in which there is a case of heart disease runs no risk of being infected himself, and through himself infecting others.  Quite the contrary is the case with tuberculosis and everyone now knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present cost of the infectious diseases maintenance allowance <Col N="1350" /> scheme is £327,000, and to expand it to cover heart and cancer cases would probably cost another £1,000,000 or more.  If I had a further £1,000,000 at this moment to expend on health services, I should in conscience spend it in a way which would confer the most widespread and general benefits.  I would be bound to spend it, say, on the improvement of our dental services, and particularly our school dental services, or on some other similar service where the benefits accruing would be very widespread.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it has to be remembered that a number of cancer and heart cases benefit under existing social welfare schemes.  Insured workers can draw disability benefits which under the new Social Welfare Bill will be payable at the following rates: a single person will receive £1 12. 6. per week; a man with an adult dependant £2 12. 6.; a man with an adult dependant and two children, £3 12. 6.; and a man with an adult dependant and five children, £4 12. 6.  For those reasons and others which I need not detail, it would, in existing conditions, be impractical and unjustifiable to single out sufferers from heart and cancer conditions for exceptional treatment as compared with persons suffering from other types of illness.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth was also anxious to get some information on the implications of the European Agreement for the Exchange of Therapeutic Substances of Human Origin which was signed by Ireland in September, 1958. The purpose of that Agreement is to provide an international blood bank which can be drawn upon to meet urgent needs.  The parties to the agreement undertake to make the therapeutic substances in question available to each other on the express condition that no profit is derived from them, and that they are used solely for medical purposes.  To facilitate this arrangement, the Agreement provides for the rationalisation of different methods of preparing, preserving, packing and dispatching blood and its derivatives.  So far, no request for assistance in accordance with the Agreement has been made to this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde said that he was <Col N="1351" /> not very clear as to the position in regard to emergency maternity services. The position is that for years past the three voluntary hospitals in Dublin, Erinville in Cork, Airmount in Waterford, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, and Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe have all provided on behalf of the health authority convenient to them, obstetrical emergency services.  As well, similar arrangements existed, though I think on a less formal basis, in almost all the remaining areas in the country.</P>
    <P>However, in order to ensure that the best possible emergency services will be available everywhere, the local authorities have been asked to give particulars of their existing arrangements. The information sought includes precise details of the scope and personnel of the services and the hospitals on which they are based, the nature of the resuscitation services available, the extent to which additional medical assistance could be provided in a patient's home and the facilities for conveying mothers and infants to hospital, when necessary.  Almost all the authorities have furnished the required data and it is now being closely studied.</P>
    <P>I come now to one of the less agreeable contributions to the debate.  From Deputy Crotty's appearance, one might take him to be an intelligent well-informed man.  What is one to think about him when one reads what he said on 30th June regarding the regional orthopaedic hospital in Kilkenny. I quote now from column 765, volume 138, of the Official Report where he alleged:</P>
    <P>...we have a regional orthopaedic hospital with no orthopaedic surgeon resident.  The surgeon lives in Waterford and if somebody breaks an ankle or a leg in Kilkenny, we have a regional hospital with every appliance, operating theatre and everything, but nobody to operate.</P>
    <P>That would be a woeful state of affairs truly, if it were true, but it simply is not true&mdash;not a single word.  I do not think Deputy Crotty has been away from Ireland for the first half of this year so his ignorance of the position in <Col N="1352" /> Kilkenny Hospital is not due to his prolonged absence abroad.  I do not think, either, that in Kilkenny he leads the life of a recluse.  How then are we to explain the ignorance which he displayed here of the fact that a highly qualified orthopaedic surgeon has been attached to the hospital since December last and is actually living in the hospital residence?  How has it happened that Deputy Crotty is unaware of the fact that the former resident registrar of the hospital is still serving as an extern registrar and resides in Kilkenny town, about three-quarters of a mile from the hospital?  If Deputy Crotty suffers from blind spots in his knowledge, he ought to take stock of what is going on around him, particularly when he labours under a schizoid condition and tells us of a magnificent orthopaedic hospital which he said is fitted with every appliance, but which, 30 odd words later, he describes as &ldquo;merely an auxiliary hospital and is not even fit for that although it was built as a regional hospital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whatever the explanation for these curious misstatements, I shall readily forgive Deputy Crotty if he adduces one little fact.  Will he give the name of any single person requiring the services of an orthopaedic surgeon since January 1st of this year who had to be transferred from Kilkenny town to Waterford city because of the fact that the services of a fully qualified experienced orthopaedic surgeon were not available in Kilkenny?  If there is any foundation at all for the strictures which he passed upon me, he ought to be able to furnish that information without delay.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy also criticised the county manager in Kilkenny because a review of the medical register had taken place within the past few months.  He was particularly anxious to know where the manager got his inspiration.  He got it, I can assure the House in the most prosaic way possible.  He read an Act of this Oireachtas&mdash;the Health Act of 1953, which provides by way of regulations made under it that the medical register has to be renewed annually.  Therefore, there was no question of the county manager receiving any inspiration <Col N="1353" /> from the Minister for Health.  He was merely discharging the duty which this House has imposed upon him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Healy's speech demonstrated how closely he has studied the Health Act, and I would advise Deputies like Deputy Crotty to read it. Many, I think, would learn from it that the medical card system is much more elastic than is commonly believed. As the Deputy pointed out, where the circumstances justify it, the person may obtain, in a specific instance for a specific purpose, all the benefits to which the possession of a medical card would entitle him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Healy also made a particular plea for an arthritic who was incapable of working.  The position is that under the Health Act the maximum amount that may be granted by way of disability allowance is 20/- per week.  The sum may appear rather modest, but these allowances in the aggregate are costing the taxpayer over £700,000 a year.  There is, however, nothing to prevent the Cork public assistance authority from granting the sufferer to whom Deputy Healy referred home assistance to any extent it wishes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Healy also stressed the need to provide a residential clinic in Cork for sufferers from cerebral palsy.  I accept the fact that the need exists. Unfortunately, it is but one of our needs.  Though money is not available for a new building, the needs of sufferers from this condition are constantly in my mind whenever I am considering the use to which a building which has become redundant can be put.  Deputy Healy also reminded me of the fact that additional accommodation is required for the Cork dental school.  Whenever the opportunity offers, I shall give sympathetic consideration to the admitted needs of that institution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley asked how many are covered by the health services.  The Deputy must have heard me incorrectly when I made reference to this or else he has got his figures wrong. The Deputy said that 28,000 people in the lower income group were covered&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Col N="1354" />
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-eight per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was a slip of the tongue on the Deputy's part. Therefore, he is aware of the fact that 28 per cent. of the population is so covered.  The total proportion of the population covered by Section 15 for hospital and specialist services is estimated at about 85 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy took exception to my intention to issue a booklet on the scope of the health services.  He says the county councils have issued comprehensive leaflets.  That is quite true, but the leaflets covered only the hospital and specialist services and the maternity and child health services. They are based, of course, on drafts issued by the Department, but they cover only two services and do not provide the answers to many questions which are often put to me.  I wish to give the people a full opportunity of putting these questions to themselves and, through the booklet, receiving the correct answers to them.  It may be, as the Deputy suggested, that a number of people will not read the booklet and that many who do will not understand it; but I am sure the majority of our people are intelligent enough to read and understand it and, when they are sufficiently interested, to have resort to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne urged me to give greater publicity to the facilities available in relation to poliomyelitis vaccination. The local authorities were requested by the Department some time ago to give public notice of the schemes by advertising in the Press; and more recently, having regard to the incidence of the disease, have been requested to do so again.  In addition, the Department proposes to undertake in the near future an advertising campaign pointing out the benefits to be obtained from poliomyelitis vaccination. But of course I do not think it is necessary for us to carry full page advertisements in the national Press in order to bring home to parents their duties and responsibilities in relation to their children in this very serious matter. We should be able to convince them by a more modest expenditure of money and paper that it is highly desirable, <Col N="1355" /> and indeed imperative, that all parents should avail of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne also had a great deal to say about the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  He stated that the existence of the scheme was not a substitute for a proper, comprehensive medical service available without charge to every member of the public and that the schemes provided by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board had not made adequate provision for people not covered by the public schemes.  In this connection he stressed the fact that only 80,000 of the total population were covered and that the schemes covered only short term hospital and specialist treatment and did not provide for the person suffering from a chronic illness.  As I pointed out in reply to queries put to me by Deputy Manley, the Health Act provides for essential services, free or at low cost, for about 85 per cent. of the population. It was never intended that the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme should provide full comprehensive cover for the remaining 15 per cent.  It is expressly provided in the statute that the scheme must pay for itself, taking one year with another, and if chronic cases were to be admitted, the premiums, naturally, would be very much higher than they are and consequently the schemes would not be anything like so attractive.  The Health Act of 1953 further provided that the Health Act schemes would be available to persons outside the income limit specified in the Act if serious hardship would result from the inability of the patient or his relations to pay for treatment.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the number of persons insured under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme has been growing steadily and there seems to be no doubt that within the next few years these schemes will provide a very substantial measure of protection against the heavy cost of illness to the greater part of the 15 per cent. of the public not covered in the Health Act schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins seemed to think that in my opening statement I did not devote enough time to praising the <Col N="1356" /> schemes and encouraging people to take advantage of them.  Of course, as the Deputy knows, under the Minister for Health, and the Department as well, there are a great many ancillary bodies operating&mdash;the National Organisation for Rehabilitation, the National Mass Radiography Association, the Blood Transfusion Association, the National Cancer Association and a dozen others.  I did not mention every such body which has any association with the Department but I did make special mention, apart from all others, of the Voluntary Insurance Board.  I mentioned the fact that it was developing in a very satisfactory way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne was trying to make a point, the precise object of which I was not quite able to follow, of the fact that the mortality among infants of parents of the professional classes was substantially lower than it is among children under one year of manual wage earners.  I think what he is trying to ask us to accept is that the heavier mortality among children, under one year, of manual workers is due entirely to the alleged fact that proper medical services were not readily available to them.  Of course there is a great deal more in question than just mere medical attention. Housing conditions in 1946 were not nearly as good as they are now 14 years later because housing had been substantially slowed down during the war years from 1939 on, and in fact it did not get going at full speed again until about 1951.  There is also the question of sanitation and perhaps an even larger factor is the different marital habits of the professional classes from these of wage-earners and manual workers.</P>
    <P>One knows that the general demographic trend all over the world is for people in the professional classes to have fewer children and therefore longer intervals between each birth. The position is quite the reverse in the case of others who are in the lower economic stratum.  Accordingly, it is not to be wondered at that where you have many births per family, the mortality rate will be higher.  I think Deputy Dr. Browne indulged in special and specious pleading which only tends <Col N="1357" /> to confirm persons in their view that he is a man who is quite incapable of making a rational approach to questions, such as these, where there are many factors involved.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that Deputy O'Higgins seemed to be in marked disagreement with almost everything that had been done by his successor.  It is natural enough that this should be so. If his attitude in regard to health matters were the same as mine, the Deputy would be where I am, not where he is. It is a pity the Deputy is not able to adjust himself to that fact; it is a pity because humility is the beginning of wisdom and if the Deputy did examine the position objectively, he would realise how much better everything now is than when he was in charge.  In any event, he should recognise that it no longer pays anybody to play politics with health services or with the Minitry for Health.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made great play with the suggestion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I just want to get the figures; that is all I am looking for.  Deputy O'Higgins made great play with the suggestion that we were spending only £1 per head on persons who were covered by the general medical services card and he quoted figures for the year 1957-8 tending to prove that.  He said that we spent £879,000 on these general medical services to cover 850,000 persons.  It is possible to frame statistics which will be quite misleading and indeed quite foolish.  It is not true that we are spending only £1 per head upon sick persons who are covered by the general medical services card.  There are many who hold these cards and who, thank God, enjoy good health and every member of their families enjoys good health.  If they are not ill, they do not need to go to the doctor or to buy medicine</P>

    <P>The statistic which the Deputy adduced has no practical significance. If we really want to know what we are spending per patient&mdash;which is the really critical statistic&mdash;we should find out&mdash;perhaps the Deputy might be able <Col N="1358" /> to do it; I have not been able to&mdash; how many of the holders of medical cards received treatment, for how long, and what was the nature of the illness for which they were treated.  We might then by correct weighing of all these values be able to get some sort of statistic that would be worth while in trying to establish the case which Deputy O'Higgins tried to establish. But, let me say this&mdash;first of all, that the figure which he gave was the figure for 1957/58.  No responsibility or blame or criticism attaches to the Deputy for giving the figure relating to that year.  It would be the only one, perhaps, which was available to him.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Estimates for the current year, 1960/61, under the heading described as General Medical Services, is £1,060,000 and is made up of salaries of doctors, £698,000; medical supplies, £287,000; other expenses, caretakers, upkeep of premises, etc., £75,000.  The Deputy, arguing from the 1957/58 figures, arrived at the conclusion that the average cost per person covered was 16/- in salaries and 4/- in medicines. In arriving at these figures, he would appear to have assumed that all the costs other than medicines were for salaries but the correct figures, accepting the total of 850,000 persons covered by the cards are as follows: salaries of doctors, 16/5d.; medicines, 6/9d. and other costs, caretakers and upkeep of premises, 1/10d.</P>
    <P>I may say that the Deputy also appeared to be under the impression that the salaries of staffs engaged on general administration&mdash;office staffs, and so on &mdash;and on the assessment of applications for general medical service cards, like assistance officers, were included in the General Medical Service item appearing in the Estimate.  That is not so because these administrative costs are included in the item &ldquo;Other Services&rdquo; and assistance officers' salaries do not rank for the health service grant, so they do not come into the Estimate at all.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also misstated the cost of medicines and drugs under the British National Health Service.  He stated that was 26/- per head of the <Col N="1359" /> population and he proceeded to compare that with the figure for medicine of 4/- per head of the population in this country.  In fact, as I have already pointed out, the figure of the cost of medicine here is almost 75 per cent. higher than the 4/-.  It is 6/9d.</P>
    <P>It is true that the total cost of supplying medicines and drugs under the British National Health Service in 1958 amounted to £65½ million but it is not correct to assume that this was entirely in respect of drugs.  The estimated breakdown of these gross payments is this: dispensing fees and payment for services outside hours, £13,080,000; overheads and profit, £9,535,000, and cost of ingredients and allowance for containers, that is to say, the cost of medicines, £39,490,000 and you see that works out at 15/3d. per head of the population.</P>
    <P>There are two factors which tend to increase the costs in Britain as compared with this country.  The first is that under our combined purchasing system we can, in fact, purchase drugs and medicines at lower prices than is the case in Britain where the purchases are made from wholesale chemists.  The second factor is that there is a very long waiting period for admission to many of the hospitals in Britain. Patients who in this country would be treated in hospitals or similar institutions are treated for long periods at home in Great Britain and during this waiting period they are supplied with medicines and drugs.  In this country, as I have already said, the waiting list is very short and the same expenditure under this heading of General Medical Services is not necessary and is not, of course, incurred.</P>
    <P>I was saying that it is a pity that Deputy O'Higgins, my predecessor, had not taken a more objective view of the position of the health services as they are at the moment, because, as I have also said, humility is the beginning of wisdom.  If I cannot give Deputy O'Higgins any laurels for his humility, I cannot forbear some admiration for him for his audacity. I wonder what Deputy listening to him on June 30th could conceive it possible that when Deputy O'Higgins left office <Col N="1360" /> in 1957 he left behind him not only financial chaos but bankruptcy and desolation in the architectural profession and in the building trade.  Not only had every penny which had accrued to the Hospitals' Trust Fund during the years preceding 1957 been spent but in January 1957 an advance of £100,000 had been secured against the proceeds of the Sweepstake on the Grand National in 1957, a race which, bear in mind, was not to be run until the following March.  The position was so desperate at the close of the financial year 1956/57 that it was not possible for me to wait for final accounts of that Sweepstake and I, therefore, had to obtain a further advance of £600,000 on 1st April, 1957, to meet the commitments of my predecessor, Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>Not only, however, did Deputy O'Higgins anticipate the Sweepstake income for 1957 by securing, as I have pointed out, an advance of the proceeds of the Grand National for that year but he proposed to continue to do so for some years.  I suppose he would, in due course, have left his successor heavily burdened with financial obligations, to meet which that successor would have neither the reserves nor accruing income.  As it was, when I took office in February, 1957, every voluntary hospital in the City, every builder engaged on hospital contracts and virtually every professional man who was associated with hospital work were dunning me for money.  I think I am quite entitled to say that, thanks to my good management, we are able to meet our commitments and our obligations as they fall due and building is proceeding in a normal way instead of proceeding by fits and starts and convulsively like some person suffering from a nervous disease.</P>
    <P>The Deputy in his speech also betrayed a Micawber-like mentality towards this question of finance.  He said he was prepared to enter into commitments and he hoped that something would turn up which would enable him to meet them.  There is a standing testimony to the wisdom of that policy.  It is to be seen near Booterstown.  Let any Deputy on the way out to Dún Laoghaire cast a look <Col N="1361" /> at Elm Park and see there the arcades of rusting steel which represent works that were begun by Deputy O'Higgins but which he had not the resources to continue.  The Deputy charged me with twiddling my thumbs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins charged me with twiddling my thumbs. What did he expect me to do in the earlier years of my responsibility when my principal preoccupation was to find money to meet the commitments which he left behind?  The Deputy spoke of the hospital programme which he drew up when the shades of the 1957 election were closing around him.  It was not, I may say, a bad programme on the whole.  It had a few political cutbacks but it was comprehensive and I agreed with most of it.  All that it lacked, and it sorely lacked that, was the money to carry it out.  However, it may interest the Deputy and the House to know that of the 40 projects on the programme decided by him, 12 schemes have already been completed and five schemes are actually in progress. The remainder are either being planned or have been deferred for the present as not being of great urgency.</P>
      <P>Apart from the schemes included in the Deputy's list I have since approved of the undertaking of 59 other necessary works involving a total estimated outlay of about £1,000,000.  Nine of these schemes have already been completed; five are in progress and the remainder are being planned.  In addition I have given instructions that the planning of the major schemes of reconstruction and improvement works at county homes is to be pushed ahead vigorously.  The estimated total expenditure involved in the county home scheme is £5,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these achievements scarcely indicate complete inactivity in the hospital building field over the past two years. The great problem is in regard to the three major projects included in the building programme as originally approved, that is to say, the Cork Regional Hospital, the new St. <Col N="1362" /> Vincent's Hospital and the new St. Laurence's Hospital.  On the basis of the estimates which have been put before me, these three schemes alone involve a total outlay of about £6,000,000 and it is quite clear, having regard to the position of the fund, that all three schemes cannot be allowed to proceed at the same time.  This is especially so since the building of a new Coombe Hospital at a cost of £750,000 has been approved and commitments for other urgent works will involve considerable outlay.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also stated that had this programme been carried through, the new Coombe Hospital would now be in existence.  While the-Deputy may have indicated that the new hospital would have been proceeded with some time, the official records in the Department indicate that in February, 1957, he had not decided definitely which two of the four major projects remaining to be undertaken should go ahead and an official minute dated 14th February, 1957, initialled by the former secretary of the Department states: &ldquo;The Minister proposes to defer for the present any decision in regard to the two major projects in respect of which grant provision was tentatively provided.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has challenged the policy which I have pursued.  I can proceed only on the basis of the documentary evidence before me and I am not going to assume that the then secretary of the Department would have written this note on the file if he had not consulted the then Minister and had not secured his approval for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a point of order which I hope will get the Minister's assent.  While it is appropriate to proceedings to bring before this House any recorded Government decisions or other documents on record, it should not be in order to bring before this House confidential minutes which ordinarily pass between the Minister for the time being and the <Col N="1363" /> secretary of the Department.  If that practice continued, it would become impossible to carry out the work in Departments because no ministerial minute to the secretary and no secretarial minute to the Minister could be confidential correspondence, if it is afterwards to be published in the House.  I would invite the Minister to consider that.</P>
      <P>That happened once before in connection, with the Department of Agriculture and I think the then Taoiseach indicated that he did not approve of the procedure, and it was never returned to subsequently.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the propriety of reading out to this House a confidential memorandum which passed between a Minister and the permanent Secretary of a Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came in, I found what had been decided, and what had been decided was as follows: the outgoing Minister had decided on 14th February, 1957, the middle of February, that he would defer any decision in regard to the two major projects.  I have merely rebutted the statement made by Deputy O'Higgins that, had he been there as Minister for Health, certain projects would have proceeded.  Now, I think Deputy O'Higgins acted correctly in asking the Secretary to record that decision.  It was clear that there was going to be a change of administration. I appreciate the fact that he left the decision&mdash; and, of course, the burden and responsibility of making the decision&mdash;to me.  It was the correct thing to do.  With the Hospitals Trust Fund already hypothecated to meet old obligations, it would have been acting quite wrongly to have entered into a further major commitment, with the Fund in that condition and a change of administration in the offing.  I do not want to go further than to say that I merely mention this fact to refute to the best of my ability, on the records available to me, the statement made by Deputy O'Higgins in criticism of me that, had he been Minister for Health, these particular projects would have gone ahead.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be querulous in answering the criticisms which have been made of myself, but I am, I think, entitled to take the strongest exception to the remarks which Deputy O'Higgins made in regard to the Board set up under the Opticians Act, 1956.  Deputy O'Higgins, in the proper course of his responsibility under that Act, appointed four persons to the Board.  I assume, in doing so, he consulted, in the way which seemed best to him, whatever organisation or body he considered suitable to advise him on the appointments. He had full discretion as to what bodies or organisations he would consult under the Act.  So have I.  He had full discretion, after consultation, to appoint four persons, each of whom had to be a registered medical practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> I did not think that he had made a very good choice, not on personal grounds, but having regard to the functions of the Board under the Act.  The persons whom he nominated were all resident in the city of Dublin.  I thought that was a weakness, and I think I am perfectly entitled, in the exercise of my responsibility, to select these people according to a different system.  I asked leading ophthalmologists resident in Dublin, in Cork and in Galway, and one other person, would they be prepared to act on the Board. One gentleman in Dublin whom I proposed to honour&mdash;that is the word&mdash; by asking him to act on this Board wrote back to me and said that, before accepting the invitation and saying whether or not he would act, he would have to consult his friends.  Quite properly, I think, I said to myself that if he was not prepared to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; and has to seek advice as to whether or not he should co-operate in this public service, then I will not humiliate myself by asking the gentleman again, and I told him that I had withdrawn the invitation.  The other ophthalmologists whom I invited to act, one residing in Galway and the other a surgeon practising in Cork, wrote back thanking me for the invitation and saying they were prepared to act.</P>
    <P>Then I asked myself: What is the function of this Board?  It is to ensure that a certain scientific standard and a certain standard of conduct will be required from those who practise as opticians.  I said: &ldquo;Let us see what is the scientific body which the Minister might, having regard to my view as to the functions of the Board, consult? I decided to consult the Irish Ophthalmological Society.  It is a scientific body which includes in its membership all the leading ophthalmologists in the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>And some outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Some from outside it.  What harm?  They live in this country.  I regard them as Irish.  I do not know what Deputy O'Higgins regards them as.  They were not going to be asked to nominate anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1366" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They were going to be told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I required of them, and what I expected them to say, was whether, in their view, the persons whom I proposed to appoint to the Board were properly qualified professionally, and so competent to determine the questions of professional conduct and scientific competence which were the sole purposes for which the Board was being established.  All credit to my predecessor for putting the Act through this House.  I am perfectly certain he did not ask this House to pass an Act in order that he might constitute another trade union or another trade union congress.  He said here at the time, quite properly, that the purpose he had in mind in asking the House to enact the legislation was to improve the standard of service given by Irish opticians.</P>
      <P>I think I was perfectly justified in my endeavour to consult the body which I considered most suitable for my purpose.  Just as Deputy O'Higgins, when he was Minister for Health, consulted another body.  I accept that this was at his discretion; as it was his responsibility.  I do not inherit, and I do not intend to inherit, all the misdeeds and mistakes of my predecessor, as I do not expect him to accept responsibility for any mistakes I may make.  I am perfectly entitled to exercise the functions entrusted to me; and I am not to be told I am a little Hitler and a totalitarian when I am doing the job I was expected to do when I was designated as Minister for Health, when I am trying to do the job which the people of the country expect me to do, and that is to see that the health services provided by law, and the ancillary services for which my Department is responsible, are conducted and administered for the benefit of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the position in relation to this matter was that certain people met and they decided that they would not co-operate.  They called on some people to resign; one did resign and another had a bereavement, and so on, but the Board is carrying on.  I am <Col N="1367" /> quite willing to suggest other names to the body which I originally consulted and I am perfectly prepared, if I am allowed to exercise the functions reposed in me by the Oireachtas&mdash; functions which I discharge in virtue of the fact that I am supported by a majority of the elected representatives of the people for whom I act, and for whom I am trustee&mdash;to consult the Irish Ophthalmological Society.  I am quite prepared to submit names to them for their observations, but I am not prepared to concede to them, or to any other organisation, the right of appointment which is vested in the Minister responsible to this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made the suggestion that if a certain notice, which is designed to have a certain effect, ceases to be published, I should be prepared to meet those responsible.  Well, I would say this: as soon as the necessary conditions are established which would enable a meeting to be fruitful I am quite prepared to meet the representatives of the Irish Medical Association. However, I am sorry that in making that suggestion&mdash;I think it has been termed an olive branch&mdash;the Deputy put as many spikes upon it as would make it a blackthorn, because he clearly availed of the opportunity to try to put the responsibility for the present unhappy situation upon the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to enter into any lengthy controversy, and what I am saying now is not for the purpose of continuing that controversy but for the purpose of maintaining the correctness of the record and ensuring that no person who may afterwards read this debate&mdash;maybe the possibility is exceedingly remote&mdash;will for a moment accept the interpretation or the misrepresentations of Deputy Tom O'Higgins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins relinquished office in March, 1957. During his term of office he declared the conditions for 13 posts.  They were: surgeon to the Tipperary North Riding <Col N="1368" /> County Council surgeon to the Louth County Council, surgeon to the Wexford County Council, E.N.T.A. specialist to the Limerick County Council, ophthalmological surgeon to the Limerick County Council, paediatrician to the Galway County Council, E.N.T.A. specialist to the Galway County Council, paediatrician to the Limerick County Council, surgeon gynaecologist to the Galway County Council, surgeon to the Galway County Council, surgeon to the Kerry County Council, and surgeon to the Tipperary County Council.  Each of these conditions, separately declared by my predecessor, contained the following statement of duties among others: &ldquo;To give to any person being a registered medical practitioner authorised by the health authority or the Minister, when requested, the clinical details respecting any person who is or has been under his care in the hospital,&rdquo; and 13: &ldquo;to give to the appropriate local authority all reasonable information respecting any person who is referred to him for examination and report by the local authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those are the conditions which appeared in every declaration of conditions made by my predecessors.  At the least they were acquiesced in, by the Irish Medical Association during the term that Deputy Tom O'Higgins acted as Minister for Health.  I succeeded him and, before the end of the month in which I succeeded him, I received a letter from the Irish Medical Association objecting to these conditions which they had acquiesced in during the whole period that my predecessor had been in office.  The letter objecting was, in fact, received on 27th March, 1957. In a reply to it, dated 1st April, 1957, I informed the Association that the draft represented the minimum necessary to enable the Minister and the health authorities to discharge effectively their obligations to the public. My predecessor, who attacked me in this debate, and I were in agreement about that.  He had declared the condition. I accepted it.  I thought, with him, that it was the minimum condition which it was essential should be one of the duties of the post, if we were to discharge our obligations effectively to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> However, my letter of April, 1957, went on to say that if the Association so wished the matters could be discussed at an informal meeting between a small deputation from the Association and the officials of the Department. It is important to note, in view of the statement that representatives of the I.M.A. have not been received by me, that a discussion took place on 31st May, 1957.  In the course of that discussion it was freely admitted by the representatives of the I.M.A. that the problem was difficult.  Certain proposals amending the declaration were discussed at that meeting.</P>
    <P>The question was the subject of further correspondence culminating in a letter from the Association dated 8th November, 1957.  I do not want to be controversial.  I want to be as factual and as historically accurate as I can. On 31st May, a letter was issued by me and on 8th November, 1957, the proposals which were mooted as a result of that discussion were turned down by the I.M.A.  I replied to that letter on 9th December, 1957.  I heard nothing further beyond the bare acknowledgment of the letter from the Association until the ban was imposed&mdash;until this notice appeared in November, 1958, one year later.</P>
    <P>It transpired from a letter which came into my possession that the reason for the publication of the notice was as follows.  I think I had better read that letter for the sake of the record.  It is headed 10 Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin, 2nd November, 1958, and it reads as follows:</P>
    <P>In answer to your enquiry concerning the recent County Surgeons posts for Bantry, Laois, Monaghan and Sligo, the Executive Council of the I.M.A. at the request of the County Surgeons Group, examined the conditions of employment and salary scales offered.  As a result of this examination the Executive Committee decided that the conditions and salary scales were unacceptable to the Association and, accordingly, advised members not to apply or if they had applied to withdraw.</P>
    <P> 1.  The Council objected to Paragraph 13 and 14 of the Particulars <Col N="1370" /> of Office which were not acceptable on ethical grounds.</P>
    <P>2.  Para 2 (b) was considered contrary to Section 25 of the Health Act.</P>
    <P>3.  Salary was inadequate now that Section 15 is in force and in view of the New Health Bill before the Dáil (re raising the Middle Income Group level from £600&mdash; £800.) </P>
    <P>I quote hereunder Paragraph 2 (b) and Paragraphs 13 and 14.</P>
    <P>2 (b) The officer may act as consultant in a private capacity to another medical practitioner when such practitioner or the patient is resident in the functional area of the local authority, to such extent as, in the opinion of that authority, will not interfere with the efficient performance of his official duties but such private consultant practice may not be conducted in a health authority institution.</P>
    <P>In respect of such private practice he may charge to the patient such fee as may be agreed between them; subject, however, in the case of his private patients in the hospital, to a maximum fee of 25 guineas.</P>
    <P>13. To furnish the clinical details regarding any person who is or has been under his care in the hospital, to a registered medical practitioner authorised by the health authority or the Minister on request, on production of the written consent of the person (or the written consent of the person's next-of-kin) or, in the case of a registered medical practitioner authorised by the Minister, the Minister's certificate that it would not be in the public interest to seek such consent.</P>
    <P>14. To give to the health authority all reasonable information respecting any person who is referred to him for examination and report.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 13 and 14 were the modified conditions of employment which I had submitted to the Association, they having rejected the conditions laid down by my predecessor, conditions which they had acquiesced in during all the period that he held <Col N="1371" /> office.  Therefore, apparently what was all right when Deputy T.F. O'Higgins was Minister for Health quite suddenly became all wrong when Deputy Seán MacEntee became Minister for Health.  I do not intend to do any more than to point out that fact.  That it is a significant fact cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>As I have shown, I had prolonged negotiations in relation to this matter. The discussions started in May, 1957. They culminated in two letters&mdash;one sent by me to the Medical Association which was rejected by them in November, 1957, and a further letter in reply to their rejection which I sent to them in December, 1957.  No more was heard about this matter until this notice of a ban suddenly appeared.</P>
    <P>In the letter I have read there is a reference to remuneration and it is stated the salary scales offered are unacceptable to the Association.  Here is the position in relation to that matter.  On 10th May, 1957, the Association wrote to the Department requesting a discussion at official level on the terms of service of county surgeons and what has since been described as the worsening of conditions following the implementation of the Health Act, 1953, which they stated brought the middle income group within the scope of the service provided.</P>
    <P>On the 19th June, 1957, in reply to that letter, the Association was informed that these matters could more appropriately be discussed by the Association, in the first instance, with the Managers' Association.  The Association suggested a tripartite conference between the Association, the Department and the managers.  The Department, with my full concurrence &mdash;the matter was submitted to me for my decision&mdash;held the view that it would be more appropriate to have the discussion with the managers in the first instance.  The Association agreed to this course and notified the Department accordingly on the 31st July, 1957.</P>
    <P>The next discussion was held on the 12th June, 1958.  I understand it was an amicable discussion and that the Irish Medical Association group, representing the county surgeons, undertook <Col N="1372" /> to prepare a further memorandum covering certain aspects of their claim and forward it to the Managers. This memorandum, however, never reached the managers.  It had not been submitted to them when in the following November this notice which Deputy O'Higgins said annoyed me appeared.</P>
    <P>The same thing happened a month later, in December, 1958, in relation to the post of county physician.  I suppose what has happened since is sufficiently imprinted on the public memory not to need any further detailing.  That is the position in regard to the dispute.  That is how the cleavage originated and that is how the matter stands today as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>I have done nothing to justify the action which the Irish Medical Association have taken&mdash;nothing whatever.  I met them with courtesy.  They have been on several occasions to my Department. The matters which they desired to discuss have been discussed in the Department.  On occasion, indeed, I may say that my Department has been treated with some degree of discourtesy. It has happened more than once that the representatives of the Association who came to my Department have gone away undertaking to make fresh submissions to the Department and have failed to do so.</P>
    <P>The Secretary, the senior officer of the Department during all this time, was the civil servant to whom glowing tributes were paid in this House the other day.  In all these discussions you had representing me the former Secretary and the present Secretary&mdash;both responsible and experienced officials.  They have all the minutiae of the services at their finger-tips.  If a settlement can be reached on such matters as those I have been discussing, as it should be, a discussion with them would be much more satisfactory and much less time-consuming than a discussion with the Ministerial Head of the Department.  I do not think one is justified in discussing sometimes trifling affairs with the representatives of various organisations when, in fact, the Dáil maintains highly-paid administrative officers to deal with these technical details.  It is <Col N="1373" /> not true, therefore, to say that I, as Minister, have not been ready to have them received by high senior officers who are quite competent to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>Another point which Deputy O'Higgins made was that the public were in some way suffering because of this lack of contact between the Irish Medical Association and the Ministerial Head of the Department.  I deny that absolutely.  No persons have suffered in this country because of the publication of these notices except those professional men who have complied with the notice, who accepted the injunction which it was intended to convey and who failed to compete for certain official posts for which no doubt some of them would have been well qualified.  They have suffered because the posts which an attempt was made to ban have been filled.  I have not any doubt whatever that if other vacancies arise tomorrow we will be equally successful in filling them.</P>
    <P>No patient, no person entitled to services under the Health Act, has suffered in any way by reason of what has arisen between me and the Irish Medical Association and no patient will suffer.  I do not want to see the situation, continuing on that basis, however. When I first addressed the Irish Medical Association, as I did in Cork in 1957, I told them how anxious I was that there should be co-operation between us.  That is still my attitude towards them, but let everybody make up their minds about this, so long as I am Minister for Health I am going to try to do my duty to the people and I am not going to allow myself to become manipulated like a marionette by those who have their own particular views in relation to many things with which I do not agree.</P>
    <P>The Deputy accused me of getting people to approach county managers, to try to negotiate with county managers in relation to the conditions of employment affecting themselves.  I have not done anything of the sort.  It is quite clear, however, from what has been taking place over the past few months that, at last, regard is being paid by some people to the statutory conditions governing the employment of those who are in the health services of the local authorities.  I have <Col N="1374" /> several times pointed out that county surgeons, county physicians, county medical officers and dispensary medical officers are not employees of the Minister.  They are employed by the local health authority and the Local Government Act, 1955, clearly places upon the managers and clearly confers on the local health authority the right to conduct negotiations for the settlement of remuneration and conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>That is the legal position, the statutory position.  I am not going to regard the laws of this land as something to be lightly put aside merely because they are thought to be inconvenient or derogatory to the prestige or the status of anyone.  The position is that, in fact, various groups have been meeting the county managers.  I understand that the county surgeons met the county managers.  I understand that the county physicians met the county managers; that the assistant medical officers' position has been discussed and that the local dispensary medical officers in the several counties have been meeting the county managers whom they serve.</P>
    <P>Let me say this.  The county managers are not meeting any one of these groups and have not met any one of these groups in their personal capacity. They are meeting them as representing the local authorities and the ratepayers who will eventually, with myself, have to meet the increased cost of whatever agreements may be arrived at.  If there has been delay in asking local authorities to give effect to the agreements which have been hammered out &mdash;and I think it is all to the good that they should be hammered out on a national basis&mdash;it is because of the fact that the mandate of the local authorities was rapidly expiring and it was thought to be desirable that the new local authorities should have the first opportunity of considering the position. Certainly I have made no endeavour to influence the county managers and I know there has not been any unwillingness on the part of the county managers to consult their councils in due course.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter, however, is that in so far as the practical situation is concerned the attitude which the <Col N="1375" /> other party to this difference has seen fit to take up has been made ineffective; the posts have been filled, the statutory position in regard to the officers and in regard to the local authorities has been accepted and there is not any reason in my view why friendly relations cannot be resumed the moment I am satisfied that the Irish Medical Association is prepared to cooperate with me in trying to make the Health Acts work effectively and for the benefit of the people.</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody to humiliate himself in any way.  If the next issue of the Association's Journal ceases to carry a certain advertisement the way will be open for a meeting between myself as Minister and the representatives of the Irish Medical Association to try to establish better relations, relations which will be based upon a recognition of the rightful authority and responsibility of the Minister for Health, whoever he may be, to ensure that the services provided under the Health Acts are made readily, effectively and properly available to all those who are entitled to them.  I hope it will be possible for us to reach agreement on that basis.</P>

      <P>Before the Estimate is put might I just ask the Minister whether he would not agree that the statement made by the President of the Irish Medical Association has made it more possible far co-operation between the Association and himself?

I think that it failed to recognise the essentials of this position, that is, that I cannot agree to a meeting as long as there is published an intention by the Association of trying to prevent the Minister for Health from fulfilling his statutory duty to provide effective health services for all the people.  I do not want to start discussing the merits and demerits of the advertisement again.  As I said, there is no need for any member of <Col N="1376" /> the Association to make long speeches, or for anybody else to make them, and no need for any intermediary.

      <P>As in previous years, I have circulated to Deputies a memorandum giving a considerable amount of detailed factual information on the activities of my Department and on agricultural production, prices and trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" /> The net Estimate for 1960/61 is £12,250,350, representing an increase of £878,348 over the original net Estimate for 1959/60 and a decrease of £1,255,152 on the original Estimate plus the Supplementary Estimate for that year.  The main reason for the increase in the Estimate compared with the original Estimate for 1959/60 is the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme, Subhead M.II.  There is also an appreciable increase in the provision for An Foras Talúntais, subhead K.5, which is partly offset by savings on the provisions for services taken over by An Foras.  The following services are provided for in the Estimate for the first time: Subheads F.4 and F.5&mdash;Grants to University College, Dublin, and Trinity College, Dublin, in respect of their Veterinary Faculties, and Subhead M. 13&mdash;Grants to Bacon Factories for certain works of modernisation in layout and plant.</P>
    <P>In introducing last year's Estimate, I had occasion to comment on the extremely bad harvest of 1958 which was due to the persistently wet weather of that year.  1959 was a very different story.  We had an exceptionally dry summer and a great deal of sunshine. The harvest was saved under ideal conditions, and the yield and quality of grain were excellent.  There were also bumper crops of sugar beet and potatoes. Due to the prolonged drought, however, grass was short, and milk production fell appreciably.  The drought also adversely affected the cattle and sheep trades, and a substantial number of stock was carried over to 1960.</P>
    <P>Taking everything into account, 1959 was not a bad year: it was not as good as 1957 but was very much better than 1958.  Gross agricultural output for 1959, including an increase in livestock numbers valued at £11 million, is estimated to be £187.5 million, that is, about £4.5 million above 1958.  Net output on the same basis increased by about £5 million, or over 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Among the more important developments affecting our agriculture during the past year was the negotiation of a supplementary Trade Agreement with Britain.  This has already been discussed by the House, and it is unnecessary, therefore, to expound it in <Col N="1379" /> detail.  From the agricultural point of view, this Agreement is important for two main reasons: it reaffirms and strengthens the special trade relations between the two countries, and it provides for the application of the same guarantee payments to our attested store cattle as to British home-bred cattle.  The House is aware of the special importance of our trade relations with Britain.  The bulk of our exports is sold there and, in turn, we are a very important market for British industry.</P>
    <P>Our sales of agricultural products in countries of the European Free Trade Association, other than Britain, are not appreciable.  We have a small but useful market in, the countries of the European Economic Community where our sales of agricultural products amount to between £4 and £5 million a year.  The future pattern of European trade generally is at present far from clear and the problems posed by the existence of the European Economic Community on the one hand and the European Free Trade Association on the other have not so far been resolved.  As regards markets outside Europe, the American market has proved very satisfactory during the past year.  Our agricultural exports to the U.S.A. in 1959&mdash;mainly frozen beef&mdash;amounted to £7.6 million compared with £5.1 million, in 1958.</P>
    <P>A few months ago, I announced a number of price and other measures which the Government had decided upon in order to improve the incomes of farmers and keep them in reasonable relationship with those of other sections of the community who had obtained increases in wages and salaries over the past couple of years. These arrangements consisted partly of increases in the guaranteed prices for certain products and partly of measures to increase productivity by reducing costs of production.  I believe that these price increases will encourage farmers to maintain and increase further their production of milk, cattle and pigs.  Our milk prices are even now not very high by comparison with those of some other countries, but we must always keep in mind the difficulties of selling high cost dairy produce in well supplied markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> It is obvious that in, the long run the most effective means of helping farmers is to try and reduce the cost of production and thereby increase productivity. The measures I announced a few months ago include a subsidy on potash fertiliser and a remission for twenty years of rates on, new farm buildings and on improvements to existing buildings.  These forms of assistance were selected because, as already announced, the Government are particularly anxious that the benefits should apply to as large a number of producers as possible.  There is evidence of increased use of fertilisers but there are still too many farmers not making full use of the facilities in this regard now placed at their disposal.</P>
    <P>Since I introduced last year's Estimate, the Advisory Committee on Marketing has completed its work. Deputies will recall the White Paper published last December which sets out Government policy in relation to the recommendations made by the Advisory Committee for the improvement of the marketing of agricultural produce. Most of the Committee's main recommendations were accepted by the Government and it was decided:&mdash; (1) that an Irish Dairy Produce Board should be established to handle certain dairy produce exports; (2) That the export of bacon to Britain should be centralised in a reorganised Pigs and Bacon Commission; and (3) that the export of eggs should be centralised in Irish Eggs Limited.</P>
    <P>The necessary legislation for the establishment of a Dairy Produce Board and the reorganisation of the Pigs and Bacon Commission is in course of preparation and will be introduced as soon as possible.  As regards eggs, arrangements have been completed for the centralisation of exports in Irish Eggs Ltd.  I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Chairman and the members of the Marketing Committee for giving so much of their time to a difficult task.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal in some detail with some important aspects of our largest export industry&mdash;cattle.  The number of cattle on farms as at January, 1960, was 4.3 million representing <Col N="1381" /> an increase of over 5 per cent. compared with a year earlier.  The number of heifers in calf had increased by 17 per cent. and there were increases of 180,000 in cattle in the 1-3 year old group reflecting the lower rate of cattle exports in 1959.  The year under review was, I regret to say, a rather disappointing one for the store cattle trade. Store prices in the early months of 1959 were very high but from May onwards a drop occurred which sharpened during the dry summer and autumn.  In part at least due to the drought conditions exports of stores were appreciably lower than in the previous year.  The number exported in 1959 was 403,000 compared with 595,000 in 1958.</P>
    <P>This was, however, to some extent compensated for by an increase in exports of fat cattle and carcase beef. Exports of carcase beef in 1959 were valued at £10.5 million which represented an increase of £3.2 million over the previous year, while fat cattle exports at £5.2 million showed an increase of £1.7 million.  The cattle trade has continued at a somewhat lower tempo this year and the prices of some classes of stock, particularly young cattle, have not been as strong in recent months as in the early part of 1959. The increases in exports of fat cattle and carcase beef have, however, been maintained in recent months.</P>
    <P>After careful examination of the position, I do not agree with the view that has been expresed in some quarters, that the reduction in our store cattle exports in 1959 was due to any important extent to resistance by British farmers to our &ldquo;once tested&rdquo; cattle.  We must recognise, however, that the value of the &ldquo;once tested&rdquo; concession is likely to have spent itself well before 1965 and this gives even greater urgency to our efforts to eliminate bovine tuberculosis.  In my opinion, an important factor in the present situation is that housewives in Britain have been able to turn to plentiful supplies of lamb, mutton and broilers when beef prices reached high levels.  Despite this, however, consumption of beef is expected to show a steady increase with rising living standards and should not <Col N="1382" /> be too seriously affected by the availability of other types of meat&mdash; although in the future I think we can expect that lower-priced alternative meat supplies will prevent beef prices from soaring too high.  In my opinion, the position of the cattle trade is basically sound but the possibility of short-term fluctuations can never be ruled out.</P>
    <P>The eradication of bovine T.B. is now our greatest single problem and if I deal with the matter in some detail, it is to underline the importance which I attach to it.  The eradication scheme commenced in 1954 in Sligo and Clare and by the middle of last year it had been extended to all parts of the country.  Compulsory clearance measures were introduced in Sligo and Clare in October, 1957, in the other five western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon and Galway in March, 1958, in Cavan and Monaghan in July, 1959 and in Longford in March of this year.  In the remaining 16 counties eradication measures are proceeding on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>To date the gross expenditure on the scheme has amounted to £12½ million and receipts from the sale of reactor cattle to £5½ million; the net cost of the scheme to date is, therefore, £7 million of which £5 million was spent in 1959-60.  For this outlay, the disease has practically been eliminated in the western clearance counties, while in the east and midlands, including Cavan and Monaghan the incidence is being steadily reduced and individually accredited herds are being established. In the south where the problem is more difficult a certain amount of progress has been made&mdash;a total of 74,500 reactor cows has been removed under compensation&mdash;but it is well to remember that the disease incidence to start with was high and this will make the completion of the task in the south more formidable than elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>However, investigations which have been carried out by veterinary officers of my Department show that there has been a considerable drop in the incidence of tuberculosis in young stock in the South over the past twelve months and I have no doubt <Col N="1383" /> that the pasteurisation of skim milk at creameries which is now compulsory will be a great help in the clearance of that area.</P>
    <P>During the past year, there has been a growing awareness amongst farmers throughout the country of the urgent need to complete the job of eradicating the disease and it seems safe to expect a considerable acceleration in the pace of eradication from now on. Much has already been accomplished but of course a great deal still remains to be done.  An extra effort now by all concerned will make all the difference as regards the time by which the whole country can be declared free of the disease.</P>
    <P>As regards the western clearance area, the rate of testing did not enable area accreditation to be achieved in 1959 as we had originally hoped.  We are now confident, however, that the entire area west of the Shannon, comprising the counties of Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway, and Clare, as a single unit, can be given accredited status by the end of this year, provided that an all-out effort is made by all concerned in the months immediately ahead.  In this connection I recently addressed meetings of farmers in the less advanced of these counties and I firmly believe that the required effort will be forthcoming. I repeatedly urged at these meetings not only the importance of accreditation to farmers in the clearance area but that the attainment of this goal in the West would be a tremendous encouragement and example to farmers in the rest of the country to push ahead with the job.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the blue card arrangement which enables our store cattle to be exported to Britain without further testing, as the equivalent of 14-day tested cattle, is being introduced in each of the western counties when the number of reactor herds has been reduced to manageable proportions. This arrangement cannot be brought into operation in a county until a high proportion of the herds there has passed two consecutive tests. The reactor herds in the meantime are placed under movement restrictions <Col N="1384" /> which mean that cattle may not be moved from them except under permit which normally would be granted only to enable the cattle to be moved outside the clearance area or to go for immediate slaughter.</P>
    <P>This arrangement is already in operation in Sligo, Donegal and Mayo and is being extended almost immediately to Galway, and will be extended to the remaining three counties of Leitrim, Roscommon and Clare in a month or so.  The blue card arrangement, valuable as it is, must, however, be regarded as no more than a prelude to full accreditation and as a useful means of accustoming farmers to the controls which will have to be complied with when accreditation is granted.</P>
    <P>Co. Donegal is in a different position from the other western clearance counties in that the movement of cattle into the county can be controlled with relatively little difficulty.  Marked progress in the county indicate that it past year and the results coming up from the round of testing now in progres in the county indicate that it should be possible to grant the county accredited status in advance of the rest of the western area provided wholehearted co-operation is forthcoming from all concerned.</P>
    <P>Cavan and Monaghan were made clearance area counties in July, 1959, and the second round of clearance testing has commenced in both counties.  On the completion of this round of testing the blue card arrangement will be introduced in the two counties as quickly as possible. Longford has been a clearance area county since March last and the first round of clearance testing is in progress there.</P>
    <P>Testing on a county basis began about a year ago in the ten Leinster counties of Louth, Meath, Westmeath, Dublin, Kildare, Offaly, Leix, Carlow, Wicklow and Wexford and is being availed of by a very high proportion of the herdowners.  Although the scheme is on a voluntary basis in these ten counties, over 70 per cent. of the cow reactors disclosed on the initial round of testing have been disposed of to the Department.  In these counties it is <Col N="1385" /> possible to make rapid progress by the combination of general eradication measures and the establishment of individually accredited herds.  When the position in those counties warrants it, and this should not be very long if the effort is made, clearance area measures will be introduced beginning with the counties which have made most progress.</P>
    <P>Last October, a new scheme of incentives involving the payment of a headage grant of £15 on each cow reactor sold to a licensed cannery and a substantial bonus when the herd gets a clear test was introduced in the six southern dairying counties of Cork, Kerry, Kilkenny, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford.  This scheme has attracted considerable support from herd owners&mdash;about 70 per cent. of the total number have submitted applications&mdash;but unfortunately, quite a number of farmers in the area, while availing of the free testing of their herds, have done little to get rid of the disease by disposing of reactors.</P>
    <P>At this stage of the eradication campaign, such an attitude could not be tolerated.  Accordingly, the automatic annual free re-testing of herds in the south was suspended early this year.  Free re-testing will be restored in that area during the present month but on the basis that the herd owner must have disposed of a stipulated minimum proportion of his reactor cows in order to earn it.  In future a farmer in the south will not have to wait twelve months for further testing as at present.  He can have further tests carried out at more regular intervals provided of course he has disposed of his quota of reactors.  This process can be repeated until the herd is cleared.  More frequent testing will be of considerable value to herd owners who are serious about ridding their cattle of T.B. and will greatly facilitate them in qualifying for the clear herd bonus available in the south.</P>
    <P>For the next year or two, one of the biggest problems with which herd owners are likely to be faced will be the economic disposal of uncertified store cattle.  Since March last, such <Col N="1386" /> cattle have been deprived of entry into herds in Great Britain or into the Six Counties.  Uncertified cattle may, however, be exported for immediate slaughter.  With a view to facilitating the disposal of such cattle by farmers, butchers here are being indemnified in full from the beginning of this month against loss in respect of any heifer or bullock beef rejected because of T.B., while from the same date an arrangement is being introduced whereby payments related to the British fat stock guarantee payments will be made on fat cattle and carcase beef exported from this country.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of this month, all cattle which fail a comparative test are being branded by means of a hole punched in the ear.  This has already been the practice in the western clearance area for some time.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of pressure on the Department to have high-yielding reactor cows in the south treated in the same way as pedigree cows for the purpose of compensation, that is, to have them taken up by the Department at market value instead of disposing of them to a cannery under the £15 headage arrangement.  The argument is that these high-yielding cows, while more valuable to the herd owner, often make less at the cannery than the lower-yielding beef-type animals.  I have considered this matter carefully and have decided to increase the headage grant of £15 to £25 in the case of cows registered under the Department's scheme for the registration of non-pedigree dairy cows.  I do not propose to give special treatment to any other categories of high-yielding cows, for example, &ldquo;recorded&rdquo; cows.</P>
    <P>From early this month, therefore, the following provisions in regard to the eradication scheme have taken effect:</P>
    <P>(i) resumption of free herd testing in the south on the basis of the prior disposal of a specified minimum proportion of reactor cows; (ii) guarantee payments in respect of fat cattle and carcase beef exported; (iii) indemnification of butchers against losses from condemnations of bullock and heifer beef because of tuberculosis; (iv) branding of all reactors to the comrartive <Col N="1387" /> parative tuberculin test; and (v) special compensation arrangements for registered non-pedigree dairy cows.</P>
    <P>When the above provisions have been implemented, I would hope that the pattern of the eradication scheme will have been set for the future.  The incentives are fairly generous and the need to complete the job should be obvious to everybody.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a special appeal to all herd-owners, veterinary practitioners and others engaged in the cattle trade to give their earnest co-operation in bringing to completion this vital task of eradicating bovine tuberculosis.  The campaign has cost a great deal of money so far and looks like costing a lot more, but without the active support of everyone concerned the most lavish expenditure will be of no avail.  The fact is simply that if our cattle export trade is to be maintained we have to get rid of this disease.  If we were so unfortunate as to have an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease everyone would give of his best to overcome it as quickly as possible because he would realise that our cattle industry was in jeopardy.  The problem of bovine tuberculosis demands a similar approach and for the same reason.</P>
    <P>There are two other developments affecting cattle which I should mention; these relate to progeny testing and milk recording.</P>
    <P>Steps were taken in 1959 to improve the arrangements for the progeny testing of bulls of the dairy breeds&mdash; Shorthorn and Friesian&mdash;at the A.I. stations.  Additional progeny testing units were established, the objective being to have four such units operating in the area of each A.I. station, and the Department has contributed about half the cost of operating the units.  Each of five A.I. stations has now all four units operating and the remaining four stations have already gone part of the way.  There are about 20 herds per unit and in each of these herds there are two or more heifers in milk, including A.I. progeny.  The milk yields of the A.I. heifers are compared with the yields of the other heifers in the herd and the worth of the sires of the A. I. heifers is assessed on the basis <Col N="1388" /> of the comparative yields.  A number of A.I. heifers are recorded in cow testing associations and records from the associations, where available with contemporary comparisons, have also been used for the progeny testing of A.I. bulls.</P>
    <P>Recently the question of integrating the different milk recording schemes so as to avoid overlapping and make for more efficient operation has been receiving active consideration.  Associated with this is the desirability of securing more records for progeny testing and of providing more convenient milk recording facilities for farmers than are available to them under the present cow testing scheme. The Department communicated with cow testing associations, the A.I. stations and the Pedigree Cattle Breeders' Council in this matter and has had discussions with a number of interests concerned.  Whilst the precise lines of a new scheme have not yet been agreed, I am hopeful that it will be possible fairly soon to secure some integration and provide improved milk recording facilities.</P>
    <P>Last year was not favourable for milk production, due largely to the exceptionally dry summer.  Towards the end of July, it became apparent that only a limited quantity of butter would be available for export and, consequently, the levy of 17/- a cwt. on butter, which had been imposed in the previous year to meet the industry's share of the export losses, was suspended.</P>
    <P>The rate of delivery of milk to creameries as compared with the previous year improved from December onwards.  This improvement has been maintained and supplies are running at about 8 per cent. above the 1959 figure but are at present still about 10 per cent. below the 1958 figure.  On the assumption that this trend will continue it seems than an export market will have to be found for a substantial quantity of butter and other dairy products.  Market prospects are to say the least, not promising but the increase in production is an encouraging sign and the position on the export market for dairy products of all types is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>As announced on 12th April last, <Col N="1389" /> the price at which the Butter Marketing Committee purchases butter has been increased by 28/- a cwt.  This increase permits an average increase of 1.3d. a gallon in the price paid to farmers for milk.  The minimum price of milk for liquid consumption in the Dublin and Cork Milk Board areas has also been increased by 1d. per gallon.  As indicated by the Minister for Finance in his Financial Statement on 27th April last, in view of the increase in the price of milk, provision has been made in the Budget for an increase of £550,000 on the original estimate of £250,000 for subsidies on dairy produce to cover the possible Exchequer liability in respect of creamery butter and also a liability &mdash; assumed provisionally pending the establishment of the Dairy Produce Board&mdash;in respect of exports of certain other dairy products.</P>
    <P>Pig production during the last year has been somewhat lower than the year before, but the census for January, 1960, shows a distinct upward trend as compared with the January 1959, census.  In January, 1960, pigs numbered 875,000, that is more than 10 per cent. higher than last year.  The increase in sows was 17 per cent. and in pigs under three months 16 per cent.  This should be reflected in higher output during the remainder of 1960. The recent introduction of the new Grade A Special for bacon pigs, for which the minimum price is 245/- per cwt. deadweight as compared with 230/- for ordinary grade A, should afford a further incentive to farmers to aim at quality improvement.</P>
    <P>I may mention that at this early stage an average of about 17 per cent. of pigs of at least Grade A standard qualify for the A Special Grade.  The initial exports of bacon from these Grade A Special pigs have been well received on the export market, and it is hoped that we are now on the road to securing a much better place in that market.  On the production side, reports have been published during the past year on the four pig progeny tests already completed at the Cork station and these will be a valuable guide to breeders.  On the processing side, there is a new provision under <Col N="1390" /> Sub-Head M.13 of the present Estimate for the payment of grants to bacon factories in respect of modernisation in layout and plant.  This State assistance to bacon factories was adumbrated in the White Paper on the Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>The January, 1960 census indicates a continuing expansion of sheep production. Sheep numbered 3.2 million and were 4 per cent. higher than in the previous year.  Ewes for breeding had increased by 5 per cent.  The export market situation in the Autumn of 1959, influenced largely by drought conditions in Britain, was very unfavourable, but the market improved later in the year and for the past few months prices have been up to and sometimes above last year's levels. There was also a substantial increase in the number of store sheep exported in 1959, and these of course qualified for British Fatstock Guarantee Scheme payments after fattening in Britain or the Six Counties.  Given reasonably normal conditions this year, we should not have cause for undue worry about the situation.  The trend of supplies abroad is, however, generally upward rather than the reverse.</P>
    <P>In regard to the poultry industry, the January census figures do not indicate any significant change in numbers.  I may mention that development work for the purpose of stock improvement, especially in the case of turkeys and broilers, is being expanded and increased facilities have been provided during the past year for breeding and propagation work at the Department's institutions concerned.  The increased facilities will permit of effective breeding programmes for the general distribution of stock of the best strains procurable.  Improvement in the quality of turkeys to meet the now very keen competition on the export market is urgently required and this is being promoted by assistance towards the formation and development of more supply farms and breeder hatcheries and by encouraging turkey breeders who have not yet purchased poults from commercial or breeder hatcheries to avail themselves of the facilities obtainable from those sources. <Col N="1391" /> The area under wheat fell substantially in 1959 but the crop was a very good one and the quantity sold to the flour millers was approximately 270,000 tons dried or 30,000 tons less than the target.  Growers received the maximum or near maximum price for all the wheat sold.</P>
    <P>A very welcome feature of last year's harvest was the increase in production of feeding barley.  The acreage under the crop was the highest on record. Prior to the harvest various proposals were made to me as to how the crop should be marketed.  After full consideration of all the problems involved and with a view to ensuring, firstly, that the growers would receive at least the floor price previously announced, and secondly that barley would be made available to feeders at the lowest price possible, I decided to leave the marketing of the crop to the trade interests concerned.  At that time the indications were that our full requirements of coarse grain would be met from the home crop.  In those circumstances and in view of the fact that some maize is required for special foods, I agreed at the harvest time to the export of barley against the imports of a limited quantity of maize on a ton for ton basis.</P>
    <P>It subsequently transpired that additional quantities of coarse grain would be needed to supplement home supplies up to next harvest and the barley exports were used as a basis for allowing the additional imports. With the co-operation of all the interests concerned I am glad to say that the arrangements made worked satisfactorily this year; there was no difficulty in marketing the barley and, generally speaking, feeding stuffs were available at reasonable prices throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I may mention that the prices of compound feeding stuffs for pigs are now £1 to £1 10.0. a ton cheaper than they were at this time last year. Another point worthy of mention is the fact that growers of feeding barley retained more than half the crop for feeding to their own stock.  Not only is <Col N="1392" /> it in the interests of the growers themselves to hold the greater proportion of their production of feeding barley but by doing this they ease considerably the overall marketing problem.</P>
    <P>In addition to the exports of feeding barley there were also limited exports of seed barley, malting barley and malt during the year.  We are all anxious to see this type of export expanded and every encouragement will be given to the exporters concerned in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the case of oats the area sown in 1959 was slightly higher than in 1958.  No official control was exercised over the marketing of the crop.  With the exception, of a limited quantity of seed oats imports of oats were not permitted when the home produced oats became available.</P>
    <P>As regards the current year, it was announced in December last year that the price for wheat would be unchanged; that the levy arrangement would be continued for this year; that the question of a quota system had not been dropped but that legislation would be needed if it were to be introduced.</P>
    <P>On the basis of present information it seems that there has been a substantial increase in the wheat acreage as compared with last year and that a levy will be necessary, but before the rate of the levy can be determined I shall have to consult with An Bord Gráin as required by the Act.</P>
    <P>It appears that there may be some reduction in the feeding barley acreage this year.  If this forecast is borne out the fall in acreage is a matter for regret, particularly with a surplus of wheat in prospect.  Increased production of feeding barley for use wherever possible on the farm where grown must remain one of the keystones in our livestock production policy.  It is, however, difficult to make a firm estimate at this stage as the quantity of seed retained by growers for their own use is not known.  As I have indicated already, the arrangements made for the marketing of last year's barley crop worked satisfactorily.  I am proposing to make arrangements on somewhat similar lines this year. <Col N="1393" /> It is unlikely that there will be much change in the oats situation and it may be taken that, except for limited quantities of seed, imports will not be permitted so long as requirements can be met from home sources.</P>
    <P>The number of applications received under the Land Project in the year 1959/60 was 26,900, an increase of more than 3,000 over the previous year.  There is quite a considerable backlog of applications awaiting attention, representing roughly twelve months' work on the average.  I am concerned to reduce to the minimum the time that elapses between the date a farmer makes his application and the date on which the application is investigated and to this end I have, during the past year, called the local officers together and personally impressed on them the need for speeding up the work of the project.  In addition, I have initiated measures designed to cut out unnecessary office procedures in order to make more time available for the actual preparation of schemes.  I am happy to say that during the past six months this has begun to show results as the number of approvals issued has been in excess of the number of applications received, which, of course, means that inroads have begun to be made on the backlog.  Since I periodically supply Deputies with statistics indicating the progress made with land reclamation, it is not necessary now to go into the matter in more detail.</P>
    <P>Under the Fertilisers Section of the Project 9,000 applications have from the outset been received of which over 8,600 have been dealt with involving a total area of 355,000 acres. Delivery and spreading of lime and fertilisers to the value of over £900,000 have been effected or arranged for on 171,000 acres on 4,330 holdings.  This response is disappointing. The acreage covered is not large having regard to the length of time the scheme has been in operation, the total area of agricultural land in the country and the great need for fertilisers. We have taken account of the farmer's point of view by amending the scheme so that he can now take on the work by instalments.</P>
    <P>As regards education, research and <Col N="1394" /> advisory work, the following developments may be mentioned.  During the last financial year the process of the handing over of veterinary education to the Universities, in accordance with arrangements approved by the two Universities, the Veterinary Council of Ireland and the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in London was completed.  Under these agreed arrangements, the Universities appoint the teaching staffs, and my Department administers the Veterinary College and appoints the non-teaching staff there. Both Universities utilise the Veterinary College for the training of their students, in accordance with arrangements agreed between the parties concerned. It is because of these arrangements that a decrease is shown in the provision under Subhead F. 3 for the Veterinary College.  This decrease is more than counterbalanced by the grants to the two Universities under Subheads F. 4 and F. 5 in respect of veterinary education.</P>
    <P>A sum of £400,000 is being provided in the Estimate for An Foras Talúntais.  Grange Farm, the Peatland Experimental Station at Glenamoy, the peatland experimental centres at Derrybrennan and Clonsast, and Johnstown Castle Agricultural College have been transferred to the Institute from my Department. The Institute is engaging in an extensive programme of research which I hope will throw light on many of the problems which confront our agriculture.</P>
    <P>During the past year the advisory services have been strengthened, the number of Agricultural Instructors actually employed at 31st March last having increased to 212 as compared with 194 a year earlier and I understand that further posts for which there are vacancies are in the process of being filled.  I am glad to know that Committees of Agriculture are generally showing a progressive outlook towards educational matters and I look forward to an additional increase in the force of instructors in the year that lies ahead.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of winter farm schools was introduced during the past year after consultations between my Department and the Department of <Col N="1395" /> Education.  Under this scheme committees of agriculture and vocational education committees pool their resources in teaching personnel, accommodation and equipment so as to provide a comprehensive educational course to fit young people for life on the land.  While the courses are varied to suit local needs and conditions they generally include agriculture and horticulture as well as instruction in a variety of other matters such as building construction, economics, account keeping and social affairs.  I am glad to be able to say that the new scheme has got off to a good start, 37 schools having been conducted in the first year with a total attendance of over 800 and generally the students are reported to have displayed very keen interest in the subjects taught.  I am hopeful that committees of agriculture and vocational education committees will continue to co-operate in this way and that the scheme will be considerably extended in the future.</P>
    <P>The winter farm schools are intended primarily to cater for young people who live at home and who do not find it possible to attend one of the residential agricultural colleges.  As the House is aware, the residential colleges provide a very fine blend of practical and theoretical education for those who have to make a living on the land and it is in the national interest that they should be fully utilised.  I am happy to be able to say that many improvements have been carried out in the agricultural colleges in recent years and generally there is a keen demand for admission to these institutions.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter which does not arise directly on the Estimate but which I should like to mention for the information of Deputies and of the public generally.  The Food and Agriculture Organisation's world-wide Freedom-from-Hunger Campaign was launched on 1st July.  The campaign, which will be carried on over a period of five years, is designed to deal with a situation which may be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>A large part of the world's population still does not have enough to eat, and an even larger part does <Col N="1396" /> not get enough of the right kinds of food.</P>
    <P>The increase in food production only barely exceeds population growth.</P>
    <P>The increase in food production per capita is least marked in the less developed parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Food production in developed countries is being held back by limited marketing possibilities abroad.</P>
    <P>The campaign is planned on the basis of world-wide concerted action with the Food and Agriculture Organisation acting as co-ordinator.  It will be financed from a Campaign Trust Fund which will be fed by voluntary contributions from Governments, international non-governmental organisations, religious groups, private organisations and individuals.  An urgent appeal has been made by the Director-General of FAO for support for the campaign and for funds urgently needed to get it under way.  The Government have decided that we should lend every possible support to the campaign and that in token of such support we should make an official contribution of $10,000, that is about £3,570, to the Campaign Trust Fund. Because of the urgent need for funds in the early stages of the campaign the contribution is being paid immediately and the covering authority of the Dáil will be sought by way of Supplementary Estimate later in the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I never moved this motion with more profound regret than I do this year having listened to the dismal tale the Minister has had to tell us.  The introduction of the Agriculture Estimate used to be an occasion of inspiration, almost excitement, some story of development, some story of expansion and some story of a new departure. This dreary recital is indicative of the state of the agricultural industry today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it fair to say that the best test of any policy is the results.  When I see what is going on in rural Ireland <Col N="1397" /> it makes me sick.  The income of the farmers was £150.6 million in 1957. In 1959, the last complete year, it was £133.2 million, £17.4 million less than it was in 1957.  I take the income of the farmers to represent the net value of agricultural output excluding turf and excluding changes in livestock.  I do not know how anybody estimates how much turf the farmers cut.  It is one of those figures that is plucked out of the air and put into statistics.  No one knows whence, no one knows how, but in any case it is not agricultural output or income.</P>
    <P>I think it is perfectly true that changes in livestock are a valid, genuine statistic, properly included in agricultural statistics, but they are not income for the farmer.  There is nothing more depressing for a farmer to have on hand than a stock of cattle, the value of which is melting away before his eyes.  I have seen the price of a calf drop from £20 to £10 in the past 12 months.  But the income&mdash;the actual receipts to the farmers&mdash;has dropped from £155,000,000 in 1957 to £133,000,000 in 1959.  If I were the Minister for Agriculture, with that tale to tell, I should be ashamed to appear in Dáil Éireann.  I should be especially ashamed to appear in Dáil Éireann, bearing in mind that I had got where I was, as is the case with the Minister, by the fradulent pretence that I was going to raise the farmer's income, at least in respect of his cereal crops, by a substantial addition to the guaranteed prices current in 1957.</P>
    <P>I remember Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party, and their leaders, stumping this country in 1957, telling the farmers how their hearts were bleeding for them because the price of wheat had been reduced and because the price of feeding barley was no better than 40/- per barrel.  I remember Deputy Corry, the poor man, coming in here on 26th March, 1957, fresh from the campaign, clearly recollecting the undertakings he had been sent to give to the people in East Cork by those who duped and fooled him.  He rushed into this House in the first week in which the new Dáil met after the general election and put down a question at Column 43 of <Col N="1398" /> Volume 161 of the Official Report to ask:&mdash;</P>
    <P>the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the absolute necessity for increasing the wheat acreage this year, and in view of the endorsement of the wheat policy by the people, he will state what steps he intends to take to secure by financial inducement an increased wheat acreage this season; and if, in view of the lateness of the season, he will make an immediate statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>I remember so well his getting the &lsquo;dusty&rsquo; answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; from Deputy Aiken, the Minister for Agriculture&mdash; that man of many parts&mdash;&ldquo;No alteration in the price of wheat in these last days of March could appreciably affect the acreage of wheat this year.&rdquo; And the reply went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I can, however, assure Deputy Corry that the necessity for securing an adequate acreage of wheat is fully realised by the Government, and that an announcement regarding wheat prices will be made in good time to enable farmers to prepare for the autumn sowing season.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken, Minister for Agriculture at the time, had forgotten by then the cruel injustice of which he had spoken so eloquently, the robberies done upon the farmer by the fixation of the price of wheat by the Government in which I was Minister for Agriculture; but he assured Deputy Corry that &ldquo;the necessity for securing an adequate acreage of wheat is fully realised by the Government&rdquo;. Poor Deputy Corry went off chewing on that.  There was no &ldquo;jam today&rdquo; for Deputy Corry or his dupes.  I think Deputies will agree with me that it was not an unreasonable interpretation of these words that there would be &ldquo;jam to-morrow&rdquo; when Deputy Aiken, as Minister for Agriculture, had had time to examine further into the matter and consult with his colleagues in the Government.</P>
    <P>That is what poor Deputy Corry thought.  So he returned again to the charge on 27th November at Column 1009 of Volume 164 of the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is now in a position <Col N="1399" /> to announce the guaranteed prices for homegrown wheat and feeding barley of the 1958 crop.</P>
    <P>Mr. Aiken: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle.... As the matter is still under consideration I am not yet in a position to make a statement in regard to prices of wheat or feeding barley of the 1958 crop.</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry: Is the Minister aware that very early last year he assured me that the prices for the 1958 wheat crop would be published early in the autumn so that we could do autumn sowing in the knowledge of them?  This does not look a bit like it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Aiken: I think as a general practice it would be good.</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry: It is nearly Christmas now.</P>
    <P>That is all the satisfaction poor Deputy Corry got.  But when the price came to be fixed, Deputy Corry discovered, as did his dupes on the land of Ireland, that what Fianna Fáil meant when they said they were going to provide 82/6d. a barrel was, in fact, that they were going to take the price fixed by the inter-Party Government of 78/6d. per barrel and reduce it by the imposition of a levy, and all because they were dealing with the farmer.</P>
    <P>In the meantime&mdash;this is something a great many people have forgotten&mdash; the same Government have required the farmers to pay more for bread&mdash;5d. on the loaf, 3/7d. on the stone of flour, 10d. now on the lb. of butter, an increase in the price of tobacco, an increase in the price of beer, increased rates on their land, increased transport charges on themselves and all they buy and sell, and the increased prices are on the things they have to buy as a result of the increased costs pushed upon the producers of this country. Over the period in which all those increased costs were thrust upon the farmers all they received from the Fianna Fáil Government, the Government who had promised them so much, was a levy on the price of wheat fixed by <Col N="1400" /> their predecessors, not an increase as was promised from 40/- to 48/- a barrel for feeding barley but a reduction to 37/-, now adjusted, I think, to 38/- per barrel.  As a result of the price of livestock and livestock products, they received a total reduction in their income from £150,000,000 in 1957 to £133,000,000 in 1959.</P>
    <P>There is no other section of the community who have been asked to accept a lower monetary income over the same period.  What this Government have forgotten is that they have pushed the farmers now very near to the position in which they were in 1947.  But we came into office then and changed the picture.  The Fianna Fáil Government are once more pushing the farmers back into that position.  They believe that the farmers can be forced into a course of tightening their belts, lowering their standard of living, into the position of being hewers of wood and drawers of water the position Fianna Fáil thinks suitable for them; but Fianna Fáil are wrong.  What is happening is&mdash;the Minister knows it and all the Fianna Fáil Party know it &mdash;that the small farmers are clearing out.  The big farmers in the east and south-east are still able to hang on, but their income is dwindling and the repercussions are being felt in the towns and villages throughout the country.</P>
    <P>That is bad from the point of view of the economy of Ireland but what is infinitely worse from the point of view of the very existence of the Republic is that the people who constitute its main stability, the landowning farmers of the country, are leaving it.  There is not a townland west of the Shannon from which at least one family has not gone and there is not a village west of the Shannon from which, in the last two years, several young people have not left; but the grimmest development in my lifetime is to see seven adjoining houses on the borders of County Mayo and Roscommon evacuated by their entire families in the last two years where, to my knowledge, children were reared as long as I remember, and where there is nothing now on seven holdings&mdash;no trace of human occupation and no production other <Col N="1401" /> than the few thin store beasts that are fighting a losing battle with the rushes which are moving in.</P>
    <P>This Government has gone mad. They have simply made up their minds to let the land go.  There are 12,000,000 acres of arable land and it is simply being abandoned by the Fianna Fáil Government.  In their heart of hearts I believe they have made up their minds to let it go, that the future of this country is to be based on the Shannon <i>entrepreneur</i> system and enterprises of that character, that the land is beyond the redemption of the people who are on it, and that the sooner they are shifted off it the better.  They are mad; they are stark, staring mad, because after that asset is suffered to wither and die our people cannot survive as an independent people for one generation.  We shall simply become the serfs of any exploiting power that wants to march in and control us.  The sheet anchor of our independence and sovereignty has been our security in the land and that is being jettisoned by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I rejoice to think that at last the people who live on the land are awakening to the measure of the catastrophe that is overtaking them, and I do not conceal the fact that the result of the Carlow-Kilkenny by-election was a gratifying surprise to me.  I did not realise the strength of the ground swell against Fianna Fáil in a constituency like Carlow-Kilkenny and I rejoice in it because, without that reaction, the prospects of this country would be truly appalling.  I only hope and pray that reaction will wax and grow so that again we may attempt in 1961 what we put our hands to in 1948.  However, there is no use concealing the fact that the situation which will confront us in 1961 will be far more difficult than the problems with which we had to struggle in 1947 because in the meantime two shameless confidence tricks have been successfully played on the people by the Fianna Fáil Party, and I do not blame our people if they now trust no one in the public life of the country.</P>
    <P>It may be unjust that we should suffer for the fraud of Fianna Fáil but <Col N="1402" /> the fact is that we do.  A great part of the electorate of the country, particularly in rural Ireland, would now not believe the Gospel from a public platform and the blame for that rests squarely on the Deputies who went down to tell them their hearts bled for them in regard to the prices obtaining for wheat in 1957, and that they were straining at the leash to get control so that, as poor Deputy Corry inquired in March, 1957: &ldquo;When are we going to do what we promised that we would do?&rdquo; The present Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Aiken, gave him his dusty answer: &ldquo;Wait and see, Deputy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, when the cold blast of winter blew him in here to repeat his inquiry, he was told again: &ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo; He finally got his answer and I pitied him the day he got up, under the spur of criticism, thumped the table and said: &ldquo;I came in here as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and I will stay that as long as I am here, whatever they do.&rdquo;  I admired his loyalty but I pitied his confession of public humiliation. I asked him to be here today so that we could discuss together that grim record of his public humiliation. He at least, I believe, was in good faith but he typifies the disillusionment of those who accepted the undertakings of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I only hope that, in his humble prostration now, he does not represent truly the reaction of the people of the country to the fact that they have been asked to lower their standard of living, and to accept the position that their proper place is on the lowest run of the social structure of this country.  I do not accept it and I do not believe any self-respecting section of our people should accept it, but I confidently prophesy that, if the policy based on such a detestable proposition is pursued, this country will collapse because the land will cease to produce and, without the output of the land, Ireland can neither be sovereign nor free.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it behoves me to undertake the formulation of policy for the present administration.  There is only one remedy for the present situation and that is to expedite the process <Col N="1403" /> which has already begun.  Fianna Fáil is on its way out and the faster it goes the better prospect there is of this country surviving.</P>

      <P>If the people asked me tomorrow what is the remedy for the present situation the only remedy I can propose to them is: &ldquo;Get the rascals out.&rdquo;  So long as they are there, the agricultural community is headed back to the position in which we found them in 1947, with the distinction that this time the people are going and still continue to go and, having gone, they will not come back.</P>
      <P>It is not my job to formulate policy for the present Government and I do not propose to try to do so.  It is right that I should recall the details of the figures to which I have referred. Dramatic though these global figures are, it is no harm to put once more upon the record the relevant facts as set out in <i>Economic Statistics</i> prior to the Budget of 1960, compiled by the Central Statistics Office, on page 8 of which occurs the following words:</P>
      <P>In 1959, as compared with 1958, the output of cattle declined by 72,000 or by about £5 million in value.  The value of total milk output fell by £2.2 million and the output of pigs fell by £1.7 million.  A fall of £l.4 million in the output of sheep and lambs was offset to some extent by a rise of £.7 million in wool.  Lower prices for turkeys caused a drop of £600,000 and egg production declined by £1.1 million. The aggregate output of livestock and livestock products fell by £11.7 million from £141.5 million in 1958 to £129.8 million in 1950.</P>
      <P>These are grim figures.  They are figures of which this country must take urgent heed if the whole west of Ireland is not quickly to be depopulated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if the young people are to be persuaded that there is still some future on the land. <Col N="1404" /> It causes me no little concern, over and above seeing the land abandoned in the West, to hear amongst the young people from whom we ought to be drawing the next and succeeding generation of farmers their growing conviction that there is no future for anybody on the land.  If that impression continues to spread, I do not know where the income from the land will be got but, without that income, this country cannot survive.  That is the urgent problem with which this Oireachtas and our people are at present confronted.</P>
      <P>In the course of the Minister's statement I see that as a result of the White Paper published in regard to the recommendations of the advisory committee he now proposes that the export of eggs should be centralised in Irish Eggs, Limited.  I cannot but remember when his predecessor, the late Deputy T. Walsh, solemnly, and at great expense, wound up Eggsports which was then handling the egg exports of this country very successfully.  Having wound it up, scattered its personnel, wrecked its organisation, five years later the present Minister has another brain wave that he will create it again. We are all meant to stand up and give three ringing cheers for this revolutionary discovery of the present Minister for Agriculture that this is the solution of all the problems of our egg trade&mdash;to stick together the pieces of what his predecessor tore up and discarded as of no value.</P>
      <P>It is like living in Bedlam to try to keep track of the gyrations of successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture. It is a wise thing that there should be centralised marketing of whatever remnants of the egg trade now survive, and they are not much.  If they suddenly discover that this is the solution of all our problems, I am wholly at a loss to understand, why they did not leave Eggsports in existence when they had it, with all the contacts and organisation it then had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister very succinctly tells us that the exports of bacon to Britain would be centralised in a reorganised Pigs and Bacon Commission.  It is gratifying to hear that he has bent his powerful intellect to the solution of <Col N="1405" /> this problem.  In the meantime, he overlooks the fact that the Danes have moved in and usurped our preferential position in the British market and, what is more, as far as I can read the signs though I have not inside information requisite to make a proper judgment, they seem successfully to have stuck their finger in our eye.</P>
    <P>I have been reading of a whole series of consultations designed to regulate supplies of bacon to the British market from the various traditional suppliers. The net result is that we have moved out and the Danes have moved in.  The Danes have stepped up consistently and regularly their exports of bacon to the British market.  They obviously have shown their readiness to accept any price the market are prepared to give them, with resulting repercussions on our position in that market which, as far as I can see, closely approximates to catastrophe.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the centralisation of our exports to Great Britain by the reorganisation of the Pigs and Bacon Commission may produce.  I wish it well.  I take it the Minister has carefully considered all the relevant considerations. There are the trade connections that exist, all of which a centralised marketing organisation must rupture and abandon.  It is not enough to tear up all these existing trade relations and then hand it to the centralised marketing organisation unless a vigorous marketing policy is pursued.</P>
    <P>One of our difficulties is that we have not the bacon at present with which to conduct an effective marketing operation in Great Britain.  We are in the dilemma at the moment that if we seek to develop the market we will not have the bacon to supply it and if we do not develop the market we will have nowhere to sell our bacon.  I imagine the wisest course to pursue will be to concentrate our exports at least temporarily on certain restricted areas in Great Britain which we have some prospect of adequately and steadily supplying but if we do we must establish in those areas an organisation equal or superior to the existing Danish marketing system which is extremely powerful and well-organised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> The Minister might have given some further explanation of what he means by saying that the export of bacon to Great Britain should be centralised in a Pigs and Bacon Commission. He says that legislation for the establishment and reorganisation of the Pigs and Bacon Commission is in course of preparation and will be introduced as soon as possible.  We must await the publication of that legislation whenever it may come, to find out the details he has in mind.  A great deal requires to be done if we are ever to recover the position we once had in the British market for bacon and if we are ever to recover the ground we have lost to Denmark in that market while we were exerting ourselves to determine whether proportional representation should be retained or abolished in our electoral system.</P>
    <P>I said here recently that one of the urgent necessities for the effective prosecution of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme was that the Minister should tell us what he wanted us to do.  I must say that it had the eminently desirable result of producing large advertisements in the newspapers succinctly telling farmers in the different parts of the country what he wanted them to do.  I do not quite understand the Minister's reference to compulsory clearance measures being introduced into the five counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon in March, 1958.</P>
    <P>What is compulsory about them?  I am not yet aware that there is any compulsion to undertake clearance operations in these five counties.  I was rather inclined to think long ago that the time was overdue when compulsory measures would be legitimate.  I would be obliged if the Minister would tell me what he means by compulsory clearance measures in Donegal, Leitrim, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon. I confess that if there are such compulsory measures I never heard of them.  If the Minister explained the matter to me, I would perhaps recognise something I have not so far recognised. If the Minister wants my opinion as to whether the time is ripe for compulsory measures, I think the time is ripe.  If some action along <Col N="1407" /> those lines is not taken pretty soon, we shall not get where we want to get in the time still available to us.</P>
    <P>On page 10 of the Minister's statement he says:</P>
    <P>Steps were taken in 1959 to improve the arrangements for the progeny testing of bulls of the dairy breeds&mdash;Shorthorn and Friesian&mdash; at the A.I. stations.</P>
    <P>To my certain knowledge, there were steps taken to that end at the Sligo A.I. centre in 1956.  I would be glad to know from the Minister whether any results have emerged.  Some results ought to be available from the progeny testing stations which have been at work for four years.  Have any outstanding bulls been discovered or any recorded?  Does anybody know anything about them?  I can tell the Minister&mdash;perhaps, he may make a note of this&mdash;that I discovered a bull recently in the Sligo A.I. centre, with a very distinguished Aberdeen Angus pedigree which was, in fact, producing horned calves.  I understand it has been moved on.  I got a couple with horns on them.  They were not full-grown horns but they were quite sufficient to persuade anybody who looked that they had a drop of Kerry blood in them.  In fact, the calf's sire had an Aberdeen Angus pedigree a mile long wherever he got it.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister, and in this I sympathise with him, that there was more talk about the calves with horns on them from the A.I. station than there was about all the excellent calves born through A.I. from that same station.  That is the nature of people. It may have been nobody's fault but it was a very strange thing to happen. I have been trying to explain it to a good many of my neighbours with very little success.  I may say that such accidents do happen.  There are a number of sceptical people who are inclined to say: &ldquo;There, I told you so.  There was nothing like the old scrub bull.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I see that the Minister refers on page 12 to the progeny testing station for pigs.  I was largely instrumental in setting up that station in Cork.  Does <Col N="1408" /> any Deputy sympathise with me in my situation when, having read four reports, beautifully produced, from the pig progeny testing station, I ask myself where do we go from there?  There was only one boar referred to in all these reports whose owner I knew and I thought I would hurry off and make that boar's acquaintance when I got such a high testimonial from the A.I. station.  When I called on the boar, I was told that he was dead and buried before the report came out.  What I should like to find out is, when you get down to tin tacks, how are we to benefit from and use the reports of the pig progeny testing station?</P>
    <P>I thought at some stage that people who wanted to buy a sow would be recommended to go to a certain place where sows of progeny tested stock were available.  I did not think it was impossible that at some stage the Pigs and Bacon Commission would hold themselves out as being in a position to supply sows from progeny tested stock.  I think the time is overdue when the Department of Agriculture should make known to the pig breeding community at large how they are to avail of the information collected at the pig progeny testing station.  If necessary, the Department should, in consultation with the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Commission, make available breeding sows of proven strains because I know of no machinery whereby these can be acquired at the present time by the average farmer.</P>
    <P>I notice that, when the Minister was referring to the increase in the number of sheep, he made no reference to wool. I used to fight a considerable running battle with the Department of Industry and Commerce who always sought to establish that wool is an industrial product in this country.  I understand that the exports of wool last year were in the order of £5,000,000.  That represents to my mind no small part of the value of the increasing numbers of sheep on the land of Ireland.  I think that the Minister has a duty to keep before the mind of the people the substantial additional income which is derived from wool in addition to the export of sheep, lamb and mutton which are customarily regarded as the main <Col N="1409" /> output of the sheep industry in this country.</P>
    <P>On page 13, the Minister says that development work for the purpose of stock improvement, especially in the case of turkeys and broilers, was being extended and increased facilities were provided during the past year for breeding and propagation work at the Department's institutions concerned.  I certainly would be interested to hear something further in this particular matter.  We brought in the best broad breasted white turkeys from the United States of America.  We brought in two separate breeds of American broiler chickens.  We established at considerable expense at Athenry a turkey propagation station amidst, I remember, the howls of derision of a good many Fianna Fáil Deputies at the time.  It was lucky we did so.  If we had not then brought in the new strains of white turkey, we would be well on our way to losing irrevocably a very substantial British market for turkey meat. I should be glad to know from the Minister how far the Athenry station is in a position to supply all the demands made upon it; whether it still confines its supplies to people who maintain turkey stations in rural Ireland, or whether anybody can apply to Athenry for supplies of pedigree white turkeys, and is it now the policy of the Department&mdash;as I think it ought to be&mdash;to replace the American Bronze as expeditiously as possible with the broad-breasted Empire White, and if so, what progress has been made to that end?</P>
    <P>I see that the Minister on page 14 of his statement believes that:</P>
    <P>As regards the current year, it was announced in December last year that the price for wheat would be unchanged; that the levy arrangement would be continued for this year; that the question of a quota system had not been dropped but that legislation would be needed if it were to be introduced.</P>
    <P>On the basis of present information it seems that there has been a substantial increase in the wheat acreage as compared with last year and that a levy will be necessary, but before the rate of the levy can <Col N="1410" /> be determined I shall have to consult with An Bord Gráin as required by the Act.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister no idea of what the dimensions of the levy are likely to be?  Will it be more or less than 5/- a barrel?  Even prior to consultation with An Bord Gráin, he might pay Dáil Éireann the compliment of informing us approximately what the figure is likely to be, before we adjourn for the Summer Recess.  This body to which we belong is, after all, representative of all the people and the ultimate authority on matters of this kind, and I think it is entitled to hear what the prospects are.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is proceeding with the Land Project. God be with the days when Fianna Fáil used to be warning the farmers not to touch the Land Project as it was a dark and sinister scheme to increase the valuation of their land.  Is it true that the Minister is catching up on the arrears?  I have been told authoritatively that the arrears were never worse and if there is any temporary staff required for any temporary job, the staff of the Land Project are promptly transferred.  Is it true that the staff of the Land Project are in part diverted to valuing cattle for the purpose of acquisition under the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme?  It is true that the staff of the land project are being substantially reduced?  My information down the country is that the delays in getting approval for works proposed have never been greater than they are now.</P>
    <P>I see that the Minister is disappointed with the fertiliser section of the project.  So am I.  When that scheme was inaugurated, we provided under it that a man should get his whole farm done at the same time and there were complaints about that condition being insisted on.  Finally, my successor, the late Senator Moylan, waived that condition and prophesied that as a result there would be a very much larger number of applications for the scheme.  It does not seem to have had that effect.  I offer this advice to the Minister: what that scheme requires is more publicity.  I do not believe <Col N="1411" /> that one one-fiftieth part of the people to whom it should be of interest know of the existence of that scheme.</P>
    <P>If the Minister engaged in a little publicity informing people that anyone who wants to get his land fully fertilised on a long-term project had only to apply, he would find plenty of applicants, provided there was some prospect of the work being done reasonably soon after the application was filed.  Nobody is going to avail of the scheme if he has to apply in January, 1960, and wait until June, 1961, to get the fertiliser.  Unless he was daft altogether, he would not leave his land lie fallow for 18 months because the Department of Agriculture were using their staff for some purpose other than that for which they were employed, that is to say, taking them from the Land Project and employing them on other work while the Land Project fell into 12 or 18 months arrears.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a specific matter which affects the problems of beet farmers who are supplying beet to the sugar factories, and also other products which are produced from Irish sugar, which is raw material produced in this country.  In 1948, we negotiated a Trade Agreement, Article V of which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government of the United Kingdom undertake that where goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland, are dutiable at preferential rates of duty, they will not vary the existing preferential treatment of these goods in such a way as to put any class of goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland, at a disadvantage in relation to goods of that class from other sources enjoying preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>Now, that is a pretty comprehensive Article and yet with that Article in existence, I understand that goods containing Irish sugar are being subjected to a very formidable levy, the proceeds of which are devoted to the subsidisation of goods of similar quality containing sugar derived from crown Colonies of the British Crown. I am told, I think, by some of the <Col N="1412" /> Minister's colleagues, that when Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce, this matter arose and that he did not consider it desirable to press the interpretation of Article V which would give us the right to claim exemption from that levy.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position is in regard to that.  I have no recollection of hearing the matter discussed when I was a member of the inter-Party Government, although it could have happened and passed out of my memory but I do not remember it and I have not discussed the matter with Deputy Norton.  Whatever attitude was taken up, I should like to be told now because frankly I confess that as I see it now, it appears that that Article is wide enough and comprehensive enough to cover the present procedure under which I believe that goods which are the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland are being put at a disadvantage in relation to goods of that class from other sources enjoying preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that the British Government, like any other Government, will seek to interpret any agreement which they have signed, in the most favourable possible light to themselves. That is their right and duty to their own people, but they will expect us to do as much, and claim from the agreement the maximum advantage to which its words and terms entitle us.  I should be very interested to hear from the Minister whether he has asked our Minister for External Affairs or whoever deals with the matter to press that point of view in regard to sugar and its products and, if so, with what result.</P>
    <P>I would view the future not only of agriculture but of this country with profound dismay, if the various Constitutions enacted since this State was founded did not have it in common that there should be a general election at least once every five years.  The longest this Government can last is another 12 months.  I hope and pray that their disappearance at the end of that term will not be too late but I have so profound a confidence and <Col N="1413" /> hope in the land of Ireland that I cannot persuade myself it will be too late.  In any case, we shall try, I hope, successfully, 12 months from now, to reverse the trend that has brought the income of the farmers down by £17,000,000 a year since Fianna Fáil took office.</P>
    <P>We shall try in so far as within us lies to see that the farmers are no worse off than any other section of the community.  We want no privileged position for them.  We want them to enjoy no superior advantage over the trade union workers, the businessmen or the professional workers in their own country, but we think they were never destined to be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water for everyone else.  That is what they are being made now.  They are being turned into the poor people of our community.  I do not think they will stand for it and I do not think the country can afford to let them go.</P>
    <P>They are going now every day, every month, every year in growing numbers, not because they want to go to better jobs, but because they cannot live in their own country.  That is the kind of emigration I hate.  We have seen both kinds in our day.  I can remember many years ago one kind of emigration.  I saw it disappear and be replaced by another kind of emigration of people who had no need to go but chose to go because they felt they could earn more and live a better and a different kind of life abroad. They were entitled to go if they chose, and some did choose to go. Some preferred to stay because they knew here in Ireland they could still get on the land a measure of security, dignity and peace that was not to be had in the industrial maelstroms of Birmingham or Pittsburg, London or New York.</P>
    <P>Now whole families are going, not because they want to go, but because they can no longer live at home, and they are leaving behind them abandoned holdings which should be a red light of warning to any rational Government.  I think Fianna Fáil do not provide our people with a rational Government.  I do not think they <Col N="1414" /> chose for our people a Minister for Agriculture who really believes either in himself or in his portfolio.  The only remedy I see for that is a change of Government.  God speed that day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement which the Minister gave us tonight was a very gloomy review of his inactivity during the past 12 months.  He made very little reference to the Trade Agreement or to any efforts to improve the position between this country and Great Britain, so far as our agricultural exports are concerned.  We expected that we would have heard from the Minister what the result of those efforts was.  If it was a failure, we should have heard from the Minister that he would try again.  Instead, he has avoided any reference to what appears to have been a fiasco, so far as agriculture is concerned.</P>
      <P>We can understand the dismal tale which the Minister had to tell this evening after the verdict of the agricultural community recently in Kilkenny. We remember the victory of the Fianna Fáil Party of almost two to one in the Carlow-Kilkenny election when they were promising to increase the price of milk and the price of wheat same years ago.  The agricultural community in Carlow-Kilkenny showed very clearly in the recent by-election that they have lost their faith in the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and that they are anxious for a change of policy and a change of Government as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned this evening that it was the intention to introduce legislation here again for the purpose of imposing a levy on this season's wheat crop.  We might have expected from the Minister an undertaking that if he did introduce legislation of that kind, it would not bring about the results we saw some years ago when money was taken from the wheat growers to be used in respect of a surplus which did not result from the crop that year.  Instead, the money was taken from them seemingly under false pretences because when it was collected, no surplus resulted and it was used for another purpose.  The wheat growers expect an undertaking <Col N="1415" /> from the Minister on this occasion that if he takes a levy from them in order to deal with a surplus, the money will be used for that purpose only.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the quota system which was very much in the minds of the wheat growers and agitated their minds when it was given an airing last year in order to see what their reaction to a proposal to have a wheat quota would be.  One of the main difficulties confronting the agricultural community at the moment arises from the Minister's lack of interest in the tuberculosis eradication scheme.  It is well known that the Minister has not his back behind that scheme and he certainly declared himself against that scheme a couple of years ago.</P>

      <P>The only body, board, company, or analogous or similar institution to which I have appointed any person is the Shannon Free Airport Development Co. Ltd.  The present directors of the Company were appointed by me by Warrant dated 22nd January, 1960.  They are Mr. B. O'Regan, Chairman, Messrs. G. Farren, A. Kennan, Col. P. Maher, J. Buist MacKenzie, J.J. Walsh and R.C. Ó. Conchubhair.  The Chairman and each director receives remuneration at the rate of £250 a year.  Col. Maher's appointment expires on 9th October, 1960, the date of his retirement from the Public Service.  Two of the directors retire at each ordinary Annual General Meeting of the Company. The two directors to retire shall be those two who have been longest in office.  As between two or more who have been in office an equal length of time the directors to retire shall, in default of agreement between them, be determined by lot.</P>

      <P>Bord na nArm Phinsean was established under Section 5 of the Acht Arm-Phinsean 1927 and consists of a chairman and two ordinary members.

The members of this board are not engaged full-time on the duties of the board.</P>
