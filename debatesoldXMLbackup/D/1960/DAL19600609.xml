      <P>asked the Minister for Health what is the cause of the delay in giving sanction to the proposal of Laois County Council to reconstruct and improve the county home at Mountmellick; and if sanction will now be given for an immediate commencement of the work in view of the present decaying state of the building.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to provide a new dispensary at Mountmellick is a small part of the general scheme for the reconstruction of the County Home at Mountmellick inasmuch as it is intended to convert the present dispensary for use as a laundry in the reconstructed <Col N="895" /> institution and to build a new dispensary at the proposed new entrance to the County Home.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the comprehensive County Home improvement scheme had reached sketch plan stage in 1956. Further progress in the matter had to be deferred by reason of the general financial difficulties which subsequently developed.  In March, 1959, due to an improvement in the general financial situation and having regard to the urgent necessity for improving conditions in County Homes, I decided that a number of County Home improvement schemes, including the Mountmellick project, could proceed. Accordingly, in May of that year, my Department requested the local authority to re-examine the original planning proposals for the Mountmellick County Home with a view to making any alterations which might have become necessary by reason of changes in the numbers to be accommodated.  The local re-examination was completed and revised proposals were submitted to my Department in October, 1959.</P>
    <P>These proposals have since been examined in detail and sanction has been given to the local authority to proceed to preparation of constructional drawings and specification.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made by my Department to clear the final planning documents, when submitted, so that tenders for the works involved can be invited at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether any new post in the Office of the Minister for Justice was created during 1954; and, if so, who was appointed to it; what changes, if any, took place in the basis of remuneration; and what was the total amount paid out of public funds in respect of such post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A new temporary post of Ministerial Personal Assistant in the Office of the Minister for Justice was created in 1954.  Mr. Richard Ryan, B.A., Solicitor, was appointed to it, on the scale £435 × 25&mdash;800 a year plus authorised percentage additions (equivalent to £525&mdash;945 inclusive), which he entered at a point four increments above the minimum.  He was paid an allowance of £100 a year in respect of private secretarial duties.</P>
      <P>As from the 1st November, 1955, by virtue of a general increase in civil service pay, the inclusive equivalent of the scale became £570&mdash;1,018, and the allowance became £105.</P>
      <P>As from the 30th August, 1956, on which date the officer was married, the scale was revised to £435 × 34&mdash; 965 plus authorised percentage additions (equivalent to £570&mdash;1,220 inclusive), the allowance of £105 a year being continued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that the serious damage to beaches and to swimming facilities and other holiday amenities experienced recently on the south coast is due to the fact that small oil tankers are not availing of facilities provided by the Irish Refining Company at Whitegate for discharging ballast and are instead discharging ballast containing oil in or in the vicinity of Cork harbour; and whether any steps have been taken or are proposed to be taken to secure either in summary or indictable manner the conviction of the persons responsible for the offensive conduct in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  I am informed by the Cork Harbour Commissioners that they are satisfied that tankers are making full use of the facilities provided by the Refinery and are not discharging oil into the harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Oil Pollution of the Sea <Col N="903" /> Act, 1956, the discharge of oil or oily mixtures from a vessel into the territorial seas and the inland waters navigable by seagoing vessels is an offence for which heavy fines may be imposed on the owners and master.  Proceedings in respect of oil pollution of harbour waters would normally be taken by the Harbour Authority and if the Deputy has any information about the discharge of oil in Cork Harbour or elsewhere he should report it to my Department, or the Harbour Authorities as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Enquiries which I have made suggest that the oil pollution to which the Deputy refers is due to discharges on the high seas.  Ireland has accepted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil the provisions of which were implemented here by the Oil Pollution of the Sea Act, 1956.  The Convention prohibits discharge of oil or oily mixtures in certain zones including the seas around this country.  Unfortunately many countries with substantial tanker fleets have not yet accepted the Convention and we have no means of preventing their ships from discharging oil outside our territorial waters.  Success in preventing oil pollution depends on international co-operation and we in this country are playing our part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister appointed any inspector to inquire into this menace in Cork Harbour and on the south coast generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made the necessary inquiries.  We have been told, as I have said, that it is not due to any discharges of oil from tankers that otherwise should use the facilities of Whitegate Oil Refinery.  I should tell the Deputy that unfortunately we have information that oil can be discharged 300 to 400 miles from the coast and still affect the coast with pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to appoint an inspector.  We have sufficient staff to make these inquiries and we are satisfied from the information received from Cork that that is the case.  If the Deputy has any further information about the matter which casts doubt on the statement I have made, I shall be very glad to have it from him because we have a certain amount of control at least in regard to oily discharges which take place from tankers which are within our supervision.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government has provided valuable facilities and incentives to encourage the establishment and development of industries and it is for private enterprise to take advantage of these facilities.  The Deputy may take it that any sound proposals that may be formulated by local or other interests for the establishment of industries in Mountmellick would be sympathetically considered.  Mountmellick is included in a list prepared in my Department of localities seeking to attract industries and, as opportunity arises, this list is supplied to industrial promoters enquiring about possible locations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department's circular letters Nos. H 6/53 and H 13/56, which were issued to urban housing authorities, set out the bases on which schemes are normally prepared for the sale to tenants of houses provided under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  Under the terms of the circulars, sale prices are generally related to the amount of loan outstanding in respect of the houses or, depending on the age of the houses, to a multiple of the current rents.  I shall have copies of the circulars forwarded to the Deputy for his information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation by county councils of purchase schemes for labourers' <Col N="906" /> cottages is governed by the Labourers Act, 1936.  Cottages are purchased by terminable annuity related to a percentage of current rents.  Costs incidental to the preparation of the schemes fall on the housing authority who also bear any expenses arising from their statutory obligation to put cottages into repair before vesting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the application of these conditions makes it practically impossible for tenants of these houses to purchase their houses?  Would he, having regard to this fact, bring in some adjustment of the conditions to make it possible for such tenants to purchase their houses?  As the Minister will agree, these tenant purchase schemes are of interest only to people living in houses built for a considerable number of years and they do, therefore, make it impossible for tenants not living in houses for the last 20 years to take advantage of such very desirable schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands what is the average time which elapses between the date when the purchase price is fixed in the case of compulsory acquisition by the Land Commission and the date upon which the Land Bonds representing the price are actually transferred to the person entitled to receive the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In compulsory acquisitions under the Land Acts the payment of purchase money arises from the &ldquo;Appointed Day&rdquo; which is normally the date possession of the land is obtained by the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>From the &ldquo;Appointed Day&rdquo; to the date of payment instructions to the bankers, the average time-lag in recent cases has been about 27 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that the average of 27 months indicates undue delay?  If he does agree with me that it does suggest undue delay, would it be right to say that the delay is largely resultant, on the investigation of title?  If that is so, would the Minister consider employing outside help in this matter of investigation of title or, in the alternative, adopting a system commonly operated in the United States of insuring against title defects and thus expediting the issue of the Land Bonds?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the delay is appalling but I should like to point <Col N="910" /> out that of the 27 months, so far as I can judge, only two months would be attributable to Land Commission delay.  The greater portion of the delay arises from owners and their solicitors not expediting proof of title.

The reserve of land available for planting is virtually exhausted at these forests and there is also a fall in the volume of general management and maintenance work to be undertaken there.  In the case of Cahir forest, where 10 men were laid off, it is hoped that it will be possible to provide employment for up to 6 of the men at a new area acquired at Shanbally, which is attached to Clogbeen forest.

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1960&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the provisions of the Finance Bill were so long and complex that I took what was then the unusual <Col N="915" /> step in the case of a Finance Bill of circulating an explanatory memorandum with the text of the Bill.  This year's Bill has neither the length nor the complexity of last year's but I repeated the procedure of issuing an explanatory memorandum as it might be of assistance to Deputies in considering the Bill.</P>
    <P>In view of the issue of the explanatory memorandum it is hardly necessary for me now to give a section by section account of the Bill.  It may help, however, if I mention briefly the principal matters with which the several parts of the Bill are concerned.</P>
    <P>Part I imposes Income Tax and Sur-tax for the current year at last year's rates.  The Finance (No. 2) Act, 1959, which is referred to in Section 1 of the Bill, made, as Deputies will remember, alterations in the personal allowances and reliefs for this year in order to pave the way for the introduction of Pay As You Earn.  The present Bill increases the income tax and sur-tax deduction for children and broadens the tax exemption in respect of deposit interest in the case of a husband and wife.</P>
    <P>Provisions benefiting industry are also included.  There are additional reliefs for business losses and the tax advantages flowing from Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, are being extended to securities of Irish manufacturing companies issued before 1932.  Profits of harbour authorities are being exempted from tax.</P>
    <P>Only Sections 8 and 9 were not foreshadowed in the Budget speech.  The purport of these sections has, of course, been given in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill is mainly concerned with the proposals in the Budget speech in relation to customs and excise duties.  The sections in it provide for the various reliefs relating to entertainments duty, table waters duty, and hydrocarbon oils; abolish tobacco dealers' licences; amend the law relating to liquor licences and hydrocarbon oils for the purpose of providing more efficient, equitable and <Col N="916" /> economic administrative procedures; and increase the duties on tobacco.</P>
    <P>This Part of the Bill also contains a section concerned with rather detailed points of motor taxation law as already set out in the explanatory memorandum.  I should, perhaps, mention that these points came to a head too late to have them included in the recent Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) (Amendment) Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>Four orders relating to special import levies and miscellaneous customs and excise duties are confirmed in the final section in this Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The effect of Part III is to raise the exemption limit for death duties from £2,000 to £5,000.</P>
    <P>Part IV brings within the scope of &ldquo;exports&rdquo; relief Irish-made goods exported by a company other than their manufacturer.  The terminal date for &ldquo;exports&rdquo; relief will now be the year 1974-75 and a five year period of tapering relief will follow the exemption period.  Safeguards are included to prevent unfair advantage being taken of these reliefs.</P>
    <P>There are provisions, in Parts IV and VI, designed to encourage the expansion of the tourist industry.  Holiday camps will be treated in the same way as hotels as regards tax allowances in respect of capital expenditure. In the case of expenditure incurred on or after the 1st January, 1960, the annual allowance will be 10 per cent. instead of 2 per cent.  Such expenditure will of course also qualify for the 10 per cent. initial allowance so that, in the normal case, it will be written off for tax purposes over nine years.</P>
    <P>Part IV also provides that profits from the mining of gypsum will qualify for the tax relief applicable to profits from coal-mining.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill abolishes the stamp duty on passports and on special forms of bank draft to be used by employers in remitting income tax under Pay As You Earn.  It also authorises the use of adhesive stamps instead of impressed stamps on copies of documents issued by district probate registries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> Part VI of the Bill deals with miscellaneous matters.  It contains the usual section relating to the Capital Services Redemption Account; subject to conditions set out in Section 38, it makes certain tax reliefs available where a person was adopted informally and it extends the scope of the tax relief provided in 1956 for mines of non-bedded minerals.  There is also a section in it relating to tax relief in respect of expenditure on the construction or extension of hotels and holiday camps.  I mentioned this already in commenting on Part IV.</P>
    <P>That, very briefly, is the scope of this year's Bill.  Debate on the Finance Bill is mainly a matter for Committee Stage and I shall be glad to deal with any points of detail on that Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has circulated the explanatory memorandum in relation to this Bill.  Having said that, I am afraid it is the only thing I can say that is good about the Bill.  This Bill is the implementation of the collection of the largest blister that has ever been imposed on the taxpayers.  It provides the basis upon which £105 million tax revenue is being collected, not to mention the £6 million of motor vehicle duties or the £24 million of non-tax revenue.  It is significant that this Bill provides the basis upon which £105 million of tax revenue is being collected, a figure which is to be compared with £94,500,000 in the year 1956-57 before the Minister took office.  That is giving him credit for special import levies as being a current tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The size of the bill must appal all of us.  We have, however, discussed generally the appalling amount that is being extracted from the pockets of taxpayers to a large extent on the Budget debate and I do not propose to deal with it any further today.  On the general matter, it is disgraceful that the Minister made no effort, either in winding up the Budget debate or today, to advert to one matter of taxation which, as Minister for Finance, he certainly should have brought to the notice of the Dáil.  When he was winding <Col N="918" /> up the Budget debate, he was much more interested in making a Party political speech than in dealing with the sober matters with which he should have dealt as Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The country is entitled to an answer to the question I put to the Minister in the Budget debate.  The people are entitled to expect that if he did not give it then, he would have given it today moving the Second Reading of this Bill.  That question was: what has happened to the Commission on Income Tax that was set up by me before I left office?  On a previous occasion, I indicated in the House that it was deplorable that we had heard nothing from that Commission in relation to the general imposition and incidence of income tax.  Some time later, I heard a rumour that the members of that Commission thought I had been unfair in castigating them for not having addressed themselves to that problem.  If they did address themselves to it and if there is castigation due, it is due to the Minister for Finance if he received a report from them and did not give it to the Dáil or to the country.</P>
    <P>A month ago, I asked the Minister for Finance a specific question: had he received any further report from the Commission on Income Tax.  I got no answer then.  We were entitled to an answer today.  It should not have to be extracted like teeth from the Minister for Finance and we should not be in the position that in relation to a most important commission on taxation queries have to be addressed to him on it without his volunteering information.</P>
    <P>What has happened in relation to the Income Tax Commission?  They gave us two interim reports.  In neither of these interim reports did they give any indication that they had considered the broad general aspect of income tax. Have they given any other report to the Minister?  Have they given any indication to the Minister that they have been considering this problem and if they have, why has the Minister not told the Dáil about it when introducing his Budget, in the first place, when concluding the Budget <Col N="919" /> debate, in the second place, or on the occasion of this Bill, in the third place? The country is entitled to an answer to these questions.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also be part of the basis, together with the Bill of last autumn, on which P.A.Y.E. will be enforced.  I do not think anybody yet realises the amount of trouble and cost to which employers will be put by being made unpaid tax gatherers. I am sure nobody realised that when the Bill was going through the House last autumn but since then, employers have had to get to grips with the situation. They have had to prepare the system to be put into operation and see exactly what will be needed under it.</P>
    <P>It is becoming more and more apparent every day to those concerned that the cost of collection of tax under the P.A.Y.E. system will be quite a substantial burden on employers.  I agree it is better to have a P.A.Y.E. system but the Minister should have taken steps in this Finance Bill to offset the additional cost with which employers will be faced.  If he had done that, I would not complain about the cost that is being imposed; but he has not done that and employers are entitled, in my opinion, to some concession. They are entitled to receive some consideration for what will be a very troublesome undertaking.</P>
    <P>In describing it as a troublesome undertaking, I am not in any way minimising the manner in which the Revenue Commissioners have simplified P.A.Y.E. here as compared with the system operative on the other side of the Channel.  The Revenue Commissioners have done a good job in that regard, but, no matter how good a job they have done, a very substantial cost will nevertheless be imposed on every employer in this State and that cost should have been offset by a concession in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some of us when we saw the Estimates for Receipts and Expenditure published on the Saturday before the Budget were very surprised at the buoyancy of income tax revenue.  In the six weeks, or so, that have elapsed <Col N="920" /> since those Estimates were published, some of us have been given an opportunity of understanding and appreciating why there is this buoyancy.  In all my experience as a solicitor, I have never seen as many notices going out to employers in respect of employees' arrears of tax.  It is perfectly clear that one of the reasons for the buoyancy in income tax revenue this year is the stringent steps being taken to catch up with and to collect in this year arrears in existence so that there will come into collection in this year more income tax revenue.  If that is so, and it must be so judging by the number of notices I have seen, it means the Minister is anticipating something that might otherwise be there next year for, I hope, his successor.  By that time, with any luck, we shall have had a general election.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister&mdash;I shall come back to it more fully on Committee Stage&mdash;something about Section 9.  Section 9 seems to me a provision which gives quite extensive powers to the Revenue Commissioners.  It gives to the Revenue Commissioners power to roam into the personal and private affairs of every individual in the State. It would be bad enough if Section 9 were restricted to payments made in the course of trade or business, as is done in subsection (1), but in subsection (2), it specifies clearly &ldquo;everyone carrying on any activity&rdquo;.  What exactly that means, I do not know, but it seems to me that anybody doing anything at any time in any place comes within the scope of the subsection.</P>
    <P>For instance, a person who gives 2d. to a newspaper boy or something to a person in a bookmaker's office for the purpose of a wager, shall we say, can be asked to go back over the year and make a return of all the payments made in that activity.  I do not go into a bookmaker's office very often.  I do not even deal with him much on the telephone.  But there are some Deputies, and some people outside this House, who will find the position very difficult.  There are many activities I carry on which I shall find it very difficult to remember at the end of the year.  I shall find it very <Col N="921" /> difficult, therefore, to make up all the payments I made during the year in order to make out a schedule and deliver that schedule to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (6) then, if I do not remember all the payments I made in any activity, I shall be liable to a penalty of £20, and that is a continuing penalty; it will be £20 for every day in relation to which I am not able to jog my memory.  Mark you, the court cannot reduce this penalty of £20.  It is the Revenue Commissioners who will determine whether or not it should be mitigated.  I could understand a penalty like that where a district justice or a circuit court judge would have the right to determine whether or not I was <i>bona fide</i> in failing to remember. If a judge so decided, quite obviously, on the evidence, it would be shown that I was trying to hide something and, in those circumstances, I would have no objection to a penalty being imposed on me, but, under this section, the judge has no option whatsoever.  If I am asked to whom did I make any payment last October and I say I cannot remember, automatically, under this section, I am liable to a penalty of £20 for forgetting, and £20 for every day I go on forgetting.</P>

      <P>If I may add one final word: I suppose if I cannot remember what I paid, the Minister for Finance, or the Revenue Commissioners, can come along and put me in jail for failing to remember. <Col N="922" /> Revenue officials are sensible men for the most part and they deal with matters in a sensible way as between the State and the taxpayer.  But one will get the one per cent. who act wrongly&mdash;not wrongly in the sense of being dishonest, but wrongly in the sense of being outrageously officious. I have come across them.  I am sure the Minister will concede that a revenue official, no matter how bad-humoured he may be, is likely to be less outrageously officious towards me than towards anybody else, but I have come across the officious official.  This section gives that type of official&mdash;the one per cent., perhaps less than one per cent. even&mdash;powers that we cannot allow him.</P>
      <P>In relation to employers being made tax gatherers under P.A.Y.E., I might add one further word.  There are some members of this House who are employers who will be collecting P.A.Y.E., and if they look up the memorandum circulated to them yesterday, they will see that, under an old Act passed in the twelfth year of the reign of Richard II, any member of this House who is a tax collector is automatically disqualified from membership of the House. Therefore, if we are tax collectors under P.A.Y.E., under that Act, we are automatically disqualified unless the Minister or his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, can amend that old, outdated section before P.A.Y.E. comes into operation.</P>

      <P>That is how the memorandum circulated yesterday reads, if Deputy Booth has done his homework since yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also well that we should realise that Section 22 of this Bill is the section which confirms the levies announced by the Minister on Budget Day and the protective duties he has substituted for levies in certain circumstances. As I said before, the rose by any other name ....  What does <Col N="923" /> that mean?  It means that in this calendar year, 1960-61, more than three years after the Minister acceded to office&mdash;and he acceded to office because he and his cohorts had led the people, particularly the shopkeepers, to believe that if Fianna Fáil became the Government, they would abolish the levies that had been imposed in 1956 solely for balance of payments purposes&mdash;the Minister this year will collect £1,120,000 from levies directly and £1,855,000 from customs duties he had imposed as an alias for levies prior to the end of the last financial year, that is to say, a total of just £3,000,000, and an additional sum for the further protective customs duties now being imposed in Section 22 changing the levies.  I have not got an estimate of what that amount is. It may be £500,000.  If I am wrong in that, the Minister will probably be very quick to correct me.  But on that basis it looks that it might be £500,000.</P>
    <P>Here is a Fianna Fáil Minister, three years after he came into office, collecting £3,500,000 in levies and quasi-levies when he was complaining bitterly in 1956-57 about the collection of £4,275,000 and giving the impression all round the place that if only Fianna Fáil got into power, they would wipe them out and that the people would be free of them.  The sincerity of the promises they made in that general election can be seen quite simply without any further comment.</P>
    <P>I am glad of one thing in this Finance Bill: that the Minister has now abandoned the totally impossible position he took up in 1957.  In 1957, he extended the provisions of the Finance Act, 1956, so as to give the benefits of the 1932 Act to certain further industrial undertakings.  At that time he was pressed very strongly by us that if he was going back to 1932, he should go back to the inception of the State.  He was told then, and justifiably told, that going back to 1932 alone was turning revenue collection into Party political collection.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the pressure put on him at that time from this side of the House, he refused to yield.  I am glad <Col N="924" /> he has yielded now and has undone the injustice he did three years ago. It does not matter to me whether he has done it because of remorse of conscience or because of the suggestions put up to him by the Associated Chambers of Commerce.  For whatever reason it was done, it is a good thing and it is desirable that this benefit should be for all industries started since the inception of the State and not only for those started since Fianna Fáil came in.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said himself, most of the other sections in this Bill are matters we can discuss more clearly, and, perhaps, with greater advantage, on Committee Stage. Inevitably, any Finance Bill is one that is an accumulation of different ideas rather than the implementation of a pattern as a whole, even though, of course, it does implement the Budget, but certainly in relation to this Bill in particular, a Committee Stage discussion would be more satisfactory for all concerned on this side and also, I believe, for the Minister.  For that reason, on this Second Stage, I do not propose to say anything further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to one specific matter raised here in the course of the Pensions (Increase) Bill and which I believe the Minister should consider sympathetically, that is, increasing the income limit in respect of income tax relief for persons over 65 years of age from £600 to £800 per year.  During the last year or so, and more particularly in recent months, a number of measures have been brought before the House which granted increases in pay and emoluments to different categories of public servants and officials, including not only members of the judiciary, the Dáil, the Seanad and the Government but civil servants, the Garda and the Army.  In all these cases, the basis on which increased emoluments were granted, either salaries or wages, was the fact that the cost of living had increased over a number of years, so that in order to compensate for the increase in the cost of living, an increase in salaries, and in certain cases salaries and emoluments, was justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> The position in respect of persons over the age of 65 is that the present income limit is £600 a year. Last year, the qualifying income limit in respect of persons entitled to join the health service was raised from £600 to £800 a year.  So that no matter from what angle the maximum income limit is examined, it has been recognised that in relation to salaries and emoluments, the income limit should be increased. In the case of the increase which was sanctioned in respect of those entitled to corns within the health service, by raising the limit from £600 to £800 a year, it has been recognised that that increase was warranted because of the increase in wages and salaries, but there is this one specific case in which no increase has been granted.</P>
    <P>For some years, people in a similar position in Britain have had the limit for income tax relief increased from £600 to £800.  It is hardly necessary to re-argue the case or to re-emphasise the justification for this increase but the fact that the cost of living has increased for those who draw wages and salaries means that it has also increased for those who are retired.  Whether a person is retired on a pension, either from the State or any other source; whether a person is living on an income from investments, or whatever the source, the fact is that the present income limit is too low.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister, if he examines this, will be sympathetic in regard to the position of these people. When I say over 65, many of them are even much older than that.  They go from that upwards.  It is natural that in many cases people who reach that age, if they are not living with their families, require domestic help or assistance of some sort.  At present they are precluded from participating in any of the benefits of the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme.  Others are not entitled to the health benefits which people in a lower income group are entitled to and consequently their position in many cases is peculiarly difficult. I would urge on the Minister the desirability of considering their special position and embodying a change which will enable them to have their <Col N="926" /> income tax relief assessed on the basis of £800 rather than £600 a year.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would give some information to the House with regard to the change in the method of control over the export of currency. Since the abolition of the exchange control section, I understand that it is now a matter for applicants for foreign currency to go to the banks and the banks can, on their own satisfaction, issue the foreign currency and the means of getting it up to a certain maximum.  I understand that the maximum is £5,000.  I should like to ask the Minister if he can state what happens when it reaches that stage.  Do the banks have to make a specific kind of case and what are the regulations or where can they be ascertained?</P>
      <P>I should like also to point out to him that there are rumours at the moment that in certain cases representations are made by members of either House of the Oireachtas.  I understand that on one matter earlier, the Opposition said: &ldquo;If you want to be dirty, we will be dirty.&rdquo;  Information has come to my ears that there is to be a suggestion that in a particular case representations were made by members of this Party in the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to deal with a few points on this Finance Bill. I wonder would the Minister consider making some concessions to the owners of private and commercial vehicles who tax their cars or lorries, as the case may be, quarterly.  Under recent legislation, taxation of certain types of commercial vehicles was very substantially increased.  It would be a welcome concession to the owners concerned, who are mainly public hauliers in a very small way of business&mdash;a very hard-working section of the community&mdash;if they could pay their quarterly tax as nearly as possible, <i>pro rata</i> to the annual tax of these vehicles.</P>
      <P>I should like to advance the same argument in regard to the owners of private motor cars, which as everybody is aware, show a very substantial increase in numbers, particularly since the war.  A number of these owners, for financial reasons, cannot tax their cars annually and it would be a welcome concession if the Minister could meet them in some regard.  As the Minister knows, taxing a car by four quarterly payments involves a sum considerably in excess of the figure for one annual taxation payment.</P>
      <P>I should also like to deal with some points under the heading of mining. There are two matters, both of which I referred to on the Budget.  Under present legislation, a different allowance is made in the case of mining operations which are termed underground operations.  The same concession does not apply in the case of mines where the operations are known as open-cast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, over the <Col N="928" /> past ten or 12 years, there has been a considerable expansion in mining interests.  A new lease of life has been given to many mining properties which had been closed down, in some cases, for 70 or 80 years.  I would urge the Minister, having regard to the fact that both types of operations take place in different mines throughout the country, to bring in legislation to provide the same allowance in the case of open-cast mines as now applies to underground operations.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I should like to welcome the concession the Minister is giving in relation to taxation on products of mines exported from the country in order to encourage the expansion of interest in mining operation, which as the Minister is aware, is a very hazardous business and which is completely dependent on circumstances outside the control of the operators in this country.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that the products of mines, such as bedded ores which have been subjected to treatment in some form in this country, should be entitled to the same tax free concessions as manufactured goods exported from the country.  In other words, they should enjoy the same 10 years' tax free concession which is eventually reduced over the following five years.  The arrangement at the moment is that in the first four years, they are 100 per cent. tax free and for four years, 50 per cent.  I think that adjustment would be a great encouragement to the full expansion of mining operations here.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister for increasing the exemption on the value of estates subject to death duties from £2,500 to £5,000.  I should like to repeat my old plea in my Budget speech&mdash;and it is a plea that was made by other Deputies&mdash;that the Minister should take his courage in his hands and abolish death duties altogether.  It would be a tremendous step in the right direction, and it would, undoubtedly, lead to a big number of people with means settling here, and leaving their estates here for disposal among their heirs.  It would be one practical way of bringing a considerable amount of capital <Col N="929" /> to the country, which would result in development within the country.</P>
    <P>I should like also to repeat the plea I have made in this House each year since I came into it, and ask the Minister to increase the excess profits tax exemption rate from the present figure of £2,500.  I make this appeal particularly in the interests of the small businesses, of which there are a big number in the country, mainly family businesses.  The rate should be limited to what I understand it was about 10 or 12 years ago, £10,000. That would not be an extravagant proposal at this stage.  The difference in revenue would be considerable, having regard to the amount of benefit that would accrue, particularly to the small interests and industries which find it extremely hard to accumulate capital at the present time.  The Minister has said, on more than one occasion, that if industry and business generally is to be expanded, it will necessitate the ploughing back of profits into these enterprises.  I suggest to the Minister that one way of ploughing back those profits is to enable the owners to make profits, and give them an opportunity to accumulate the requisite capital to expand their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing legislation, stamp duty of two per cent. is payable on transfer of property, irrespective of the size of the property.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that this is a severe hardship, particularly on a person who wants to purchase a house which is, perhaps, being built under a Small Dwellings Act loan.  If there is a mortgage outstanding of £1,200 or £1,500, in existing circumstances, the purchaser of that property must pay the price which he gives the owner for the goodwill of <Col N="931" /> the property&mdash;say, £250 or £300&mdash;and he must add on the value of the mortgage outstanding and pay two per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can correct me or Deputy O'Malley in his reply.  I suggest that is a matter the Minister might adjust somewhat on the lines of what has been done in England, and bring in a figure below which stamp duty will not apply.  That would be particularly helpful to purchasers of properties of quite small value.  The exemption figure, I understand, is £3,500, and if a similar figure were decided on in this country it would mitigate quite an amount of hardship.  There are enough hardships in the transfer of property.  I suggest to the Minister that he might forgo his pound of flesh to a value of £3,000 or £3,500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>There is one point with which I wish to deal and I do not know whether it will be considered to be a Committee Stage point or otherwise&mdash;I shall make it, anyway.  I am referring to a specific case in Shannon Airport.  If a passenger, for the sake of argument, who lands at Shannon from the United States, and intends to go on to Europe, wishes to make a purchase in the duty-free shop and pick it up on his return from Europe, he is not allowed to do so, due to some technicality which exists somewhere along the line between the Revenue Commissioners and those responsible for the collection of duty in the duty-free zone of the Airport. Some thousands of dollars worth of business&mdash;and that is a conservative figure&mdash;are lost annually as a result of the failure of the Revenue section <Col N="932" /> of the Department to rectify this position. It should surely be possible for people proceeding to Europe and who do not wish to hawk the goods round Europe with them to leave these goods in bond, so to speak.  That is the first point.</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to make deals with the same matter.  If a person flies from Shannon via Dublin to London, he cannot make a purchase. They will not sell one article in the shop in the customs-free zone.  That is not the way to attract business and I think the position should be rectified immediately.  It has caused a deal of comment.</P>

      <P>I should be very sorry indeed&mdash;Deputy Sweetman accused me of being silent on the matter&mdash;if through my silence, the Commission on Income Tax should be accused of not doing their work.  I can assure the House that they have been working very hard.  They have already produced three reports, two of which have been published.  One of them is being implemented.  The Report on P.A.Y.E. was a fairly comprehensive document.  They put a good deal of thought into it and it took a good deal of time.  That, as Deputies know, we have adopted. They then produced a second report which is being published concerning Schedule A tax and also the consolidation of income tax and sur-tax collection.  I have not come to any conclusion on that and, consequently, I made no recommendation to the Government on these two points, although I think I mentioned here before this year that the Revenue Commissioners have been moving in the direction of taking sur-tax and income tax together.  I know it will come some time.  When it will come I cannot say at this moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third report is, of course, the big matter, that is, whether income tax can be replaced by some other form of tax.  They have presented that report, but only within the past few days.  It is a very comprehensive <Col N="933" /> report.  I could not possibly give any opinion on it for a long time.  I intend recommending its publication to the Government as soon as possible so that everybody can see it.  That proves that the Commission have been working hard.  I think we should be thankful to them for the time they have given to the matter.  I know that everybody here will give very earnest consideration to the recommendations they make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point raised by Deputy Sweetman was that this Bill would, to some extent at any rate, be invoked along with the Finance (No. 2) Bill of 1959 in bringing P.A.Y.E. into operation.  I suppose the Deputy made that point for the purpose of bringing himself into order. Again, I appreciate what employers are doing under P.A.Y.E.  They were very helpful in this matter as I mentioned here during the Budget debate.  The trade unions and so on have also been very helpful in trying to get P.A.Y.E. to run as smoothly as possible.</P>
      <P>Some employers, however&mdash;as was mentioned in the report, I think&mdash;expressed the opinion that they did not want to be paid or rewarded for their services in this matter because they did not want to be considered as tax gatherers for the Government and that, consequently, on the whole they would prefer to do this duty without being paid.  I do not say they are all of that opinion but some are.  As the report points out, the financial expense on the employers, when the thing is running, is not very big.  The experience in England, together with the investigations that were made here by this Commission, led them to believe that the cost would be 10/- or 15/- per employee per year.  We must also remember that that cost will be taken into account in paying their taxes.  That takes 40 per cent. off that and leaves a very small cost on the employer in running this service.</P>

      <P>I suppose a very small employer would have to do it himself for some time, until it was running smoothly.  With regard to Section 9, I think the Deputy is not correct in some of the statements he made because it applies, of course, only to a person carrying on a trade or business. If a person sends the office boy to put a bet on a horse, that would hardly be connected with his trade or business.  I do not think it would be a matter the Revenue Commissioners would have to be told about.</P>

      <P>It is principally designed, I may say, to cover the cases where people are drawing remuneration but are not regarded as employees.  That is the whole point in the section.  Some do not make returns of all payments of that kind.  There seems to be some legal justification for the omission.  It is in order to remove any doubts in that respect that this clause is put in. A person who is an agent for a company might be paid on a fee basis and not be an employee.  Therefore, returns might not have to be made in his case. <Col N="935" /> It is a clause that will have to be discussed more fully when we come to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the position of the person over 65 years. As Deputies are aware, better treatment was given to people over 65 years who were living on unearned income.  I think it came in, first of all, in 1951.  The sum of £600 is regarded as earned income.  Until you consider this matter calmly and impersonally, we must take the person with £600 a year unearned income and see how he compares with a person with £600 earned income.  Six hundred pounds unearned income must come from investment of some sort. Generally it comes from investment of some sort.  It would mean a capital value of £10,000.  You could hardly regard the old person with £10,000 as being very badly off and I think, generally speaking, he would not be regarded as worse off than the pensioner with, say, £10 or £12 per week.</P>
      <P>Looking at it from that point of view, one would, I think, come to the conclusion that there was no great case for making an increase.  Representations have been made to me before now on the same lines as those made by Deputy Cosgrave that this might be raised to £800.  I suppose that might be considered again&mdash;that is all I can say at this stage&mdash;but not this year.</P>
      <P>At present and for some time back there is no limit on the amount that may be granted under the Exchange Control Regulations.  Banks are permitted to give money on request if it is required for the purchase of goods for this country.  If the goods are for re-export the question of added value comes into operation.  General directions are laid down for the banks and the banks act within these directions.</P>
      <P>Regulations and notices are sent to the banks from time to time.  Anybody going to a bank can have a look at them and find out for himself what these control regulations are.  As far as the specific question is concerned, I can assure the Deputy that nobody made any representations to me with regard to the purchase of stamps for this country.</P>

      <Col N="936" /> Deputy Russell spoke about mining. He gave the impression that the owners of mines are not as well treated as other sections of the trading community. I think he said he thought they should be put on the same basis&mdash;in regard, I suppose, to financial advantage&mdash;as exporters.  The legislation dealing with coal-mining and mining generally is a different code from export legislation.  On the whole, I think the mining people have been treated well.  There is no question of export in their case.  If they are exporting they get the export facilities. If they are not exporting they get advantages in regard to tax that no other trader gets.  On the whole, I think the benefits given to miners have been fairly generous.  We are bringing in two new activities that we were not benefiting before&mdash;one is gypsum and the other is anhydrite. That is the only change as far as this Finance Bill is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had in mind making a differentiation between, say, raw ores treated as against those sent out untreated. In other words, I wanted to encourage the treatment of ores mined in this country rather than to send them out in the raw state.  I wanted to take the process of manufacture a stage further here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there are proposals for the treatment of some of our ores here.  If they should materialise, probably a proposition of that kind will be put up and we can consider it when that time comes.  Deputy Russell went on to say that we should abolish death duties.  We would all agree with that if we could afford it.  If a Minister for Finance has £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 or whatever it may be that he is prepared to offer by way of concession he must decide where to apply it.  There are so many things that are attractive to deal with&mdash;income tax, surtax, death duties.  We usually end up by trying to do a little for all of them.  We find it very hard to abolish the one or the other completely.  I agree it is not a desirable tax in these times when we talk about personal saving, and so on.  It would be a great thing if we could abolish it but we cannot afford to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> The other point the Deputy made is one which has been made on many occasions.  He urged that we should raise the exemption limit for corporation profits tax.  In the past, it went up and down over fairly wide ranges. For many years now the limit has been about £2,000.  As far as I remember the tax is lower now&mdash;it is only 10 per cent.&mdash;than it was when the exemption limit was higher.</P>
    <P>If you compare how the corporation and the private individual are treated you will see that the corporation is in a favourable position.  Take a private trader who pays income tax and surtax. If you compare his case with that of the corporation you will find that the corporation is not any worse treated. If the profits are very high the corporation is treated better than the individual trader.  From that point of view, I do not think one can make a very good case for raising the exemption limit.</P>
    <P>I must confess I am not very familiar with the matter of stamp duty on transferred properties.  I can only promise to look at it again and see whether it would be possible to do something about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter I want to raise has reference to the facilities provided for passengers at Dún Laoghaire.  When I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce, I think that in 1949 or 1950 <Col N="938" /> Bord Fáilte, the Office of Public Works and Dún Laoghaire Corporation began improvements to provide better amenities for passengers using the pier.  Since then very considerable improvements have been effected but despite that they have not on occasion prevented unfortunate stoppages and delays in clearing passengers who wish to travel from Dún Laoghaire to Holy-head. While, as I say, there have been improvements I have always had the impression, and I think so have a number of others, that British Railways have not been sufficiently co-operative in this matter.  It is true that the traffic is confined to a short period of the year and that the peak periods are experienced within that relatively short season, but it is unfortunate that some of the delays and overcrowding have been allowed to arise, more especially as the company concerned, having experience which goes back over a long number of years, must be in a position to estimate when a likely increase in traffic is to be expected.</P>
      <P>I notice from the Minister's statement that it is proposed to have further discussions in the near future with the chairman of the particular section in Britain dealing with this matter, and as a result of these discussions I hope it will be possible to eliminate, or at least lessen, the congestion which has occurred and which, indeed, occurred again quite recently.  One of the unfortunate features of this matter is the fact that there is an impression abroad that there is something wrong in Dún Laoghaire itself whereas the contrary is the case.  Whatever may have been true in that regard up to the time I mentioned, when improvements were carried out, the facilities now existing in Dún Laoghaire are good, but because of the inability to cater for the number of passengers who offer themselves at Dún Laoghaire on occasion, an impression is created that in some way or another those responsible at Dún Laoghaire are not dealing efficiently with the matter.  As I say, the contrary is the case and the facilities provided are adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people concerned are fully aware of the need for providing such further facilities as may be necessary <Col N="939" /> and the Corporation, the Board of Works and Bord Fáilte have taken the necessary measures, energetically and actively over a long time, to provide them.  It is, therefore, important, without trying to cause any friction or in any way to seek to apportion responsibility, that it should be clearly understood that the responsibility does not lie at this end, and in that connection I would be glad if the Minister would impress upon the Chairman of the Midland Area of the Board of British Railways Commission, as well as the authorities in British Railways, the importance from every angle of securing a satisfactory arrangement on this whole question.</P>
    <P>Quite recently there was a debate in the British House of Lords on the problem of car ferry service arrangements and I have no doubt that the Minister and his Department have adverted to the remarks made by Lord Ogmore in the course of that debate. He expressed the view that some of those responsible for the arrangements were not as co-operative as they might be, but I know from experience many years ago that Lord Ogmore is well disposed towards this country.  I believe his remarks were made in a friendly spirit and I think we should endeavour to secure the maximum cooperation possible with a view to providing a satisfactory car ferry service.</P>
    <P>I also notice in the Minister's statement that he has re-emphasised the fact that his Department and the Government are opposed to providing a subsidy for transport services.  I think that there would be general agreement with the view which he mentioned in connection with the implementation of the Transport Act of 1958&mdash;that it was generally approved by all Parties in this House.  However, it is significant that there appears to be one rule for surface transport and another rule for air transport, and if a subsidy is to be provided we surely have a particular obligation in respect of our own people.</P>
    <P>I mention this because there is very considerable anxiety amongst the users of the Dublin-Dún Laoghaire-Greystones <Col N="940" /> line at the proposed reduction of the services on that line and the possible threat to it.  Discussions have taken place between representatives of residents' groups and organisations in the area and the Company, and I want to urge on the Minister the desirability of entering into consultation with C.I.E. on this matter.  The area between Dublin and Dún Laoghaire is heavily, or rather, densely populated and has the peculiarity that no part of the population lies on the side of the railway line which is next to the sea, and consequently all the passengers come from the hinterland.  There is only one main thoroughfare, and if those who, at present, use the railway were obliged to travel by road, the congestion would be appalling and the burdens which would be thrown on the ratepayers of the area would be very considerable.</P>
    <P>In that area there are two main arteries.  One is the Dublin-Stillorgan-Bray Road which caters mainly for people going directly to or from Bray or the adjoining areas.  The other, the Dún Laoghaire-Dublin Road through Blackrock is the main thoroughfare from Dún Laoghaire to Dublin.  If passengers who at present use the railway line had to travel by road it would inevitably increase the already congested condition of that road.</P>
    <P>It is fair enough to suggest that transport should pay its way but, if that principle is to be applied, it should be applied universally and we should not be prepared to provide a subsidy for air travellers, many of whom are people from outside the country, and at the same time refuse to provide an adequate service for our own people who use surface transport.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. have engaged in a publicity campaign to attract traffic.  During discussions which a deputation from users of the Dublin-Dún Laoghaire-Greystones line had with C.I.E. the importance of further publicity to attract passengers to that line was stressed and I believe the company were impressed by the views expressed by the deputation. The Minister should consult with C.I.E. with a view to seeing if further <Col N="941" /> steps can be taken to safeguard the interests of the very large numbers of passengers served by this line.</P>
    <P>The last matter which I wish to mention is the position of C.I.E. pensioners. This matter has been discussed on previous occasions and the Minister and the House are fully acquainted with the very difficult circumstances in which many of these pensioners are expected to exist.  The present pensions are in many cases below subsistence level. The amount involved is not very considerable when the total sum is taken into account.  The peculiarly difficult position of these people warrants special consideration.  Some of them have pensions as low as 12/- a week, which is below anything that could be regarded as adequate to enable them to live properly.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister should discuss this matter again with the board of the company.  Over a period increases in pensions have been granted in this House to various categories of retired workers.  Those directly employed by the State, local authority employees, retired people drawn from many walks of life, have had their pensions increased.  It is unreasonable and unfair to expect persons who retired from the public transport undertaking to exist on a lower rate of pension than is considered the minimum on which other people are expected to exist or which is regarded as adequate in their cases.</P>
    <P>The charge would be a diminishing charge because it applies in particular to pensioners who because of their emoluments and service have low pensions. The problem is not likely to recur.  For that reason these people have a special claim to the sympathetic consideration of the company.  The Minister has a responsibility to see that the company consider the matter so that justice may be done to these aged pensioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be commended for the comprehensive report on the activities of his Department and the many bodies associated with it which he has given us in introducing the Estimate.  The creation of two Departments from the original <Col N="942" /> Department of Industry and Commerce was a practical step and, knowing the Minister as I do, I have no doubt that the change will bring beneficial results.</P>
      <P>The Electricity Supply Board is doing an excellent job.  The rural electrification scheme has caused a social revolution.  I should like, however, to refer to the special charge on consumers who are regarded by the E.S.B. as uneconomic.  The increased charge is usually in the form of an increase in ground rent or a lump sum. I appreciate the difficulties facing the E.S.B. in this matter arising from the fact that rural electrification is not paying for itself and because of the interest on the extra capital investment required in such cases but I should like if the E.S.B. could devise some other means of solving the problem. For example, could the E.S.B. give the supply on the normal terms if they got a guarantee from the consumer that he would use a minimum number of units per annum?</P>
      <P>I should like to ask with regard to the matter of uneconomic consumers whether there is a regulation covering the whole country whereby the E.S.B. decides that a potential consumer is economic or uneconomic or is it decided in relation to areas?  For example in Louth there is an area stretching from the sea west through my constituency where applications for supply are refused unless the applicant agrees to pay a fairly considerable increase in ground rent or a fairly large lump sum.  In a constituency such as mine which is relatively densely populated, the area I refer to could be regarded as rather sparsely populated, but in comparison with other areas in the country it would be relatively thickly populated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to support various Deputies who have asked the Minister <Col N="943" /> to consider getting an increase for the C.I.E. pensioners.  I wish to refer especially to pensioners from the old G.N.R.  The pension they got was particularly small even in comparison with the pensions received by C.I.E. personnel.  This Government is not responsible for that; so far as I know the Six-County Government at the time when both Governments controlled the G.N.R. system, for some reason refused to allow any increase in these pensions but the circumstances have now changed and the control of portion of the G.N.R. system has come to C.I.E. I feel that particular regard should be had to the cases I have mentioned.  A percentage increase would be of very little value because these pensions are so small.  I would ask the Minister to have the matter considered as a special case.</P>
    <P>It has also been brought to my notice that certain employees of the G.N.R. who subsequently became employees of C.I.E., and who, for some reason or another, were not in the Pension Fund could not get into it when they applied for permission to join and after lifelong service to the transport systems they are now out on very small pensions.  Perhaps they were not legally entitled to a pension but they are certainly morally entitled to it and I ask that their case be considered also.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the difficulties which faced C.I.E. employees in my constituency due to reorganisation and due to the closing of certain branch lines in the area and the closing of trans-Border lines.  Some large stations in my constituency were reduced in status with the result that some employees became redundant.  Depending on the type of work they were doing, some of them were offered employment in other areas or alternatively a lump sum.  In other cases they were simply transferred.  Some of them were transferred to Dublin; they were married men and they had the difficulties of keeping on a home and paying expenses to and from Dublin and expenses in Dublin and in <Col N="944" /> some cases they had to stay overnight in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider allowing these men, at least for the time being until they have adjusted themselves, to travel free?  I know they are travelling at somewhat less cost than the general public but because of the exceptional circumstances involved I feel these employees are entitled to free travel.  I know that when they signed their agreement with C.I.E. it included a provision that they could be transferred from one district to another but at that time it was most unusual for anybody to be transferred and, where it did arise, the person concerned was at least given an opportunity of providing himself with a home in the new area.  There is no need for me to tell the Minister that it is impossible for these people to get houses in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I noted that the Minister said he had consultations with the Chairman of British Railways.  A report made to me by people who travel to London indicates that conditions are anything but good, not only at the ports but on the trains.  The trains are most unsatisfactory in Britain from the point of view of there being no restaurant cars provided and so on.  I have already been in communication with the Minister on this matter and I hope that from his consultations with the Chairman of British Railways there will be an improvement.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note that a final decision on the application of Drogheda Harbour Commissioners for a State grant for the proposed Drogheda harbour scheme will be made when a number of points raised have been disposed of.  Drogheda port is a very busy port but we feel it could be still busier if the improvements were carried out.  We hope these improvements will add considerably to the prosperity of the town which has many attractions to offer industrialists.  The improvements will add considerably to these attractions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has finally succeeded in opening Greenore port for container traffic and I should like to express my thanks to him and the <Col N="945" /> Department for the help they gave us in furthering this project.  Practically all the container traffic arriving in Dublin and north of Dublin has been coming in through the port of Larne. We hope that most of this traffic will now come in through Greenore.  I would ask the Minister to consult with the Minister for Local Government with a view to having the Greenore-Newry, Greenore-Dundalk roads improved so that they will be able to carry the traffic which we now confidently expect.  I feel we can expect a new and prosperous era for this area which was sorely hit by the closing of the railway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the Minister's speech in connection with shipping and I note that we are within measurable distance of achieving the target of 200,000 tons of shipping set some years ago.  I wonder if this particular time when there is a worldwide slump in shipping is in fact the right time to pursue a policy of continuing to build ships.  I wonder if it would not be more economic and practical at present to hire some of the large amount of tonnage which is now out of commission or even to go a step further and purchase on favourable terms some of the ships now idle and which must have been built in recent years.  I am not competent to offer an opinion on the subject but perhaps the Minister in his reply might give his own good reasons for pursuing a policy laid down at a time when the shipping position was considerably more prosperous looking than it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The participation of Irish interests in cross-Channel shipping is a matter I have raised on more than one occasion in this House.  I do not want to reopen the whole of the discussion on a motion of mine discussed here some months ago but I had hoped that the Minister might give some indication in his Estimate speech as to what progress had been made in the negotiations which his predecessor&mdash;or rather the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass&mdash; mentioned about three years ago.  I hoped these negotiations would include <Col N="946" /> some method by which this country could participate in the cross-Channel trade between this country and Great Britain which carries a very large proportion of the £200,000,000 worth of goods that pass to and fro between the two countries.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister made reference in his speech to the inauguration of an air-car ferry service, which is a very welcome development.  I should like to see a number of vessel-car services in operation.  With our still almost empty country roads, there must be tremendous opportunities for the encouragement of the tourist who is prepared to bring his car over here to travel the length and breadth of our very beautiful and very hospitable country.  If there were a regular vessel-car service between the various ports in England and this country, in a very short time it would develop into a very good adjunct to our small shipping industry; I use the word &ldquo;small&rdquo; in relation to cross-Channel shipping.  Perhaps the Minister would let us have his views as to the potentialities of this development.</P>
    <P>A further development which I should like to see when current negotiations are concluded is a container service.  We rightly regard Great Britain as our main market for foodstuffs. One of the essentials of successful marketing is that the producer and the seller are able to deliver their goods promptly and cheaply to their customer.  An efficient container service on ships between this country and Great Britain would be a major development in expanding the market particularly for items like carcase meat, poultry, vegetables, and so on.</P>
    <P>I was interested to learn, as the Minister mentioned, that under the general heading of aviation this country, up to the end of last March, spent £14,500,000 on Collinstown and Shannon Airports and that the income accruing up to the same period was £7,000,000.  At first glance, this would appear to show a very substantial deficit of £7,500,000.  The Minister quite rightly pointed out that there was indirect, invisible income from the employment given at Shannon and <Col N="947" /> Dublin and that there was also the benefit to our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I should have liked the Minister to give more specific figures&mdash;it may not be possible to give exact figures&mdash;which would be very useful and illuminating in showing to the public that the outlay on aviation and the income accruing over the past 10 or 12 years are very largely, if not entirely, accounted for.  I hope that, if not in reply to this debate, perhaps at some future date, the Minister will be able to give statistics to cover that very substantial gap.  The country would like to be assured that it has in fact been substantially, if not entirely, filled by indirect receipts.</P>
    <P>With regard to Shannon Airport, the Minister's figure of 2,000 employed there is an indication of its value, particularly to the city of Limerick and also to the town of Ennis.  It was suggested, perhaps rather wildly, in the past that if anything should happen to Shannon to reduce drastically that employment or do away with it altogether, Limerick city would become a ghost town.  Even if that is not completely true, it would certainly have a disastrous effect on the city of Limerick which has benefited very largely from the developments at Shannon, both in aviation and in the industrial field.  I hope the present activities will continue to expand and prosper.  A wage bill of £1,000,000 in an area in the South west of Ireland is a very important source of income and the city of Limerick and the counties of Limerick and Clare are gratified that that amount of money is circulating in the area.</P>
    <P>About 12 or 18 months ago, in reply to a Question of mine, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, indicated that the maintenance of transatlantic aircraft was to be carried out at Dublin.  I protested at the time because I thought that Shannon was the obvious place for that work.  Now that we have a Minister specifically in charge of aviation, I wonder if the question of the maintenance work, particularly on the new jet aircraft and also on the older type of aircraft, might be reconsidered with a view to having the shops etc., erected <Col N="948" /> at Shannon Airport for the purpose of carrying out this work.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the inauguration of the new link between this country and Great Britain, namely, the Shannon-London service which has got off to a modest beginning but which, as the public come to know about it, will be used possibly to a greater extent.  I would suggest that the fare of £16. 10s. might be reviewed at the earliest possible date.  No doubt it compares favourably with the Shannon-Dublin-London fare, but for a new service of that type which we are anxious to develop, a very keen figure should be set.</P>
    <P>The rapid development of industry at Shannon reflects the greatest credit on those responsible for getting industries established there.  As a one-time critic of those concerned, I should like to pay a generous tribute to the efforts of Mr. O'Regan and his co-directors in the Shannon Industrial Development Company for the initiative they have shown in getting these new industries established.  It is somewhat discouraging to learn that out of the eight industries in production or nearing the point of production and 17 pending, only three Irish firms have shown any interest.  I appreciate that one of the objectives in having these industries set up was to encourage outside firms with the requisite technical know-how to come in and give the country the benefit of their knowledge.  If that be so, it would appear that that objective has been very largely realised.</P>
    <P>Still, I should like to see greater participation by Irish firms in this export effort and I feel sure that this will happen when the benefits are better known, possibly, than they are now.  I assume that credentials are carefully examined before any industrialists are allowed into Shannon. When a great number of new industries are established there are, of course, bound to be some failures. One cannot expect success all round.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, one would like to feel there was a certain permanence about the main body of industrial enterprises established at Shannon and, <Col N="949" /> from that point of view, I assume the credentials of those concerned and the permanence of their markets are carefully vetted before sites are allocated and before they secure the benefits given to those who establish industries in the free zone.  We are a rather conservative people and we are inclined to look upon new developments with a certain amount of distrust.  If the industries established there prosper they will have the effect of increasing industrialisation substantially far beyond what we visualise to-day.  That is why I want to be certain that the industrialists coming in there are reputable firms with established markets, markets which will continue irrespective of competition from elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have always looked upon Limerick City as coming within the scope of what is described as the Shannon development area.  It would be very desirable if the benefits applicable to industries established within the free zone could be extended to Limerick. As the crow flies, ten or twelve miles divide the two.  If that whole area were regarded as one development area, it would in time be of tremendous benefit to the whole of the south and west of Ireland.  Limerick City, Shannon Airport and the estuary should be regarded as one area and worthwhile industries established in Limerick City should enjoy the benefits applicable to industries established in the free zone at Shannon.  It may not be politic to extend these benefits generally to Limerick City but I think I am correct in saying that the Taoiseach, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, did indicate that, if any worthwhile industry were established in or near Limerick, he would give sympathetic consideration to extending to it the benefits which are now applicable to industries established at Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in the undeveloped areas.  It is a fact that, in <Col N="950" /> recent years, Limerick has not enjoyed the industrial expansion other areas have enjoyed.  One way of rectifying the position would be to allow any worthwhile, substantial industry established in Limerick to enjoy the benefits enjoyed in the Shannon free zone and in the undeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated his categorical opposition to the principle of State subsidy for C.I.E.  As a businessman, I echo his sentiment in that regard but, in our anxiety to ensure that C.I.E. pays its way, we should not overlook the fact that C.I.E., as a national transport undertaking, has an obligation to give an adequate service to the community.  I should not like to see C.I.E. paying its way at the expense of a necessary service to any section of the community.  It would be far better to accept the necessity for paying a limited subsidy rather than have C.I.E. pay its way and find ourselves faced with a serious complaint or grievance from any section of the community because of their not being properly looked after in relation to either freight or passenger services.</P>
      <P>The position of C.I.E. is somewhat analogous to the position of the aviation services.  On paper, C.I.E. may appear to have a very substantial deficit.  There are, of course, indirect sources of income which do not appear in its profit and loss account.  The workers, 20,000 of them, pay indirect taxation to the State.  Traders supply goods to C.I.E. and on their profits the State gets a certain amount of taxation.  That is not shown in the trading accounts of C.I.E.  In considering profit and loss, therefore, we should have regard to these indirect sources of revenue to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that at some future date we must visualise the situation in which present sources of energy in this country will have come to an end, and we may have to rely substantially, if not completely, on nuclear energy.  I should welcome some expansion by the Minister of that particular aspect because it is a very important matter from the point of view of the future of this country.  I should welcome some indication as to what steps the E.S.B. are taking in this matter.  Such <Col N="951" /> information would be of tremendous interest to the House and to the public generally.  I wonder what success attended the efforts of the E.S.B. some few years ago to harness wind for the production of electricity.  Furthermore, I should like to know from the Minister what success has attended the efforts to gasify turf.  If that were practicable, it would be one obvious method of cutting down on imports of coal while, at the same time, utilising one of our own natural resources of which we have an abundant supply at the moment.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister is the question of centralised heating in housing areas.  I do not mean central heating.  I mean centralised plants such as there are in the United States and in certain urban centres in England.  Heating in corporation and county council housing estates is one of the heaviest burdens cast on a working-class family.  If some scheme were evolved whereby these houses could be heated from a centralised plant that would be a tremendous advance as against the present method of heating each house individually.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to a matter of particular concern to the citizens of Limerick.  Some months ago the General Manager and the Assistant Manager of C.I.E. paid a visit to Limerick Corporation and listened to a number of criticisms advanced there of the services in the city.  I am sorry to say that the reply to those criticisms was most unsatisfactory and the Board have been asked to submit a further detailed reply to the complaints raised by the members of the City Council.  As the Minister is aware, Limerick participated in the general rise in fares which took place some months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Malley is finished, I can proceed.  The point I want to make is largely a point of policy.  The increased impost in the case of Limerick has been proportionately far greater than in a city the size of Dublin.  I should like to ask the Minister's aid in ensuring that the charges in Limerick would be at least comparable to those in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I want to make a brief reference to the question of summer tours by C.I.E.  The Board have shown a good deal of initiative in utilising the railway system for these tours, but I should like to suggest to the Minister to use his good offices to see that this system is extended to provide short-distance tours or day trips from centres such as Limerick.  Where you have these large centres of population it would be a paying proposition if 200 or 300 people could be taken short distances during the day at reasonable charges, particularly for families.  I think C.I.E. would find that their initiative would be well rewarded.</P>
      <P>In County Clare, which was referred to a few minutes ago, we have a unique railway system, the West-Clare Railway.  That could be made an outstanding tourist attraction.  I hope the Minister will prevail on the Board of C.I.E. to make more of it because it is unique and, at a time when there is talk of scrapping railways and having fewer railways, with proper publicity a small narrow-gauge railway like the West-Clare could become a great tourist attraction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only a few items to which I wish to draw attention.  First of all, like Deputy Faulkner, I should like to refer to rural electrification.  Deputy Faulkner's problems in his constituency seem to be similar to ours in Cork.  It is strange that, although the rural electrification programme will ultimately benefit the whole country, there is quite an amount of picking and choosing by the Board.  They tell us they are anxious to select the areas that show the best prospects of paying.  That may have been all right a few years ago but I imagine we have now reached the stage&mdash;and I think the Minister mentioned it in his statement &mdash;when all the financial plums have been picked by the Board and when we would expect them to be prepared to give electricity to the poorer areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Cork some parts of a parish were selected for rural electrification whereas other parts were omitted.  I think that is false economy and that ultimately, when rural electrification is extended to the parts now left without it, it will be provided at greater cost.  I would ask the Minister to re-examine the whole situation. Some years ago we were told that while this system had been in operation in County Cork it had not applied in other counties, that rural electrification in other counties was conducted <Col N="954" /> on the basis of whole areas rather than on a system of picking and choosing of different parts of different parishes.</P>
    <P>The other item to which I wish to refer concerns C.I.E.  We have heard the Minister refer to the rosy outlook and the hope that C.I.E. will become independent of subsidy.  I shall not repeat the comparison made by Deputy Cosgrave between the subsidy for the Air Companies and the subsidy for C.I.E.  I agree with what he said, and therefore I do not think I need repeat it.  However, it is strange that a State company, financed to such a large extent by the taxpayer, should have been so quick to increase fares recently when other concerns were prepared to carry their losses.  But when wage increases came, C.I.E. were very quick off the mark in increasing immediately bus and train fares.  That is an indication that C.I.E. are determined, in accordance with the Minister's wishes, to reduce the burden of subsidy by placing a greater burden on the general public through increased fares.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley was loud in his advice to members, but I wish to follow the line taken by Deputy Russell.  We are told by some people that certain problems are the day-to-day affairs of C.I.E.  Having directed the attention of C.I.E. to the matter of bus fares and not having got a reply, I take it that I, as a member of this House, am entitled to draw attention to the matter here.  Bus fares in rural areas are very high, but the great problem is that when C.I.E. are making these charges they do so on a certain mileage basis.  It seems that they set out the mileage for each journey and do not mind adding a mile or two.  That must be a headache for the people paying increased bus fares.  I have in mind for instance the Cork-Crosshaven journey. Official returns will show that Cork-Crosshaven is reckoned as 12 miles yet C.I.E. fix it at 14 miles.</P>
    <P>Again, in regard to the breaking up of the different stages of these journeys by C.I.E.&mdash;and I do not wish to be merely parochial about the matter&mdash; I am not satisfied with the way in which they reckon the mileage points <Col N="955" /> on different journeys.  I think it is unfair to the people as a whole.  It is all right for some members of this House, and for the Minister if he is so happy about a reduction in the subsidy, or its abolition, but increased bus fares are more of a burden on the ordinary working people than on anyone else.  If subsidies are to apply then, naturally, all sections must bear their share.  Where they are not in operation, it is to a large extent the unfortunate people who have no other system of transport to help them and who must depend on the public transport who will have to pay the higher fares.  It is a false principle to adopt here to say that we are all so anxious to see the day when C.I.E. can continue without these subsidies.</P>
    <P>I would particularly draw the Minister's attention to this problem of mileage charges with C.I.E., and the incorrect mileage, in my opinion, reckoned for many stages of journeys both in Cork county and elsewhere. If they can be checked on by the Minister, and not regarded as one of the so called day-to-day problems, or left to the hierarchy of C.I.E., we may be able to reduce, not to speak of increasing, the present charges.  Finally, apparently the Minister seems to be happy about C.I.E.'s policy in regard to closing down some of the railway lines.  It may sound very well to those who believe in the policy of saving at all costs and having no subsidies.  In many areas in West Cork the threat of closing lines is unfair.  In one area, the Bandon-Courtmacsherry area, a heavy tonnage of beet is grown every year and to a large extent the people are dependent on the railway for the cartage of beet from that area to the factory.  It is not correct to say that just by closing down these lines C.I.E. can give a better return to the country. The agricultural community must be considered, so far as railway services are concerned, in areas where the community is giving such a return to the overall economy of the country.  After all the Minister, with whatever Department he was concerned, was always quick to tell us about the necessity for improving the economy of the country. To close down some of these lines <Col N="956" /> would be unfair and disastrous to the people concerned and harmful to the overall economy in county Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The coalition Government by legislation ensured that the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the time, now the Minister for Transport and Power, would have no function good, bad or indifferent, in the day-to-day administration of C.I.E.  With the greatest respect I think speakers are wasting the time of the House, and are completely out of order, when they discuss such matters as bus fares and the closing or opening of railway lines.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, the Deputy does not intend to reflect on the Chair and withdraws that statement. I should like to refer to a few points in regard to Shannon Airport and some matters which not only concern Limerick, as has been suggested by Deputy Russell, and Clare but the country as a whole.  I must congratulate my political opponents, in Limerick particularly, for the conversion which has taken place with regard to Shannon Airport, a conversion which has taken place because it is politically expedient now to praise everything that takes place in Shannon which will give employment.  I remember the day, not so long ago, when the political opponents of Fianna Fáil in Limerick decried development at Shannon; decried the transatlantic air service; decried the laying of the new jet runways; decried the setting up of the industrial zone in the airport.  Now because it is politically expedient, apart from the fact that local elections are in the offing, they have done a complete switch over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now anything that benefits Shannon is of interest to them and they encourage it, vocally at least.  It might be of interest too if the policy makers, if such exist, of the Fine Gael Party were to be straight with the Irish people and came out once and for all with a clear concise statement as to the policy attitude with regard to aviation, with particular reference to Shannon Airport.  It is all right for <Col N="957" /> Fine Gael to set up a sub-committee on parking arrangements for Dublin but that will not cut much ice.  I challenge them now, once and for all, to say what their convictions are with regard to aviation and particularly with regard to their Party's policy on Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that if the Coalition had continued in office, if Fine Gael or a coalition Government had been returned to power in March, 1957, there would have been no jet runway built in Shannon Airport; there would have been no industrial zone constructed there and moneys would not have been voted by this House to ensure that an industrial zone could come to fruition, as now appears to be the case.  Policy statements on such important matters are essential.  Aviation plays a very big part in the economy of the industrial life of our citizens.</P>
    <P>Whilst Deputy Desmond was at it, he might have included in his policy statement, now that I see the Labour Party will no longer take part in a coalition, and now that the local elections are coming off, whether the Labour Party would support a Fine Gael Party if they could ever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because they enable me to enlighten not only Deputy Murphy, but some people in the country who might still have a clouded mentality with regard to the position in Shannon Airport.  Deputy Murphy said that these factories would not remain if some people walked out, and that a white elephant would remain.  The position is that the <Col N="959" /> Shannon Free Airport Development Company, Limited, have a reversionary clause in all agreements with industrialists who avail of factory space there, and in case of bankruptcy or failure by any of those industrialists, the factory reverts to the ownership of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, Limited, and another factory can take its place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  Deputy Murphy said they could walk out and leave a white elephant behind them. Before I was interrupted, I was saying it is ridiculous to suggest that the facilities in Shannon Airport should be extended to Ennis or Limerick.  The industrial zone in Shannon Airport was set up, in the first instance, to try to preserve the employment content in the Airport because it was inevitable, due to our geographical location, that with the coming of jet aircraft, a substantial percentage of aircraft which hitherto landed in Shannon Airport would over-fly.  A large percentage will over-fly but the Government, I am glad to say, faced up to that position. They studied the possibilities of encouraging air freight and, therefore, the encouragement of the industrial zone.  That zone was for the setting up of factories which will utilise air freight by flying out the finished product.</P>
      <P>If the same concessions were given in Limerick&mdash;and it may sound very strange for a Limerick Deputy to speak on these lines&mdash;the entire purpose of the industrial zone would be negatived and the whole concept of the industrial estate in Shannon Airport negatived. Then, again, it would be ridiculous to set up a factory in Limerick, with the concessions which are enjoyed by Shannon, because, if the goods were to be flown out on freight planes, the question of transport for the 12 miles from Limerick to Shannon would arise. One of the main advantages, as has been stressed before, of having the industries in Shannon, is that the finished product can go from the factory, by lift, up to the freight planes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> Having said that about the position in Shannon, I should like very much if another very important matter were given consideration.  There is no doubt that these factories in Shannon herald the growth of an industrial estate of tremendous magnitude which evidently will grow beyond the wildest dreams of the most enthusiastic supporters of that project.  Those in public life in Clare and Limerick, from time to time, and indeed every week, have representations made to them from all over Ireland&mdash;from complete strangers, in many instances&mdash;looking for employment for their sons and daughters in the Airport.  They want to know how to go about getting it.  Some people think there is still a certain amount of political pull&mdash;I am sorry to say that I have never come across a case of political pull&mdash;and certainly in Shannon Airport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Representations on a political basis should not arise.  That is not the proper way.  The point I am coming back to is that the parents of children are confused at the present time&mdash;I mentioned this matter on the University College, Dublin, Bill also&mdash; as to what they should put their children on for.  A clear-cut statement should be made with regard to the employment potential in the Shannon Airport industrial zone, that the demand for clerical positions, shorthand typists, young people coming out of school&mdash; even with Leaving Certificate honours &mdash;will be very, very, insignificant indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demand is for young people who are willing to go to the Airport immediately they come from school and seek an interview with the very competent personnel officers they have there, if they are willing to be trained for a certain specific trade.  As against that, they may go to the local technical institute and get trained in electrical engineering, electronics, sheet metal working.  That is where the demand will arise.  Advice should be given to them from the top in the form of a statement of policy as to what will be the employment potential for the next five or 10 years at Shannon Airport.  It could be said that 150 young fellows would be required for <Col N="962" /> electrical engineering, 50 for sheet metal working and so on.  The vocational education committees could then gear their classes accordingly and we would have a very high percentage of absorption of students leaving schools not only in these areas but in Irish schools generally for a number of years hence.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is readily appreciated by Deputies who may not be conversant with the position that it looks as if within the next eight to ten years anything up to 10,000 extra employees&mdash;10,000 extra workers&mdash; will be taken on at Shannon Airport. That is not an exaggeration.  I believe that is a conservative figure, prepared by people who are far more competent than I am in regard to these matters. That is in addition to the 2,000 already employed there.  That is a total of 12,000 individuals and assuming that the average family is composed of 4 persons, that gives you 40,000 people. Unfortunately, it does not constitute 40,000 workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a lot to put up with, Sir.  I see from the Estimates for the Public Services that this Department is responsible for the management of Shannon Airport generally.  Apart from our own people visiting the Airport, something will have to be done in the interests of our international visitors in regard to the quality of the food.  This is an important point and it should not be difficult to rectify the position.  As we all know, the best food in Europe was available up to some time ago in Shannon Airport at a reasonable price, but for some obscure reason best known to some people, a certain amount of neglect has crept in which will have to creep out just as quickly. It is not very pleasant for me to draw to the attention of the House the fact that even the food for the workers employed by the Airport has rapidly deteriorated.  Having said that, I sincerely trust that something will be done to rectify the position.</P>
      <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question, I was told that the method of employment in the sales and catering section was entrusted to the management of that department.  It is very disturbing to see husband and wife working together in a job while we have emigration in this country.  It creates quite a lot of comment.  What you want down there are happy industrial relations and happy public relations but, in the main, there is a feeling among the public that it is not a question of what you know but whom you know in regard to getting employment in the Airport, particularly in the sales and catering department.  One should be judged on one's merits and suitability for the position in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down a Question here some time ago.  It reached you.  Sir, and it came back to me again.  That was as far as it got.  My question asked the Minister for Transport and Power what proposals Aer Lingus had with regard <Col N="964" /> to the maintenance of planes at present operated by Pan-American World Airways and B.O.A.C.  It did not get as far as the Order Paper.  You, Sir, ruled that the Minister had no function in the matter.  I did not agree with that but there was nothing I could do about it.  I wrote back again putting the question in a different form but you refused my request.</P>
    <P>All that happened about three weeks ago.  Since then, an agreement has been signed between Aer Lingus and Pan-American World Airways, whereby 90 per cent. of the maintenance staff are being taken over by Aer Lingus.  In my opinion, Aer Lingus acted in a very responsible manner.  There are certain skilled mechanics down there.  One earns over £30; another £26 and another £23. These rates are more or less comparable with American rates.  They feared that, being taken over by Aer Lingus, there would not only be redundancy but a drop in the wage rate.  Not one of these men taken over by Aer Lingus will suffer any worsening of his position. His remuneration is exactly the same.</P>
    <P>I know, from personal contact with these people, that they are very happy in the area.  Of course, the thing to stress is that the request came from the American company to Aer Lingus that Aer Lingus should take over and do the maintenance for them.  The request did not come from Aer Lingus to the American company.  That is important.</P>
    <P>The only other outstanding matter concerns some men in B.O.A.C.  The position is slightly different.  Nevertheless, I am assured by Aer Lingus that not alone will they take on all these people in Pan-American World Airways and B.O.A.C. who are offered to them, but, in fact, they will have to advertise for extra skilled personnel for maintenance work.  There will not be enough to go around.  If at all possible, the same treatment should be meted out to the employees of B.O.A.C. as was given to the Pan-American employees.</P>
    <P>I did not see in the report of the Minister's speech anything about <Col N="965" /> Hovercraft.  I wonder if I have the right name for it: I refer to the machine that skims along on air pressure.  I see that the Armstrong-Siddeley Company are now commercially making it in England.  I think the Minister referred to it some minutes ago.  A model was made recently which could carry at very great speed and comfort up to 350 passengers.  We can appreciate how revolutionary it is from the point of view of tourism in so far as people wishing to cross to this country from Britain or other places are concerned.  Furthermore, it could have an effect on certain areas. An example which springs to mind immediately is the connecting of Kerry and Clare about which there was agitation recently because tourists wanted a ferry service.</P>
    <P>For some peculiar reason, the Minister for Industry and Commerce still appears to be regarded as the competent authority on harbours in specific instances.  I am sorry that that should be the case.  I thought the Minister for Transport and Power would have complete control of all aspects of the matter.  Criticism has been levelled here from time to time at restrictive practices in the port of Dublin and the problem of container traffic, and, indeed, as was mentioned in Mr. Whitaker's publication <i>Economic Expansion</i>, restrictive practices in the port of Limerick.  I do not think we shall have industrial peace in dockland or harbours until a joint industrial council is established, representative of employees, employers and the unions for port workers.</P>
    <P>It is not the workers in every instance, as has been suggested, who are to blame.  Some employers who are very loquacious in expressing Christian sentiments and talking about the rights of employees would surprise one by the way they treat their workers.  Without going into detail, I am afraid that everything is not too happy there.  Until we have a joint council with a certain amount of statutory authority and certain accepted rules, it is inevitable that we shall have these lightning strikes, these unfortunate practices and refusals by the people who handle different types of cargo.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> The cause of the trouble is simple. Consider any harbour.  Cork has few complaints because of the upsurge of industrial activity there.  Take Dublin or Limerick as an example.  There are about five times too many names on the society's list than there is work for. Until the principle of decasualisation is accepted, with consequent compensation for redundancy, there will be industrial unrest.  It stands to reason.  I know that far too many workers in the port of Limerick are looking after far too few jobs.  If the 400 names, or whatever the number is, were cut down to the realistic figure of 80 to 100 and these people were paid a living wage, and then conditions were brought in acceptable to employer and employee, we would have a happy port.  Some unfortunate people there average less than three months' work in the year. Still, they call themselves dockers. While we have the unhappy position of too many looking after too few jobs, we will have industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that only three Irish firms evinced any interest in regard to the factories at Shannon.  Some of these factories are giving our people the industrial &ldquo;knowhow.&rdquo; Some of our workers are being trained and will occupy very high positions in these factories when they go through their courses and are acceptable to the foreign management.  I think some people are under the impression that an industry can be set up in Shannon and concessions given and that the manufacturers can compete on the home market, notwithstanding the fact that they export, say, 90 per cent. of their product.  That is not the position.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, any industrialist who enjoys the concessions at Shannon Airport must export 100 per cent. the product of a factory there.  I understand also that no product manufactured at Shannon may be sold in competition with an existing manufacturer on the Irish domestic market.  That should be clear.  There was criticism recently of a substantial firm in Dublin in relation to an industry to be set up at Shannon.  For some reason the people here in Dublin thought that the products of this industry were <Col N="967" /> similar to those which they were producing. That is not the position.  I understand that I.D.A. policy is that they will not subsidise any industry by way of loan or grant to compete with an existing established industry, but the answer to the Dublin firm who criticised the setting up of the factory at Shannon is to ask: why do they themselves not avail of the facilities there?  If they have a knowledge of the trade, if they have been pioneers of the trade in Ireland, as they claimed, there is nothing good, bad, or indifferent, to prevent them from setting up in Shannon.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to make, and which I made on a previous occasion some time ago, in the debate for the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Budget debate.  People in many areas say that one of the greatest difficulties they have in attracting industries is that their areas are not in what is known as the undeveloped areas.  They compare the concessions given to industrialists at Shannon Airport and say that these concessions are drawing industries there which might otherwise have gone to their towns.  That is complete and arrant nonsense.  Some 99 per cent. of the industries started at Shannon would never have come to Ireland except that the industrial estate there was conceived and brought into being.  As I have said, the whole concept of the industrial estate is the export of manufactured goods by air services to different locations, and it should be remembered that under the 1959 Industrial Grant Act those of us who are not in the undeveloped areas are not so badly off.</P>
    <P>Dublin is not in the undeveloped areas.  To all intents and purposes, the undeveloped areas comprise districts west of the Shannon, parts of Kerry, certain parts of Clare, and parts of Cork, but under the Act of which I speak, Dublin, Mullingar, Limerick, Nenagh, Sligo, Donegal and any towns such as these can now qualify for a grant not exceeding £250,000.  We in these areas can get grants for two-thirds of the cost of factory buildings but what do the people in the undeveloped areas get?  They get the full <Col N="968" /> cost.  I ask why is there this differentiation? I know the purpose of the Undeveloped Areas Act was to try to encourage people to set up industries in those areas so that they would not be denuded of population, but I am simply pointing out that facilities exist in places outside the undeveloped areas, and when we talk about industries being attracted to Shannon to the detriment of such areas it would be well to remember these two points. Outside the undeveloped areas, people starting new industries can get two-thirds the cost of factory buildings, two-thirds of the cost of machinery, and, if they are in the export trade, can enjoy a ten years' remission of taxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone could quibble with the Minister's statement in that it is comprehensive and that he has covered all the wide subjects that appear to be associated with his Department, but there is one question that seems to pose itself to me.  He has made a full statement on the position and policy of Coras Iompair Éireann.  I should like to ask him does this mean that we are allowed to discuss C.I.E. only once a year?  In other words, for the remaining 12 months must we hold our peace in relation to the affairs of C.I.E. or, from now on, are we in a position to ask Paliamentary Questions about it?  If a Minister introduces a statement covering very widely a field which is connected with the administration of his Department as a whole, and therefore with the administration of a particular concern, if one asks a Parliamentary Question relating to that particular facet of his Department I fail to see how one could be ruled out of order.  Perhaps I put that wrongly; I do not think the Chair has ever ruled anybody out of order for asking a question about C.I.E. but the Minister concerned has usually replied to the effect that the subject of the question is a matter of day-to-day administration and that he has no function in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this point because the Minister has given us quite a detailed statement regarding the affairs of <Col N="969" /> C.I.E.  For that reason I feel that Deputies should be in a position to question him further in the ensuing 12 months if there are any particular problems that present themselves and with which they feel, relative to their function as public representatives and concerning the constituencies they represent, they might wish to deal by way of Parliamentary Question.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that C.I.E. is improving and that their affairs are far more healthy than they have been for a considerable time past, but I have one or two criticisms to make relative to my own part of the country.  I think we may claim along the east coast that we have a considerable tourist potential. I have travelled from town to town over the railway system in that part of the country, as I do in other parts of Ireland, and it seems to me that it is only in the other parts of the country that C.I.E. have provided up-to-date railway coaches.  A considerable number of people arrive in Ireland at Rosslare Harbour and the other southern ports which are still in existence, and I think they should be entitled to the same facilities in travelling as are afforded to those who come into Dublin and the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the Minister's statement in regard to cross-Channel passenger services.  He devoted quite a considerable amount of his speech to that and made a very full statement in so far as Dublin is concerned but, reading his speech, the thing that struck me was that he as Minister, those who advised him, those he consulted&mdash;I presume they were the directors or the officials concerned with British Railways&mdash;were solely concerned with Dublin.  One of the objects in catering for tourists who come to Ireland is to give them an opportunity of seeing the country as a whole, and I wish to refer to tourism only in so far as it relates to transport.</P>
    <P>First of all, I think we should secure an easy means of ingress for tourists and, secondly, we should encourage them to visit every part of Ireland by placing adequate transport at their disposal.  I do not know whether it is correct, but I have been told by <Col N="970" /> those concerned with British Railways and those concerned with our own transport, that a scheme has, shall I say, been long on the books, or at least suggested, under which those who come to visit this country from below a certain meridian, a certain latitude, should be encouraged to come in via the southern ports, be they Cork, Waterford when in existence, or Rosslare Harbour, and those who come from a level above that should be encouraged to come in through Dublin</P>
    <P>I have heard that from British Railway representatives and from C.I.E. representatives but the Minister's statement would indicate that that is not the case and that it has not been considered at the level of discussions that have taken place.  If it has been considered, why was every other place in Ireland except Dublin omitted from mention in the Minister's statement? Naturally, though, Dublin is the capital of the country and has good facilities available, and one expects that a considerable portion of this traffic would come in through Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of the ferry transport of cars.  The most up-to-date method of bringing in a car by British Railways was through Rosslare Harbour and through Cork and, to a lesser extent, through Waterford. A great part of the Minister's speech relates to Dublin.  It is all about improving facilities in Dublin, improving the ferry service for Dublin.  Is not that defeating its own ends? Is not it the purpose of an up-to-date passenger service to bring in more people?  The Minister has referred to the number of cars in Britain at the moment.  There is a huge number of cars in every country in the world.  A tourist potential means any place to which you can bring a car and where you drive comfortably.  The Minister is concentrating on trying to induce tourists to come here in great numbers by offering transport facilities.  He should have borne in mind that there are facilities, not only in Dublin, but in Rosslare Harbour and Cork.</P>
    <P>That again poses the question why the Waterford line was closed down. There does not seem to have been any <Col N="971" /> reason for it.  I heard that some peculiar legislation, passed many years ago, required British Railways to maintain the Fishguard-Waterford service, but that after a certain time that had lapsed, and it was possible to close it down.  I have been further informed that it was closed down on the argument that it did not pay.  If we are short of facilities for bringing in motor cars, will the Minister tell us when replying if it is possible to bring in motor cars through Waterford at the moment and, if not, why that transport system was discontinued?</P>
    <P>Everyone must view with disquiet the fact that in the recent Whit week-end rush there was a repetition of the same old story, lack of facilities for people coming to Ireland, whether Irish people returning on holidays or tourists.  We are told that there is a conference proceeding and that the Minister is doing his best to ensure that everything will be all right.  Why should there be the conditions for passengers that obtained during the Whit weekend?  Traffic between the United Kingdom and France and the United Kingdom and Europe is far in excess of the traffic between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  There are the same rush periods but one does not hear of thousands of people being left standing on the beach for hours.</P>
    <P>The Minister represents a rural constituency, as I do.  From his constituency of Longford-Westmeath emigration has been as heavy as it is everywhere else.  In fact they have lost a seat there.  Wexford has five seats.  His constituency has four. Emigration is heavy from that constituency and there are many of the Minister's constituents in the United Kingdom.  They return to this country for holidays.  They are working men. Many of them are separated from their wives.  When they come home at Whit or Easter or in the Summer they have a very limited time, perhaps a week or ten days.  They are entitled to be facilitated.  Why should a man who has only a few days' holidays have to spend a long time waiting for a boat?  He may miss the first boat. He gets the second boat and comes to <Col N="972" /> Dún Laoghaire to find that his train has gone.  That may mean the loss of a whole day.  That is not a proper service.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that we should start our own service.  That poses a difficult question but in the present state of affairs it must be seriously considered.  It is a public outrage that year after year at every rush period the transport system breaks down.  I want to be fair.  I am not throwing the blame directly on the Minister.  I have read his speech and I think he has done his best to discuss the matter with British Railways.  There must be some rational or reasonable approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>It is no use saying that in a rush period it is impossible to cater for the number of people travelling.  They could be catered for if there were a reasonable approach to the matter. How is it that thousands of people can book in with British Railways and be given reservations?  If there is proper liaison between British Railways and the transport service here, they must know that these people are coming.  They know the number of boats available.  People coming here for a short period, in many cases people who have been forced to emigrate from this country, are entitled to transport facilities to bring them home.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that it is no use meeting officials and discussing this matter with them. Every Minister that has been there has assured this House that what has happened will not happen again but it does happen again.  It has happened early this year, at the first possible opportunity that it could happen, the Whit weekend.  The Minister should meet his counterpart in the United Kingdom. There is so much transport between the two countries now that a commission should be set up to deal with this matter and be responsible for it. It need only be a small commission. Two representatives from the other side and two representatives from this country should be sufficient.  It would be their direct responsibility to see that at rush periods the conditions which have obtained will no longer <Col N="973" /> continue.  Why should we put up with it?</P>
    <P>We are giving British Railways full right to bring every passenger across the Channel to this country.  We do not give them the right in the air.  We have our own Aer Lingus service. Does anybody in this House think for one moment that if we were dependent on British European Airways and had not our own air transport we would not have people standing in London Airport and in Dublin Airport awaiting transport?  Let British Railways realise that they have a virtual monopoly. There is no use in coming back year after year with the same story, that the rush is unexpected.  They have the organisation at their disposal. They can provide transport into Europe and they can do it in the case of this country.  The Minister will have the support of every Deputy if he hits out and hits hard and sees to it that people travelling to this country get the service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I have always been in favour of having a mercantile fleet.  We are a mercantile power.  The world in general may not be aware of that and may not so regard us.  Our people have played a part in every navy and every merchant service in the world.  We have produced as good sailors as any other country.  We are entitled to a shipping fleet.  With Deputy Russell I am inclined to query the wisdom of concentrating on deep water fleets when there is so much shipping lying idle at the moment.  Deep water fleets are finding it hard to get employment. What we require is a ferry service between this country and the United Kingdom, with which we have the major portion of our trade.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the Minister something that came to my notice recently which will bring home to him the necessity of having some control over our merchandise exports to Britain.  In my own constituency, we have a factory from which a machine was exported to Britain and carried by British Railways.  It cost £58 to get it there.  The same machine was exported to the Far East at a cost of £148.  That will give the House some idea of the outrageous charges <Col N="974" /> which are being imposed on this country and which apply not only to industrial merchandise but to agricultural produce also.  A great deal of the yield we get from such exports goes west in these absolutely unfair and unnecessary charges.  The company must be making a profit or one might think that if they are making a loss elsewhere, they must be covering that loss by the profits they make out of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I think we have reason to be proud of our air services.  I have always been doubtful as to whether the transatlantic service will pay.  Only time can tell.  Even the Minister when he came into the House did not claim that the transatlantic air service was yet paying or was likely to pay for some time to come.  I think he is basing his arguments for the transatlantic air service on the fact that Shannon Airport runs a risk of being overflown by jet aircraft and so on. I think that is a mistaken impression.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that Shannon Airport is necessary to world aviation for passenger traffic and also for freight. It is a convenient place for refuelling heavily-laden planes carrying freight to the western hemisphere.  I think it is also evident from what has happened in the past seven or eight months that Shannon is necessary.  We had cases of aircraft setting out seemingly in good order and having to limp back to Shannon and the crews were very glad to have the airport to land on for their own safety and the safety of those for whom they were responsible.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley gave a long discourse on the Shannon development area.  It is true to say that there is development there and apparently the scheme has been very successful so far, but I do not think we ought to rely too much on that as part of our national economy.  We must remember there is a tremendous shortage of labour in Europe and a tremendous demand for manufactured goods in the United States, in Europe and in the emergent countries, the black republics and the countries of south-east Asia.  It is very convenient for firms to open up here and gain an extra line of production but we should not be too sanguine that they are there for all time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> When a firm from outside comes in here and gets all the benefits we have to offer &mdash; and they are considerable &mdash; I feel we ought to have some sort of safeguard to ensure that they will not pack up at a certain time when demand for their goods may not be so extensive and when they feel that it is not necessary for their own economy to carry on.  Many of these firms coming here are branches of existing European firms and they want to secure quicker production while the demand is there. Their branches here are only a fleabite in their over-all economy but we always face the risk that the time may come when they will feel it is no longer necessary to utilise the labour at their disposal here and they may close down. For that reason, I think any new industry that comes into Shannon Airport area &mdash; for which I gather the Minister is responsible &mdash; should give some guarantee that they will at least stay for a certain period so that they may fully earn the benefits we are providing and so that they may not in any way upset our future economy.</P>
    <P>We are rapidly coming to the end of electricity development.  The time must come when it will have been completed and the question will be posed: what are you to do with the personnel?  Can one still keep them in employment?  I think the Minister will agree that the personnel concerned are highly qualified, highly trained. As time goes on, they are improving their knowledge and becoming more scientific and better able to do their jobs than in the early days.  I cannot help feeling that there is a considerable risk that when we have finished development here, we shall have redundant personnel and for that reason I repeat a suggestion I made a couple of years ago.  I do not think anybody took any notice of it &mdash; I do not think anybody takes any notice of what I say but I still keep on saying it in a hopeful spirit.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board, through the Minister for Transport and Power, could sponsor a scheme to instal in Ireland a central heating system.  We import vast quantities of <Col N="976" /> fuel every year and our balance of payments problem is a question that comes up regularly in every discussion. If we were able to produce electrical central heating, starting perhaps in a not-too-ambitious way, possibly with the larger public institutions and gradually extending to private houses, we could have a very fair return for our investment and we could employ our personnel here permanently and obviate the need for the present heavy imports of fuel.</P>
    <P>That brings me to coal.  I notice the Minister said that the generating stations as far as possible use Irish coal.  It is not very clear why it is not possible to use more Irish coal. Is there something wrong with Irish coal?  Is it below the standards of other coal produced in, say, Poland or America or even in Britain?  Much of the coal we get from Britain is not by any means first-class.  It is well known that for that reason we had to go elsewhere for coal.  Would it be possible, in the rather difficult situation in which the coal producers of this country find themselves at present &mdash; I know they are having negotiations with the Minister and that he is trying to do his best for them, taking into account our agreement with other countries and so on &mdash; to use more of our own coal in generating stations and so extend electricity production and power availability in the country as well?</P>
    <P>I was glad to find that we have a Department Vote on which we can discuss harbours.  I have been trying to discuss harbours over the past couple of years and I always seem to have been unlucky in getting in on the wrong Vote and being ruled out of order.  I trust the Chair will permit me to say a few words on the subject now.  I understand there has been an examination of harbours as a whole. As the Minister knows, having been in the Department of Fisheries for some time, there has been a considerable increase in the fishing fleets in Waterford and Wexford and down the east coast generally, but there has been no improvement of harbours in that area since I came into public life, nearly 10 years ago.  In this year's Estimate, <Col N="977" /> considerable sums are voted for the improvement of two harbours in Donegal.  I am unaware of the fact that there has been an increase in the fishing fleet in Donegal.  I am aware that there has been an increase in the fishing fleet in my own constituency.  I am also aware that in respect of Kilmore Quay, where there is a considerable number of fishermen and which numerous representatives from Fisheries came to inspect, it has been made crystal clear that improvements to the harbour are necessary.  There is bad anchorage there; the only anchorage is to tie up alongside the wall.  The harbour needs continual dredging and at the moment it is protected from the wind from only two sides.  Very little would put that harbour in order.  I do not know whose function it really is to do that, but from the Minister's statement I gather he has taken responsibility for harbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with all that was said by Deputy Esmonde in relation to passenger facilities at Dun Laoghaire and at the ports where passengers arrive in this country.  When the Government, the Minister for Transport and Power or our tourist bodies talk about tourism the first thing they should ask themselves is: have we adequate facilities for receiving tourists?  I think it was Deputy Esmonde who said that in Dublin the facilities are far superior to those in other places such as Rosslare, Waterford, Cork, and so on.  I disagree thoroughly.  At the B. &amp; I. terminus, North Wall, there are facilities that are suitable only for cattle, not for human beings.  It is appalling to see that there are no facilities whatsoever for the parking of cars or private transport. The people have to walk up a dirty, dusty old stairway.  There are no facilities for waiting and, in general, conditions are most unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned there are no facilities for cars; nevertheless people can string their cars in ribbon fashion along the street but there are absolutely no facilities for passengers who have not got cars.  There is no public transport to take people to and from the B. &amp; I. terminus at the North Wall. One sees people going to the B. &amp; I. boat or coming from it &ldquo;lugging&rdquo; their suitcases down along the Quays where the conditions are disgraceful.</P>
      <P>As regards the Whit weekend, which is the slackest bank holiday weekend of the bank holiday weekends to which we are accustomed, one of the daily newspapers had a short report and this comment by a newspaper correspondent of the <i>Blackburn Evening Telegraph:</i></P>
      <P>British Railways put on an extra sailing to Dún Laoghaire on Saturday morning and some British travellers protested at a two-hour delay in Dún Laoghaire harbour. Passengers stood by for an hour in the harbour waiting for the <i>Hibernia</i> to leave and when they docked they had to wait for another hour before they disembarked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> They included a party of 400 on a one-day outing to Dublin arranged by the <i>Blackburn Evening Telegraph.</i> Mr. Alex Stuttard, a reporter on the <i>Evening Telegraph</i>, said that the passengers were fed up after the hour's delay.  &ldquo;We then had to wait on board the vessel in conditions which would have been unsuitable for animals,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Women were screaming and several of them fainted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were the conditions that prevailed at Dún Laoghaire last Saturday morning.  Does the Minister not think that it is utterly ridiculous to have the Tourist Board inviting tourists to spend their holidays here when those are the conditions that prevail?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister thinks that if too much is said about this what will happen will be exactly what has already been referred to by other Deputies: people will think the conditions are always like that and we shall get fewer tourists.  It is the sort of criticism which should be well-advised and discreet in its character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must disagree with the Minister there.  As long as I have been a member of this House and as long as I have had the slightest interest in tourism, these conditions have prevailed at Dún Laoghaire and in Dublin port, and each year we are promised that something will be done about it.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately this boat brought 400 day trippers as well as other trippers.  I would say their picture of Dublin is completely coloured by their experience, that on a day trip they had a two-hour delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of mentioning a domestic matter, I <Col N="980" /> presume, in relation to C.I.E.; I mention it because of the difficulty a public representative would find in bringing problems such as this to the notice of the authorities concerned. There are something like 2,000 pensioned workers in C.I.E.  I am not speaking about the salaried workers at all; I am speaking about bus drivers, conductors, and so on, who wish to be received by the people in authority to have their complaints listened to. The chief complaint of these people is that after 30 years' work with C.I.E. they are receiving pensions as small as 11/- per week.  Some of the pensions range from 35/- to 50/- per week but others are as low as 11/-.  Some time ago I asked the Minister if he would receive a deputation and he rightly told me that it was no function of his.  I then got in touch with C.I.E. and their officials informed me that they could do nothing in the matter, and they would not see the deputation.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister now to examine the position in relation to these pensioners.  I understand the salaried workers' association have other grievances.  I think these pensioners should get the same consideration as pensioners in general.  Their position should be reviewed as the cost of living rises or falls.  Unfortunately, in this country, the cost of living generally tends to rise.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to mention.  The Minister cannot do anything about it but the matter should, I think, be publicly aired to show what can happen and to underline the arguments advanced by Deputy Desmond.  It is interesting to discover that on a particular bus route in Dublin from Eden Quay to the East Wall, approximately one mile as the crow flies, the fare is 7d.  This is a preponderantly working-class district. I suggest that, if it were a predominantly residential district, there would be a general boycott of public transport in the area.  Such a situation creates nothing but ill-feeling.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to comment on a question asked in one of our newspapers over the weekend: Were there as many customs officers available to cater for the passengers at Dún <Col N="981" /> Laoghaire as there were at Dublin Airport, remembering that the number of passengers arriving at Dún Laoghaire would be eight or ten times greater than the number arriving at Dublin Airport?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I should like to raise on the aviation side.  First of all, I should like some information with regard to the present position of Aer Línte as opposed to Aer Lingus.  Originally, there were two companies, one in charge of the transatlantic route and the other in charge of the cross-Channel route.  Is Aer Linte still in existence or has it been integrated in Aer Lingus?  I hope it has been integrated because I no longer see any justification for any division.</P>
      <P>Some criticism was made of the purchase of the jets and the construction of the runways.  It is very significant that already, before the Irish jets have come into operation, American jets are using the airport.  I am absolutely convinced that, had it not been decided to go into jet traffic, no American airline would have used Shannon for jet aircraft.  Traffic attracts traffic and the fact that Irish jets will be using Shannon will bring other jets into the airport as well.</P>
      <P>I am very much involved in the question of C.I.E. and the Bray line since the line runs through my constituency. I have always felt that some very drastic move would have to be made.  I know it is unpopular to say so, but I think C.I.E. have done a very good job in their proposals for economic working.  Only yesterday I saw a train which left the city at about a quarter past one and, at Merrion Gates, it had exactly 15 passengers in six coaches.  Quite obviously running like that is entirely unprofitable.  I hope that C.I.E. will give greater publicity to its faster schedules in the hope of attracting more traffic and persuading people that it is doing, as I believe it is, a really good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I greatly deplore some of the remarks made about cross-Channel shipping.  We are one of the most vicious critics of British Railways and a great deal of the criticism is grossly <Col N="982" /> exaggerated and, in my view, most unwise. Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde went so far as to speak of hundreds of thousands of people being left on the beach.  That, of course, is utter nonsense, and I think Sir Anthony knew it.  This weekened there were 45 passengers who had to wait for the next boat.  The idea that you can provide a cross-Channel shipping route with unlimited accommodation is quite fantastic. Possibly there is room for some improvement, but the whole problem is a very, very difficult one.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Electricity Supply Board, I welcome the introduction of the amending Bill, though we have not got very far with it yet.  I think the Board are getting a bit too big for their boots.  They are becoming absolutely dictatorial in their attitude to the public.  One sphere in which I think the activities of the E.S.B. might be curtailed is in their entry into the retail sale of electrical equipment and contract work which is normally the province of a private electrical contractor. The E.S.B. have a stranglehold on the market because those to whom it sells by retail are already customers and already in the power of the E.S.B. No additional expenditure is incurred by having to add hire purchase charges to the ordinary bill for electricity; and, if the customers do not pay, there is no question of going to court because all that need be done is to send out one reminder and cut the customers off. Consequently, their overheads are very low.</P>
    <P>They are interfering to a marked extent with the ordinary retail trader dealing with electrical equipment.  It is quite right and proper that they should have extensive showrooms, but I state my opinion quite definitely: the Electricity Supply Board should not enter into the retail trade of electrical equipment.  Neither should they undertake contract work for installation which is normally the province of private contractors.  It is most unfair to use public money for the purpose of interfering with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister &mdash; I think he has taken some steps in this direction already &mdash; to continue considering <Col N="983" /> the possibility of bringing State companies under greater control. The present position is that the capital of such companies is under the name of the Minister for Finance.  It is the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Power or the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ensure that the policy of such companies is in line with general Government policy.  I feel very deeply, however, that there should be some way in which this House could influence the general policy of State companies.  A State company should not be in a different position from a private company whose directors have to answer to, at least, an annual general meeting of the company where the shareholders are at liberty to raise any matters of interest to them.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to visualise how what I suggest could be done.  The Committee on Public Accounts would be far too detailed.  If the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, could devise some way in which State companies could hold what approximates to an annual general meeting at which the directors would formally submit their report, and themselves, for examination by a committee of this House, an important step forward would be achieved.  We are constantly frustrated here by the fact that a State board has been set up by an Act of the Oireachtas and we then find ourselves with no control over the board and the Minister with only a very limited control.</P>
    <P>If we could get State companies more nearly approaching the category of an ordinary private company, we would have much less frustration and would have also much better control and much greater confidence as between these companies and the public.  There is always the danger of a State company with a monopoly becoming dictatorial, and all of them have a monopoly of some sort or another.  I would ask the Minister if he could give further consideration to it &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;further&rdquo; because I know it has been in his mind already &mdash;<Col N="984" /> and see whether some solution can be reached on a problem which has already, I think, defeated most of the legislatures in Europe at any rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>The most refreshing aspect of the Minister's speech was his references to C.I.E.  To follow a point made by Deputy Booth, although I do not think Deputy Booth would go all the way with me, I hope the manner in which the Minister has given us some detailed information of the affairs of C.I.E. might be interpreted as an indication that the Minister feels, as several Deputies do, that the affairs of State and semi-State companies might be subjected to a more detailed examination in the House.  From time to time, we all have had the frustrating experience, when we endeavoured to inquire into the affairs of State or semi-State companies, of being told that the Minister has nothing to do with the day-to-day affairs of these companies.  We are precluded from pursuing inquiries which are very often not only in the interests of the public but in the interests of the companies themselves.</P>
      <P>I should like to recall the very pertinent remarks of the Minister when he referred to the position we have reached here in which we have obvious over-investment in transport vehicles. That cannot be denied.  We have too much transport and too much capital is being put into the provision of further transport.  It was timely and appropriate for the Minister to avail of this opportunity of urging on everyone concerned to examine the facilities available to C.I.E. for transporting their goods before they proceed to invest further capital in vehicles to carry their goods.  I think the Minister is not asking too much when he requests all concerned to examine the cost of their own transport and see exactly what the difference would be if they were to have a package deal with C.I.E., as many firms have, since the introduction of the last Transport Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another problem to which the Minister must address himself. While he is rightly exhorting everybody concerned to see if C.I.E. cannot do less expensively and more efficiently <Col N="985" /> what their own transport are doing, he will also have to look at the position whereby State and semi-State companies are investing quite a lot of capital in the provision of vehicles for the transportation of their own goods. We have the Sugar Company, the E.S.B., Bord na Móna, the various county councils and county borough councils, local authorities of one kind or another, all engaged in the transport of their own goods, which very often could be carried more efficiently and less expensively by the national transport undertaking.</P>
    <P>I often wonder, when I meet these vehicles of the Sugar Company and the E.S.B. on the road, if there is not a vast amount of duplication of vehicles between all these State companies.  While agreeing thoroughly with the Minister in his exhortations to private concerns to look at the facilities now available to C.I.E., the Minister, in conjunction with his colleagues in the Cabinet, who are responsible in one way or another for these other State companies, owes it to C.I.E. and the country to give them a clear indication that wherever possible they should support C.I.E.</P>
    <P>One other point I should like to mention is the matter of illegal haulage.  I referred to it at length during the passage of the last Transport Act.  Indeed, the Minister at that time indicated that he shared my views regarding the wholesale illegal haulage that then obtained.  I should like to know does the Minister feel some progress has been made in regard to the detection of these illegal hauliers and their prosecution.  It was indicated at the time that special steps would be taken, and from my own personal knowledge I know an attempt has been made to deal with these problems, but I should like to hear from the Minister whether he feels real progress has been made and whether he regards it as a big problem now.</P>
    <P>My own opinion from observation is that while very good progress has been made in the detection of illegal haulage of merchandise and livestock, there is wholesale illegal carriage of passengers to the detriment of C.I.E. <Col N="986" /> I feel that no serious attempt has yet been made by the authorities to grapple with that situation.  I should like to know from the Minister whether or not he finds it possible now to deal with it as vigorously as the problem of the illegal haulage of merchandise and livestock was dealt with in the recent past.</P>
    <P>I should like to add my voice to others that have been raised here on behalf of C.I.E. wages grade superannuated employees.  I was very glad indeed to find that several of the Minister's colleagues found it appropriate to refer to this matter at this time.  For quite a while, I was a voice crying in the wilderness when I referred to the vast number of C.I.E. wages grade employees who are superannuated at such a very low level of pension.  I pointed out in the past that 50 per cent. of all the people in that grade are on a pension of less than 12/- a week.  These were people who, because of the economic circumstances of the times, as far as the railway companies were concerned, found it necessary to work at depressed wages during practically all their service with the railway companies prior to the taking over of the railways by the State.</P>
    <P>It is due to these people who are on such a miserable pittance that the Minister should indicate to the Board of C.I.E. that while there is no statutory obligation on the Board, unfortunately, to deal with this matter, they should in all equity revise the situation there.  I have no doubt if the Minister indicated that he was sympathetically disposed towards such a revision, the Board of C.I.E. would deal with the matter on those lines. As I say, I am glad that several of the Minister's colleagues, several Deputies on that side of the House, saw fit to refer to that and I hope that the adding of their voices to mine will have some effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first report which the Minister has brought before the House in introducing this Estimate indicates that the decision of the Government to set up a separate Department for the particular activities <Col N="987" /> assigned to the Minister has been fully justified.  I am pleased to note that the part of the report which deals with harbours states that a number of major developments in connection with two or three harbours are being undertaken.  In the course of his speech, the Minister stated that applications for grants for improvement schemes had been received from a number of provincial centres and are under examination.  I take it that one of the centres referred to is Dingle, which is in my constituency.  I would ask the Minister to take a note of that application and have it dealt with as sympathetically and as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>The need for improvements at the harbour in Dingle is rather urgent. Owing to diminishing revenue over a number of years past the condition of the harbour has been allowed to deteriorate considerably and the position now is that interests which might be likely to use it for the shipment of various types of merchandise find themselves unable to utilise the harbour. In recent times a number of industrial promoters visited the area and in one instance, a group of people likely to set up a very heavy industry were rather unfavourably impressed, due to the condition of the harbour.  The area adjacent to the harbour is losing its population rapidly, due to lack of employment, and if the harbour were put in a proper state of repair, I am quite sure the possibilities of getting industries to the area would come to fruition eventually. I sincerely hope when the Minister deals with the application, he will find it possible to allocate sufficient funds to carry out the necessary work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to standard lorry weights.  That matter was dealt with when the Transport Act was being discussed here and disquiet was expressed in regard to the developments that would take place as a result of the statutory provisions which were being imposed under the Act.  It was predicted that the idea of the legislation at that time was more or less to bolster up C.I.E. and to put the private man, as he was called, off the road.  I have no fears in that direction.  As a matter of <Col N="988" /> fact, I indicated to the Minister at that time that I thought the <i>bona fide</i> applications of private licensed hauliers who were seeking an increase in the unladen weight of their merchandise licences should be considered sympathetically. I am glad to say, from my experience of a number of cases, that, by and large, such applications were considered by the Department and each and every one of them was met very fairly.  This is most satisfactory because I think a clean-up in that direction was long overdue.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, the attitude of the Department towards applications of that kind was rather indefinite and when the recent legislation came into force, the operators of these vehicles were obliged to give way.  It was found in quite a large number of cases that they were carrying weight in excess of that permitted by licence.  I am quite sure that they made a clean breast of the whole business and that now the question of unladen weight has been fully rectified, to the satisfaction of all concerned.  I want to thank the Minister for his very sympathetic and businesslike handling of this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt here with the question of electricity and I have some observations to make in that connection. Generally the report of the Minister in regard to electricity development is quite satisfactory.  We have, however, every year during the course of debates of this kind, to bring to the Minister's notice anomalies, if I might use a very mild term for them, which exist in rural areas in regard to the flat charges for rural electrification. Evidently the policy of the Electricity Supply Board is to determine the flat rate charges in accordance with valuation and the measurement of the premises.  That is where this charge happens to be what is known as a standard charge.</P>
    <P>The E.S.B., however, have a method which is very hard to understand. Certain areas are described by them as uneconomic units.  I take it that areas so scheduled are those with few houses and large districts to be connected. These people who find themselves scheduled in uneconomic areas are asked to pay a very exorbitant excess on the current rate charges <Col N="989" /> before they can qualify for a supply of electric current.  It would be reasonable, I imagine, to expect in sparsely populated areas, where there are very few houses and where a large transmission network would have to be erected, that some additional charge should normally be applied which should be borne by somebody and I would go so far as to say that the consumers should bear their due proportion of such a charge.</P>
    <P>The position, however, is that the charge is doubled and sometimes trebled, with the result that the potential consumer finds it beyond his means to take in electricity on such terms.  Representations made on the matter to the E.S.B. are of very little avail.  They seem to have rather fixed terms of reference in that connection and will not depart from the calculations they apply in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>With regard to the excess charges for electricity supplied in the country, the E.S.B. might reasonably be asked to reconsider their terms in some instances. It is the ambition of every householder in the rural areas to be connected up with the E.S.B. current for light and power.  It is very irritating, to say the least of it, for those people who are subjected to excess charges, not to be able to be as good as their neighbours in having a supply of electricity available.  I do not think the overall aggregate of the excess is very considerable.  A very progressive organisation, such as the E.S.B., should be expected to meet the requirements of the people by adopting a more moderate scale of charges. It might be as reasonable for, let us say, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to insist on excess charges for postage on a letter which had to be delivered in a remote area, as for the E.S.B. to say that a very sparsely populated area, with very few houses, should be subjected to the charges I refer to.</P>

      <P>The people concerned have a very definite grievance. I ask the Minister to consider this matter more particularly and to have it made the subject of examination at departmental level.  If he is entitled to do so, he should give some sort of direction, or at least recommendation, to the E.S.B. that the scale of charges should be reconsidered and modified.</P>
      <P>At the concluding stages of his speech, the Minister dealt with turf development and, generally speaking, he had a very satisfactory picture to show.  I should like, however, to direct his attention to the area activities, generally speaking, of Bord na Móna.  Most of the activities conducted by Bord na Móna are carried out in the midlands and the western areas &mdash; particularly the midlands.  So far as the south of Ireland is concerned, with the exception of two or three small projects, Bord na Móna do not appear to be paying any attention to that part of the country.  I suggested here on a previous occasion &mdash; the Department of Industry and Commerce was at that time charged with responsibility for Bord na Móna &mdash; that the manufacture of briquettes should commend itself to them in the southern areas.</P>
      <P>Briquettes, as a fuel, have become exceptionally popular in recent years, but, due to the large distance they have to be transported to the south and south-west of Ireland from the briquette factories in the midlands, the price of that type of fuel in the south is uneconomic.  I have no doubt that if that fuel were available at reasonable distances from the southern areas, a very considerable quantity would be disposed of.  I suggest to the Minister that if Bord na Móna are contemplating any further developments in the manufacture of briquettes, in so far as he can do so, he should direct their attention to the southern areas.  There are large tracts of peat and other suitable bogland available in the Munster counties which have not been developed by private interests, and are unlikely to be developed by any private interests in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> As I say, Bord na Móna have had a limited experience in the development of peat in the south and that experience gave satisfactory results.  I feel there is entirely too much concentration on the midlands in the matter of turf development, and particularly in the matter of briquette fuel.  I again ask the Minister to examine this matter and to endeavour to get Bord na Móna to give serious consideration to the southern areas, in the event of there being any further developments in the field of briquette manufacture or, for that matter, in general turf development, whether for private consumption or for industrial use.</P>
    <P>I understand at the present moment some form of amalgamation of the maintenance arrangements at Shannon Airport is being contemplated.  From what I could learn, it appears that Aer Lingus are about to enter into an arrangement &mdash; if they have not already done so &mdash; with a number of other operating companies whereby the mechanical service requirements of all these companies will be undertaken in future under contract by Aer Lingus.  That might be quite commendable and I have no doubt it is a good arrangement from the point of view of economy, but the question of staff redundancy is involved.  The existing staff of the operating companies now under contract with Aer Lingus are feeling very uneasy.  Quite a number of them also feel that complete unemployment is inevitable.  A number of them also feel that the existing rate of charges will, of necessity, be considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>Most people who have had experience of amalgamation in any field of activity know that, whilst it may lead to a reduction in the overall cost of the maintenance of a service, it is at the same time inevitably bound to bring unemployment.  It is a very disturbing state of affairs for the employees at Shannon.  I am not competent to speak for that territory because I have no direct responsibility for it.  However, a number of people who are employed on the maintenance staff of Aer Lingus have to live so far away <Col N="992" /> from Shannon as to be in my territory. I am concerned with those people.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with that possible development in the course of his statement under the headings &ldquo;Aviation&rdquo; or &ldquo;Aer Lingus&rdquo;.  If he has any information on the matter, I should be glad if he would throw some light on it when he is concluding the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly anxious to get to the House this evening to speak in this debate, although I am up to my eyes in two elections. I wired several times to make certain that I did not miss it.  First of all, this Department of Transport and Power is a kind of mystery Department. The name &ldquo;Transport and Power&rdquo; is rather imposing but has the Minister the power, or is it the Dáil which has the power?  I do not know.  I am not certain.  I know that one hands the baby back to the other when questions are asked.</P>
      <P>With regard to the right of members of the House to question the actions, or even the administration, of State subsidised companies, I hold the House should have that right.  We in the Corporation have the right to criticise the Corporation.  We can put down questions and that system works very well.  That is democracy.  We believe that if we did not have that right, quite a number of injustices would arise.  We have the special problem of trying to get the rents in and some of the collectors have to act very tough.  If we did not intervene now and again, quite a number of injustices would be done.  I hold that it should be the same in all such companies. Where there is a bit of power, there is tyranny.  There must be.</P>
      <P>I hold that the E.S.B., whether wittingly or unwittingly &mdash; I do not know and it does not matter &mdash; act tyrannically in thousands of cases.  Up to recently, their agents actually went about putting people's lights off on their way home on a Saturday between 12 noon and 1 o'clock, but, because of pressure brought by the Corporation, that practice was done away with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just the point. The argument we advance from time to time is that we ought to have the power to question the Minister on administration.  By making representations and having this practice cancelled, we proved the justification for our intervention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be right.  If the Minister has no direct responsibility, the matter would be irrelevant and would not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the title &ldquo;Minister for Transport and Power&rdquo; implies that the Minister has a surfeit of power but he has no power.  If I cannot question him, what am I to do?  How can we go about it?  Are we to walk up and down outside the offices and boycott them?  The only justification for this House is that we can come in here and question anything. There is one thing certain at any rate&mdash;whatever intervention we made, we got some concessions and we have a right to get more.</P>
      <P>Now I come to this notorious matter of charging a meter fee.  It is 9/- for one point and 25/- for 19 points.  A man with a castle who pays 25/- is covered for 19 rooms but the old age pensioner must pay 9/- for one.  Surely that is a question which I can raise? I quoted a case during the year where 9d. worth of light was used but the meter fee was 13/6d.  The average old person goes to bed about 7 or 8 o'clock.  In summer, it is bright until 10 o'clock.  Actually, these people do not use a halfpenny's worth of light a night.  They do not use meters.  They have only one point and yet they must pay 9/- for using a halfpenny worth of light.  Could the E.S.B. not scale down these charges and give, say, four points for 9/- and one point for 2/6d.? That would obviate a tremendous amount of hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter before and I was told that the company was prepared to save the money and put it in the collection box.  That is not the point. <Col N="994" /> The people I speak for are being taken for a ride, in being asked to pay 9/- meter fee where only a halfpenny's worth of light is used.  If the Minister would arrange to have 9/- for four points and 2/6d. for one point, it would solve the problem.  After all, the only remedy these people have is for us to come here and kick up a row about the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be.  I do not want to call the Minister a dummy but what else can I do if he can do nothing about the matter?  There is one other point which was raised by other Deputies and I was requested to raise it.  It is the case of C.I.E. pensioners.  We are told that they get a pension of 37/6d. Those are the mechanics of the thing but when they reach 70 years of age, it is reduced to 12/-.  I am told that, in spite of the last three increases, they got nothing.  They claim they should get the increases all the other pensioners got in the Budget.  I understand that a new scheme came into operation two years ago.  Under this scheme, they are now getting £1.  Why should the men who went out prior to those two years be left with 12/-?  Everyone should get a corresponding and proportionate increase.  No one should be left out.  I came in here principally to argue against this E.S.B. meter charge and the conduct of the E.S.B. officials.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the Minister should encourage a short air service in order to make people air-minded.  Thousands of people in this country would not travel in a plane.  I personally did not like the idea either until I had to go on a trip and then I liked it so much that I would not travel any other way.  If you want to make the company pay, you must make people air-minded. There is a service of the type I mention in operation in the United States.  We must encourage and educate people in regard to air travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> In regard to shipping, I hold that the Minister should do something to have tourist ships built in order to help the tourist trade and employment.  There are 10,000,000 workers in England who would gladly go overseas.  People on holiday like to go overseas.  It could be spread over a period of five or six months.  The people want something cheap and if such ships were built for this purpose, you could have a six months' service.  There is an excursion to Belfast once or twice every week and it is packed.  Why could we not do the same thing in regard to the ships and avoid the situation in Dún Laoghaire where the travelling public are held up for hours?  I hold that if there are excursions on tourist ships, it would help considerably.  I want to emphasise that every chance I get I will criticise the E.S.B.  They acted the tyrant not once but a thousand times and they would do it a thousand times a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House or the Minister very long but out of this debate one thought emerges.  It is this: how successful the Minister in this case and over all, the Government, have been in their policy over the past four years.  We come to yet another Estimate.  In the narrow view, the Minister can report a co-ordination of a very vital sector of our economy under his control.  He is personally to be commended on the reasonable and, I would say, tactful, but nevertheless tenacious, approach he has adopted to this problem.  There has been no flamboyance about it but there is evidence of plenty of hard study and rewarding work.  He is able to come in here with the first phases of that co-ordination well in hand and, on top of that, to report substantial progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think he can claim to be the first Minister who has come into this House and been able to report a real progress in the almost intractable problem of land transport in this country.  The report in regard to C.I.E. shows not only an agreeable improvement but for the first time there are signs that this enterprise may be developed on economic lines and that there is a <Col N="996" /> future for it.  I know that much of this is to be attributed to the dynamic leadership of Dr. Andrews who is repeating in his present post the performance which stands to his credit in Bord na Móna.  However that may be, the policy behind it all has now been bearing fruit and it is a significant thing to note.  The same things hold in regard to the other phases which the Minister has mentioned.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to watch Deputy McGilligan's approach in moving to refer back this Estimate.  At the end of his speech, I wondered just what he was referring back.  He did not directly object to or criticise one thing that had been done.  He made a number of suggestions of things that had not been done.  If he examines some of his suggestions or implications, he will find that the blame might more fairly be laid on the administration of which he was a member rather than on the administration which the Minister represents.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan spent a lot of time analysing deficits in regard to airlines.  He mentioned Aer Rianta.  I could not help wondering what the picture might be if a Coalition Government had not completely destroyed our project for expansion in 1948 and onwards in that regard.  The abolition and the breaking-up of the transatlantic airline project&mdash;which had to be revived and is attempted to be revived by the present Government under more difficult circumstances after the lapse of valuable time &mdash; was a retrograde step by the Coalition Government. That project might be a very fruitful one to-day if Deputy McGilligan and his Government had not destroyed it in its infancy.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan was critical about expenditure.  He was very faint in his praise, if any, of what is being done in regard to C.I.E.  I cannot help wondering what an analysis of the measures taken by the Coalition Government in regard to that undertaking would show.  However, I do not wish to follow too much in this line.  I probably would not have adverted to these things were it not that, by implication, there was a sneer at over-capitalisation of the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>Surely, if more equipment is available <Col N="997" /> and if more equipment is being developed than is immediately necessary, it is a good thing.  I am not so sure that that is the position.  However, to object to investment of that nature in productive power is I think a very old fashioned approach.  It is the same type of mentality as destroyed the project for a chassis factory at Inchicore.  It is the same type of mentality which thinks narrowly in terms of halfpence at the moment and will forgo the opportunity for expansion and for earning pounds in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>How much have the airlines earned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>They might have earned a lot more if the Deputy's Government in 1948 had not set things in reverse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you remember the selling of the Constellations and the selling of the capital equipment for the airlines?  Deputy Lindsay asked me a question.  I answer him. The situation might be a lot rosier to-day if it were not for what the Coalition did.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy McGilligan's approach to this matter, this thought strikes one.  There has been progress. There is progress to be reported on this Estimate.  This is a new Ministry.  One might say the Minister is coming here for the first time with these activities co-ordinated under his charge.  He can report spectacular progress in regard to C.I.E. and the picture is generally optimistic under the other heads. Again, this is in keeping with the general pattern of the Government. The situation in other Departments is the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the lesson?  The lesson is that this country has made marked progress during the past couple of years when compared with the situation which obtained under Coalition and weak Governments in the previous period.  It shows the importance of stability in Government and stability in policy.  Thanks be to goodness, <Col N="998" /> this country is now reaping the rewards of stability and certainty in its administration.  I have no doubt that the present year will continue to show substantial improvements of the same nature for the very same reason.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Casey's unfair observations in regard to Deputy de Valera have <Col N="999" /> caused this debate to end in an unpleasant spirit.  The general debate has been most friendly.  In the main, the criticism has been constructive.  A number of very pleasant observations have been made to me by Deputies on all sides of the House on the character of the Estimate speech and its comprehensive nature, and it gives me very great pleasure to reply to as many of the points as were made and as many of the criticisms as I can.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the fact that the Minister for Transport and Power and his officers do not interfere with the day to day activities of the companies over which we exercise some general supervision. This must be examined from a commonsense point of view.  Quite obviously the State companies must be allowed to operate as much as possible as private companies with full liberties in initiative, with full liberties in regard to control of staff, and with full liberties in regard to the day-to-day operations of their concerns.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Department is, first of all, to prepare legislation when it is required, to examine the demands for capital for future productive purposes and the promotion of the various companies, to examine how capital already provided is being spent and whether or not it should be remunerated at any given stage in a company's operations, to examine the general policy of each of these companies in relation to the national economy as a whole, to see if they are contributing to the national economy, and to see if there are any elements in their operations which are hindering other companies or other interests. In that we should also have regard to the necessity of there being reasonably good relations between employers and workers in these companies and we like to assure ourselves in every way possible that industrial relations are operating on what might be described as an optimum basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the duty of the Department also to exhort all companies at every possible opportunity to adopt dynamic <Col N="1000" /> cost reducing, output raising techniques, to lower their costs as much as possible, to provide the very best possible service at the lowest cost, and to keep in line with modern practice but that does not mean that we see these companies every day, or that we write to them every day, or that we are in contact with them every day. It means that we have meetings with the Boards of the Companies and their chief officers from time to time.  We compare the progress they make with the progress made by companies of renown in other countries.  We make general comparisons&mdash;always general comparisons&mdash;always exhorting them on a general basis, but not interfering with the day-to-day operations of any particular company.</P>
    <P>We also study the quality of service they give the public in a general way, comparing it with the quality of service given by other companies abroad, to ensure that their customers, who are the public, are being reasonably treated, that for the money they pay they get good value.  I count it entirely wrong and against the interests of these companies, and the public in the long run, if we were to make pin-pricking interferences with their day to day operations.  What we do is to examine these questions in a big way and, as I said, have discussions with the Boards on the basis of general efficiency, general mode of production, general relations with workers, and general costings.  I thought that would be fairly obvious to most Deputies but I think it is just as well that I stress what is our purpose.</P>
    <P>It would be very inadvisable for me to encourage Deputies to ask individual questions as to why railway carriages on a certain line were dirty, but what I would wish to encourage Deputies to do is to complain to the companies themselves, and to encourage the public to make complaints to these companies if the service they receive is poor.  I think this procedure is fair and reasonable.  I would intervene if I became aware that a large number of Deputies were getting a large number of complaints in regard to a particular company, if I became aware that quite evidently a large number of the public <Col N="1001" /> were complaining about the services provided by the company for them.</P>
    <P>Then it would cease to be a day-to-day question.  It would become a matter of public interest and I would certainly intervene with the Board of that company and ask why the volume of complaints had reached such a level that I had to have regard to it.  That is a very different matter from my having to answer questions in detail as to whether the remuneration of certain employees of a company being transferred to another company was to be the same as the other employees of that company, when I know that the industrial tribunal&mdash;a trade union committee&mdash;had good relations with the company's management and that the men's interests were being looked after.  There would be absolute chaos if I interfered unilaterally in a particular case because a Deputy asked questions.</P>
    <P>I could repeat examples of that <i>ad infinitum</i>, showing the very great undesirability of my answering questions of a day-to-day character when it would be better for the people concerned if the Deputy addressed his questions to the companies themselves. So far as I know Deputies receive courteous replies reasonably promptly in regard to the questions they ask. There again, if there are many complaints that the replies they receive are long delayed, are discourteous, or show lack of regard for the matters complained of, it would be part of my general responsibility to see that the public relations of these companies were improved so that complaints would be properly and efficiently investigated, whether they come from Deputies, Senators or the general public at large.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made this matter sufficiently clear.  Of course, quite a considerable amount of freedom has been allowed in the course of this debate by the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  They have taken a liberal attitude in regard to the extent and detail of the questions asked.  This would be a matter for the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to control in future.  Now that we have a separate <Col N="1002" /> Department, the position is different. I think it very proper that the Ceann Comhairle has allowed a very liberal amount of detailed comment.  I think it could be useful in future years.  It gives me a fair idea of what people are thinking of the general progress of these companies, and the rather detailed matters raised in these questions I can consider myself, discuss with the officers of my Department or refer to them for consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth raised the question of the general control of State companies and he suggested that we ought to have further thoughts on this subject which has been so much discussed in other countries as to how far State companies should be free of examination by the Parliament of the country concerned, free of investigation by Committees of the Parliament and by the Minister himself.  I think the best thing I can do is to remind Deputy Booth of a question asked by Deputy McQuillan in regard to this matter on the control of State and semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in replying, said:</P>
    <P>In the case of those of the principal State-sponsored bodies referred to by the Deputy which do not receive annual grants but the capital of which has been wholly or mainly subscribed or guaranteed by the State, I would, if there is a substantial demand in the House for such a procedure, be prepared to consider whether there is need for an arrangement whereby the House would be asked to allow time periodically for discussion of a motion dealing with the report and accounts of each such body which have been laid before the House pursuant to statute.</P>
    <P>So the Taoiseach has suggested a method whereby, in addition to the debate on the Estimate, if a number of Deputies asked for a particular debate by resolution, on the presentation of the annual accounts of one of these numerous State companies, that might be arranged.  The Taoiseach has said that he is prepared to consider an arrangement whereby there could be such a discussion outside the <Col N="1003" /> scope of the debate on the Estimate itself.  I do not know if that is likely to arise in future.  I hope these State companies will continue to be run and administered so as not to warrant such a particular examination but it is impossible to foretell the future.</P>
    <P>Now I should like to deal with matters related to the C.I.E.  Deputy McGilligan, in the course of his speech, suggested that the C.I.E. was interpreting the terms of the Transport Act of 1958, which directed the C.I.E. to become an economically-run organisation as soon as possible, making no loss, by ruthless pruning, by reduction in services at the expense of the public.</P>
    <P>A number of other Deputies, without definitely saying as much, asked me questions as to whether C.I.E. was going to pay at the expense of the public in a large measure, so I want to make it perfectly clear that, so far as I am concerned, my interpretation of the Act is that C.I.E. should be economically run, should cease to impose the burden of taxation on the public which at the moment amounts to 3d. in the £ on income tax, 3d. on every 20 cigarettes, 4d. on every gallon of petrol and 4d. on every gallon of diesel oil, to use a combination of taxes to illustrate the subsidy.  I hope that that subsidy will eventually end, but that the services of C.I.E. will improve, will become more modern, will become more attuned to modern conditions, that if the railway lines have to be replaced by buses, the buses will provide a better service, letting passengers up and down at more numerous points, and that the railway service will improve, that there will be greater turn-over of business of every kind, enabling still better service to be given to the public.</P>
    <P>I should also make it clear that since the Transport Act, 1958, was passed I am not aware of any deterioration in the service of C.I.E.  I am aware of a railway line that has been closed and where two buses daily have replaced the train service and have provided an adequate service.  One does not have a railway in an area where two buses can replace the railway.  There the <Col N="1004" /> railway is out of date.  There the railway operated under conditions where the only alternative was the horse. There the bus is more convenient and lets passengers down at more frequent intervals.  In fact, on this particular line, I find it hard to believe but the fact is that the bus does the journey within ten minutes of the time taken by the train although the stopping points on the bus route are far more numerous and far more convenient to the people concerned than the stopping places on the railway line now closed.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I want to make it absolutely clear that there is to be no ruthless pruning of the transport service in this country.  C.I.E. is not bound under the 1958 Act to provide substitute services and that is the only section of the Bill of 1958 which was challenged by the Opposition.  The whole of the rest of it was passed bag and baggage by this House after the then Minister for Industry and Commerce had made some concessions on compensation and a few other matters but, when he had made these concessions the whole of the Bill was passed unanimously, with the exception of that one section.  In fact, I do not envisage C.I.E. on more than a very rare number of occasions abolishing a train service without providing an equally good bus service and freight lorry service.  I believe also that they would only do so if they found that there was a private individual already prepared to take over the service and that they were not particularly anxious to provide a bus or freight service.  I do not believe they will take unfair advantage of that section which, as I say, was the only one disputed in this House in any measure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell hinted that if it was necessary to subsidise the railway, the railway should be subsidised.  He was talking about indirect benefits provided by a railway service.  Of course, one could go on the basis that the State should subsidise everything on the ground that there were indirect advantages of subsidisation.  One can justify almost any subsidy if one seeks an argument sufficiently clever, agile and sometimes distorted but in the case of C.I.E., where there is such a surplus <Col N="1005" /> of transport around it and competing with it already, I feel that to subsidise C.I.E. unnecessarily and to subsidise C.I.E. any further than it is at present being subsidised and to adopt any other policy than has been decided by this House would be sheer inflation, the kind of thing we want to get rid of.  It has a demoralising effect on the employers and the workers.  It has a demoralising effect on the public and gives the public the false impression that so long as the taxpayer can keep on oiling the wheels everything will be all right and, as we all know, we are not going to become a great nation by following that principle.</P>
    <P>I have dealt to a fair extent with the question of lines that are closing.  So far, the lines that are closed have been substituted by a very small number of bus services, for example, the Cahirciveen-Valentia railway line has been substituted adequately by two bus services a day with a third three times a week, indicating the very low volume of traffic transferred from the rail service to the road service.</P>
    <P>In a number of cases the Minister for Local Government is giving for one, two, three, or four years a grant to county councils to do a once-and-for-all improvement to their roads where the roads are likely to be very much affected, sometimes only in very small areas around bends and so on, by the ending of the railway service.  The Kerry County Council, for example, is getting £50,000 over a period of four years.  At the end of that period the capital improvement required for the roads will be completed with the aid of these grants and I do not think there will be any complaints.</P>
    <P>There are many areas, of course, where the traffic is so low that the only improvement required is the easing of certain bends.  Quite obviously, if it is really a fact that the whole of the rail services if transferred to the road, would increase road traffic by three per cent. over the country at large, the amount of damage that can be done to roads and the dangers that may occur through transfer of traffic to road services is not likely to be very great and can be reasonably met by these contributions that are being made by the Minister for Local Government, <Col N="1006" /> which are not likely to be large save in isolated cases in isolated stretches of road.</P>
    <P>I should also say that the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Transport and Power have in the past ten years received almost no complaints of note when any utterly uneconomic railway service has been closed.  It is a remarkable fact that people both here and in other countries have an almost hysterical feeling when a railway is going to close, as though the end of the world is coming.  Although a railway service, while extremely economic and right in certain places, is utterly out of date in other places and in circumstances where a bus service is more appropriate, nevertheless, people have this strange feeling.  But, it is a temporary feeling and it passes away and we have had very, very few complaints, hardly any at all, and only complaints of a character that can be quickly rectified.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies have spoken about railway lines that may close in future and have spoken about the disaster that will occur.  My answer is that if enough people are using the railway the line will not close and the disaster will not occur.  What the Deputies call a disaster occurs when practically no one is using the railway.  These are the hard facts about the situation.  I have asked C.I.E., as I indicated in my opening speech, to make the examination of the lines that are likely to be classified as uneconomic as quickly as possible over a period of the next 12 months so that decisions can be taken which will give a feeling of certainty to the staffs, will give the staffs a feeling of security in regard to their future position along those lines that are obviously going to be retained and will leave as few lines as possible in a questionable position. I am quite sure that the C.I.E. Board will follow the course which we have suggested and with which, in fact, I know they agree.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that it was wrong to pass on to the public increase of wages in the case of State companies and, in particular, in the case of C.I.E.  State companies naturally must follow the pattern of <Col N="1007" /> wage increases elsewhere and I am sure I am right in saying in the case of the State companies that if an improvement in productivity can enable part of the wage award&mdash;or even the whole of it&mdash;not to be passed on, that will certainly be done.  But if productivity does not increase sufficiently, inevitably the wage award must be passed on to the public in the form of increased costs of services as in the case of private industries.  To do anything else would simply involve us in the principle of robbing Peter to pay Paul and we would get nowhere.</P>
    <P>A great number of Deputies referred to the question of C.I.E. pensions and I accept the difficulties of the present pensioners but there is a Social Insurance Bill coming before the Dáil under which the position of C.I.E. pensioners will be improved. That will necessarily involve a study of the whole pension position in C.I.E. and it will involve equally a study of whatever differences will arise between one group of pensioners and another.  I am quite certain that C.I.E. will make a study of the pension position and will do what they can about the matter.  I think I can entrust it to them.  The present C.I.E. pensions are calculated on an actuarial basis and the funds they hold could not be used to increase pensions as was suggested by one Deputy.  Any increase in pensions is a matter which would involve C.I.E. itself and the workers.  They are both involved; the workers must be consulted if there is any change.  It would seem to me that the first thing to do is to study C.I.E. pensions in relation to the Social Insurance Bill and Deputies will have an opportunity of doing that when the Bill comes before them.  I think they will find that a very considerable number of pensioners is covered by the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan asked questions about the staff employed by C.I.E. and the G.N.R. from 1958 to 1960. In 1958 the C.I.E. and G.N.R. staffs numbered 22,623; in 1960, C.I.E., which is combined with the G.N.R., employed 22,000.  The annual wages <Col N="1008" /> and salaries bill for the 22,623 was £10,362,000 and the annual wages and salary bill for the 22,000 was £10,866,000, so that there was a slight increase in the wages and salaries bill for a very slightly reduced number of workers.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also asked for the increase in C.I.E. rates and charges since 1958.  In May, 1958, there was an increase of 5 per cent. in passenger charges and provincial bus fares and an increase of 5 per cent. in road freight charges and, in the case of city bus fares, the stages were shortened and the minimum 2d. fare was abolished. There was an increase in rail freight charges in January/February, Passenger train and provincial bus fares were increased by 7½ per cent.; rail freight charges were increased by 10 per cent. and city bus fare stages were shortened.  I should say in that connection that a comparison of rail fares and freight rates between this country and other countries in the sterling area and particularly Britain, shows that the charges here are reasonable.  There is no gross inflation of either bus fares or road freight or rail freight rates as a result of these increases.  While I hope that the use of work study techniques will cut out costs and increase output and enable C.I.E. to avoid increasing charges in the future they must naturally bear in mind current costings.  I hope they will be able to make progress in that direction and that the charges will not become excessive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the position compare with wages in other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got those figures, but while I cannot recall the exact figures in regard to freight labour costs, in 1954 there were three times as many people handling passenger trains here in relation to the number of passengers carried as there were on the average for the whole of Europe so that if the question of comparing wages is asked the answer is that there has been such a low utilisation of passenger carriages and railway wagons that the amount of staff employed in handling them per <Col N="1009" /> million-ton miles or per million passenger-miles is very much greater here than the average for Europe.  In spite of that the charges for passenger services and for freight are not on the whole unreasonable.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan, and perhaps also Deputy Lindsay, asked for the number of miles of railroad recently closed.  The answer is 268 out of 2,142 miles.  The saving already effected has been £215,000.  Deputy McGilligan wanted some comparison about the number of lorries licensed in relation to the general service of road freight of C.I.E.  I am afraid, because of changes in the pattern of our economy, it is impossible to make any real statistical comparison but in August 1958 a total of 43,433 lorries was licensed and in August 1949 the total was 43,634.  That includes C.I.E. carriers.  The C.I.E. road freight service carried 2,265,000 tons of goods in 1957/58; 1,970,000 tons of goods in 1958/59 and 2,620,000 tons of goods in 1959/60, showing that they have increased their tonnage.  Yet, as I said, it is impossible to find any real relationship between the increased tonnage of goods carried by C.I.E. and the number of lorries licensed because of various technical factors that are easy to understand.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch of Waterford referred to vandalism on the railway.  I heartily support the decision of C.I.E. to get really tough with the vandals and the yahoos on the railway.  I read of the most scandalous incidents taking place, drunken people wrecking carriages and so on, and I fully support the action of the board in regard to this matter.  Passengers should be respected and left in peace.  The people who get drunk and destroy railway property should be prosecuted to the utmost limit of the law.  I entirely agree with Deputy Lynch in what he said.</P>
      <P>Deputy Geoghegan suggested there should be more mystery tours around the Galway area and that the bus service should be improved.  I hope he will write to the general manager of C.I.E. and make some specific suggestions to him.  I am sure they will be taken up with enthusiasm, if they would pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> Deputy Coogan referred to the scrap lying around the C.I.E. system.  I am glad to tell Deputy Coogan that very large revenues are accruing to C.I.E. which were not included in their recent statement of provisional accounts for the year ended March 31st, 1960, for scrap sold.  The end of this terrible collection of old railway engines is in sight; at least they are beginning to collect them and dispose of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point I wished to make.  I want some of these engines, which I might describe as being in the mothball stage, to be kept for an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid most of these steam engines have gone beyond the mothball stage.  In regard to schoolchildren, I understand special rates operate for them.  If Deputy Coogan has some observations to make on that matter, he should make them to C.I.E. but I am told there are special rates for schoolchildren travelling on a train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not apply in my area.  It was by bus I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a special bus chartered, then there can be a special rate arranged.  There are special school fares in the city.  The Deputy can make his observations to the company about it.  I merely wanted to mention that C.I.E. have a fairly wide range of special rates for children.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay referred to long distance buses following the railway route.  It is true that some buses do follow the railway route; others travel by different routes.  For example, the Cork bus does not follow the railway at all or hardly at all the whole way to Cork, and some of the buses going through my constituency take a different route from the railways.  However, all that is being examined under the work study techniques to see that the bus services are properly utilised in relation to the rail service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay may be interested to know that an initial examination already reveals that few of those people travel the whole distance and <Col N="1011" /> quite a large percentage of them do not even travel between points that correspond with the main railway stations.  They get out at one place and get in at another, and the bus service, although it seems to rival the railway, is in fact carrying out a very useful purpose in setting down people at various points over a comparatively long stretch of the road.  That whole question is being examined by C.I.E. at present and C.I.E. are also examining the value of the feeder service to the railways that was suggested by Deputy Lindsay.</P>
    <P>Deputy P.J. Burke raised the question of the Howth bus service.  He should address his observations to the Dublin Corporation.  The road is unsuitable and until the road is improved, it will be impossible to provide an adequate bus service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch of Waterford suggested that if 6d. were charged on the trains from Waterford to Tramore, the trains would be full.  The Deputy should make his proposal to the manager of C.I.E. and I can assure him that the calculations that have to be made to prove whether such fare reductions are profitable are just the kind of work now being done by C.I.E.  They have a staff of people there whose sole purpose is to examine all the possibilities of that kind, and that suggestion should be made to them direct.</P>
    <P>Deputy P.J. Burke raised the question of pensions for canal employees. Redundant employees are receiving reasonably generous compensation. There are some persons who have, for example, been lock-keepers and whose only payment was a free house.  They may be in a slightly different position but I do not believe C.I.E. will be ungenerous to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the Bray line.  I think the decision made by C.I.E. is a reasonable one, and it does not involve the use of any extra buses in so far as the closing of the stations near Dublin is concerned The train service becomes slightly faster.  Reasonable fares and season tickets at reasonable rates are offered <Col N="1012" /> to people to use the trains twice a day. The fact remains that the huge majority of people do not want to travel by train.  The service is being retained because of the excursions and because C.I.E. now believe that the new plan for speeding up the service and closing certain stations will make the service pay.</P>
    <P>I hope it will not be necessary to make any further changes but when I read all the letters in the newspapers about the vast congestion on the roads and the deaths that would occur if the Bray railway were closed &mdash; I am not of course including the service to the mail boat in Dún Laoghaire &mdash; I am prompted to say that the entire rail service to Bray could be replaced by just 26 double-deck buses.  People persist in exaggerating the congestion caused by the closing of a rail service.</P>
    <P>I quite understand that the Bray-Dublin area is one where there is a specific demand for a railway service, but there are a vast number of other people who will not get into one vehicle, drive to the station, get out of a vehicle, get into the station, get into the train, get out of the train and sometimes have to take a bus further on.  Even though there are parking difficulties in Dublin, there are huge numbers of people who will simply not do that.</P>
    <P>There are people to whom the Bray service is very convenient and I am sure the arrangements that have been made by C.I.E. and the changes taking place will satisfy everyone, with the exception of the small minority who will be affected by the closing of the stations near Dublin.  Let us not talk about the vast congestion that will be thrown on the road when 26 buses would replace the entire train service during the day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan and Deputy Geoghegan raised the question of the shipment of cattle from the Aran Islands to Galway fair on 31st May and 1st June, 1960.  I understand that on 28th May, 132 cattle were available for shipment at Kilronan.  The full complement of the Naomh Éanna, 71, was shipped to Galway that day. The remaining 61 were shipped on 30th May, arriving in Galway at about <Col N="1013" /> midnight on that date.  Had C.I.E. been asked, the 61 cattle shipped on 30th May could have been shipped on the 29th, which was a Sunday.  The delay took place because the 29th was a Sunday and they were not asked to ship them on that day.  There was a similar, reasonably good explanation of what took place on the subsequent occasion.  I do not need to give the details.  If the Deputy requires them, I shall write to him about the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner suggested that certain types of employees should be allowed to travel free by C.I.E., particularly those who were about to be declared redundant.  I think those employees should make that suggestion to C.I.E. to see whether any concession can be made to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Casey made a very excellent suggestion that other State companies should, wherever possible, give their traffic to C.I.E.  I am glad to say that C.I.E. have been negotiating for traffic with the E.S.B., the Sugar Company and local authorities.  C.I.E. of their own volition suggested to me that it is much better that they should negotiate on a commercial basis and that the influence of the Department of Transport and Power should not be used to compel, or even to persuade, these bodies to make use of C.I.E.  If the C.I.E. commercial sales service is first-class, then objectives which are not related to a purely commercial concern will be appreciated by other State bodies and local authorities.  All that we have done, therefore, is to encourage these bodies to consider offers made to them by C.I.E. in a general spirit of co-operation and to give C.I.E. a fair chance.  I think results will be achieved satisfactorily in that way.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of harbours.  Deputy Moloney asked about an application for a grant for Dingle harbour.  I am not sure whether the interests of Dingle are not purely of a fishery character.  If the harbour commissioners should suggest there are commercial interests involved in the improvement of the harbour, naturally we would consider the proposition on its merits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> Deputy Coogan asked me about Galway harbour.  He half implied that I wanted to torpedo the Galway harbour plan.  Then he took that back and suggested I wanted to cut down the cost of the harbour development plan.  My answer simply is that I am in negotiation with the Galway Harbour Commissioners.  I believe that Galway harbour can be improved to the point where it can take at least double its present tonnage satisfactorily  and satisfy the needs of both importers and exporters in the area. I just happen to differ from the Harbour Commissioners about how much that need cost, but I am quite definitely going to propose to the Government a scheme which will enable Galway harbour to take part in the potentially increased traffic we hope will be available to it and other ports along the western coast.  I am proposing this scheme, even though, as I told the Harbour Commissioners in Galway, the great improvement expected in western harbours has not materialised to the extent forecast before and after the war, chiefly because of changes in the pattern of coastal shipping which have taken place not only in this country but in other countries as well.  I am still, however, prepared to enable Galway harbour to take part in an expansion in shipping trade through the medium of the plans I have suggested to the Galway Harbour Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke raised the question of Skerries harbour.  This harbour is administered by the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  So far as I know, even though it is largely a fishery harbour, any improvement would be a matter for the Minister for Lands.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. Lynch mentioned Waterford harbour.  A deputation is coming to the Department in regard to that. They have made proposals in relation to the purchase of the North Wharf. I do not think we have had any final proposals from Waterford yet, but we will be willing to see the representatives in order to discuss suggestions for the improvement of the harbour.</P>
      <P>Deputy Geoghegan questioned the design of the Aran Island vessel, the Naomh Éanna.  This vessel was designed by a naval architect.  I understand the design was based on a sort of compromise having regard to the local conditions experienced.  The best possible design has been adopted. I hope the vessel will prove satisfactory to the people of the islands.  It was designed after the architect had been made fully acquainted with the conditions under which it will sail.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay raised the question of Ballina harbour.  We are examining the proposals made by the Harbour Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the difficulties experienced by passengers at Dún Laoghaire.  I do not think I need to say very much on this matter because speakers, as a whole, balanced each other.  Some of them made ferocious attacks on British Railways.  Others pointed out, quite rightly, that we do tremendous damage to the tourist industry when we exaggerate incidents which occur on a few occasions out of the entire 365 days <Col N="1016" /> in the year.  It has to be remembered that on the majority of occasions passengers are properly, safely and expeditiously disembarked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall be meeting very soon the new head of the Midland Board of the British Transport Commission, Sir Reginald Wilson, and his advisers.  We shall once more discuss with them this question.  We want to discuss the best method of maintaining the highest possible level of service. If we can, we want to persuade the British Transport Commission to do the very best they can to bring the service up to the level experienced in travelling on other Channel routes, while, at the same time, admitting quite definitely that there are some occasional peaks of 48 to 72 hours which are beyond anything experienced on any other Channel journey.  For the complete solution of the problem of the very high peaks, one would require a vessel which, in all probability, one would not use again for the rest of the year.  What is wanted is a reasonable service and proper attention paid to the needs of these people.  I hope we shall secure some improvement in time.</P>
      <P>I should add that there have been very considerable improvements over the last five years and I want to pay tribute to An Bord Fáilte which has been constantly in touch with British Railways in relation to this problem. As compared with six years ago, conditions at Dún Laoghaire have been enormously improved through the reconstruction of the pier and the provision of amenities.  At the same time, we hope to secure a greater improvement in the service and the complete disappearance, if possible, of incidents which, on the face of them, do create the impression that they are caused because of lack of attention unrelated to a very high peak traffic of a kind which no one can handle in the circumstances to the best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde and Deputy T. Lynch referred to the utilisation of southern routes from Great Britain to this country.  Both referred to the Rosslare-Fishguard route.  An effort <Col N="1017" /> was made by An Bord Fáilte to secure more interest in that route and to promote, by advertisement, more traffic between Great Britain and the southern part of the country through Rosslare-Fishguard.  So far, there has not been any great measure of success. There has been an improvement in regard to the car service in that cars can now arrive later at Fishguard as compared with heretofore.  We secured that concession.  We are examining the possibility of some improvements in Rosslare Harbour itself.  That is a matter for C.I.E. and the other Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton made some complaint about the North Wall.  I have not yet had an opportunity of examining the general position of passengers on that service from Dublin to Liverpool, and we will have a look at it to see whether, from the general standpoint of the country, it is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the air companies.  A number of Deputies seemed to suggest that because the air companies do not yet pay interest on capital advanced to them by the State, why should we not subsidise C.I.E.? The answer is very simple.  Air transport is a new business, developing here largely since the war and involving the finding of enormous amounts of risk capital.  The risk capital involved is so large that it is impossible to remunerate that capital in the early stages. It is quite a different transport set-up from C.I.E. which was a well established body, most of whose rolling stock was in existence at the end of the war and which has lost £23,000,000 in the past ten years.  I just cannot see any comparison.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be progress in regard to the financial position of all these air companies.  In reply to Deputy McGilligan, I should say that he can get the accounts of Aer Lingus, Aer Línte and Aer Rianta and he can see the expenditure and receipts on Aer Línte from the year of operation up to the 31st March, 1959, and very shortly for the ensuing year.  He can study their expenditure and receipts and study the deficit in relation to it.  Aer Lingus, in the year ended 31st March, 1959, made £48,000 <Col N="1018" /> after paying depreciation and superannuation and after having paid interest on the money advanced to them by banks.  They have not yet been able to start paying interest on money advanced to them by the State.  If they can make progress, I can foresee the day when they can begin to pay a small dividend on the State capital they have received so that they will gradually, I hope, get into a satisfactory position financially.</P>
    <P>In regard to the airports, I gave a full statement in my Estimate speech of the expenses and receipts.  I made quite clear what the position was in regard to depreciation and interest on capital.  As I indicated, Shannon Airport is virtually paying for itself. Its profits have been sufficient to pay interest on capital and depreciation, and I understand that up to now it has amortised the capital invested in it to the extent of £700,000.  Dublin Airport is not yet in that position but there has been a gradual improvement over the years.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the losses of Aer Línte.  I wish to make it clear that in the first year of operation Aer Línte made less of a loss than had been predicted in November, 1957, some months before the service started.  For the next year they made a greater loss.  Taking these losses together, the total increase in the deficit was 11 per cent. above that predicted in November, 1957.  I do not think that is unsatisfactory under the circumstances.  The accounts for Aer Línte are published at page 42 of the combined accounts of Aer Lingus, Aer Línte and Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the air ferry service and to the speech made by Lord Ogmore in the House of Lords. In common with Deputy Cosgrave I should like to thank Lord Ogmore for his observations and to state that we are doing everything possible to expand the car air ferry services in general.  The difficulty is of course to find suitable airports within a short distance of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell asked about the maintenance of the Boeing jets.  Aer Línte found that the case for maintaining <Col N="1019" /> the jets in Dublin and not in Shannon was, in the financial sense, overwhelming, that they have to be maintained at the end point of their journey, which is Dublin.  Moreover, the overheads involved in having two separate major workshops &mdash; and workshops not only for maintenance but for changing engines and doing all the other complicated operations involved in the handling of the Boeing jets &mdash; would be far too great.  Therefore, they decided it was best to carry out the work in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked about employment by the new industries in Shannon Airport.  I should say in reply that there were advertisements in the public Press indicating the skills which were required for employment in the Shannon factories.  The Shannon Company is in close touch with the vocational teachers in the area, and the Deputy should advise the young people in whom he is interested to consult the local vocational officers and the personnel officer of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  The new industries will require many different kinds of industrial workers and the position is not static.  In some cases, for example, the industries have had to recruit skilled workers in England and bring emigrants home to this country. One industry alone is looking for over 40 skilled workers at present employed in England.  They have to have these skilled workers immediately.  They will be able to train others as part of their production programme, but they actually have to get skilled workers from England because there is nobody unemployed in this country capable of doing the jobs required.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made reference to the catering establishment at Shannon Airport.  I wish to say I have complete confidence in the activities of the catering manager who, I think, has appointed an excellent staff.</P>
    <P>The question of the agreement between Aer Lingus and the other companies in Shannon for maintenance is a matter for the internal management of Aer Lingus in which I do not propose to interfere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> I should make it clear in regard to the Shannon Industrial Estate that goods produced at Shannon may be imported into the rest of the country, but, if so, the appropriate duty must be paid and no tax remission on the profits of Irish sales is allowed.  There seemed to be some doubt about that. That is the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan repeated the statement made on previous occasions in this House that the excess generating capacity which the E.S.B. had over the last few years was due to the action of my predecessor in compelling the E.S.B. to erect generating stations which the E.S.B. did not consider necessary.  I do not propose to retrace all the history of the generating programme as this has been gone into previously during debates in this House.  I wish to repeat, however, the statement made by my predecessor that the programme for the extension of generating capacity submitted by the E.S.B. was drawn up by the Board without any pressure from the Department.  It was based on estimates made by the Board of the growth in the consumption of electricity.  It is true that as a result of an unexpected decline in the rate of increase in electricity consumption, some excess capacity existed in the last few years. However, I can state definitely that at present there is no excess generating plant in the country.  All the plant in existence is required to meet current demands, allowing for occasions when there is a reduction in one particular sector through either excessively dry weather or excessively wet weather.  In fact the new generating stations are required and have been put in hand in order to meet the increased consumption of electricity.  This programme is based on an estimated increase of seven per cent. per annum.  In fact, at a recent date the increased consumption was 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan made play about the excess cost thrown on the E.S.B. by reason of the excess capacity.  I pointed out that this was only of a temporary character and has now nearly disappeared.  I should say the action of denying the E.S.B. £5 millions of subsidies for rural electrification <Col N="1021" /> is having a severe effect on the financial position of the E.S.B. That was done deliberately by the last Government and it has meant that a burden of interest has been thrown on to the E.S.B. for rural electrification which was not justified under the circumstances.  The Fianna Fáil Government decided that once and for all we should give a capital subsidy for rural electrification and that the system afterwards must pay for itself.  The urban consumer, the industrial consumer and the country consumer together pay for the burden. This subsidy was necessary to enable rural electrification to be completed in a country where there are fewer clusters of people in rural areas than in any other European country except Sweden.</P>
    <P>A higher proportion of people live in this country in clusters of fewer than 200 people than in any other country except Sweden.  We are not a village community and as a result the cost of rural electrification is terrific.  Because of that we are willing to give this subsidy.  For rural electrification to be economic the basic rate charge on a household should be about 12 per cent. of the capital charges involved, not in producing current, but in bringing current to the consumers.  The E.S.B. are prepared to do that work although the amount contributed by the consumer is only four per cent. of the capital charge and not 12 per cent.  That has been the system and now the E.S.B. lacks £5 million of the capital contribution which is very much more important to them than this business of the excess generating capacity about which Deputy McGilligan spoke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner asked how this calculation was made. The answer is that the Board will connect a particular house on the basis that the consumer will pay a fixed charge which amounts to four per cent. of the capital cost of doing the work.  The area is taken for making the calculation.  If the houses <Col N="1022" /> are very far apart, a special calculation is made in respect of each house.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond said that certain areas were omitted from the scheme. As the House knows, the E.S.B. will be getting to the end of the present scheme in the next two or three years when an estimated 95 per cent. of the area of the country will be covered by an electricity network and within that 95 per cent. area, roughly 75 per cent. of the houses will be joined to the power system.  Consideration will have to be given at the end of that period to the question of what further steps should be taken.  I should say that, with the exception of areas where there are very few houses, the areas that have not taken current are not in most cases poorer than corresponding areas which have taken current.  That is the case in a number of different counties throughout the country.  There is no chance of there being any subsidy for the provision of current.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde raised the question of the redundancy in employment likely to take place when rural electrification comes to an end.  I should say that the great majority of the labourers employed are casual.  The supervisory personnel of the E.S.B. are small in number and I hope they will be absorbed on other E.S.B. work because of the general expansion of the system and the growth generally in the number of generating stations.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan asked a question in regard to the financial position of Bord na Móna and referred to the &ldquo;truly frightening loss&rdquo; of nearly £1,000,000 in 1958.  I have not seen the Financial Statement for the year ended March 31st, 1960, but I understand that the financial position was satisfactory.  There was no recurrence of this very heavy loss which was occasioned by the weather experienced in that year and which, as the House knows, was unique for this country for, in a major respect, nearly 100 years and in a minor respect at least ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as employment is concerned, questions were asked about the average employment and the peak employment in Bord na Móna.  I should say that the employment position is <Col N="1023" /> complicated by the fact that bogs are being developed all the time.  Then the development ceases and production alone continues in the area.  It will be sufficient to give the figures for average employment.  In 1955-56 it was 4,886.  It was roughly the same the next year.  It was 4,631 in 1957-58; 4,637 in 1958-59; and 4,757 in 1959-60. The peak employment followed the same pattern and rose to nearly 7,000 last year.  As I said, those figures are affected by the fact that there is development work of a very large order on different bogs and then development work ends.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much more I need say except to tell Deputy Russell that the gasification of turf for use in Dublin proved to be inadvisable and that the experiments with the use of wind for generating electric power are still being carried on by the E.S.B.  I think I have dealt with virtually all the major points raised in this debate.  I have not dealt with Irish Shipping but I invite Deputy McGilligan to look at the published accounts of Irish Shipping Limited in which he will see the progress which is being made. Deputy Russell raised the question as to whether it is advisable to build ships now.  The answer is that we have to trust the Board of Irish Shipping who know that the time to build ships is when the cost of building is reasonable and when they hope they see an end to the slump in freight rates. I believe that the programme of substituting vessels which are now out-of-date by new vessels is a wise one. Looking at the general history of Irish Shipping, I think the Board can be trusted to decide when it is good to build new ships.</P>

    <P>Go ndeonfar suim nach mó ná £367,730 chun slánuithe na suime is <Col N="1024" /> gá chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfas chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1961, le haghaidh Tuarastal agus Costas Roinn na Gaeltachta maille le deontais le haghaidh Tithe agus Ildeontais-i-gCabhair.</P>
    <P>Taispeánann an Meastachán don bhliain seo méadú de £40,120 glan ar an soláthar a rinneadh don bhliain seo caite.  Sé an chúis is mó atá leis an ardú sin ná méadú de £59,850 a bheith sa soláthar le haghaidh Tithe Gaeltachta agus méaduithe de £13,805 in iomlán sa soláthar le haghaidh seirbhísí cultúrtha, coláistí Gaeilge agus scoláireachtaí saoire agus scoile sa Ghaeltacht.  Ina gcoinne sin cuirtear sábhála de £33,500 in iomlán sa soláthar le haghaidh scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht, an deontas-i- gcabhair do Ghaeltarra Éireann agus an deontas £5.</P>
    <P>Taispeánann an Meastachán sábhála freisin sa soláthar le haghaidh tuarastal, costaisí taistil agus costaisí teagmhasacha, torthaí mara agus cúnaimh teicniúil ach baineann an t-iomlán atá i gceist ansin, £39,280, go díreach leis an laghdú de £39,345 san iomlán a bheas le fáil mar leithreasa-i-gcabhair mar a mhíneoidh mé níos déanaí agus mé ag caint ar na fo-mhírchinn ar leith.</P>
    <P>Tagann an tsábháil ar thuarastail, pá agus liúntais, go formhór de bharr foireann teicniúil na dtionscal tuaithe a aistriú go seirbhís Ghaeltarra Éireann tar éis don Bhord Scéim Aoisliúntas a dhéanamh dá oifigigh agus seirbhísigh faoi réir an Achta um Thionscail na Gaeltachta, 1957.  Leagadh an Scéim sin faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas ag deireadh mí Iúil seo caite agus le linn Lúnasa agus Meán Fómhair haistríodh na bainistreása agus teicneóirí eile nár Stát-seirbhisigh bhunaithe iad chuig seirbhís an Bhoird.  Bhí soláthar de £15,000 le haghaidh tuarastal na nOifigeach sin i Vóta na bliana seo caite agus sábhálfar é sin i mbliana. Ar an taobh eile dhe, áfach, bhí soláthar ann an bhliain seo caite chun an £15,000 sin a aisghnóthú ó Ghaeltaira Éireann agus é a ghlacadh chun creidis an Vóta mar leithreasa-i-gcabhair.  Ní bheidh a chomh-mhéid le fáil mar leithreasa-i-gcabhair i mbliana.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> Tá sábháil freisin ar thuarastail i mbliana toisc an obair a bhain le bailiú na dtorthaí mara d'aistriú chun cúram an ghnóluchta, Arramara Teoranta, le feidhm ón gcéad lá de Dheireadh Fómhair seo caite.  Do haistríodh chun seirbhíse an ghnólachta freisin na hOifigigh neamh-bhunaithe a bhí ar fhoirinn mo Roinne chun an obair bhailiúcháin sin a mhaoirsiú agus de thoradh a n-aistrithe sin beidh sábháil i mbliana ar thuarastail agus freisin ar chostais taistil agus costais teaghmhasacha a bhain lena ndualgais mhaoirseoireachta.</P>
    <P>Go dtí gur aistríodh obair bhailiúcháin na dTorthaí Mara chun cúram Arramara Teoranta bhí soláthar i Vóta na Roinne chun na slataí mara agus cineálacha eile feamainne a cheannach agus soláthar ann freisin chun an t-airgead a faightí ar a ndíol a ghlacadh chun creidis mar leithreasa-i-gcabhair. Sábhálfar an costas ceannacháin feasta ach ar an taobh eile dhe beidh ísliú ar an bhfáltas mar leithreasa-i-gcabhair. Chífear gur beag an difríocht atá idir an t-iomlán a fuarthas anuraidh ar na Torthaí Mara a dhíol sé sin £19,168 agus an t-iomlán de £19,078 a sábháilfear ar na slataí mara agus feamainne a cheannach sé sin, £15,145, agus na sábhála a bheas ar thuarastail sé sin, £1,720, costais taistil sé sin, £2,063, agus costais teagmhasacha £150.</P>
    <P>Moltar soláthar de £100,000 a dhéanamh i mbliana mar dheontas-i-gcabhair do Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Tá ísliú ansin de £10,000 ar an soláthar a rinneadh an bhliain seo caite ach mar a tharla ní raibh an soláthar iomlán ag teastáil ón mBord anuraidh agus níor ghá ach £85,000 a chur ar fáil dó mar dheontas-i-gcabhair.</P>
    <P>I rith na bliana seo caite bhí 1,345 daoine fostaithe i gceantair na n-ionad tionscail &mdash; fir tuairim is an ceathrú chuid díobh.  Bhí timpeall leath an líon oibritheoirí sin ar fostú lán-ama sna hionaid oibre agus an leath eile ar fostú páirt-ama ina dtithe féin. Tháinig forbairt ar an tionscal láimhchniotála i rith na bliana seo caite agus bhí gá le tuilleadh oibritheoirí d'fhostú. San iomlán bhí céad duine níos mó fostaithe ag an mBord ná mar a bhí sa bhliain roimhe sin.  Dá bharr sin agus de bharr méadaithe sna rátaí pé <Col N="1026" /> i gcásanna áirithe do híocadh £27,795 níos mó mar phá ná an méid a híocadh, sé sin, £149,365, sa bhliain roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>Díoladh luach níos mó ná leathmhilliún punt earraí sa bhliain. B'ionann, nach mór, an díol sa Stát an díol ann sa bhliain roimhe sin, ach thit luach na ndíolachán thar lear. Tuigim go bhfuil an Bord tar éis suirbhéireacht a dhéanamh anois ar na margaí thar lear agus socraithe nua déanta acu chun díolacháin a spreagadh i dtíortha áirithe.  Tá a fhios agam go dtuigeann an Bord a thábhachtaí atá sé san am i láthair go n-onnmhuireofaí oiread earraí agus is féidir agus tá gach dóchas agam go n-éireoidh leo san iarracht atá á dhéanamh acu chuige sin.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-Mhírcheann E deantar soláthar le haghaidh deontas faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht).  Sa bhliain airgeadais 1959/60 críochnaíodh 153 tithe nua, feabhsaíodh 199 tithe, cuireadh saoráidí sláintíochta i 78 tithe agus rinneadh méadú speisialta ar 5 tithe.</P>
    <P>Thainig méadú arís ar an gcaiteachas faoi na hAchtanna ó £78,000 i 1958/59 go tuairim is £85,000 i 1959/60.  Meastar go dtiocfaidh méadú arís ar an obair sa bhliain airgeadais seo de bharr an Achta nua a ritheadh anuraidh agus gur gá £150,000 a sholáthar chuige i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh tús le hobair in i bhfad níos mó cásanna i rith na bliana seo caite.  Ceadaíodh deontais de luach timpeall £140,000 i dtuairim 900 cásanna i gcomparáid le deontais de luach £54,000 i 413 cásanna sa bhliain airgeadais roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>Ó ritheadh an tAcht nua i mí Iúil, 1959 tá méadú mór tagtha ar líon na n-iarratas.  Fritheadh ós cionn 1,500 iarratais i 1959/60 i gcomparáid le tuairim 850 i 1958/9.  Nuair a cuimhnítear go dtógann sé dhá bhliain de ghnáth ón dáta a ceadaítear cás go dtí go n-íoctar an tráthchuid deireannach den deontas, tá sé soiléir gur sa bhliain reatha agus sa bhliain seo chugainn a bheidh an chuid is mó den airgead, a bhainfidh leis na hiarratais sin, le n-íoc. Mar is eol do na Teachtaí, méadaíodh na deontais tógála, na deontais feabhsúcháin agus na deontais sláintíochta <Col N="1027" /> san Acht nua agus tá cosúlacht ann go mbainfidh muintir na Gaeltachta mórán tairbhe as na deontaisí nua.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ro-luath fós a rá cé mar a néiróidh leis an iarracht atá á dhéanamh trí na deontais i leith méadaithe speisialta, seallaí saoire agus brúnna ach tá dóchas agam, as na figiúirí atá agam go dtí seo, go n-éireoidh go maith leis.  Fritheadh 10 iarratais faoi Scéim na mBrúnna, 30 faoi Scéim na seallaí saoire agus 73 ar dheontais i leith méadaithe speisialta suas go deireadh Márta seo caite agus tá cosúlacht ann go dtiocfaidh méadú mór ar líon na n-iarratas sin i rith na bliana seo.  Dar ndóigh is rudaí nua ar fad Scéim na mBrúnna agus Scéim na seallaí saoire agus tógfaidh sé tamall sara mbeidh na scéimeanna sin faoi lán-tseol.  Ach táim cinnte go rachaidh siad chun mór-thairbhe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta má bhaineann na daoine feidhm cheart iomlán astu.</P>
    <P>Tá gnólachtaí sa tír atá in ann seallaí réamh-dhéanta lena nglacfaidh an Roinn a sholáthar ar phraghasanna réasúnta nó, más fearr leis na hiarratasóirí iad, tá pleananna ullmhaithe ag an Roinn le seallaí saoire a thógáil ar an ngnáth-nós.  Is gnó é seo inar féidir leis na Teachtaí a bhfuil aon bhaint acu leis an nGaeltacht cabhair a thabhairt trí na daoine a spreagadh i ngach slí is féidir chun na deontais a úsáid ar mhaithe leo féin.</P>
    <P>Is as Fó-mhírcheann F a cuirfear an t-airgead ar fáil le haghaidh scéimeanna feabhsúcháin na Roinne i mbliana.  Fé mar a míníodh i ndáil le Meastachán na bliana seo caite, tá na húdaráis áitiúla agus muintir na Gaeltachta ag dul i dtaithí na scéimeanna sin do réir a chéile.  Tháinig méadú arís sa bhliain 1959/60 ar an éileamh ortha.  I gcás na scéimeanna uisce-sholáthair, mar shampla, tugadh 40% breise amach i bhfoirm deontaisí sa bhliain 1959/60 i gcomparáid leis an mbliain roimhe sin.  Cé gur méadú mór é sin níl sé in aon ghaor de bheith chomh mór leis an méadú a rabhthas ag súil leis ag féachaint do no meastacháin a chuir na húdaráis áitiúla ar fáil roimhré.  Maidir leis an leathnú atá á dhéanamh ar scéim na dtithe gloine, níorbh fhéidir an scéim a <Col N="1028" /> chríochnú laistigh den bhliain airgeadais 1959/60 amhail mar a measadh a déanfaí agus, cé go raibh an scéim leathnúcháin faoi lán-tseol i gConamara agus i dTuar Mhic Éadaigh um dheireadh na bliana sin, fágadh timpeall £34,000 den tsoláthar £53,000 a bhí i Vóta na Roinne chun na críche sin gan caitheamh toisc nach rabhthas ullamh chun na híocaíochta d'údarú. Bhain an deacracht chéanna le roinnt scéimeanna beaga eile ar cuireadh airgead i leataoibh dóibh ach nár éirigh leis na heagrais a raibh baint acu leo iad a chur i gcrích laistigh den bhliain airgeadais amhail mar a mheasadar a dhéanfaidís.</P>
    <P>Dá dhroim sin uile, fágadh £80,000 gan caitheamh sa bhliain 1959/60 as an £170,000 a cuireadh ar fáil le haghaidh na Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin.</P>
    <P>Ag féachaint don éileamh atá ar scéimeanna feabhsúcháin na Roinne, más ea, agus don éiginteacht a ghabhann leis na meastacháin a cuirtear ar fáil ina leith, meastar, de dhroim na taithí a bhí ag an Roinn ar na cúrsaí seo le cúpla bliain anuas, gur leor suim £150,000 d'fhonn riaradh ar riachtanaisí na Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa bhliain 1960/61.</P>
    <P>Fé mar is gnáthach i ndáil leis an Meastachán seo, bhéarfaidh mé cuntas gairid anois ar an obair atá ar siúl agus ar an dul chun chinn atá á dhéanamh faoi na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin.  Is iad seo leanas na scéimeanna:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Faoi Scéim na mBóithar, tugtar deontas, 100% den chostas, a cuirtear ar fáil trí Oifig na Scéimeanna Fostaíochta Speisialta, d'fhonn riaradh ar bhóithre áise, is é sin bóithre nach bhfuil freagracht reachtúil ar na húdaráis áitiúla ná ar éinne eile ina leith.  Is é beartas na Roinne airgead na mbóthar faoin bhfo-mhírcheann seo a chaitheamh ar bhóithre den tsórt sin ó tharla nach bhfuil amhras ar bith ann ná go bhfuil géar-ghá le cúnamh airgid i gcás na mbóthar áise sa Ghaeltacht. Ní mór, ámh, cionúireacht bheag den tsoláthar a chur ar fáil, go ceann tréimhse teoranta, le haghaidh na mbóthar contae chun go bhféadfar críoch a chur le hoibreacha feabhsúcháin áirithe ar tosnaíodh orthu le blianta beaga anuas sarar socraíodh <Col N="1029" /> ar chaiteachas na Roinne a chúngú go dtí na bóithre áise.  Faoi réir an choinníll sin, féadfar glacadh leis gur leis na bóithre áise amháin a bhainfidh deontaisí bóthair na Roinne chomh fada chun cinn agus is léir dúinn.</P>
    <P>Tá dhá chineál deontais á dtabhairt ag an Roinn do na húdaráis áitiúla i leith scéimeanna uisce-sholáthair, deontas 50% &mdash; 60% i gcás caidéal agus mionscéimeanna píopaithe agus cumhachta, agus deontas 25% i gcás scéimeanna réigiúnacha.  I gcás na scéimeanna réigiúnacha sin bíonn cabhair le fáil freisin ón Roinn Rialtais Áitiúil, is é sin cúnamh airgid i leith muirear aon iasachta a bheas á fháil ag na húdaráis áitiúla i ndáil leis na hoibreacha a bheas i gceist.  Fé mar d'fhógair an tAire Rialtais Áitiúil tamall ó shoin, táthar tar éis an cúnamh sin a mhéadú ó 43.1/3 &mdash; 50% go dtí 60% de mhuirear na hiasachta. Nuair a cuirtear deontas na Roinne seo agus cúnamh airgid na Roinne Rialtais Áitiúil san áireamh i dteannta a chéile, más ea, chítear go bhfuil timpeall 70% de chostas na scéimeanna le fáil in aisce ag na húdaráis áitiúla i ndáil le tograí uisce-sholáthair a cuirtear i gcrích sa Ghaeltacht.  Chítear dom gur cabhair an-mhór í sin agus gur cóir go mba leor í chun a chur ar chumas na núdarás áitiúla áird ar leith a thabhairt ar chás na Gaeltachta ó thaobh cúrsaí uisce-sholáthair.  Tá dóchas agam go dtiocfaidh borradh dá réir ar na cúrsaí sna blianta amach anseo.  Fé mar adúradh cheana tá cosúlacht ar an scéal go bhfuil an borradh sin ag tosnú cheana féin.</P>
    <P>Faoi Scéim Mion-Oibreacha Mara, tugann an Roinn deontaisí lán-chostais i leith muir-oibreacha áirithe sa Ghaeltacht ar choinníoll go mbeidh na húdaráis áitiúla iomchuí sásta cothabháil na n-oibreacha sin a ghlacadh mar cúram orthu féin tar éis a ndéanta. Fágtar faoi Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí, de ghnáth, tograí den tsórt sin a chur i gcrích.  Sa bhliain seo caite caitheadh beagán ós cionn £4,000 ar an scéim seo ach, má éiríonn le hOifig na nOibreacha Poiblí clár oibre na bliana seo a comhlíonadh, meastar go mbeidh caiteachas £14,000 ann ar oibreacha éagsúla.</P>
    <P>D'éirigh go maith le Scéim na Muc <Col N="1030" /> aris anuraidh: timpeall 50 cráin a tugadh amach.  Tá ar intinn tuairim is 70 cráin a thabhairt amach sa bhliain airgeadais reatha agus táthar tar éis an scéim a leathnú go dtí Co.  Chorcaighe agus Co.  Phortláirge, is é sin le rá, go bhfuil feidhm ag an scéim anois ar fud na Gaeltachta uile.</P>
    <P>Tá an obair faoi lán-tseol anois i ndáil le leathnú Scéim na dTithe Gloine, mar adúirt mé cheana.  Tá teas á chur isteach i naoi gcinn déag de na sean-tithe i gCois Fharraige.  Tá dhá cheann déag de thithe nua á dtógáil i dTuar Mhic Éadaigh.  Ní bheidh a thuilleadh i gceist, ó tharla nach bhfuarthas dóthain iarrataisí chun go bhféadfaí aonad 20 teach a bhunú amhail mar a bhí ar intinn ag an Roinn.  Tá fiche ceann nua eile á dtógáil i gCois Fharraige, agus tá súil agam go bhféadfaimíd gléas teasa a chur sna tithe nua sin uile roimh dheireadh na bliana airgeadais reatha. Comhairlítear dom gur fearr go mbeidh deis ag na fásadóirí nua teacht isteach ar an gcéird sara gcuirfear an teas ar fáil dóibh.  Beidh costas tuairim £35,000 ag dul leis an scéim i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Tá an Scéim chun cabhrú le meánscolaíocht sa Ghaeltacht ag dul ar aghaidh go sásúil agus is deimhin liom go dtiocfaidh mór-thairbhe don Ghaeltacht aistí sna blianta atá romhainn. Íocadh deontais de mhéid £8,300 i rith na bliana seo caite.  Tá tuilleadh oibre faoin scéim ar siúl i láthair na huaire agus meastar go mbeadh suas le £15,000 ag teastáil chun riaradh ar riachtanais na scéime i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Scéim nua i Scéim na Hallaí Siamsa trína gcuirtear deontaisí ar fáil suas go dtí 80% den chostas measta, faoi theorainn uasta de £5,000 i leith aon deontais áirithe, do choistí áitiúla chun hallaí a thógáil, a dheisiú nó a fheistiú. Leanfaidh an scéim i bhfeidhm go dtí an 31 Márta, 1965, agus cuirfidh an Roinn suas go dtí £10,000 in aghaidh na bliana airgeadais ar fáil le haghaidh na scéime fhaid a mhairfidh sí.  Meastar go mbeidh caiteachas £10,000 faoin scéim ann i mbliana agus go mbeidh éileamh níos fairsinge ar an gcúnamh airgid seo sna blianta atá le teacht.</P>
    <P>Baineann Scéim Saoráidí Ilghnéitheacha le saoráidí éagsúla, mar shampla, <Col N="1031" /> piniúirí liathróid láimhe, faichí imeartha, linnte snámha, etc.  Tugtar deontaisí suas go dtí 80% den chostas measta ina leith siúd.  D'ainneoin téarmaí na scéime a bheith chomh fábharach sin, is ábhar iontais é, mar adúradh anuraidh cheana, a laghad tairbhe is a baineadh as na deontaisí seo ó tugadh isteach iad.</P>
    <P>Tá deontaisí suas go dtí 80% den chostas measta ar fáil ón Roinn freisin i ndáil le scéimeanna trialacha talmhaíochta. Tá scéimeanna den tsórt sin (maoth-thorthaí is mó atá i gceist) ar siúl i gCo.  Chiarraighe, Co. Chorcaighe agus Co.  Phortláirge le cabhair na gcoistí talmhaíochta ansin.  Sa chás seo arís níl éileamh chomh mór ar na scéimeanna, ná borradh chomh mór ag teacht fúthu, is beifí ag súil leis ag féachaint do na téarmaí a ghabhas leo.</P>
    <P>Is é fírinne an scéil, i gcás scéimeanna den tsórt seo, nach féidir tairbhe na ndeontas a thabhairt do dhream ar bith mura mbeidh sásta na scéimeanna d'ullmhú agus a riaradh.  Tá téarmaí na scéimeanna ar eolas go fóirleathan ag pobal agus údaráis na Gaeltachta cheana féin.  Más féidir leo dul i mbun oibre beidh cabhair airgid ar fáil acu go fial ón Roinn.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-Mhírcheann H den Mheastachán, tá £2,000 á sholáthar i mbliana chun deontais bheaga a thabhairt le haghaidh imeachtaí cultúrtha agus sóisialacha sa Ghaeltacht, mar shompla, deontaisí i leith feiseanna agus féilí drámaíochta agus cúnamh airgid chun oirnéisí ceoil agus a leithéid a chur ar fáil do choistí áitiúla sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Chífear go bhfuil laghdú beag déanta i mbliana ar an méid atá á sholáthar faoi Fo-Mhírcheann I le haghaidh an deontais £5.  Meastar go bhfuil an figiúr £48,000 níos goire don chaiteachas a bheidh ag teastáil i mbliana.  Faoi mar is eol do na Teachtaí tá laghdú ginearálta tagtha ar an líon daoine sna ceantair tuaithe i gcoitinne, agus tá laghdú mar an gcéanna tagtha dá dheasca sin ar uimhir na bpáistí sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá £5,000 á sholáthar faoi Fho-Mhírcheann L i mbliana le cabhrú chun foirgintí a thógáil, a shealbhú, a <Col N="1032" /> oiriúnú agus a fheistiú mar Choláistí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Is cosúil go mbeidh tuilleadh iarratas ag teacht chugainn i leith Coláistí Gaeilge sna blianta atá amach romhainn.</P>
    <P>Níl aon athrú ar an soláthar faoi Fho-Mhírcheann M den Mheastachán agus ní dóigh liom gur gá aon rud a rá faoi.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-Mhírcheann N den Mheastachán, tugtar cúnamh airgid do choistí áitiúla, faoi scéim a bunaíodh i 1936, chun scoláireachtaí saoire sa Ghaeltacht a thabhairt do pháistí ó áiteanna lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Do hardaíodh an uasteorainn aoise faoin scéim go dtí 18 mbliana, d'fhonn scóip na scéime a leathnú do dhaltaí meánscoile agus, mar thoradh ar sin, tá méadú mór tagtha ar líon na bpáistí atá páirteach sa scéim faoi láthair. Tá £7,500 á sholáthar don bhliain 1960 i gcompráid le £4,685 (agus Meastachán Foirlíontach a áireamh) a soláthraíodh don bhliain 1959.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta sin, tá scéim trialach á chur i bhfeidhm i mbliana trína gcuirfear suas le 300 scoláirí ag freas-tal ar scoileanna éagsúla sa Ghaeltacht le linn téarma scoile amháin sa bhliain airgeadais.  Íocfaidh an Roinn deontais de leath an chostais suas go dtí £17 10s. 0d. an scoláire, agus tá £5,000 dá sholáthar faoin bhfo-mhírcheann seo ina leith.  Déanfaidh Gael-Linn an scéim a reachtáil i mbliana ar bhun trialach agus is fúthu sin a bhéas na socruithe go léir maidir le toghadh na bpáistí agus iad a chur chun na Gaeltachta.  Socróidh siad freisin faoin bhfuílleach den chostas a chur dá bhailiú.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go maith leis an triail seo agus go mbeidh ar mo chumas é a mhéadú sna blianta atá rómhainn.</P>
    <P>Is iad príomh-fheidhmeanna Roinn na Gaeltachta leas cultúrtha agus geilleagrach na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn agus cabhrú le caomhaint agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáthurlabhra. Tá límistéirí feidhme na Roinne leagtha amach in Ordú na Límistéirí Gaeltachta, 1956.  Ag comhlíonadh a feidhmeanna di, chítear don Roinn gur ceart di féachaint le cumas tuillimh mhuintir na Gaeltachta a mhéadú, caighdeán maireachtála na ndaoine a ardú, agus an cultúr Gaelach <Col N="1033" /> a chothú agus saoráidí oideachais a fheabhsú.  Tá eolas tugtha agam ar na hiarrachtaí atá á ndéanamh chuige sin, agus tá súil agam go n-aontóidh an Dáil liom go bhfuil fiúntas éigin sna hiarrachtaí sin.  Is go príomha chun neartú le cumas tuillimh na ndaoine a ceapadh na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin a bhfuil saothrú ag dul leo.</P>
    <P>I gcúrsaí tionscail, is eol don Dáil gur ar Ghaeltarra Éireann atá anois cúram na dtionscal tuaithe a bhíodh á riaradh ag an Roinn roimhe seo. Chomh fada agus a bhaineann leis an gcaighdeán maireachtála a ardú, is mór an leas a dhéanfaidh an cúnamh fial atá le fáil faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) agus ní beag le rá sa gcaoi sin na scéimeanna uisce-sholáthair, scéim an gháis bhuidéalaithe agus na deontais atá le fáil le haghaidh hallaí siamsa, faichí imeartha, piniúirí liathróid láimhe, linnte snámha agus a leithéid.  Agus is cinnte gur tairbhe don chultúr dúchais agus do chúrsaí oideachais scéimeanna ar nós an deontas £5, scoláireachtaí saoire sa Ghaeltacht, deontais drámaíochta, deontais le haghaidh oirnéisí ceoil, féilí agus feiseanna agus go háirithe an scéim atá againn le cabhrú le meánscolaíocht sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá ar intinn agam go leanfar de na hiarrachtaí atá ar bun againn agus beidh mé toilteanach i gcónaí aon mholtaí a thiocfaidh chugam agus a measfar a rachadh chun leasa don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht a bhreithniú chomh báúil agus is féidir. Is maith liom é bheith le rá arís i mbliana go bhfuil comhoibriú agus comhairle le fáil go fial ó údaráis agus eagrais agus daoine a bhfuil suim acu sa Gaeltacht.  Gabhaim buíochas leo uile thar mo cheann féin agus thar ceann na Roinne.</P>

      <P>Cé go bhfuil méadú breis is £40,000 sa Mheastachán seo, níl áfach, maitheas ar bith ann, ach amháin go bhfuil níos mó le fáil i dtaobh deontas tithe.  Ach ní ionann sin is a rá go dtógfaí níos mó tithe i mbliana, agus maidir leis an deontas £5, ní féidir a rá ach go bhfuil sprionlaitheacht mhór annsin.  Ó mo thaithí féin ar an scéal, ní bhronnfar an deontas £5 agus an deontas tí má bhíonn athair an líontí lag sa Ghaeilge. Is éagóir é sin, agus rud a dhéanann an-díobháil don teanga.</P>
      <P>Ar an taobh eile, is maith liom go mór an méadú ar scoláireachtaí chun na Gaeltachta agus le haghaidh na gColáistí Gaeilge.  Is rudaí maithe iad sin agus is mór an trua liom nach bhfuil níos mó rudaí maithe ann.</P>
      <P>As I said at the beginning in Irish, we are delighted to see the Minister back from his recent bout of illness and looking none the worse for it.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion on which the Estimate for the Department of the Gaeltacht was debated here, I, as the person responsible from these benches to speak to it, did not speak to it and I am speaking to it this time out of deference to the present occupant of the Ministry and in sharp contrast with the attitude which I adopted towards his predecessor.  Whatever political differences there may be between the present occupant of the Ministry and myself, as there must be differences, having regard to the fact that one is Government and the other Opposition, I concede straightaway that long before he occupied the Ministry which he now occupies, he always spoke Irish, took an interest in it and used it at every available opportunity.  The same cannot be said in regard to the person to whose speech in Irish I took serious exception.  What I meant at the time when I said that I was not going to speak Irish in this House to the same degree as I might like to was that I felt that the Gaeltacht had been insulted on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate, although it does provide for an overall increase of £40,000, does not really give rise to any reason for pride or boasting.  The increase, by and large, is due to the <Col N="1035" /> fact that there have been substantial increases in housing grants but, of course, as I have already said, that does not mean that in fact houses will be built.  It is a money increase for individual houses and a consequent increase in the overall Estimate.</P>
    <P>The other small increases which I welcome are the increases for scholarships to the Gaeltacht and for the setting up of colleges in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the £5 prize money to children between six and 16 years of age is indicative of many things.  In speaking in Irish, I termed it niggardly and showing a loss of hope.  The Minister's own reasons are even worse than that.  It is not a loss of hope; it is an expression of facts as they are, namely, that there are fewer people in the Gaeltacht and fewer schoolgoing children there than there were even last year when it was necessary to set aside £51,000 for the £5 prize for Irish-speaking children.</P>
    <P>All through his speech, the Minister has talked about various schemes, various things that are going ahead.  I hope that is true.  I hope they are going ahead, particularly the tomato glasshouses in the various Gaeltachta, but I do think that something should be done to speed up the provision of heating for the glasshouses in Tourmakeady which we have seen recently and in which there is no heating as yet.</P>
    <P>With regard to water supplies, that is something taken over from the Department of Local Government and is a scheme set on foot by Deputy O'Donnell when he was Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>About Scéim na Muc or the Sow Scheme for the Gaeltacht, I do not take the same optimistic view as the Minister.  When the scheme was being instituted in the House, Deputy Dillon said that all that would happen would be that instead of getting sows through the ordinary channels of the Department of Agriculture and getting good ones, people would get sows not quite so good at this lesser price through the Department of the Gaeltacht.  From my information, it seems that that is true, that there has been a great deal <Col N="1036" /> of dissatisfaction, and I should like the Minister to state, when replying how many such sows were actually supplied in each Gaeltacht.  The figure of 50 as an overall figure for the whole Gaeltacht is not sufficiently satisfying from the point of view of getting information as to how this scheme is being availed of.</P>
    <P>By and large, the story is that the Gaeltacht is dwindling in terms of young people and that is contained, not implicitly, but explicitly, in the Minister's speech.  There are fewer people there and fewer children there. I do not know that you are going to keep them there by building handball alleys, providing playing fields and building swimming pools, particularly if the youth are not there to play in the handball alleys, swim in the pools or play in the parks.</P>
    <P>It is a feature of the whole seaboard that houses are closing and whole families are going away.  The provision of suitable employment in those areas would have a far better effect in stemming emigration than trying to make things pleasant for the old people who are left and the few children who are being born there who might enjoy these amenities in time to come.</P>
    <P>I want to know why, when questions are put down in the House to the Minister for Finance in relation to slips and piers, they are transferred to the Minister for the Gaeltacht and why he takes responsibility for them when I heard him say at Aughleam, near Blacksod in Mayo, that all he could do was to receive representations, consider them and make representations to the appropriate Departments. I do not think he should accept responsibility for them and allow himself to be the channel through which these things are by-passed by the authorities that should take greater interest in them.</P>
    <P>I am rather disappointed that the Minister has not given more elaborate or more revealing figures about Gaeltarra Éireann.  Gaeltarra Éireann, as everybody now knows, was set up under an independent board pursuant to a policy which was taken over from us by the present Government and a policy with which we agree.  How the Board has worked out in practice, of <Col N="1037" /> course, is a different matter altogether. The only account we have seen from them to date is the printed booklet of Gaeltarra Éireann, an céad tuarastal bliantúil, namely, their first annual report for the year 1958/59, and that, in itself, is a revealing document, much as I imagine it was not intended to reveal anything.</P>
    <P>First of all, let us be quite clear as to the amount of the grant-in-aid set aside for Gaeltarra Éireann from its inception.  That grant was £220,000. When a grant-in-aid is being sought by a Department, it is fine-combed in that Department and fine-combed afterwards in the Department of Finance before it is allowed into an Estimate and it is computed, from my experience, on the basis not alone of the amount required but the amount it is within the competence and ability of a particular Department or semi-State body to use in the course of its year's working.</P>
    <P>What happened in that first year for which £220,000 was made available by way of grant-in-aid?  All that Gaeltarra Éireann actually asked for and received was £120,285, almost £100,000 less than they said they required.  Either they were doing extremely well during that year or there was an incorrect estimate.  By whom was the incorrect estimate made?  I do not accept for a moment that they did not require that extra £100,000 because they actually show a trading loss of £82,000 and if they had taken the whole of the grant-in-aid there would not have been any loss at all in relation to their trading.</P>
    <P>All I have, of course, is this little booklet.  I do not know whether the Minister was referring &mdash; I think he was &mdash;to the year ending 31st March in relation to Gaeltarra Éireann when he said that over £500,000 worth of goods were sold in the year.  I should like to know what the actual figure is, if available, for the year ending 31st March, 1960.  I should like to know what those goods were and whether they can be classified by the Minister in his reply into the various categories set out in the report of 1958-59, namely, <Col N="1038" /> under the headings of tweed, toys, machine-knit garments, hand-knit garments and linen.  The curious thing about the workings of the Board is that their total sales for 1957-58 were £583,294 and in the following year, 1958-59, up to the 31st March that year, their total sales under the headings I have given were £542,244, slightly over £41,000 of a reduction.</P>
    <P>We now come to another interesting little table in this report for 1957-58 which says that on the 31st March, 1958, the stock which the Board held amounted in value to £426,763 and the next year's stock is placed at £405,345, a reduction of nearly £20,000.  How is that reduction in stock value accounted for?  It is rather curious that while the sales have gone down from 1957-58 into 1958-59 the stock has also gone down although one would be led to believe that the picture is that there has been a certain amount of progress. Mark you, there is a good deal to be said &mdash; having regard to these figures&mdash; for the reference this evening in the previous debate on the Estimate for Transport and Power where the Minister gave the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy McQuillan on some former occasion, that he thought there might be, or should be, an occasion for debate on State or semi-State concerns in addition to the debate on the Estimate, in which Deputies might seek to discover things for themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not think this statement of the Board is correct.  I know that it is published by the Board and that it has affixed to the back of it &mdash; not part of the published material &mdash; a certificate from the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.  From previous experience we know that people who are able to present things with a good face on them can get a certificate of that kind.  I am tempted to suggest&mdash; my temptation comes from a little more than speculation &mdash; that the full £220,000 was not drawn upon from the grant-in-aid because stock was sold, or a large portion of it was sold, and was not used to finance the purchase of new stock but was allowed to run into other expenses.  Neither do I accept the figure of £405,000 as being the real figure representing the <Col N="1039" /> value of the stock today and I propose at some future time, when the next report comes out, to ask for time by way of motion to discuss this matter in the House.  This is a field of activity that has given rise to considerable inquiry over some years past and it would appear that, certainly up to the 31st March, 1959, there is considerable room for further inquiry.</P>
    <P>This £82,000 of trading loss must be explained when the grant-in-aid was available to them.  The £426,000 for stock at the end of 1958 and the £405,000 at the end of 1959 must be explained by reference to specific articles, be they finished, part-finished or raw material.</P>
    <P>Some time in November, 1959, the Chairman of Gaeltarra Éireann, Mr. Briscoe, resigned and has been replaced &mdash; in a temporary fashion no doubt but continuing for a considerable length of time from November up to the present day &mdash; by the permanent head of the Civil Service Department of the Gaeltacht.  It is rather curious to note that while the same permanent head was the acting managing director of this firm the sales fell under his guidance by £40,000 in one year.  Now we have the situation where the Chairman of the Board is the same person despite the losses incurred during his period as managing director.  Now he is chairman in defiance of what was the stated object of the setting-up of this Board &mdash; to free Gaeltarra Éireann from the alleged restrictions to which it was subject under Civil Service procedure.</P>
    <P>I understand that all of the civil servants who operated Gaeltarra Éireann have now gone into various Departments, some into the Department of the Gaeltacht.  Suffice it to say, that the fact that the Board of whom the managing director was the permanent head of the Department of the Gaeltacht did not keep on one of these civil servants is a very grave reflection on them as a body and is a reflection to which I do not subscribe. I should like to know the reason for that, whether any of them got the option to stay on or whether they elected to move into different <Col N="1040" /> Departments where suitable places could be found for them.</P>
    <P>The method of recruitment of the new staff to the board provides, to say the least of it, a certain amount of amusement.  I understand that almost all of them come from a well-known football club and that they were able to secure appointment through the help of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice and the permanent head of the Department of the Gaeltacht, the Secretary, now the chairman of the Board and formerly the managing director.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Times</i> wrote a sub-leader on 17th May of this year taking the Board of Gaeltarra Éireann to task in so far as it had not realised the hopes that everybody placed in it when it was set up.  The <i>Irish Times</i> wrote a rather mild article, gently chastising, if you like to put it that way, but it was something, I thought, to which the Board of Gaeltarra Éireann might themselves have taken exception, if they felt that exception should be taken; but far from the Board of Gaeltarra Éireann taking exception &mdash; the chairman of the Board is permanent head of the Department of the Gaeltacht &mdash; the Minister's private secretary rushes into print.  The title of that sub-leader was &ldquo;Cutting Their Cloth&rdquo; and the letter replying to it was published on Friday 20th May, 1960.  It says:</P>

    <P>With reference to your leader of May 17th, the Minister for the Gaeltacht has asked me to inform you that he considers the general trend of your comments, and in particular your reference to maladministration, to be most unfair to the civil servants who administered the Gaeltach Services prior to the establishment of Gaeltarra Éireann and who were transferred on a temporary basis to the service of the new board when the latter assumed control of the industries.</P>
    <P>What else could the <i>Irish Times</i> say except that there must have been maladministration <Col N="1041" /> of some kind?  We are all conversant with a certain measure of maladministration during those days.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>The responsible Minister stated in the Dáil on the Second Reading of the Gaeltacht Industries Bill, 1957, that the conclusion had been reached after very careful and thorough consideration of the matter that, in view of the continued growth of the industries, the time had come when it was necessary to have them freed from the restrictions of Civil Service procedure, which is not designed to deal with businesses of a commercial nature.  This was the only reason for the establishment of the new board.</P>
    <P>Was it the only reason?  I can say, as somebody responsible and as a member of the Government that undertook the setting up of this new board, the arrangements for which were almost ready on the change of Government, that it was not the only reason.  I was not satisfied as Minister for the Gaeltacht that it was the only reason.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to say:</P>
    <P>It was the intention from the beginning to withdraw the Civil Service staff when the board had secured, as provided for in the Act, its own staff.  It is stated in the report which was the subject of your comments that 50 civil servants were returned to Government departments and 32 appointments made by the board to replace them. It is also stated in the report, however, though not mentioned by you, that other appointments remained to be made.</P>
    <P>Here is the private secretary to the Minister for the Gealtacht calmly acknowledging what the <i>Irish Times,</i> misinformed as they were, said, that only 50 civil servants went back. Ninety in fact, went back.</P>
    <P>The letter continues:</P>
    <P>The advice which you state the board received drastically to reorganise its staff can have had nothing whatever to do with the <Col N="1042" /> departure of the Civil Service staff from the service of the board.</P>
    <P>The letter is signed: &ldquo;E. Ó Cadhain, Private Secretary, Office of the Minister for the Gaeltacht, Dublin&rdquo; and dated May 19th, 1960.  I can well understand the Minister directing his private secretary to go gaily into print to defend the position of these civil servants but the way to have defended the position of the civil servants, particularly those men who had long experience and had given good service, was to retain them if they wished to stay, and I doubt very much if all of them opted to go.  I should be very surprised if they had.</P>
    <P>It is a rather unusual thing, particularly with a new board, the members of which must have been care fully selected &mdash; from my own knowledge, they were rather carefully selected &mdash; to have the chairman resigning in a very short time.  The Minister has a duty to inform the House as to why Mr. Briscoe resigned the chairmanship of Gaeltarra Éireann and further, why, if it is intended, as his own letter would seem to imply, to remove the restricting hand of Civil Service procedure from such a Board, the permanent head of the Gaeltacht has continued since November, 1959, as the chairman of this Board on a part-time basis.  Is it the intention of the Minister or the Government to fill this vacancy and get a competent chairman to take over the affairs of this undertaking?</P>
    <P>I hear that the sales of tweed are increasing.  That is a matter at which we must rejoice.  I hope that not alone will they increase but that they will double and treble themselves as time goes on.  That can only come from continued competence, improved methods and more care being given to design and patterns generally.  I am told the same situation obtains with regards to toys.  Certainly in Elly Bay in my constituency, everything seems to be going on well.  There was some difficulty recently about the toy factory at Crolly but Deputy O'Donnell was responsible for revealing an extraordinary situation when he questioned notice being served on the 19 people there.  He was told that <Col N="1043" /> notice was served only, that those people would be taken back or were being taken back because there was plenty of work available now.  I hope that is true and continues to be true not alone for the number there but for greater numbers in time to come.</P>
    <P>I am told the situation with regard to knitwear is not easy and that those who want to sell are faced with certain difficulties.  That situation is, of course, understandable because in many houses all over the country now there are knitting machines and a great many housewives are supplementing their incomes, or housekeeping money, by making knitwear.  That naturally makes for a glut.  It has to be remembered too that their products are not as highly costed as those of Gaeltarra Éireann.  One sympathises with the present management of Gaeltarra Éireann in their efforts to combat this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Far from being critical of the Board, apart from what I have said, and the points I have raised which need clarification, I am satisfied this Board is operating reasonably well.  We all &mdash;I certainly do at any rate &mdash; wish it well.  I hope it will go on from success to success.  Anything that may have happened with regard to it in the past happened with the best intention in the world, namely, to clear out the rot, get rid of the nonsense and ensure that those who invested would get value for their money.  I do not know exactly what success has attended those efforts but I do know that there is considerably more activity in relation to the promotion of sales abroad, particularly in the tweed line.  That is something upon which we must concentrate.  The world is crying out for tweed and we have the best tweed in the world.  If it is properly designed, properly woven, and properly dyed there will always be a market for it and there will be no complaints afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Minister should check with the Board on these figures because, on the face of them, they are suspicious.  I do not understand bookkeeping and all its intricacies, but it seems rather <Col N="1044" /> strange that sales can be down and stocks less when production has proceeded uniformly throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister in his efforts to deal with the problem of the Gaeltacht.  The task is a formidable one.  The atmosphere of the Gaeltacht is rapidly fading away.  I do not blame either the Government or the Department of the Gaeltacht for that.  There are other things, perhaps, to which attention might be directed, but what they are I must confess I cannot even conjecture.  I do not think the situation is improved by difficulties in relation to examinations to test linguistic ability where people are looking for a housing grant or the £5.  Where a man has had to find a wife from an English speaking area, or vice versa, and the children show a reasonable competence in Irish the examiner should not expect them to be on a par with himself linguistically speaking.  The examiner should also take into consideration &mdash; this is something that is not taken into consideration in my opinion &mdash; that when a stranger comes into a house and proceeds to talk with the youngest child in the house, which seems to be the main pattern set for these examinations, shyness and the difficulties children encounter in meeting strangers is not taken into account.  In such circumstances, I do not think we can reasonably expect much progress.</P>
    <P>Recently I had a reply to a communication from the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I made representations for a housing grant on behalf of a comparatively young man, his wife and children.  It was frankly admitted that the wife knew Irish, the children had Irish, but the husband was rather weak.  The letter then went on to say there did not appear to be any nature for the language, or any love of the language.  How, in the name of Providence, could an inspector find that out in the few minutes he spent in the house?  It is absurd to expect too high a standard on these occasions. By encouragement rather than by restriction more can be done to promote the language.  The application of sanctions will never revive the language.  Indeed, I do not see how <Col N="1045" /> one can ask people in areas where work is scarce and money difficult to come by, other then by migration or emigration on the part of some members of the family at least, to devote themselves to the study of Irish to the complete exclusion of English; after all, their ultimate destination will be Birmingham, Coventry, London, New York, Boston, or Philadelphia. In that light, it is an unreal situation to dream of or to aspire to.</P>

      <P>Do labhair an tAire mar gheall ar thithe gloine.  Tá siad á tógáil, maith go leor, ach tá moill mhor ann.  Rud eile atá ag cur isteach ar mhuintir na Fíor-Ghaeltachta i láthair na huaire isea deontas na dtithe ós rud é go bhfuil moill mhór sa chás sin freisin. Rinne mé caint faoi seo anuraidh, freisin.  D'iarr mé ar an Aire innealtóir breise a chur isteach i nGaillimh agus rinne sé amhlaidh ach ina dhiadh sin is uile bíonn moill ann i gcónaí.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> 'Siad na moillte is mó atá in aigne agam ná i leith téamh na dtithe.  Sílim go bhfuil Comhairle Contae na Gaillimhe ag feitheamh le scéal ón Roinn le beagnach ceathair nó cúig de mhíosa.  Ní raibh Comhairle Contae, na Gaillimhe in ann na deontais a íoc amach nuair nach bhfuair siad scéal ón Roinn seo maidir le téamh na dtithe sin.</P>
    <P>Ceist eile isea na deontais i leith céibheanna beaga.  Tá an tAire agus an Roinn ag iarraidh ar an gComhairle Contae, pé áit a bhfuil sé san Ghaeltacht, an ceathrú cuid a íoc.  Ní cóir agus ní ceart é sin ar aon chor.  Sílim gur chóir go n-íocfadh Roinn na Gaeltachta an deontas iomlán.  Ansin, bfhéidir go mbeadh an Chomhairle Contae, pé áit a bhfuil sé, sásta na céibheanna a thógáil &mdash; sin agus iad a choiméad i gcaoi as sin amach.</P>
