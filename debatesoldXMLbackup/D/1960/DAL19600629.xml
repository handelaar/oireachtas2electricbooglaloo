      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the townland of Cuilaghurrail is in the Lahardane Rural Area which was developed by the Board under the Rural Electrification Scheme in 1956. At the time of the development of this area the number of acceptances of supply by householders in the townland of Cuilaghurrail was not sufficient to enable the Board to provide supply except on very onerous terms and, in the course of a post-development construction programme which was completed in December, 1959, the position remained unchanged.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice Bill, 1960&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his introductory statement, covered the ground relating to the treatment of prisoners generally in prisons and places of detention.  Our Holy Father, the Pope, has set us all a good example in visiting the prisons of Rome during last Christmas season.  Emulating that example, it may be no harm to refer to certain matters the Minister has mentioned in his statement introducing this Bill from the point of view of someone incarcerated in a prison.  I do not want to employ a phrase which might possibly appear <Col N="568" /> to be uncomplimentary, but I did detect in the Minister's opening statement a measure of what I must describe as almost smug equanimity which I thought strange coming from one who I hoped had a full understanding of the problems with which he has to grapple.</P>
      <P>There are few Deputies who are not personally, or at least vicariously, familiar with the insides of prisons. Many of our colleagues have been inside as prisoners.  Some of us have heard at second hand of conditions within prisons.  Others of us accepted the prudent discipline of visiting the prisons when we became legislators so that we might have a clear knowledge of what we were doing if we legislated in such a way as to make it possible to imprison our neighbour. I visited all the prisons in this country, Borstal, the reformatories and some of the industrial schools.  One has always to bear in mind that, for anybody entering a penal institution of any kind for the first time, there is always the possibility that he may experience a certain feeling of shock. But, having recovered from that, it is, I think, the duty of all legislators to attempt at least to take an objective and a charitable view of the circumstances of people upon whom the misfortune of imprisonment has fallen.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in reviewing the text of this Bill, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Although no substantial modifications in the statutory code for the treatment of offenders have taken place since the establishment of the State a number of improvements in prison conditions have been effected by administrative action.  Prisoners receive more substantial meals of better quality.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is no harm to look at that statement from the point of view of a prisoner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly advise the Deputy not to accept that as gospel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;recently released from a penal institution.  We are all familiar with the volume which sometimes <Col N="569" /> appears over the name of a recently released prisoner, the contents of which are manifestly distorted by the sense of bitterness and resentment that one who suffered imprisonment is likely to experience.  This book, to which we shall attach no more importance than is its due, makes a claim upon our attention, in my opinion, because of the moderation of its language and because of the wise and generous tribute that is paid to the governor of the prison in which this prisoner spent his period of detention, the tribute he pays to the chief officer and the tribute he pays to the humanity, general decency, and kindness of the prison officers.</P>
      <P>I find that usually, if you read a story by a prisoner, it includes violent animadversions on those into whose custody the writer was delivered.  This story, from which I shall quote, is marked by the fact that it testifies rather to the kindness and humanity not only of the governor but of almost all the officers with whom he was brought in contact.  I am not asking the House to accept the quotations I give as anything approaching gospel, but I think they are a necessary antidote to the phrase employed by the Minister: &ldquo;Prisoners receive more substantial meals of better quality&rdquo;.  I have no doubt the Minister believes that.</P>
      <P>I should like to give the House now an impression of how those meals appear to the men who have to eat them.  One of them has it to say, at any rate, that the food is poor, inadequate and monotonous:</P>
      <P>The food a prisoner gets is limited to white bread, potatoes, cabbage, onions, tea, margarine, a morsel of beef or mutton, an infinitesimal portion of jam, the concoction called &ldquo;broth&rdquo;, and on Fridays one pint of milk and two ozs. of bread and ¾ oz. of margarine.</P>
      <P>The tea ration supplied at 4.30 is the same as that supplied at breakfast. For supper at 7.30 p.m. another pint of tea, four ozs. of bread with a little jam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four different kinds of dinner during the week.  On Mondays and Wednesdays it is Irish <Col N="570" /> Stew and 2 ozs. of bread.  What is called &ldquo;Irish Stew&rdquo; is not Irish Stew.  The dietary says mutton uncooked 8 ozs., potatoes 20 ozs., onion or carrot 2 ozs., and flour 2 ozs.  These ingredients are put in one 30 gallon pot and boiled together.  The potatoes weigh about 20 stone.  Six stone of mutton, cut in small pieces, is put in with the potatoes.  The mutton had always much more fat than lean in it and the fat was that woolly kind of suet that caused nausea when it touched a tender palate... Two stone of carrots or onions and two stone of flour are added.  The &ldquo;Irish Stew&rdquo; that resulted was a sodden mass of fat, flour and potatoes.  The onions or carrots gave little flavour to the mush.  As the stew cooled it congealed and became an uneatable and objectionable looking mess. Quite a lot of it was left uneaten by the hungry prisoners and found its way as swill to the pighouse... On Tuesdays and Saturdays the dietary consisted of 16 ozs. of cabbage, or other vegetables, four ozs. and bread 4 ozs... The meat came in miscellaneous pieces and was boiled the day before, just as it arrived, untrimmed, uncleaned, unblanched, in one of the 30 gallon pots.  The meat was taken out when boiled and the water was left in the pot overnight. On the following day some left-over stirabout, flour and onions were added and the whole re-boiled. This was the broth.  It was served from a milk can of the usual kind, with broad base and narrow mouth, by a prisoner using a pint milk measure.  Naturally it spilled against the narrow mouth of the milk can and soiled the server's shirt, coat-sleeves or bare arms...</P>
    <P>The dinner dietary on Thursday and Sundays was corned beef (uncooked 8 ozs.), cabbage 4 ozs., potatoes 16 ozs. and bread 4 ozs.</P>
    <P>In this case also the meat was cooked on the day before use.</P>
    <P>On Fridays the dinner dietary was rice 2 ozs., dry bread 8 ozs., and a pint of milk.  As an alternative the doctor might allow a prisoner to get <Col N="571" /> vegetable soup and 20 ozs. of potatoes instead of the rice and milk.</P>
    <P>The only vegetable was cabbage and I may interpolate that cabbage is a very good vegetable.</P>
    <P>The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>When it was unobtainable, a desert-spoonful of boiled onion mush or similar quantity of mashed parsnips, turnips or carrots was substituted for it.  The cabbage for about 250 was packed in cold water in one of the 30 gallon pots at 7 a.m., brought to the boil quickly and boiled continuously until sometime after 10 a.m.  It was then taken out of the pot, chopped on a wooden tray and put on plates with a tiny meat ration.  The plates of cabbage and cold meat were stacked, one on top of the other, in such a way that the bottom of one plate was bedded down on the cabbage and meat on the plate underneath it. All the plates so stacked were then placed on a tin or aluminium tray which was set on top of one of the 30 gallon pots containing boiling water from which the steam was rising.  The tray and the plates on it were then covered with a sheet and in this crude way an effort was unsuccessfully made to heat up the dinners before they were served at 12.30.  By dinner time the cabbage was dark, cold, smelly and unhealthy looking and could have had no value whatever.  At dinner time the potatoes in their jackets were put on top of the cabbage and meat on the plates and in this way the prisoner got his dinner.</P>
    <P>Many of the enamel plates on which the dinners are served were often damaged... Sometimes they leaked as a result of rust eating through the metal where the enamel had chipped or broken off.  The washing of the plates is carried out in accordance with the routine approved by the Minister.  The forty to forty-five plates for a class are collected by the prisoner who is class orderly and are, with the knives and forks, put into a bucket of warm <Col N="572" /> water and washed without soap or other detergent.  They are then dried with cloths, better not described.</P>
    <P>This prisoner goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The only cooking facilities provided in the prison kitchen are four 30-gallon pots, one 40-gallon pot and a steamer for the potatoes.  Everything, except the potatoes on four days a week, has to be boiled in those five pots....  The 40-gallon pot is used for making tea.  Of the remaining four, one is for stirabout, one for the cabbage, one for boiling meat, rice, broth or stew and one for hot water.</P>
    <P>I do not ask the House to accept that as a foolproof description of prison diet.  That is a view of the prison diet from the viewpoint of a man who had to consume it day in and day out for more than two years and who, evidently, came from a background where unpalatable food would not have been his ordinary diet.  On the other hand, it is the impression created on a man who experienced that over two years, not coming from a background of extravagant luxury where plain and common food would constitute an intolerable burden.  I offer it to the House merely as a comment on the phrase that &ldquo;a number of improvements in prison conditions have been effected by administrative action&rdquo;.  I am quoting from the Minister's statement which says &ldquo;prisoners receive more substantial meals of better quality&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I remember years ago visiting a county home in Roscommon in which some of my own neighbours were living. I was then a member of the board of health and I remember being greatly shocked to see these people being asked to eat their daily meals off chipped enamel plates.  I do not think it had occurred to anybody what a humiliation that was to them and what a daily hardship it was.  It had been going on for the previous 70 years and nobody had ever thought to change it, but I must say that the moment I drew it to the attention of my colleagues on the board of health, all the enamel plates were thrown away and we were able to substitute plain china and plain <Col N="573" /> delph.  The difference that made to people who had to take their meals day after day in the conditions of the old county home was very great.</P>
    <P>Today we are living in an era in which unbreakable crockery is readily available; yet prisoners are still continuing to eat off chipped enamel plates in Mountjoy Jail just because nobody has ever said anything about it.  Why not throw the whole lot out and get unbreakable plastic crockery and let these people have their meals in conditions which do not constitute a daily hardship on them?</P>
    <P>This is a little pamphlet to which I do not want to attach too much importance.  I simply offer it as a recent impression of a prisoner.  It is not extravagantly written.  It does not seek to make the case that everybody in Mountjoy is a highly cultivated person suffering under intolerable conditions. It readily recognises that the handling of prisoners in Mountjoy becomes an extremely difficult problem because many of them are of the most difficult kind, which this prisoner has no hesitation in stating can be classified as first offenders, frequent offenders, habitual offenders, &ldquo;moochers&rdquo;, those decrepit old beggars one sees from time to time all over the country, winers &mdash; more properly described as chronic alcoholics &mdash;&ldquo;knackers&rdquo;, being the tough type of itinerant tinker, and sexual offenders of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>These also have to be sub-divided into youthful offenders and adult offenders and the Minister is to be congratulated on recognising that some measure of segregation, particularly in respect of young persons at first committal on remand, was necessary and is taking powers to give effect to that desirable end.  But allowing for the fact that the type of prisoner ordinarily incarcerated in our prisons is of a very mixed type, I do not think it is an extravagant claim, (1), that we should substitute more suitable crockery than chipped enamel and, (2), that you are not providing &ldquo;more substantial meals of better quality,&rdquo; to quote the Minister's statement, simply by stipulating that there must be so much meat, so much vegetables, so <Col N="574" /> much raw materials.  No matter how much raw meat and vegetables there are, a meal is not a meal until it has been cooked and put before the person who has to eat it.</P>
    <P>Nobody, no reasonable person, expects that meals served in a penal institution will approximate to those served in one's home or in a restaurant, but I do think they ought to reach a certain standard of decency and that, in addition to the ordinary pains and penalties of detention, those of our neighbours who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in prison should not be asked to accept their food in conditions which I shall describe as sordid but which much more poetical language might pardonably be used to describe.  I am trying to soft-pedal this.  I could tear passion to tatters about the conditions in which these people get their food. However, I do not think that is necessary because I do not believe the Minister and I are in substantial difference about these matters.  For that reason, I am going to say the extracts I am reading are not guaranteed to be absolutely objective and clear, but I believe they present an aspect of this question to which the Minister's attention should be directed so that what is remiss can be put right.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say in his statement that prisoners are permitted cigarettes and tobacco at particular times of the day and in Portlaoise prison, where long-term prisoners are housed, the cigarettes and tobacco are supplied at State expense.  I think they are allowed six cigarettes a day at the State's expense in Portlaoise. I think that is a humanitarian and sensible arrangement because sometimes we may forget that, in a desire to relax conditions of prisoners, we rightly concede permission to smoke. But some of us have, perhaps, overlooked the fact that that may make the suffering of those who cannot afford to smoke far greater.</P>
    <P>If, as I understand, the rule permits four cigarettes a day to the inmates of Mountjoy, I do suggest that we should either adopt the Portlaoise procedure in Mountjoy and give to <Col N="575" /> those who want them the four cigarettes they are permitted to smoke and particularly to give to the old people who are broken down, the old alcoholics, the winers, the tramps, the bit of tobacco the rules permit them to use &mdash; if they cannot afford it themselves, then at the State's expense&mdash; so that they may not be driven to the extremity of scrambling around the exercise yard trying to pick up the exiguous &ldquo;butts&rdquo; that their more fortunate neighbours in misfortune may reject after they have smoked as far as they can.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that recommendations of that kind will find a sympathethic reaction with the Minister.  I doubt if his mind has turned to it heretofore.  I understand that in our prisons the maximum a prisoner can earn by his work is a penny a day.  I understand that that figure has remained the same for decades, if not for generations, whereas in the British prisons it has been expanded to four pence or five pence per day.  That is not a very princely sum but even if they were allowed to earn four pence or five pence per day that would provide one solution of this tobacco problem because they would at least have that pocket money which they could spend on the enjoyment of the concession we have already decided to make and which the Minister in his statement says has, on the whole, contributed to a better discipline in our penal institutions than was the rule when that kind of concession was denied in the past.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister believes this when he says it:</P>
    <P>As is well known, too, no doubt, the prison garb of former days has been changed for the better and it is the practice, in the generality of cases, to allow prisoners to wear their own clothes.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to how that appears to a prisoner:</P>
    <P>If the sentence does not exceed two years, a prisoner may be allowed to wear his own clothes provided the <Col N="576" /> Governor is satisfied he will get replacements when necessary and a weekly change of shirts, socks, underclothing, collars, ties and handkerchiefs. Prisoners whose sentences are six months or more are issued with a new outfit of prison clothes and boots, but if the sentence is less than six months a prisoner, by order of the Minister for Justice, is issued with used clothing, boots, socks and shirts.  The majority of the prisoners are short-term and consequently are dressed in old worn clothes and boots.  The old clothing is often stained, torn, dirty, ill-fitting and trampish looking.</P>
    <P>May I interpolate here my reaction to that phrase?  That last adjective struck a sympathetic chord in me: &ldquo;and trampish looking&rdquo;.  It is bad enough to find yourself planted in Mountjoy for a month or so.  Remember it might happen to any of us. That is a thing I think legislators often forget &mdash; that it might happen to any of us.  But to be turned into a tramp by the raiment which one is constrained to wear is an indignity which I do not believe any of us think it is expedient to employ as a punitive procedure.  So, I return to the quotation:</P>
    <P>It is not unusual to see newly-admitted short-term prisoners with torn trousers, either too small or too large, and without buttons on the fork.</P>
    <P>Some prisoners have half-mast trousers and others have them rolled up at the bottoms to prevent them dragging on the ground.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that there is something almost laughable until the tragic aspect of it strikes me.  It is something I do not think any of us desire.  In addition to exacting the penalty due to society for wrong-doing, none of us wants to make a person in misfortune a figure of fun.  I have not the slightest doubt that, in so far as this is appearing to happen, it is inadvertence; and inasmuch as this little pamphlet directs our attention to these considerations, I think it has a value.</P>
    <P>The boots issued to short-term prisoners are often derelict and of different sizes.  Many of them, <Col N="577" /> through being worn by prisoners for whom they were much too big, have an arabic turn up at the toes.</P>
    <P>That is, after all, a very eloquent way of painting a picture which it is hard to see unless you have been a daily witness of it.</P>
    <P>The used shirts issued are sometimes buttonless, torn and ill-fitting and now and again one may see a prisoner's belly and chest bare from the navel to the throat.  The old used suits are not cleaned before re-issue.  One suit of clothes may be issued in turn to several prisoners, and it continues to be issued until it falls to pieces.  When prisoners are congregated together for Divine Service or for some other purpose, one may get a nauseating smell from those old clothes.  For reasons of Ministerial economy, no polish, dubbin or grease is issued for boots, and prison boots are never polished, dubbed or greased during their years of use.</P>
    <P>That is the other side of the story which the Minister told us when he said that the prison garb of former years had been changed for the better and that it is the practice in the generality of cases to allow prisoners to wear their own clothes.</P>
    <P>Let us remember in this context again that a great number of these recidivists who go to Mountjoy again and again are tramps.  Many of them are alcoholics and the most unfortunate elements in our society but one of the purposes we ought to have in mind when they come to prison is to rescue them in so far as we can, and that may not be very far, from the state of dereliction into which they have fallen.  Thus to attire them does not seem to me to contribute to that end.</P>
    <P>I am fully conscious of the danger of an excessive reforming zeal in advocating uniforms instead of ordinary clothing.  That, I believe, would be a mistake but where ordinary clothing cannot be used, owing to the circumstances of the prisoner or the prison, then I imagine something more seemly than what is here described <Col N="578" /> could be devised &mdash; whether by way of overalls or less heavily worn clothing than they are at present using, I am not prepared to say, but clearly it seems that the practice here described requires sympathetic review.</P>
    <P>Here is a detail which I feel sure has not been present in the Minister's mind and I do not think I am being unreasonably solicitous when I refer to it, though the Minister is cautious to say on pages 4 and 5:</P>
    <P>I am not against change if change would serve a sufficiently useful purpose but in prison administration there is constant pressure from well-intentioned persons to do this or that for the sake of change itself without advertence to the cost.</P>
    <P>I suppose I fall within the category of &ldquo;well-intentioned persons&rdquo;.  I suppose that is true but, nevertheless, &ldquo;well-intentioned persons&rdquo;, foolish as they may seem to bureaucratic ears, on occasions are often the source of modest reform.  Here is a suggestion that will not cost the State anything more than they are at present spending and so at least the argument of cost will not be advanced against it.  I quote:</P>
    <P>When a prisoner is admitted, he is not issued with soap or toothbrush. If his sentence is more than three months he may, with the sanction of the prison doctor, be issued with a toothbrush.  He is permitted to shave twice a week and goes around for the rest of the week unshaven.</P>
    <P>I think this ex-prisoner is justified in saying this helps to break his morale. I continue to quote:</P>
    <P>If prisoners were permitted to shave every day it would help towards rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>I think he is right.  I think it would be a good thing if special permission were provided to require prisoners to shave every day.  I think this prisoner or ex-prisoner is right in saying it is a bad thing to prescribe that they may shave only twice a week.  It undoubtedly operates to lower the morale and hustle the prisoners into the acceptance of the status of tramps.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> Here is a detail which I think the Minister may profitably bear in mind:</P>
    <P>Shirts, socks, towels, sheets and pillow cases come back from the laundry in the female prison very poorly laundered due to out-of-date facilities and inadequate requisites. A prisoner does not get back his own shirt, sheets, socks, towel or pillow case.  He just gets an outfit in the pillow case.  The shirt that comes back to him may be too big or too small and the socks may be odd ones, non-fitting or badly holed.</P>
    <P>I think that is a detail that ought to be remediable and the Minister should provide the means of setting to rights what is there complained of.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that the prison hospital, while not being a luxury nursing home, should be a place where special care and kindness would be shown.  The inmates of prisons are extremely skilful in dissembling sickness, if they think that thereby they may purchase a soft time for themselves, but experienced prison officers are usually well able to detect that kind of fraud and correct it.  We should not, however, consent to a situation in which the really sick in prison are hardly treated in order to deter the malingerer from seeking admission to the hospital.  It seems hard that a situation can obtain in which:</P>
    <P>The Prison Hospital is detached from the main building but well within the outer walls.  Starved of funds for modernisation it is a frowsy dump.  Prisoners who are ill, winers suffering from the effects of alcohol poisoned systems, old, infirm moochers, dangerous simpletons, half-wits and lunatics are often to be found in the hospital as patients.  Discipline in the hospital is rigid and more severe than in the prison proper and all patients are locked up there in their individual and austerely furnished cells for longer hours than prisoners are locked up in the prison.  No experienced prisoner will go into the prison hospital if he can possibly keep out of it.  The prison medical officer visits the hospital once <Col N="580" /> daily, and oftener if necessary, but he has nothing much, if anything, to do with the discipline, routine and administration of the hospital. The prison officers attend to these matters.  The patients who are able to walk spend part of the forenoon and afternoon and part of the evening in summer walking in the recreation yard or sitting on the concrete surround.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that precautions must be taken against malingerers seeking to escape the ordinary prison routine by wangling their way into hospital but I do not think that any of us wish a situation to obtain in which the truly sick resist removal to the prison hospital because they fear its rigours.  To set that right and to maintain an even balance between solicitude for the sick and an absence of discipline is not impossible, but I think there must be scope for some improvement there.  I do not doubt that some improvement could be provided if better facilities were made available to the prison staff for the handling of sick.</P>
    <P>Baths are allowed to hospital patients once a fortnight, as against once a week in the main prison.  No bath towel is issued to the prisoners who have to dry themselves with their soiled sheets.  The baths are, therefore, given on sheet changing day... No bath in the hospital, or for that matter in the main prison, has a stopper in it.  A filthy rag has to be used as a stopper.  It collects germs and dirt from one patient's bath and floats them into the bath water being used by the next patient.</P>
    <P>That is a very small detail but it seems a hardship that patients in the hospital may have a bath only once a fortnight and that, when they do get one, there cannot be an adequate stopper provided for the bath.  Yet the daily or fortnightly recurrence of circumstances of that kind makes the life of a prisoner harder than it ought to be.</P>
    <P>When the Minister came to refer to the Question of classification he said:</P>
    <P>What are the possibilities of introducing further and large-scale <Col N="581" /> reforms?  Any consideration of this question must take into account the smallness of our prison population &mdash; inclusive of all classes, whether prisoners on remand, awaiting trial, debtors and contempt of court prisoners and those under sentences, the average is about 400 &mdash; the fact that there are now only four prisons for the detention of offenders, the high proportion of short-term sentences &mdash; 60 per cent of the sentences are for periods of under three months &mdash; and the expense of providing additional institutions in relation to the use likely to be made of them and the other demands on our resources.  These factors combine to make it impracticable to carry out classification and segregation of prisoners to any great extent.</P>
    <P>That is almost exasperating.</P>
    <P>Every other country in Europe is wrestling with the appalling problem that its prisons are overcrowded and that they have not got accommodation to carry out the segregation which everybody considers necessary.  Here our complaint is that we have not enough prisoners to segregate them. Surely, the ingenuity of man should be able to deal with the problem of adequate segregation when, in fact, the total number of prisoners is not sufficient to tax much more than one-half the capacity of our existing criminal institutions.  I am glad to see, as I understand it under this Bill, that the Minister is taking power to ensure that young prisoners who are on remand will not be brought into intimate contact with the habitual prison population.  I feel that a very much better type of segregation should be both desirable and possible.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies this question: supposing a young fellow goes out, is wild and commits a serious motoring offence as a result of which he gets a month in jail, does anybody in this House think that on being committed to jail he should be brought into intimate contact with people who are recidivists or convicted of grave moral delinquency? I do not want to over-paint this picture or to make an unreasonable case but my mind always goes back <Col N="582" /> to the bad old days when I first visited Summerhill, that is thirty years ago, and the appalling shock it was to me to find in one room 15 or 20 children. The youngest of those children was little more than two years of age and was in the process of transfer to an industrial school as an orphan.  The oldest was a boy of 15 who was on remand for committing a sexual offence against a little girl.  That absence of segregation, because they were children in every age group between the little girl and the oldest boy, so shocked me that I pressed successive Ministers very strongly that something was urgently required to be done.  I believe something has now been done and there is more effective segregation than in the bad old days.</P>
    <P>I am thinking now of a young boy or, worse still, a young girl, although the situation does not arise with girls because as a rule courts do not send a girl to prison.  Take a young person who gets into trouble and for whom there is no alternative but to give him a term in jail, if he has been cautioned two or three times and manifestly is going to continue on his course of conduct.  He gets say one month in jail.  How can it be desirable that that young person should be brought into contact with the other type of prisoners who habituate a penal institution like Mountjoy and who are manifestly quite unsuitable as company for a reckless youth, whom all of us are concerned not alone to check but to redeem? I refer not only to those categories of persons who have been guilty of grave moral delinquency but any decent citizen who gets into trouble which brings him into jail.  He has had enough woe surely without equating him in jail with tramps, winers, and &ldquo;knackers&rdquo; and all the flotsam and jetsam of prison life with which ordinarily he would have no common contact and with which for his own salvation he should never be identified either in his own mind or in the minds of those into whose care he has been committed when he is sent to jail.</P>
    <P>I think there should be segregation. I recognise that to delineate the classes into which prisoners should be segregated presents a problem but it is a <Col N="583" /> problem that should be faced and if possible resolved.  Although we may not be able to achieve perfection, we can certainly make real progress on the situation as it obtains today.  I am amazed that the Minister for Justice should, in extenuation of his failure to do so, plead that he has so few prisoners to handle.  He is in a more fortunate position than those Ministers for Justice in other countries who are driven to the extremity of incarcerating three prisoners in a cell designed for one because they have nowhere else to put them on account of the excessive numbers with which they have to deal.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his success, with the assistance of his Grace, the Archbishop of Dublin, in securing suitable accommodation for girls whom it is necessary to remand until contact is made with their families, in order to determine how they are to be ultimately disposed of.  I gather they are to be placed in the charge of nuns where they are Catholics, and that the Minister has approached other religious communities to provide analogous accommodation for girls of another faith, if circumstances should require them to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose there is any particular reason why the word &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo; should be retained, and if it is thought desirable to drop it, well and good, but I do not think we are facing this whole problem of what used to be called Borstal in a realistic way.  I think there is only one justification for sending any boy to Borstal. Remember we are dealing with boys under 21 years of age.  Would the Minister remind me &mdash; must not a boy be under 21 years of age to go to Borstal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with boys under 21 years of age to whom family background is still a matter of consequence.  I think we would all be agreed that family discipline is the ideal, if it could be made to function, <Col N="584" /> and that we would only consent to their removal from the discipline of family life where we were satisfied it had completely broken down or that some rigorous form of treatment had become inevitable.</P>
      <P>Any literature I have ever read on this subject is unanimous in expressing the view that no reform or no rehabilitation of character can be effected in an adolescent by a short term of incarceration in a Borstal or prison, and that the only hope of making any impression on a youth at that stage of his life is to accept the inevitable, take him away from his family, put him in an institution and keep him there for a period sufficiently long to remould his character and provide him with the kind of training which will make him capable of facing the world when he returns to it.  I have seen that period put at two years, and I have even heard interested and prudent people say that a period of less than four years cannot achieve that purpose. I am prepared to say that a period of two years is the minimum, but I think we are making a mistake if, because we have St. Patrick's, we embark with easy consciences upon a new system of incarcerating young people for short periods in prisons, or whatever you like to call them.</P>
      <P>If we want to reform young people, I could understand placing them in institutions for that purpose, but I do not believe we are doing any good by taking a young person away from his family and putting him in an institution, if the circumstances do not require a radical change for a protracted period of training.  I believe children should be left with their families, if necessary on probation under the supervision of probation officers, and if that involves additional probation officers, male and female, it still ought to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do not let the House reconcile itself to the fact that because we have changed the name of Borstal to St. Patrick's, it is a suitable atmosphere into which to toss a miscellaneous group of troublesome youngsters for periods of one, two, three, six or twelve months.  If we are to take children <Col N="585" /> or delinquents away from their family background, we should do it in the certain knowledge that there is no alternative, and we should then charge ourselves with the responsibility of providing facilities for adequate training so that nothing will be left undone for the child, before his return to the world, which could possibly be done to give him a chance of building himself up as a decent useful citizen.</P>
    <P>I have a holy horror of the idea that we should accept casually in this House the principle of short-term detention for children and adolescents.  It is all wrong.  We must face up to the fact that when an adolescent has got into bad company and is moving in the Irish equivalent of a gang&mdash;if it has become that type of gang which begets juvenile delinquents&mdash;then a short period of incarceration in an institution like St. Patrick's may surround the incarceree with a kind of aura of romance, and unless he is sent out at the end of that short period with a prospect of recovery we are sending him straight back as a hardened heroic leader and almost as an example to the others, and we are leaving the others almost under the impression that in order to attain to his status and dignity, they must themselves be able to claim they are alumni of Borstal.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister most strenuously not to be persuaded that a system of short-term sentences for juvenile delinquents is any useful instrument in the correction of the juvenile or the adolescent.  The family is the proper atmosphere in which reform can be achieved, and in the rare case where that breaks down, it is a Borstal or a reformatory charged with the responsibility, not of detention or punishment primarily, but with the obligation to reform.  That involves the provision of the means to do the job and the resolution to do it in the certainty that you are doing the best that can be done in all the circumstances, if you have decided that it is right and proper that the juvenile should be taken under care for a minimum period of two years, and longer, if the circumstances affecting the reform indicate that is necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> When I say adequate facilities should be available, I mean not only facilities for training, but facilities for understanding. In that connection, I want to say that I yield to none in my admiration for Brothers and religious.  I believe religious are a very useful means of dealing with this problem, but when I think of a delinquent child &mdash;and I include in that category young persons suitable for detention in a reformatory&mdash;I think it is wholly wrong, and quite mistaken, to send juveniles of that age away from their families into an atmosphere where there is no feminine influence whatsoever.  I know that Brothers do the best they can, but it does make a difference if there is some maternal woman there who will provide some approximation to the solicitude of maternal affection, the absence of which may have been a powerful contributory cause of the juvenile delinquency.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies I am not approaching this problem from the romantic angle of complete inexperience.  The plain truth is that district justices do not, as a rule, send juveniles to places of detention, be they reformatories or Borstal, until they feel there is nothing else to do.  The result is that the material in the reformatory and in Borstal is pretty bad.  A mighty and substantial job has to be done there. By the mercy of God's providence, we here in Ireland are burdened with a microscopic problem compared with that which confronts the Government of Great Britain or the Governments of the several States of the United States.  The problem here is very small.  I doubt if, between reformatory and Borstal, we have more than one hundred under detention.  The fact that the problem is so small affords us the opportunity of doing for them the best that can be done.</P>
    <P>Deputies will not forget that, however exasperating the records of these juveniles may be, they are somebody's sons or somebody's daughters.  Their reform and redemption is a matter of desperate concern to people just like ourselves who have known the humiliation and the hardship of seeing their children go wrong, who are obliged to confess to themselves that they have <Col N="587" /> failed them, who know all the anguish of having lost them and who are cruelly concerned to see their hope of reform realised.</P>
    <P>The responsibility is passed over to us who are the Government of this country.  We should be awakened to that responsibility and accept its obligations.  When we come to face it, we must remember that, no matter what we do here, in the last analysis, the immediate burden of carrying out the prospect of reform will fall on people like the Governor or the Chief Officer and the officers of these institutions, most of whom are laymen but, lay or religious, it is they in the last analysis who must bear the heat and burden of the day.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy is interested in the pamphlet which I quoted earlier, I recommend him to read what this ex-prisoner has to say about the Governor, the chief officer and warders of Mountjoy Jail.  It is encouraging to read that, in that anonymous atmosphere, there are men who from day to day go on working in a spirit of Christian charity and kindness to help the very miscellaneous population committed to their care.  The highest tribute of veracity this pamphlet can have is that when this ex-prisoner comes to speak of those with whom he came in daily contact, he has a very glowing tale to tell.</P>
    <P>I have no clear view on the merits of parole.  Most people regard it as a very desirable reform in prison administration. Prudently used, I suppose it is.  My experience from living in America and my familiarity with conditions in America, such as it is, does not strongly prejudice me in favour of the system of parole.  I think its operation in the United States has been a very qualified blessing and has not resulted, on the whole, in a desirable reform.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to hope that under our different system of administration, parole may work better here.  I hope it does.  It is a humanitarian desire to provide for contingencies but its administration will be extremely difficult. I remember that the first time <Col N="588" /> I visited a prison, a very humane prison Governor said to me that there is one interview which in all his experience of prison administration, he had never yet become hardened to.  I asked him if that was where he admitted a prisoner.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you can always deal with that.  It may be very difficult if it is a tragic case but it is part of our job to meet that.  However, there is one interview I find almost unbearable.  It is when a man is put to jail and leaves behind a wife and children.  Then he gets a letter to say his wife has fallen desperately ill and there is nobody at home to look after the children.  He comes up to me quite confidently and says: &lsquo;You will have to let me home, Sir&rsquo;. I have to say: &lsquo;But you may not go home.  You are serving a sentence of imprisonment.  There is no provision to allow you to go home.&rsquo; It is that moment of tragedy that is perhaps the most trying of a prison governor's life &mdash;the awful realisation that there is no provision for that situation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Part of the penalty of going to jail is that when that disaster supervenes, the afflicted father of a normal family, whatever his failings may be, is forbidden to lend a hand.  What will you do with your powers of parole?  Suppose such a case arises and the prisoner comes up and says: &ldquo;The wife is sick. There are seven children at home. We have never known a day's unhappiness or anxiety about the children. We always had a united home. They are waiting eagerly for me to get home again.  I must go to them.&rdquo; What will you say?  Will you say &ldquo;No&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>If I go to the Minister for Justice and say: &ldquo;I know this man.  He is the best man who ever lived but he goes on a &lsquo;batter&rsquo;.  He went on a &lsquo;batter&rsquo; and got himself locked up in jail.  He has the best wife who ever walked and they have seven children. The wife has been removed to hospital and a neighbouring woman is looking after the seven children.  If you do not let the man out, the family will have to be broken up and the children sent to an institution as there is nobody to look after them&rdquo;, will the Minister parole him?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> If you accept that&mdash;and, thinking with my heart, I am all for accepting it&mdash;you must also accept that you are dealing with criminals.  While these facts may be true of the exceptional case, for every true and valid case of this kind there will be three rapscallions who will keep a wife for the purpose of getting sick as soon as they go into Mountjoy.  If you accept the principle that if the wife gets sick as soon as the prisoner goes in there will be plenty of sick wives of prisoners in Mountjoy.  Thinking with my heart, I am all for parole but thinking with my head and recollecting what I saw happen under the parole system in America, I often wonder if it works.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that if you are going to let people out of jail it is better to let them out, give them a clap on the back and say: &ldquo;The Minister has made up his mind to let you go.  He is exercising his prerogative of mercy in turning you out but take care that you do not come back again.  You may consider yourself lucky that the Minister was in a soft frame of mind and was sorry for you.&rdquo; I want to hear more from the Minister to justify the introduction of the system of parole. Remember 60 per cent. of the people who are in jail serve less than three months and what, in the name of goodness, do you want to parole a man for who is in jail for three months? And if you are going to take into account the remission he can earn by his own good conduct would it not be just as well to give him a clap on the back and tell him to go home, that he has been long enough in?</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am failing to see some aspect of this problem.  I do not think the Minister has sufficiently elaborated it in his introductory speech to justify a new departure.  As I say, thinking with my heart I welcome parole, but thinking with my head I am uneasy. That is one point of view.  Secondly, I am wholly and convincedly opposed to any system which envisages short sentences for juveniles.  That is all wrong and it will get us into seas of sorrow and will become a powerful force of corruption rather than reform. I think the Minister is not doing himself justice when he says that we have <Col N="590" /> so few prisoners on our hands that an arbitrary system of segregation is not really practicable and that he is urged by well-intentioned persons to do it for the sake of the change itself without advertence to the cost.  I submit that that is an unfortunate phrase.</P>
    <P>I think, on reflection, the Minister would wish himself included in the ranks of the much despised body of well-intentioned persons.  In dealing with matters of this kind we should all be well-intentioned persons.  If sometimes, in excess of zeal, to avoid the imposition of unintentional hardship on prisoners whom we are charged by Scripture to visit and comfort in their adversity and if we are sometimes moved to advocate what conservatives would regard as excessive expenditure in trying to avoid that situation, I am not ashamed to be derided as a well-intentioned person.  If that be a crime, it is one to which I do not hesitate to plead guilty.  But I should be glad to think that the Minister would join me in that category and reassure me when he is concluding this debate that the matters to which I have referred will have, or have had, adequate consideration and in the latter contingency I hope he will give me the information that I seek.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of dealing with the prisoners in our jails is basically a problem of trying to balance the over-all public interest with the necessity of acting in a fair and humane manner towards the prisoners. It is easy to advocate very generous treatment of prisoners.  If you do that, you run the risk of seriously impairing the defences of the public interest. Similarly, if you take the view that the prisoner is a permanent enemy of society, you can be driven towards acting unfairly and with inhumanity towards the prisoner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been visiting prisons in many countries over a long period.  I have seen the conditions and the problems there and I have heard the views of those charged with prison administration. I have done the same here and I think it can be said that our prison problem is a relatively small one compared with those which confront other countries.  But it is because it is a <Col N="591" /> relatively small problem and within manageable proportions and one which does not cause any great public perturbation that we should, I think, endeavour to deal with it in a manner that will give us reasonable hope that the first offender can be brought back to be a good member of society while at the same time protecting the public interest from the incorrigible offender for whom prison and the deeds which get him there have some magnetic attraction.</P>
    <P>I think one of the difficulties, or rather one of the shortcomings, of our present prison administration is that the emphasis is too much on punishment and not sufficiently on reformation. When you get a prisoner who has spent the best part of his life, or obviously intends to spend it, in prison it is probably impossible to find any method known to human ingenuity whereby you can bring a person of that kind back to being a good member of society.  Some mental disability may be responsible for that person's action; his whole family background may be a contributing factor and you might well waste a substantial amount of time trying to effect a reformation with pretty poor results.  Where such a person is concerned it seems to me that detention is the only way in which you can safeguard the public interest and you cannot take a chance with the public interest in these cases unless you have some evidence that such a person when released among society again will at least conduct himself in a manner that indicates he has respect for the people in whose company he moves.</P>
    <P>It may be that it is possible to effect reformation or at least amelioration in the conduct of such persons after long periods of trial and error and to that extent, perhaps, it is worth while continuing any reformative processes which are calculated to yield even partial results in such cases.  I am concerned mainly for the first offender or, perhaps, even the second offender&mdash;where a person lapses for the second time on some relatively minor charge.  Quite a considerable number of our prisoners&mdash;I think more <Col N="592" /> than 50 per cent. &mdash;find their way into our prisons for offences which do not merit punishment of more than three months and, therefore, they can be said not to have committed the heinous crimes that make headlines in the newspapers of other countries.  To that extent, therefore, one must, I think, assume that their transgressions are not the transgressions of men of evil bent but that they are lapses due to one cause or another.</P>
    <P>In many cases their downfall is due to a condition of mind and body which prevents their realising the gravity of their actions at a particular time or to the fact that they have parted for their own reasons with their normal judgment.  We have to be specially concerned in their cases, not with imposing punishment which can be brutalising, but with bringing about reformation.  While marking public disapproval of the action, it should be possible to make due allowance for the character of the offence and the circumstances in which it was committed. If there is evidence of early reformation on the part of a prisoner there should be some remission of the sentence even substantially above that normally allowed for good conduct.</P>
    <P>In other words, in the case of a prisoner on whom a three months sentence has been imposed, if, as happens in most cases of first offenders, the shock of even a day's imprisonment produces a reaction which indicates that he has been taught his lesson, it is not fair to hold that person for the full normal period, namely, the full period of the sentence less the remission.  We ought to deal specially with these cases and release the prisoner, on conditions if you like, on any kind of conditions that it is thought proper to impose, with the right, of course, to take him back if the authorities are not satisfied that their first judgment of him was correct.  A person of that kind ought not to be put through the full process of prison sentence where the State, meaning the Governor and those administering the punishment in prisons, is satisfied that there is evidence of that person's sentence having produced the necessary <Col N="593" /> reformation and there is a reasonable prospect that he or she will be a good member of society in future.</P>
    <P>It ought to be possible in a case of that kind to recognise that what is needed is a lecture or lectures to the prisoner concerned, or, perhaps, psychiatric treatment whilst in prison. The punishment element ought to be quite unnecessary in the sense of humiliating the prisoner because, quite obviously, he is not of a type that requires punishment in order to appreciate the ignominy of his position. The punishment aspect of imprisonment should be reserved for those who are beyond the stage of redemption from the standpoint of being able to be brought back to a recognition of what they owe to the community.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister is proposing to try the system of parole.  It is worth while trying.  I hope the system will be found to be satisfactory. If the system is properly administered, and if the prisoner gets adequate lessons and lectures before parole is applied to him, it ought to work satisfactorily in a country like this where there is not the long list of hard-bitten criminals such as exist in many other countries.</P>
    <P>The segregation of prisoners in jail is important.  It is a great mistake from every point of view to permit young prisoners who have lapsed for the first time to get into the company of those who are regular customers of our prisons.</P>

      <P>I am certain.  There are very few first offenders in prison because it is only after they have committed numerous crimes that persons find themselves in prison.  When they do go there they are put into the wood yard or some place of that kind and are given the work of chopping kindling wood or that type of work and do not go into the workshops where the hardened types to whom the Deputy refers mainly do their work.</P>

      <P>If it does not happen it is all right but, so far as it happens at all, it is bad that it should be allowed to happen.  My main point on that is that in prison one gets first offenders or second offenders, persons who have lapsed temporarily and whose lapse is the greatest punishment that could be inflicted upon them and their families.  The recollection that they have fallen in the esteem of their friends and relatives carries with it an enormous moral punishment.  There are other cases&mdash;regular housebreakers, regular burglars, persons to whom larceny is an occupation, persons with bad moral records.  I do not know that punishment is of much use to people with bad moral records.</P>
      <P>I do not know that punishment is of much use to the other people I have mentioned.  They serve their sentence, come out and go back again.  If it is not possible to reform them the only alternative is to detain them in prison. Although the results may be relatively small it is worth endeavouring in these cases to bring about some reformation, to bring them back to the straight and narrow path even if it has to be done by special methods and by the employment of religious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as long term prisoners are concerned, I understand that they do a certain amount of work at Portlaoise <Col N="595" /> prison which is the long term punishment prison.  I was wondering if it would be possible to give some of the long term prisoners there training in a craft or trade which might help to rehabilitate them on their release.  I do not think it would be possible to give them a complete trade in the sense of being journeymen tradesmen but it ought to be possible through the medium of the local technical schools or in some other way to give them training in occupations which might secure for them regular employment when they would be released.  Many people who come out of jail after long periods of detention, having done the kind of work they have been given to do in jail, find it impossible to get any kind of work and probably drift back to a life of crime.  It might be possible to teach these people a trade or skill which they could exploit at least to the extent of finding semi-skilled jobs when they are released instead of being turned adrift with no prospect of being able to find a niche for themselves in industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has quoted the contents of a pamphlet which was issued in the last few days by a former member of this House.  I have read only parts of that pamphlet.  If you are terribly enthusiastic in putting a point of view, I know how easy it is to put that point of view and perhaps not see the other side of the case. However, making all due allowances for that, there are some statements in that book which must be answered. The statements are positive and deliberate. If they are true, the situation ought to be remedied by the Minister. If they are not true, we ought to know in what respect they are not true.</P>
    <P>For instance, a statement is made that flies fall into three or four 30-gallon pots, that they are scooped out and thrown away and the process of boiling goes on until more flies fall in, and again they are thrown out.  That can be either proved or disproved. There must have been somebody in the prison cookhouse besides the writer of that pamphlet at the time he saw that and it ought to be possible to say that is true or untrue.  It is not <Col N="596" /> sufficient to push it aside and say that is irresponsible propaganda.  The pamphlet writer pays tribute to the Governor of the prison and to the chief warders, a tribute which, I think, from personal experience is very well deserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>And cancels out the other charges he has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an oversimplification of the allegations made by the person concerned.  Either the flies get into the saucepans or they do not.  That should be easily proved or disproved.  Another statement which is worthy of mention is in regard to the food served to prisoners. I do not think we should carry punishment of prisoners to such an extent as to give them dry bread nor do I think it necessary that the meat should be boiled every time they get meat.  It ought to be possible without any great expenditure to give a prisoner some variety over and above what he gets at present.  You are not necessarily making him a more difficult prisoner by giving him a little more variety in his food.  Instead you are probably helping to produce an understanding in his mind that he is being treated with all humanity, having regard to the fact that he has transgressed the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister not to write off the pamphlet as of no consequence and just the outpourings of a person who is sour in society.  If the statements can be proved to be untrue, well and good; the whole argument for our present prison system and its humanitarian objectives is reinforced.  If, on the other hand, the pamphlet is shown to contain statements which are contrary to what we believe to be a human concept of prison administration, then adjustments are called for.  However, I express no view on the rightness or otherwise of the statements made.  I have no means of checking them, but they ought to be checked and they ought to be answered.  If they are not true we can rejoice in that fact.  If they are true at least some of them ought to be looked into and dealt <Col N="597" /> with, with a view to removing what in respect of some of them is a justifiable cause for complaint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the experience for a number of years of being a member of the visiting committee to the Borstal Institution formerly located in Clonmel.  I have also had the experience, like many others, of being a prisoner in that institution and several other institutions, so when I speak about conditions in them it will be from two viewpoints.</P>
      <P>Most of us who were members of the visiting committee of the Borstal came to the conclusion that many of the young people in prison there were handicapped children.  I remember recently in Clonmel listening to a Dr. Stack, I think that was his name, giving a talk on handicapped children. He said that three out of every thousand children were what would be known as handicapped and that half of that number were capable of being taught in schools and consequently were capable, by proper teaching, of having their ways mended.  It also came to my knowledge as a member of the Borstal visiting committee that about 75 per cent. of the young people who came to that institution were illiterate.  I sometimes think they were illiterate because they were handicapped in one way or another and could not be taught as the normal child could.</P>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with Deputy Dillon that if there is to be rehabilitation of the type of people imprisoned in a Borstal institution as it was known at that time, the term should be a long one.  There is no use in sending such delinquents to an institution for two or three weeks or two or three months. The idea of the Borstal institution is to train the youngsters and to get them to see the advantage of becoming useful citizens.  When they are there for only two or three months they are just punching in time until the day they are released.  Our biggest difficulty towards the end of the period when the Borstal institution was in Clonmel was that there were not enough children to give them the type of training which might be useful in rehabilitating them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> I was personally disappointed at all times with the training given but I am afraid I was unable to offer a solution. There was instruction in carpentry which was good but we also had shoemaking and tailoring which were a waste of time and energy.  I came to the conclusion that shoemaking, what is called cobbling, was a finished business. What we call cobbling at the present time is mainly done by machines, not by hand with wax, leather and all the rest.  As far as tailoring was concerned, they did not learn enough to become tailors or to become useful even in the matter of mending clothes.  I often thought that training in some other trades should be adopted in such institutions.</P>
    <P>When Deputy G. Boland was Minister for Justice he wanted to take a farm, even if it were several miles distant from the institution, to train the boys.  He said he would be prepared to take the risk of escape from the farm.  His idea was that the boys would be taught agriculture or horticulture there.  That would have been a wonderful innovation for those children.  I myself thought that music might be useful.  Training in the use of machines would also be an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>While the institution was located in Clonmel we had the option of recommending release if suitable employment offered.  Invariably the recommendation was accepted provided the probation officer approved of the employment.  A good deal of the employment offered was fictitious. The offers were made simply to get the children out.  Having got out, they were allowed to revert to whatever they had been engaged in before they were committed.</P>
    <P>The family is, of course, very important in the training of young people. Oddly enough, before the Borstal left Clonmel one of the recommendations the visiting committee made was that the children should be removed as far away as possible from their parents. We discovered, in other words, that in certain cases it was not a good thing to have the children too close to their parents and relatives.  The children <Col N="599" /> were actually better off without visits from their relatives.  That is one of the reasons I regretted the transfer of Borstal from Clonmel.</P>
    <P>Statistics proved that about 75 per cent. of the inmates never went back again to Borstal.  That is a wonderful record.  What happened them when they left the country I do not know because no records were kept as to how they progressed elsewhere.  When parents wrote saying they had a job for a boy and the job, on investigation, was found to be reasonably good the boy was released.  On the other hand, there were some excellent lads in Clonmel who had no relatives of any kind and there was no means of having them released to outside employment because nobody wanted them. There was one lad who was very high in the Governor's esteem but he had to serve his full term, with, of course, remission for good conduct.  When he did go out we had to rely on some of the organisations here in Dublin to look after him and see that he got a job.</P>
    <P>There was one great difference in Borstal as compared with the prisons I was in.  We used appoint our own committee for disciplinary purposes. In Borstal, as well as losing liberty, they also lose any choice with regard to those in authority over them.  I think it would be a good idea if they had their own groups exercising control; it would obviate a good deal of the unpleasantness that sometimes occurs in Borstal.</P>
    <P>The loss of liberty is really the greatest punishment.  The food is excellent. In Clonmel we inspected the food regularly.  We could go in at any time we liked and see how it was cooked.  All this talk about flies is just so much nonsense.  Even in the best run kitchens accidents can happen. Possibly an isolated incident did occur. Generally speaking, the food was excellent, properly cooked, abundant and wholesome.  If anything, it was perhaps a little too abundant for lads who did not have all the exercise they would have had had they been at liberty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> All the time in Clonmel conditions were being improved.  When I went there first the boys were, perhaps, like so many slaves.  The Governor came along and announced: &ldquo;Visiting Justices. Any complaints?&rdquo; The lads stood there in little uniform shorts, hangdog and crushed.  I am not saying that there was no cause for complaint. Possibly on that first occasion they were afraid.  I do not know.  But none of them ever made a complaint in the early days, and I believe they could have made them.</P>
    <P>The uniform was changed.  They were provided with ordinary suits of different colours so that there would be no suggestion of a uniform.  When Deputy MacEoin was Minister for Justice they were allowed to smoke. Boxing tournaments were organised. They went out for walks through the countryside in charge of one or two warders.  They never gave any trouble. They were gradually beginning to realise that they were not animals.  They believed the State was going to do something for them to rehabilitate them.  I have never been up to St. Patrick's.</P>
    <P>It was a cause for deep regret to us that these children were going so close to Mountjoy.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that St. Patrick's should not be confused with Mountjoy because some of these youngsters thought it a wonderful thing to be coming out of Mountjoy or going into Mountjoy.  I have actually seen a lad do tough things in order that he might be sent into the criminal prison.  At that time some of them were so bad that when we asked them would they do these things again, inevitably they said they would, and offered no excuse for doing what they did.</P>
    <P>I believe that all young lads in prison should be treated as handicapped children.  Each one of them when first admitted should be examined by a psychiatrist, or some person of that description, and should not be treated as a criminal.  We made a recommendation, for instance, that when a child or young person was convicted three times within a <Col N="601" /> short period, he should be sent to Borstal.  We felt such a young person was just beginning on a career of crime and that sending him to Borstal for two or three years might break him of the bad habit he was developing.  Sentencing him to a month or six weeks in prison three times in succession would not achieve that, because, by the time he had served his third sentence, he had usually become a hardened criminal, and we felt he would get proper treatment during a couple of years in Borstal.</P>
    <P>Since this is the only opportunity I shall have, I should like to say that I always found the prison warders and Governors interested in the lads, and very happy when they could report to our Committee that the young people in their care had behaved well since our last visit.  They were always anxious to secure concessions for them and were always inclined to do everything they could for them. I think there were three Ministers in charge of the Department during the period of which I speak, and all of them were only too happy at any time to adopt any suggestion which we made which might be reckoned to be helpful.</P>
    <P>Returning to the question of handicapped children, I remember one occasion when we got in six young prisoners all together.  One of them happened to be a lad from Dublin who killed somebody else with a knife and the other five were just habitual offenders.  The very minute these six lads came before us, it was perfectly obvious that the lad who used the knife was not an habitual criminal. In a fit of temper, he had used a knife and killed somebody but, on the other hand, the type the others were was perfectly obvious and the only conclusion I could come to was that they also were of the handicapped children type.  The best recommendation I could make to the Minister is that these offenders should be regarded as handicapped children and should be examined by a psychiatrist, and the authorities should be guided by such a person as to what might be done.  I <Col N="602" /> make that recommendation because I have met doctors, who did both temporary and permanent duty in Borstal, and they considered that was the most practical thing that could be done.  It is my opinion, too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which we are considering deals most inadequately with one of our serious social problems, namely, the treatment and care of juvenile offenders.  Our present system of dealing with juvenile offenders and caring for them is pitifully inadequate and I regret the Minister has not taken the opportunity, offered to him by this Bill, of bringing in some most needed reform.  I do not think it is a wise decision to put off the reforms which are so vitally necessary until some time in the long distant future when a comprehensive piece of codification, law reform and prison legislation is introduced.  Rather than wait for such a comprehensive code, I should be glad if the Minister would take a suitable opportunity in the immediate future to deal with matters which have not been dealt with in the legislation before us today.</P>
      <P>I am concerned primarily and principally in the remarks I have to make with the problem of the juvenile offender, and I wish to state categorically that our present legal system dealing with the juvenile offender is inadequate and needs to be reformed. Its administration also requires very serious overhaul.  As Deputies are aware, the problem is divided into two parts by our legislation, the problem of the young person, the child offender under 16, and that of the youthful offender over 17.  In this piece of legislation, we are dealing only with one part of the major problem.  We are dealing with only a very small aspect of that one part of the problem and I should have liked the Minister to have taken some more trouble and care over the presentation of this legislation and dealt more thoroughly with all aspects of juvenile delinquency which could be dealt with by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking of the problems that are raised at the present time for the courts dealing with the child offender. <Col N="603" /> As Deputies know, when child offenders come before district justices, the justices are very frequently placed in a most invidious position.  They are faced with the problem of a child offender who they realise would not benefit by being sent to an industrial school or reformatory but in respect of whom there is no alternative.  This arises not only in the case of normal children but also in the case of subnormal and mentally afflicted children and, as Deputy Loughman pointed out, in the case of Borstal institutions, it does happen that a district justice has to send children who are mentally subnormal to an industrial school, knowing that they should get proper and adequate treatment, psychiatric treatment and specialised nursing care.</P>
    <P>We in this country have no proper system for dealing with the subnormal, mentally-handicapped child and that is something which should be dealt with immediately as a matter of urgent social reform.  Under the present system, children who are mentally retarded are sent to industrial schools where they do not get the proper care they need; the position is that we have a totally inadequate system of psychiatric treatment and care for these young offenders.  In a rather shallow fashion, it is sometimes fashionable to criticise modern advances in psychiatric medicine.  There can be no doubt that a great many of the young offenders who come before the courts would benefit considerably&mdash;and society itself would benefit&mdash;from psychiatric treatment. The present legislative set-up and the present services available are totally inadequate to deal with this aspect of the problem.  Powers should be taken to see that proper psychiatric treatment is available for youthful offenders and that special institutions are established to deal with children who are psychologically deranged or mentally retarded and who would benefit from specialised treatment.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which I think should have been dealt with in this legislation is the problem which faces the district justice who has no alternative <Col N="604" /> but to send a child to an industrial school and who has no means of sending him for even a limited period.  The district justice has at present no discretion as to the length of the sentence fee will impose on the young offender.  For these young child offenders, there should be a special short-term institution for corrective treatment where, in suitable cases, the district justice concerned would be able to send them rather than to an industrial school for a period up to the time when the child reaches the age of 16, as is the present situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Loughman referred to the problem with which we are dealing only in a very minor way in this legislation&mdash;the problem of the youthful offender between the age of 16 and 21. There is one minor matter of legislative reform which I think the Minister should have included in this piece of legislation.  At present the circuit criminal court has the power of sending the child to the Borstal institution, and I think the power of imposing Borstal sentence should be given to the district justice where he has such jurisdiction to deal with summary offences.  But the main problem with which we are dealing, the problem of Borstal training, is one which, I think, is not being adequately dealt with by the Government in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The development in recent years has been significant and regrettable. The development, as Deputy Loughman pointed out, has been to take away the Borstal from Clonmel and bring it to a wing of Mountjoy Prison. It is regrettable that what is now to be known as &ldquo;St. Patrick's&rdquo; and what has been known as &ldquo;St. Patrick's&rdquo; for some time is, in fact, part of a wing of Mountjoy Prison.  The Minister, I think, admits in his opening statement that this is not desirable but he says he is not prepared to ask the Government for the money necessary to build an institution, in a semi-rural area. I regret that decision very much indeed. He said the cost would be well into six figures.  Whatever the sum would be, I think it would be money well spent.  We are dealing with human lives.  We are dealing mainly with young boys whose whole future may be <Col N="605" /> conditioned and coloured by what happens to them when they are getting this Borstal training.  It is regrettable that the Minister has decided not to ask the Government to see that a proper institution is provided for boys between the ages of 16 and 21 who are committed for Borstal training.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that the present change from Clonmel to Mountjoy Prison has not been for the good of the boys concerned and that a stigma attaches to the boys as a result of being in Mountjoy Prison, even though they are in a separate part of it.  While it is true they are in a separate wing away from the main criminals detained there, there is evidence &mdash; and I should like to have the Minister's comment on it &mdash; that in fact the segregation between, the two parts is not as complete as he would appear to indicate to us.  There is evidence to show that in fact the boys do mix from time to time with the hardened criminals both in the hospital, for example, and in the kitchens. I should be glad if the Minister could reassure us in the House whether that is so or not.</P>
    <P>But apart from this development by which the Borstal has been moved from Clonmel to Mountjoy Prison, there is the development, which will be strengthened by the provisions of this Bill, of mixing the short-term juvenile offenders with the long-term Borstal trainees.  I do not think this is a good development.  Since the move from Clonmel to Mountjoy Prison, the Minister has exercised the powers given to him under previous legislation by which he can transfer a boy doing a prison sentence to Borstal training.  The result has been that a great number of the short-term offenders have been transferred from the prison proper of Mountjoy to the Borstal part of Mountjoy and you have in the Borstal training college in Mountjoy a great number of what are termed &ldquo;short-termers&rdquo; with the long-term trainee undergoing Borstal training.  That movement will be accelerated under the provisions of this Bill.  I do not think it is a wise movement from the point of view of the boys undergoing Borstal training.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> The boys sentenced to Borstal training are those of a more hardened type who require a very special type of training and supervision and it is generally more long-term.  It is not good for them that they should be in contact with these &ldquo;short-termers&rdquo;. It is not good for the institution that it has to deal not only with these boys undergoing longer periods of training but also with the other boys under 21 who are serving short-term prison sentences.  I should like to see a proper segregation of the two types.  It is desirable that there should be a separate institution for boys under 21 who are serving short-term prison sentences and who are not being sentenced to Borstal training.</P>
    <P>There is a double problem here &mdash; a problem of the boy who is serving a short-term sentence and who should not be with adult criminals and the problem of the boy doing Borstal training who should not be in the same institution as the youthful offender serving a short-term sentence.  To my mind, the answer to this problem is to be found in establishing a proper institution for Borstal training in what the Minister has described as &ldquo;semirural surroundings&rdquo;.  It is bad that the boys are kept in the city of Dublin. It would be preferable for them to be outside, but not too far from the city. It is extremely bad for them that they are in the environment of Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, it is to be regretted that the Minister has not sought from his colleagues in the Government authority to spend money, whatever it may be, in establishing a proper institution for Borstal training.  It would then be possible, if this move were made, to use the wing.  If so desired, it could be made available in Mountjoy prison for these short-term offenders who should not be mixed with the adult criminals and who should be dealt with separately from those who are undergoing Borstal training.</P>
    <P>With respect to those boys also, there is a great need for the psychiatric treatment to which Deputy Loughman referred.  The problems involved in dealing with boys who are <Col N="607" /> offenders and undergoing Borstal training are very great indeed.  I think a tribute should be paid to those who assisted in the development of their training, not only to the staffs of the Borstal institutions but also, as the Minister properly pointed out, to the visiting committee and to the welfare workers who are assisting in this important work.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the problem with which we are dealing is part of a larger problem.  The rate of juvenile crime has been steadily increasing.  In fact, close on 40 per cent. of all the offenders who come before the courts are under 21 years.  The reasons for this rise in juvenile crime are many and varied.  It is very hard to see how we can tackle adequately the problem of juvenile crime when we have unemployment at over 40,000 in the age group 14 to 19 &mdash; unemployment of over 40,000 young people who are neither employed nor getting any education.  If we have figures of that dimension, it is not to be wondered at that we have a rising rate of juvenile delinquency.</P>
    <P>Although it does not arise on the Second Reading of this Bill, I should like to say that one of the strongest arguments for raising the school leaving age is to stop this dreadful scourge of unemployment at such a youthful age and to assist in controlling the rate of juvenile delinquency by doing so.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that the problems with which we are dealing are not of a political nature.  They are not matters which concern one Party more than another.  They are matters which should concern and do concern, I believe, Deputies from every part of this House.  I feel that there might be something to be gained if a committee were established to endeavour to find out what improvements could be made in our present penal code &mdash; a committee that would not drag on its deliberations for a great number of years but one which would be required to report in a very short time.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset of my remarks, there are a number of legislative <Col N="608" /> changes which could be made without any great difficulty and which would considerably improve our present system.  Apart from the framework in which the treatment and care of juvenile offenders have to be worked, there is the provision of the personnel and the provision of the institutions themselves to fit into the system.</P>
    <P>The matters we are dealing with are matters of urgency.  They involve human lives and human souls.  It seems to me it is a responsibility which this House should face up to.  If it means providing £100,000 or £200,000 for the erection of a new institution; if it means providing for extra psychiatric and nursing treatment, it would be money which this House would do well to provide, in my opinion.  The results from up-to-date psychological research and the results from up-to-date methods of training in other countries have proved their worth. We are still operating a very antiquated system and the sooner it is reformed, the better it will be for society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the humane approach of the Minister in this Bill.  The problem with which we are dealing is one which concerns every public representative and every citizen.  What are we to do in regard to juvenile crime?  Some juveniles get a first, second and third chance of making good but yet they relapse into crime.  We should be as humane as possible in regard to people sent to prison.  We should endeavour to prevent them embarking upon a life of crime when they are released.  A more severe punishment was suggested in connection with certain types of crime. I believe that by helping the prisoners, you will get the best results.  Our aim should not be to drive those people further along the road to crime and make hardened criminals of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the State, especially in the case of juveniles, to do everything possible to train and assist them.  The object should be so to equip them that they will lead a better life when they come out of prison.  They should be shown that a life of crime does not pay and that <Col N="609" /> their criminal actions will lead to their being in prison continuously.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who said that we have not adequate facilities for training such juveniles.  I do not think our Borstal institutions are adequate at all.  We should have a proper school in which a trained psychiatrist would be employed and where juveniles could be examined and graded from the point of view of intelligence. You will always encounter the hardened criminal but then there is some good in everybody.  I believe that by proper training and advice prisoners can be brought back from a life of crime.  These are serious matters which concern all of us. People must be protected from criminals, but directly the State sentences a man and sends him to prison it is the duty of the State to do everything possible to reform that individual.</P>
    <P>I believe we have a long way to go in this matter and while the present Minister has been most humane in his approach he cannot wave a magic wand and achieve results overnight. I believe, as I say, we have a long way to go to achieve what should be achieved and to train these individuals, let them be juveniles or adults. Many a man found himself in prison, and many a woman and many a youngster, too, through bad company. They were not criminals but they found themselves in prison.  The more humane we are the better and if there is anything good in the individual he will react favourably.  If he cannot react to kindness or to an educational system adopted by the prison authorities and by the Department of Justice, his case is hopeless.  If we can make good citizens of a large percentage of those who appear before the courts and undergo a term of imprisonment, the State will have achieved something.  On the other hand, if a juvenile or an adult is sentenced to a term of imprisonment and becomes a hardened criminal and repeats his crimes over and over again, the State has failed because it has not turned that man from a career of crime.</P>
    <P>I know that the expenses of the <Col N="610" /> State are fairly high but nevertheless money spent in this regard would be money well spent; the more humane we are and the more education we can give young people the better.  Above all we should have segregation and we should have the services of a psychiatrist. As far as juvenile delinquency is concerned, I do not believe the children involved are normal.  Children guilty of abnormal and vicious acts are not normal and hence there is an urgent need for training.  There is an urgent need to see what can be done for them.  These are the problems facing us as a young State.  We must provide segregation for young prisoners, and old prisoners too, especially first offenders.  Segregation is also necessary amongst the different types of offenders.  Bad habits acquired by youngsters at an early age will continue throughout their lives.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I must pay tribute to the Governor and the staff of Mountjoy Prison.  On occasions I worked with the Governor on committees and I never met a more humane man in his approach to every single person under his charge.  His anxiety is to see that every prisoner leaving Mountjoy is rehabilitated in ordinary life through advice, encouragement and every other means at his disposal.  We are lucky to have such humane men holding public office.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the parole system as I like to see a man getting a chance. The just man falls seven times a day and I suppose we all fall sometimes. It is up to us to try to make life better for society but we have to protect society against criminals who commit offences day after day.  Again I repeat that the humane approach is the best approach.  I should like, in conclusion, to compliment the Minister on the work he is doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in this Bill because I have had certain prison experiences myself.  I was never a criminal but I was in prison in Mountjoy amongst criminals.  I was a political prisoner during the Civil War.  As a result of a Commando raid in which I took part I was tried by a courtmartial but when the Civil <Col N="611" /> War was over they tried me again and sentenced me to twelve months amongst criminals in Mountjoy, so at least I have the experience of having mixed with criminals.  I listened to their hopes, their plots and their plans. I know human nature and, although these incidents occurred some years ago, human nature does not change.</P>
      <P>There are different types of criminals. There is the major criminal, the fellow who wants to achieve fame and riches by means of a short cut.  He is not concerned with your humanitarian approach.  He is certain that when he gets out he will do a better job the next time.  There is the petty criminal who feels that he did the job the wrong way on the last occasion.  Those were the types with whom I mixed in Mountjoy.  Then there are the young fellows, and perhaps the young girls, who are influenced by the other types and who find themselves in trouble. There is the type of criminal also who likes to enjoy the good things of life and who achieves that end by taking other people's property.  You will always have them and the law will have to be tough to deal with such people.  These fellows with a criminal bent can morally justify their actions. They say that the other fellows are doing it.  In one of last Sunday's English newspapers I read of a famous American criminal who was asked if he would commit his crimes all over again and he replied: &ldquo;Yes, but I would make certain that I got a licence&rdquo;.  That is the mentality of those people.  They believe that society steals and they claim that they can justify their actions.  Perhaps there is some truth in it.  Society is not innocent; do not worry about that. Society &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; just as much&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It can be argued that half the people with money robbed it at some time and there is some truth in that.  Up to 100 <Col N="612" /> years ago, the nationalists in the north held that their land was stolen.  They were always trying to get it back and they looked for a chance to rebel and take the land back.  Times have eased since then and I do not think they are still trying.  They probably cannot prove their title.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am, Sir.  I want to deal with the whole question of crime and its cause.  I am pointing out that there is a class of society we shall never convert and, therefore, there must be laws to deal with them.  With regard to the other type of criminal the Minister has in mind, and for whom he wants power of parole, I fully agree that the Minister should have such power because it is my experience that in every class of society and in every group, there is leadership.  There is some fellow who leads the others, whether it is only breaking windows or stealing apples. Someone is responsible and the others are led.</P>
      <P>I believe there should be segregation and that the Minister should have power to parole those who he believes or has evidence to show are not the criminal type.  It would be most unjust to keep such people in prison, even though to the justices they may all be the same.  Perhaps there was not sufficient evidence to prove the differential between one of the accused and the others.  Time may prove that differential and the Minister should, therefore, have those powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, apart from the fact that there are people who are bent on a short cut to fame and riches, and apart from petty criminals, there are those who steal for economic reasons. It has been stressed here by other speakers that unemployment is a cause of crimes and it has been mentioned that the Minister is lucky in having such a limited prison population. The Minister can thank emigration for that because, whether we like it or not, we must accept that economic reasons are responsible for <Col N="613" /> much crime.  The easy way out is across the Channel which saves the Minister from having double the prison population.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons, apart from economic reasons and apart from unemployment. Society, as I know it, is a closed shop and that has a lot to do with people going despairingly into a life of crime.  You cannot get into a trade unless you are on the union files.  I know a man who is a printer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We come here and talk, but if we understood the problem better, we might be able to do more about converting people.  With regard to segregation, I believe the hardened type, the type with the bent to which I have referred, should not be allowed to associate with the type, as I say, who are very often influenced into crime.  Only a year or so ago, it was reported in the Press that there was a mutiny in one of our industrial schools, the school at Daingean.  I know the reason for that, because I know the facts.</P>
      <P>Some tough people, the leader type to which I have referred, were allowed to associate with the rest and it was not until they were removed that there was peace in the institution.  That is why I say there should be segregation. People should be appointed to watch for those who are inclined to be troublesome and they should then be removed.  If that were done, the Minister, or those appointed by him, might go a long way towards converting the rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to deal with the whole subject but the Chair says we are concerned only with the treatment of crime.  The Minister should segregate <Col N="614" /> these people and keep them segregated. I would suggest to the Minister that he should encourage prisoners to study.  If he wants to encourage them to study, he could offer a little further remission, and in that way they might be enabled perhaps to make a better go of life, when they come out.  Remissions go a long way with prisoners and I believe that without them there would be mutinies day and night.  It is with remission of sentences that prisons are kept in order and, therefore, there should be further remissions to encourage the prisoners to study and to cultivate some vocation or other. It is a well-known fact that after leaving industrial schools where the study of music is cultivated, a number of young people have found good jobs in life.  I know quite a number of them.  These people need encouragement and the best way to do that is to offer further remissions.</P>
    <P>If I were allowed to speak on the whole subject I might speak for an hour, but I am not.  As I said before, society is a closed shop.  If it were not so closed, there might not be so many crimes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">

      <P>While I agree prison reform is good, I think this is about the worst time to introduce it, when crime has never been at a more alarming level and when no one is safe in the city of Dublin or any of the other cities.  I agree that the Minister means well but there is a time for everything and I do not think this House should allow its heart to rule instead of its head.</P>
      <P>So far as prison life is concerned, I am quite satisfied that Mountjoy, our chief prison, is a convalescent home and not a prison at all.  It is a place where people rest until they come out and commit another crime and go back in again.  There were many reforms in prisons 30 or 40 years ago, and rightly so.  I am not a hard man but I believe society must be protected.  Society which earns its living honestly must be protected against those who break the law.</P>
      <P>There is a minority of people who are dangerous, low and dirty, and society must be protected against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> Criminals must go to prison &mdash; there is no question about that.  If they behave themselves in prison, they may get a remission, but if they come out and break the rules again, they must be given the full severity of the law. That is the position in any Christian country and it is the position here.  I do not think we should fall over ourselves to have prison reforms at the present time when there is so much looting and plundering.  That does not happen because people are hungry.  It happens because their home life is rotten and I think the parents are more to be blamed than anyone else.  There is no doubt that a vast number of these criminals, whether young or middle-aged, are rascals.  They want to be converted one way or another. You will not convert them by patting them on the head.  Society is entitled to see that justice is done.  We have too many juvenile trouble-makers in this country.  There is a wave of crime in Dublin the like of which we have not had for the past fifty years.</P>
    <P>We are trying to reform the law and to give these people as easy a time as possible.  Surely that is wrong.  I am not against prison reform in normal days.  I believe that segregation in our prisons is good.  We should not have certain types of criminals mixing with other types.  Old &ldquo;hoboes&rdquo; and habitual criminals must be kept to themselves.  First and second offenders may have been, and may still be, rather decent people and, if given a chance, may yet make good.  Therefore, they should not have to mix with old &ldquo;hoboes&rdquo; and habitual criminals who will have nothing but a very bad effect on them.  That is not class distinction. It is justice.</P>
    <P>I spent many days and months in prison.  I know as much about prison life as anybody else.  I have had experience of Irish and foreign prisons. One of the hardest prisons in the British Isles is located in Perth.  I did twelve months in it.  At that time, criminal lunatics mixed with the Irish prisoners.  I know what these criminal lunatics were like.  They were dangerous and dirty.  Nobody should have to mix with them.  It is the same in <Col N="616" /> this country.  There is a small minority of persons in Mountjoy, and some even outside it, who should not be allowed to mix with society until they make good.  If an ordinary person mixes with them the danger is that in the course of a few short weeks or months his mind becomes upset and his outlook altered.  By hook or by crook, the very undesirable element endeavour to unsettle him and make him one of themselves.  Therefore, segregation is most important.</P>
    <P>While I was in prison, I learned many things in connection with life there.  In Mountjoy at that time and in the penal settlements across the water the conditions were a disgrace. You were given a suit of clothes and you had to wear it whether it fitted you or not.  If the legs of the trousers were too short or too long you had to put up with it.  You were given a pair of boots and no matter what your size you just had to make do with them. The clothes were a disgrace at that time.  I am happy to say that there is no such thing as that today.</P>
    <P>I remember that when we Irish prisoners had to mix with other people we were heartily ashamed of our clothes.  We are a clean people by nature.  We like to be clean.  Unfortunately, our clothes were a mass of vermin so much so that we could not sleep at night.  I do not believe that that is the position now but if it still obtains it should be terminated.  We had to suffer all those things.  I am trying to show the reforms that have taken place in the course of the past thirty or forty years.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I am not against prison reform.  For instance, I believe there should be an open air life for prisoners.  I know what it was like in the old days when we had to sit in our cells picking oakum. The cell was about five feet by six or nine feet.  Sometimes we had to tease dusty, dirty hair.  By the end of the day your throat and nose were stuffed up and generally you felt in such a mess that the position was pretty awful.  We fought against all that and then we were put out on a farm of three hundred acres with the criminal lunatics.  We had to look <Col N="617" /> after 130 acres and the criminal lunatics had to look after the remainder. Ten men were tied to a plough.  We ploughed that farm which was a penal settlement in Britain.  We ploughed the same as horses ploughed.  We broke with that, too.  We refused to continue to do it and we won.</P>
    <P>An open air life is the best thing for those people.  To keep a man in a cell teasing hair and picking oakum is dirty and depressing.  Give him an open air life.  If a man is in a cell and is occupied with those dirty jobs he will come out a worse criminal than when he was put in.  I urge that very little if any work should be done in the prison cells.  Give the prisoners all the open air they possibly can have.  It is desirable to have a farm of land attached to the prison.  Put the prisoners out to horticulture, agriculture, and so on, and you will improve them immensely.  That is where they should be.</P>
    <P>Political and agrarian trouble-makers should not be sent to Mountjoy. They are a society altogether different from the tough and the thief. You will always have political and agrarian trouble.  I do not think they should be mixed with the ordinary criminal in Mountjoy.  Perhaps, they are not.</P>
    <P>For a long number of years I have known a good deal about the officers and the Governor in Mountjoy.  He was a pal of mine and did prison himself. He is a humane man.  I do not think a prisoner in Mountjoy for the past twenty years would say he did not get a fair deal.  The Governor is a man who knew the inside of a prison as well as the outside and he has the humane touch in life.</P>
    <P>I believe in parole for a good type of prisoner on his first or second offence.  If he makes good, all the better.  I am at one with Deputy Dillon, Deputy D. Costello and the other Deputies who spoke about the juveniles.  There is no use putting a juvenile boy in for two, three or four months, thinking he will reform. You will make a proper &ldquo;hobo&rdquo; of him.  Put him in for about two years for good schooling.  If he got nothing <Col N="618" /> but proper schooling and proper Christian doctrine under the right type of instructor I believe he would make good.  If a boy starting out on the wrong road got such an opportunity of schooling and Christian doctrine instruction for a period of about two years he would be bound to make good afterwards.  If a boy of 15, 16 or 17 years of age starting on a life of crime receives the treatment I have just mentioned I believe he will come out satisfied and will make good.  He is the last man who will try to break the law again.</P>
    <P>Be slow to throw your arms around the toughs and to do too much for them.  Some prisoners regard Mountjoy as a convalescent home.  Our present prison system is not severe.  I talked to some inmates of Mountjoy and they said it was far better than when they were at home and that they were as happy there as outside as the only thing they lacked was their freedom.  Too much prison reform in a dangerous period as at present is not wise.  We have far too much pilfering, looting and criminal activities to think about prison reform. Let us consider it when times are good and not when there is a wave of crime.</P>
    <P>Let us not allow our hearts to govern us in this matter.  Let us use our heads as well as our hearts and do justice to the people who are not criminals and who are living decent, honest, clean lives and working hard to put a few pounds together to help their children.  Sometimes a thug will come along with a cosh, a stick, a bicycle chain or a broken bottle and smash an unfortunate individual and ruin him for life in body, mind and pocket.  There is too much hooliganism going on in this country at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to go slow about prison reform because Mountjoy is not a prison at all to some of those people but a convalescent home.  Some people there are having a right good time.  That should not be.  All that is wrong is that they cannot get out.  If they do get out they will go on a wave of crime again.  They say: &ldquo;We have the wireless, television, concerts, pictures. We get out on Sunday and talk <Col N="619" /> to one another.  We can move from cell to cell.  We see no difference between Mountjoy and outside.  When we are at home we have to work whereas in here we have nothing to do. Why should we come out at all?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are two sides to it.  If you make prison life too easy you will have plenty of criminals; if you leave prison life plain and straight, in conformity with the needs of society, so that a man who commits a crime is punished for it and serves the full sentence for his crime, you are doing justice.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;2. &mdash;A member of the staff of Radio Éireann who ceased to be a civil servant on the establishment of that authority under the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, shall for all income tax purposes be treated not less favourably than if he was an ordinary Schedule E tax-payer as from 5th April, 1960.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment following the discussion on the Committee Stage so as to give the Minister an opportunity of indicating his views on it in accordance with the hope that he expressed that he would be able to do so at this stage.

      <P>When the new system of P.A.Y.E. was introduced by a Bill here, it was debated and the point of view of civil servants was explained and I think agreed with.  Civil servants pay income tax on a P.A.Y.E. system at the moment and those who were working with the Broadcasting Authority had paid income tax fully for 1959-60 by the 5th April.  Now, <Col N="620" /> if they are to be exempt from income tax from the 5th April until the 1st October, they will then go on to P.A.Y.E. but they would have had a six months' holiday, as it were, from income tax and in that way they would be in a much more favourable position than the ordinary Schedule E tax-payer who pays his income tax on 1st January and 1st July.  I suppose most Deputies here have their documents on their tables or desks waiting to pay tomorrow or next day, if they are prompt payers of income tax and they know that is the case.  If the Broadcasting Authority employees had gone over to the new Television Authority on the 1st April they would have had that six months after that but actually they were being transferred during the period.  I am not sure whether it is the 1st June or 1st July but I think it was on the 1st June they were transferred.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 14, after &ldquo;harbours&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and in respect of any profits or gains of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned this matter on the Committee Stage.  The Minister provides in Section 7 of the Bill exemption for harbour authorities.  In consequence of the provisions contained in Section 7, a harbour authority will not have to <Col N="621" /> pay any income tax in the future in respect of what I might best term its surplus of operating receipts over operating expenditure.  Theoretically, that is called profit under the Income Tax Acts but, of course, it is something that is ploughed back.  That is a new conception in relation to that type of ploughing back organisation and I think, therefore, when it is being adopted in respect of a harbour authority it should equally be extended in relation to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that my amendment has been deliberately phrased so as to ensure that the exemption will mean that the Board itself will pay tax on any income arising from any investments it may have. One can never be certain of anything from a drafting point of view but if I have not succeeded in doing that, that certainly was my intention &mdash;to provide that in respect of income it might get from the investments it might hold, it would be in a different situation from that which applied to the other surpluses.  The difference between the gross operating profit and the gross operating expenditure is something that it was always intended under the scheme to plough back and it is something that it would be desirable in the public interest to plough back.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be any difference of opinion between the Minister and myself when I say that our aim and object in all taxation and social legislation should be to provide the inducements and the means by which those who are able to make provision for their social needs should be induced to make that provision. The inducement in this instance arises in two ways.  It arises first by reason of the tax concession for the individual provided in the 1955 Finance Act I think &mdash; either 1955 or 1956 &mdash; but more than that we want to ensure that the Board is able to offer satisfactory schemes, able to offer inducements so that its schemes will go to the furthest possible point.  It is particularly desirable in the early years of the Board, therefore, that it would have no barrier in the way of producing the best and widest possible scheme.  There are bound to be some comparisons <Col N="622" /> with organisations outside Ireland that were heretofore carrying on sickness benefit schemes in this country and which had been established long before.</P>
    <P>By reason of the fact that they were long-established, I think many of these non-profit-making foundations as well as the profit-making companies carrying on sickness benefit schemes were able, because of the funds they had built up, to offer terms wider, perhaps, than the new company would be able to offer.  I think it is up to us to ensure that the new Irish company will be put in the position as soon as possible of being able to establish itself even more firmly than it has been able to do so far and to ensure that any surplus resulting in any particular year from its operations can be ploughed back <i>in toto</i> without the Minister for Finance for the time being extracting his pound of flesh from it.</P>
    <P>Theoretically, it may seem to the Minister that by agreeing to this he would be losing something from the Exchequer.  I do not think that is so.  I think the Minister will go with me as far as saying that the more the voluntary health scheme succeeds the less he will have to pay under the Health Estimate.  If he adopts this amendment while it may mean a small diminution in receipts into the Exchequer from Schedule D income tax, nevertheless, the success of the Board will mean that he will have to meet in future less expenditure under the Health Estimate.</P>
    <P>It is not, perhaps, strictly relevant, but I think it would be wrong for me to make reference to the work of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board without adding the comment that not merely have I felt its beneficial results in the case of illness in my own family but I have heard widespread commendation of its field of activity, of the manner of its administration and of the way in which it is grappling with the problems.  That commendation that is published so frequently by people is something that should be taken into account and added as another argument as to why they <Col N="623" /> should be allowed to get on with the good work without any drain on them from taxation of this sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to say that the comments I have heard of the workings of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board lead me to agree with the Deputy.  They have all been favourable.  There is no doubt that it has made very great progress in its activities since it started.  Unfortunately, we cannot decide the issue on that alone and neither did the Deputy ask me to decide the issue on that alone.</P>
      <P>First of all, the Board is carrying on a trade or business and in the ordinary way would be taxed on its profits and the Deputy is proposing that we should exempt this body from income tax on its profits.  The Deputy is probably quite well aware that in the Department of Finance one of the biggest fears they have is the fear of creating precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that in this instance the fear of creating precedent is a real fear.  There are many other organisations which could claim that they were doing very good work from the national point of view, not operating for personal gain or profits for shareholders or anything of that kind and it would, I am afraid, open the door to a very big number of applications which could be supported if we were to agree in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall confine myself, however, to the analogy of those who insure themselves against fire or accident or who take out a life endowment policy.  It will be agreed that the person who insures himself with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board gets much better terms because he is exempt as far as his premium goes from both income tax and surtax.  In the case of a life policy, the person, if he insures with an Irish company, gets two-thirds free of income tax on his premium; if it is not with an Irish company, it is only half.  If he insures <Col N="624" /> against fire and accident and other things, he gets no relief whatever.  The insurance company, in the other case, has to pay full tax, of course, on its profits as well as on its investments. So, those who are dealing with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are getting very favourable terms.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was going through the Dáil, it was pointed out that a very essential feature of the whole scheme was that it should be self-supporting and should not impose any charge on the Exchequer.  That has been lived up to indeed.  It was laid down when the Bill was going through that they were to get some small loan to carry them through their initial stages and that is as much as it has ever applied for.  It would be inconsistent, however, with the intention to make the Board entirely self-sufficient or self-supporting if it were to get this income tax exemption because, after all, we can look on that only as an annual subsidy to enable them to carry on.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I can say very much more.  I suppose we could draw this debate out for quite a long time, but this Board was set up as a self-supporting body and has lived up to that.  The difficulty of making it an exceptional case is the biggest argument I can use against the Deputy's request in this case.  Therefore, I have to oppose the Deputy and say that I cannot agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>May I say a word in relation to what the Minister has said?  The concluding words the Minister used are not entirely final. The Minister has said that there is a fear in the Department &mdash; Deputy Sweetman interpolated &ldquo;any Department&rdquo;&mdash; against creating a precedent and that is quite understandable.  The Minister will find that it was always understood to be the law that a statutory board of this kind which was expressly excluded from profit making by the terms of the statute creating it was not, in fact, liable for income tax.  It was only a decision, the name of which escapes me at the moment, some time in 1953 or 1954 that held that view of the law not to be precisely correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> When the Voluntary Health Insurance Bill was before this House it originally contained a section expressly excluding the Board from income tax liability.  It was felt that such a section was more suitable for inclusion in a Finance Bill rather than in a Bill dealing with health insurance, even though it was laying down the terms and the rights and the liabilities of the new Board.  Accordingly, the proposed section was taken out of the Voluntary Health Insurance Bill as it then was and the matter of its inclusion in a Finance Bill was deferred for further consideration.</P>
    <P>I merely mention to the Minister that the question of the Board's not being liable to income tax was certainly present to the mind of the then Minister in introducing the Bill in the House and I have little doubt that my colleague.  Deputy Sweetman, in due course, in a Finance Bill, would have dealt with the matter, which might have been dealt with had the section been left in the Voluntary Health Insurance Bill as it was originally planned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said very fairly and properly that the idea of health insurance as it was introduced here was that the Board should be self-supporting and should pay its own way.  In the Act setting it up, provision was made for two loans of £25,000, not exceeding the sum of £50,000, to the Board to enable them to go into business.  In fact, the Board indented merely for a loan of £13,000 and that loan has been fully repaid with interest to the State.  The position has been that the Board has lived up to the hopes held out for it on its establishment but anyone looking at the finances of the Board in its annual report will realise it has had to put aside, comparatively speaking, quite a considerable sum to meet this income tax liability and the State in continuing to charge the Board that income tax, in effect, is making money out of the prudent provision by people in insuring against the hazards of ill-health.</P>
    <P>That was never contemplated when this Bill was introduced.  It was far removed from the minds of the then <Col N="626" /> Government.  It was always the intention &mdash; I am speaking purely for myself &mdash;that this Board would be prevented from making money out of health insurance but because it could not make money, that it would not be liable, merely because it received from a premium payer a sum of money, to be charged income tax.</P>
    <P>I had intended in any event to refer to this matter on another occasion this evening but I would press the Minister not to approach this in any facile manner, not merely to say this is just the same as any other such board and is not a precedent.  Health insurance creates a precedent and I think a very good precedent in this or any other country.  When the Bill was introduced here, I stated that it was the first measure of social welfare in any country in the world in respect of which the taxpayer would not be asked to pay a penny.  That statement has been lived up to.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Deputy Sweetman's amendment is to provide that this type of social relief should not be taxed but should be encouraged so that it can develop and perhaps have a parallel in other spheres of activity.  I would urge the Minister not to reject the amendment out of hand because there is a matter of considerable principle involved. I shall not put it any further than this: if Deputy Sweetman had introduced the ensuing Finance Bill, I have little doubt that it would have contained the section envisaged by the amendment.  In those circumstances, I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter very carefully.</P>

      <P>I cannot remember how far the discussion had gone, but I know there was a discussion on this matter, whether in relation to voluntary health insurance or otherwise as to the difference between taxing of a surplus and taxing of income arising from investments that would be held by the body.  I can remember quite clearly digging my toes in and saying that in relation to investment held by the body, the income from this investment must remain taxable but that the surplus from gross receipts over gross expenditure was a matter I was prepared to go into further.  Whether this was the case or not, I cannot honestly remember, but I am quite prepared to leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say just one other thing? The Minister says he is afraid of creating a precedent here.  There are not many precedents in respect of which if you do create them you would also have a precedent at the other end, that is, that the greater success of <Col N="628" /> this means lesser Exchequer expenditure. The Minister by promoting greater success for the voluntary health insurance scheme will save himself expenditure on the ordinary Health Estimate and I think the Minister would be hard set to find a precedent, giving away a small amount of revenue to save a larger amount of expenditure, which would be more readily jumped at by the Department of Finance or by any other Department.  I withdraw the amendment if the Minister will reconsider the question.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 42, after &ldquo;rendered&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;to the person carrying on such trade or business&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In relation to this matter which we discussed on Section 9 last week, the Minister has gone some distance to meet my point with the following amendment, No. 4.  However, I am still not very happy.  Taking a solicitor as an example, I can see a situation in which I pay money for a client.  I would do this in connection with my business because my business is to pay money for clients.  It seems to me that on that basis I would be caught by the Minister's amendment, No. 4, in having to disclose and to return payments I made merely as an agent for somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there could be any doubt whatever in regard to my amendment because it makes it clear that the services must be rendered to me.  We mentioned the other day the question of fees paid to counsel and I should like to take the same example today.  I am not trying to restrict it to that but I am using it purely as being explanatory of what I have in mind.  If I pay a fee to counsel, I pay it for services rendered not to me but to my client.  Under my amendment, that would not be included in the return because the services are not rendered to me.  However, if I were to accept the Minister's amendment, it could most certainly be held that I pay a fee to counsel in connection with my business, because my business is <Col N="629" /> doing business for my clients and paying counsel is part of my business for my clients.  It is a net drafting issue.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has no desire to incorporate in this section moneys that are paid by someone as an agent merely for somebody else.  He merely wants to catch moneys that I pay as a principal.  I do not think there is any difference between us but it does seem to me, on my interpretation of the drafting of the two amendments, that there is a substantial difference.  I had my amendments drafted beforehand and I held them in cold store until I saw the Minister's amendments.  I had some other gems for him, but he has met the points and so I did not put them in.  But I considered carefully before putting in No. 3 whether, in fact, the Minister in No. 4 did meet my difficulty, and I came to the conclusion that he did not.  I might add that I consulted elsewhere also and I was advised that there was some doubt as to whether the Minister's amendment did catch the agent who habitually, as part of his business, paid certain moneys for another principal. There can be no doubt whatever on that ground if the Minister accepts my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that the Deputy's form of words might be a bit more restrictive than mine &mdash; a bit too restrictive, I am afraid.  As far as my legal advice goes, I do not think there would be any danger that a solicitor could be compelled to say what he paid to counsel because he is paying on behalf of a client.  Possibly, it could be held, as the Deputy has pointed out, that it is part of his business to defend his clients and, therefore, part of his business to engage counsel to help him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy will agree that there is definitely no danger of what he feared, namely, that an inspector of taxes might ask him how much he paid to a certain client by way of settlement.  That is definitely ruled out.  I am afraid the Deputy's words would be too restrictive altogether. There is an example I should like to put before the Deputy.  A manufacturer sells a machine.  The buyer <Col N="630" /> complains that the machine is not working properly.  The manufacturer engages an engineer who happens to be convenient and he asks him to look at the machine and advise on it.  Under the Deputy's wording we would be precluded, I am afraid, from getting information as to what the manufacturer paid the engineer.</P>
    <P>Under my amendment there would be no such difficulty.  It is unlikely we would ever be getting after an engineer like that, but I give the example to show the difference between the wording in the two amendments.  In my amendment no danger need be apprehended.  It gives a little more latitude to the Revenue Commissioners to get information.  I am told, however, that the principle underlying this is that it must be an effective payment and it is held that effective payment is made by the person who is the ultimate payer, not an agent.</P>

There was an objection to the fact that there was no time limit on the Revenue Commissioners as to how far back they might go when looking for information.  It was suggested we might put in a limit.

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give the Minister an opportunity of answering the various queries that I threw at him rather quickly and, possibly, without notice in relation to Section 22 on the Committee Stage. First, I asked the Minister to give me the estimated yield from the various Orders that are being made.  Unless I am forced to, I do not intend to have an acrimonious political argument about levies and quasi-levies.  I have no intention of starting that hare, but I think we are entitled to know the other side of the picture in relation to the diminution by, I think, £575,000 that the releasing part of these Orders involves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was, I think, a little bit puzzled, just as I was puzzled myself, in relation to the second question I asked.  Why, in all the Tables that were issued over the last four years as being explanatory of the Budget, was account taken of the diminution in revenue because of the Order then made dealing with the matter at Budget time, but no account taken of the increase in revenue which would accrue by reason of exactly the same instrument?  The printed Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure issued on the Saturday before the Budget are clearly set out as being operative at the rates in force. The rates then in force were varied by remission, on the one hand, and by increase, on the other hand, by the <Col N="633" /> same part of an operation, and it seems to me that when one side of that operation is included in the explanatory Table, the other side should also be included.</P>
    <P>There was, I think, also a third point I made in relation to these new Orders in connection with oil.  I am sure the Minister has it in front of him &mdash; column 189 &mdash; where I asked the estimated figure for the third and fourth items that were mentioned then. We had different categories and different rates of duties in relation to the categories.  It is not so much that which I have in my mind, but the total additional revenue expected to accrue to customs duties by reason of the Order now made, by virtue whereof £575,000 comes up on the revenue side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the explanatory Table of the current Budget, the figure given under the heading &ldquo;Deductions for tax rebates and reliefs &mdash;special import levies&rdquo; was £555,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And for hydrocarbon heavy oils, it was £500,000.  The special import levies, of course, included all customs duties and is a net figure.  There were certain reductions and some complete abolitions of levies or duties, as the case may be. For instance, for newsprint, bananas and some of the fresh fruits, they amounted to £200,000.  They have completely gone, but, apart from that, there is a very long list of changes in duties where the import levy was taken off but the customs duty remains, and some cases where the levy was reduced and where, I think, the customs duty was reduced, too.  The net result of the whole lot was that, when the gains were deducted from the losses, the net figure was £555,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that was the form in which it was shown in the last couple of years &mdash; the form of a net figure.  There was not as much change in any other <Col N="634" /> year as there was this year, but, nevertheless, the net figure was given. It is a net figure and, therefore, there was no reason for showing anything on the other side of the balance sheet. I suppose we could have shown a bigger figure, and a smaller figure on the other side, which would give the same result, but on going back over these explanatory Tables that were issued with the Budget, I think it was a net figure that was given during the past couple of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <P> (1)  The Agreement, set forth in the <i>Third Schedule</i> to this Act, made on the 23rd day of June, 1960, between the Government and the United Kingdom Government relating to the Agreement set forth in Part I of the First Schedule to the Finance Act, 1926 (as amended by the agreements set forth in the First Schedule to the Finance Act, 1928, the First Schedule to the Finance Act, 1948, and the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1959), is hereby confirmed and, subject to confirmation by the United Kingdom Parliament, shall have effect accordingly.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purpose of carrying out any obligation under Article 2 of the Agreement set forth in the <i>Third Schedule</i> to this Act, the Government may by order direct that any provisions of the Income Tax Acts specified in the order, being provisions affecting in any way exemptions from income tax of persons resident in the State, shall not affect, and be deemed not to have affected, exemptions from income tax which persons enjoy as not resident in the State but resident in the United Kingdom, and any such order shall have effect accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 12 and 14 go together.  Amendment No. 13 is purely a drafting amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to insert a section to give statutory powers to implement the Agreement that was signed on 23rd June, and the Agreement is set out in the Schedule.  This section, which will now be Part V and which, I think, will be Section 34 of the Bill, has two parts.  The first part of the section says that: &ldquo;The Agreement set forth in the third Schedule to this Act... <Col N="636" /> is hereby confirmed and, subject to confirmation by the United Kingdom Parliament, shall have effect accordingly.&rdquo; The meaning of that subsection is that when the Agreement is confirmed, if we on our side withdraw an exemption from income tax, by passing the law through the Oireachtas in the Finance Bill, it will have the effect of preventing a person living in that country from having the benefit of that exemption in future.  If that were not passed, however, a person living in England who did the same type of business here, could claim the exemption under the residence agreement. If you like, this is to say to that person: &ldquo;You are not entitled to claim any benefit under the residence agreement.  It does not apply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) then lays down how we would operate under Article 2 of the Schedule.  If we bring in legislation withdrawing an exemption and apply it not only to our own citizens but also to residents of Great Britain, the latter might claim that, under the residence agreement, they were exempt, and if we refuse to accept that, they might complain to the British Government that they were being treated unfairly.  If the British Government approached us and said: &ldquo;This is unfair under the residence agreement and we think you should not go ahead with it&rdquo; and if we agree to that, subsection (2) gives us power to make an Order rescinding that clause and giving exemption to the person in England.  We need not necessarily rescind it as far as our own citizens are concerned.  This section gives the force of law to the working of the agreement.</P>
    <P>We have, I might say, very few exemptions in this country.  We have exemptions from income tax for charities and for superannuation funds, but very few beyond that.  If the exemption is being abused and we withdraw it, Article 1 lays down that that would apply also to a person resident in England who might, under the double income tax agreement, claim exemption.  To that extent the double income tax agreement would be amended.  If we pass legislation of that kind, Article 2 gives power to the <Col N="637" /> British Government to object and say it is not in the spirit of the agreement. If we agree, we take action under subsection (2) of the section; if we do not agree, it is laid down here that, with that exception, everything else in the agreement still holds good.  Article 3 lays down that it becomes effective when it has the force of law, that is, when it is sanctioned by the British Parliament and by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As far as this Schedule is concerned, it applies to income tax avoidance but only in respect of exemptions.  In no other respect does it apply.  For example, the British are now legislating to deal with persons who hope to be freed from income tax by manipulating income and capital.  We shall not be affected by that.  It is only in cases where an exemption is already there or is renewed that it would apply here, and in no other case.  It is a rather narrow field but it is a field in which very big transactions have been attempted or carried out in the past. We commenced legislating in 1958. Unfortunately, we were a bit late.  We did not suffer very badly, but we did suffer in respect of a few transactions that had taken place before the Act was passed.  We are very close to Great Britain and they think of things there more quickly than here because, I suppose, the prize is bigger.  When the door is closed to them there, they quickly come over to try the same thing here, and we have to be fairly quick to deal with actions of that kind.</P>

      <P>I take it that this is purely in respect of exemptions for persons, &ldquo;persons&rdquo; being used in the legal sense, that is to say, either individuals or companies, and that it does not affect any exemptions there may be in respect of the interest arising from certain securities &mdash; that the interest on certain securities is exempt from taxation here in certain circumstances where the person is not resident here. I do not think this could affect it because it seems to me, from line 3 of Article 1, that it deals with &ldquo;exemptions from income tax of that country of persons resident in that country&rdquo;, whereas the exemption I am thinking of is an exemption in respect of an Irish security for a person who is neither domiciled nor resident here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a different line from that of most Deputies in connection with prison reform.  It is not an opportune time to bring it in.  As far as juvenile delinquency is concerned, it is no harm to reform there and make some effort to put these people on the straight road and so avoid making criminals of them.  Deputy Dillon read an extract from an ex-prisoner's book&mdash;I think it was ex-Deputy Cowan's book &mdash; to the effect that flies were getting in the food.  There could be some substance in that complaint.  When I was in prison, one of our first complaints was that flies and insects of all kinds were getting in our food.  When you got your porringer of porridge, you had to get a spoon and stir the porridge up to get five or six cockroaches out of it.  I hope it is not so bad to-day.  If it is, ex-Deputy Cowan is quite right in raising this matter. After all, food should be served in a proper manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in prison in Scotland, we complained about all the hairs in the soup, if you could call it soup.  We got no reply.  It was only about three months afterwards, when we were released, that two of the attendants in <Col N="642" /> the cook-house asked us if we remembered having made a complaint.  We said we did.  They said not only were there hairs in the soup but we ate a cat Somebody shot at a cat in a field and it got into the boiler and so we had cat soup.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  I hope that the improvements he is endeavouring to carry out will be of benefit to the country.  I hope that when he does this, these people who are abnormal criminals over the years will have a change of heart.  If we do make concessions to them, I hope they will show their appreciation by respecting the law.  If they do not, we must rely upon strict justice.  We should first speak for the victims of those criminals and not for the criminals themselves. When a young man embarks upon a life of crime, we should do what we can to get him to mend his ways, and the only way to do that is by sending him to a school where he will learn Christian doctrine and come out a good citizen.</P>
    <P>These reformatories should be situated in country areas.  They should have a large farm attached upon which these people can work.  They will be working in the open air and will be enabled to make a return for the food they eat.  I took a different line from that taken by the other Deputies in the firm conviction that the time is not yet ripe for prison reform.  We have a huge wave of pillaging all over the country.  Bicycles, motorcars and handbags are stolen.  In fact, everything capable of being stolen is being taken.  There are between 6,000 and 8,000 bicycles in the police barracks year after year with nobody to claim them.  Thousands of crimes are committed which are not reported in the Press.  That shows that there is a wave of crime the like of which we have never experienced before.</P>
    <P>We must protect the decent people living honestly &mdash; people who try to pay good wages and who are the prey of louts and criminals.  It is idle to speak of reform at a time when there was never such a wave of villainy in the country.  That is why I took the line I did.  I was not going to fall for ex-Deputy Cowan's book or the book of <Col N="643" /> anybody else.  I believe the book is all right but at the same time it is the book of a man who was convicted of a criminal offence.  He had to stand his punishment.  Carl Chessman tried to make money out of a book and ended by being executed.  I do not want the Minister to be led by a book of that type.  If a book of that type needs to be written, let somebody put up with the rigours of prison life and write a book about his experiences.  I would stand by that but I would certainly not stand by the book of a man who is a &ldquo;hook&rdquo; himself.  That is as far as I shall go.  I wish the Minister well and I hope that what he is doing will bring about the desired results.  If it does, everything will be all right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support very much what Deputy Giles said.  I feel with him that this is not the time for softening up unduly in our treatment of convicted criminals.  Like him, I do not wish to be in any way bitter towards people who have fallen into crime, but I think there is a tendency, which has been shown in this House today, for some people to get unduly concerned about the well-being of prisoners in our prisons.  Reference to a certain, book is of very slight value. When Deputy Norton called upon the Minister to inquire why three flies had fallen into the soup, that was taking an entirely ridiculous line altogether. Anyone who has ever eaten in an institution knows that occasionally such incidents may happen.  They might happen in the Dáil Restaurant or they might even happen at home but trying to start a campaign by reason of such accusations seems to me to be far from helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we need is strict discipline and that is exercised in our prisons at the moment.  We do not wish to be unduly soft but there has been a great step forward by reason of the introduction of a proper parole sysem.  That is something I was always in favour of.  I spoke very strongly on the Estimate of the Department of Justice last year and I pleaded with the Minister on that occasion&mdash;I thought, without any success&mdash;to introduce such a sysem but apparently he had it in his mind all <Col N="644" /> along.  That is the proper way in which we can make progress.  Where a person has been convicted and has to be punished, he has got to be restrained in some way for some period but he will become an abnormal creature if he is cut off from the community for too long a period.</P>
    <P>I feel that the introduction of a proper parole system will make it much easier for the governors of our prisons to exercise a discretion, subject to the Minister's approval, in replacing in society those who have been convicted of crime.  It means that such people will be enabled to find their place in society more easily when the date of their final release comes around.  It will undoubtedly help them in regaining their self-respect when they are allowed out on their honour and when they come back of their own free will to resume serving their sentence.  Certainly the record in Northern Ireland where this scheme has been in operation for some time &mdash; and probably in Great Britain &mdash; has been singularly satisfactory and all, or practically all, of the prisoners allowed out on parole have reported back dead on time.  Such a scheme can accomplish a great deal of good for the prisoner himself and I strongly support the proposal.</P>
    <P>The whole question of penal reform is a very large one and I hope the Minister will regard this as a purely emergency enactment, if you like, to deal with some of the simpler matters which require attention.  I hope that the Minister and his Department will not relax on the passing of this Bill but will press on with a more drastic revision of the whole system of penal reform, particularly with reference to juvenile offenders.  There is a tremendous amount of work to be done in the analysis of the motives which animate those juvenile offenders and I hope that there will be much more specialised attention given in that regard.  I think the dropping of the title &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo; is a good idea.  In general there can be little or no criticism of the provisions relating to young people.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister referred in particular to Section 9, subsection (2), which deals with the detention <Col N="645" /> of persons only in an institution conducted in accordance with the religion of that person.  I appreciate that very much and I appreciate the Minister's statement that he would gladly co-operate with any Church authorities in recognising institutions for detention purposes.  The problem of the young Protestant juvenile delinquents is different not because the proportion of Protestant juvenile delinquents is less but because being such a small proportion of the total population, the incidence of delinquency is fairly low.  How that matter can be dealt with is not at all clear to me and I am sure it is not at all clear to the Minister either.  From the investigations I have been able to make through members of the societies connected with the Protestant Churches, I find that they have not a clear idea either.  I hope therefore they will co-operate with the Minister in seeing that any young Protestant delinquent who is detained will be looked after in some suitable way and in some suitable institution.</P>
    <P>In general I support this Bill without any reservation whatever but at the same time I should like to express the very sincere hope that the whole matter of penal reform will continue to receive great attention so that in the not too distant future we shall have much more comprehensive legislation which will enable those dealing with convicted criminals to do so in a more constructive way.  I wish the prison authorities all the very best in working out the provisions of this Bill.  I should not like anybody to feel that I was critical.  When I spoke on the Estimate for the Department of Justice last year some people wrote to me and criticised me bitterly for what I said in reference to our prisons being unsuitable places for people to be confined. Some members of Visiting Committees in particular felt I was criticising them.  I did not intend to criticise them for a moment.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with Deputy Giles in his plea that more prisoners should be given work outside.  I agree absolutely with him that confinement in prisons like Mountjoy and Portlaoise must be a soul-destroying experience, <Col N="646" /> no matter how well the prisoners are looked after.  The mere fact of being confined in such buildings must have a dreadful effect not only on the prisoners but also the prison staff.  Prisons essentially, by reason of their architecture, are depressing places.  In subsequent legislation I should like to see provision made for prisons without bars, with farm activities and so on carried on in the open so that men would not be so completely cut off from the community they have offended.  That can be done and we can take much greater steps than we are doing in this measure, but at least in this Bill we are moving in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been bedevilled to some extent by the issuing of the pamphlet so liberally quoted by Deputy Dillon.  I was given a copy of that pamphlet last evening.  I did not get it from the author although it was autographed by him and I was given a message that the references to the Minister were not intended to be a reflection on me.  Having looked through the document and having read some of the charges made in the document I can only assume that the only person he was referring to in the document was the Minister who was operating during the period about which he was writing.</P>
      <P>The author of the document concerned, having made all these charges &mdash; which I want to say are in the main untrue &mdash; goes on to pay tribute to the Governor of the prison.  As I suggested to Deputy Norton when he referred to that fact himself, the tribute to the Governor and to the Deputy Governor in fact cancelled out the charges he made in regard to the conduct of the prison.  Naturally the prison is under the control of the Governor and the Deputy Governor, and if the conditions which are said in this document to exist did in fact exist, then neither the Governor nor the Deputy Governor would be fitted to hold his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I received a copy of this document reasonably late last evening, and having seen the statements contained in it, I immediately had it examined by my officials, and by the <Col N="647" /> Governor of the prison.  I want to say the statements contained in this document are, in the main, untrue.  We all know that half truths are very difficult to disprove because of the fact that there is a slight element of truth in them.  Prison is a rather unpleasant place to be in, and it is intended to be unpleasant.  The people who are in prisons are generally people who have been convicted.</P>
    <P>We know that the diet which the author of this booklet received in Mountjoy would not suit his epicurean tastes.  That goes without saying, but I think anyone who has read this document will be rather surprised to find that he describes the food supply of the prison as:</P>
    <P>...poor, inadequate, monotonous and incapable of maintaining human beings in health.  A prisoner is never given such vital foods as butter, cheese, bacon, pork, roast, fried or grilled meat, sausages, black or white pudding, liver, kidney, heart, eggs, fish, brown bread, raw vegetables, salad, fresh fruit, peas, beans, scallions, beetroot, radishes, dried fruit, milk or milk foods (except the rice dinner diet on a Friday).  The food a prisoner gets is limited to white bread, potatoes, cabbage, onions, tea, margarine, a morsel of beef or mutton, an infinitesimal portion of jam, the concoction called &ldquo;broth&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>&mdash;and so on.  The author must have been thinking of one of these big hotels which cater for tourists when he started to think in those terms.</P>
    <P>I want now to try to deal as well as possible with some of the charges he has made.  Deputy Norton was terribly concerned today &mdash; genuinely concerned &mdash; with the statement contained in this document that food was being contaminated by flies being mixed up in it, and the suggestion was that that was a normal thing to happen in prison.  As I said, I immediately got my officials to get in touch with the Governor and he said there is no word of truth in the allegation about flies.</P>
    <P>I quite realise that to deal properly with this document which contains 115 <Col N="648" /> paragraphs, Deputies would need to have copies of it before them.  In respect to the complaint contained in paragraph 4, which is a long statement dealing with admission, clothing, bedding and cell equipment, this is what the Governor has to say:</P>
    <P>Short-term prisoners (seven days, etc.) are not issued with suits to measure but are dressed from a stock of worn clothes which are cleaned and disinfected before use and on which necessary repairs have been done.  Shirts are not issued if torn, and if damaged by wear are in use only to the end of the week at most.  Boot cleaning materials are issued to all wards and are available to the prisoners.</P>
    <P>That is the Governor's reply to the long statement contained in paragraph 4.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph 5, the Governor said that prisoners who do not provide their own soap receive a regular issue and that all prisoners may be issued with a toothbrush on request. All are allowed to shave as frequently as they desire and the average is about twice weekly.  The suggestion contained in the booklet is that the prisoners are not allowed to shave more than twice a week.  They can shave as often as they wish, and there is nothing to prevent them from shaving when they so desire.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph 6 the Governor states that knives and forks are issued to all, and that there are buckets under the taps to take all spilled water.  The author talks about the laundry and, as with every other portion of the establishment, he denounces it.  The statement of the Governor is that the laundry is modern and properly equipped.  Prisoners do not receive their own laundry but all are properly fitted.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10 of the Governor's Report states that almost 90 per cent. of the prisoners have previous convictions. Of the 170 convicted criminal prisoners on 27th June this year, only 20 were first offenders.  They were employed as cooks, bakers, artisans and gardeners, and as far as possible, they did not associate with old offenders <Col N="649" /> at work.  Those with previous convictions are usually employed on tailoring or shoe-making, but if a &ldquo;star man&rdquo; wishes to learn one of these trades it can be taught only by allowing him to associate with those who are at work on them.</P>
    <P>In former days before so many privileges such as evening recreation, radio, etc. were allowed the segregation was strict.  Prisoners were locked in their cells when not at work or exercise.  The prison authorities have no wish to return to the bad days of rigid segregation. They think that to have really strict segregation, it would be necessary to have different prisons.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph 12, the Governor states that of 33 untried prisoners at Mountjoy on 27th June this year, only two were under 21 and their position will be remedied by the new Criminal Justice Act.  The alternative to association at work and exercise would be separate or solitary confinement and the reintroduction of the rule of silence.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 14 refers to the question of diet.  The dietary is approved by the medical authorities and extras and variants are granted by the medical officer as found necessary.  There is no evidence to support the statements in paragraph 15; on the contrary, prisoners usually gain weight and improve in health.  With regard to paragraph 16, the 7.30 p.m. supper was put on about 20 years ago and prisoners now receive four meals per day.</P>
    <P>The Irish Stew was denounced as mush and an awful thing to offer to anyone.  The Governor's statement says that Irish Stew on Mondays and Wednesdays is the most popular dinner of the week and is always favourably commented on by the Visiting Committee. It is not made as suggested. The meat is inspected immediately on delivery and if not up to standard is returned and replaced.  The suggestion was that the meat was flung into a pot as it came in, that it was never inspected, that it could be any type of meat and that it could be unsound.</P>
    <P>Some references were made to the manner in which the beef is cooked. <Col N="650" /> It was suggested it was cooked the day before it was served.  The beef is cooked fresh on the day of consumption and broth is made according to the scale laid down.</P>
    <P>The Governor states, in regard to paragraph 25, that in any case of doubtful meat the medical officer is consulted before acceptance.  In other words, it has got to pass the medical test before the authorities are allowed to accept it as a final delivery.</P>

      <P>The medical officer examines the meat.  If he finds it is sound and not diseased or contaminated or anything like that he gives it his sanction, I suppose. Furthermore, in the course of this booklet, the writer says old broken enamel mugs were given to the prisoners out of which to take their meals although some of them were rusty and leaking.  The answer to that charge is that enamel ware is taken out of use as soon as it begins to chip and that rusty or leaking utensils are never used.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 28 it is stated that the kitchen is not up to date.  The cooking plant in the kitchen is all new.  The cooking is done by steam except some special diets which are done on the electric cooker.  Permission for the installation of the latter was given by the Department and no conditions were ever laid down regarding its use. It is suggested in the booklet that the prison authorities are not allowed to use the electric cooker except on the special authority of the Department. That is not true.  The Department has never forbidden any officer to attend courses, and so on.  It was suggested that some of the prison officers were anxious to attend courses to gain some knowledge in respect of cookery and matters pertaining to the cooking of food.  The Department has never forbidden any officer to attend these courses.  Prisoners for all classes of works are selected by the Chief Officer according to their suitability, usually in consultation with the officer under whom they will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> With regard to paragraph 31 of the booklet I may say that the workshops are situated in a large, well-ventilated, bright hall which is better than any similar accommodation in any prison outside this country which has been visited by the Governor.  There are adequate toilet facilities.  The usual prison trades are carried out there. The Governor has visited quite a number of foreign prisons.  Naturally he always compares the accommodation of the prison for which he is responsible with that in any prison he may visit.  I have just stated his view in regard to the criticism in respect of the main hall.</P>
    <P>In reply to the charge contained in paragraph 34, all prisoners selected for work in bakery, kitchen or food stores must first be approved by the medical officer before commencing work.  There was some suggestion that people with diseases or something of that kind were allowed to handle food, and so on.</P>
    <P>Insane remand prisoners even when charged with murder are invariably certified insane by the prison medical officer and another doctor if they are considered dangerous to themselves or to others.  An Order of the district justice is not necessary for this.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 38 there was the suggestion that some prisoners were mixing with other prisoners and should not be allowed to do so.  The Governor says that prisoners with homosexual tendencies are kept under observation but the alleged practice of locking toilets is unknown.  Slops were collected in the old hospital by the cleaners but food was distributed by the prison cook.</P>
    <P>Hospital patients are entitled to baths at least as often as other prisoners in the main prison and no complaint was ever received from Captain Cowan or anyone else about the bathing facilities.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to paragraph 40 is that mutton is provided for dinner on all days except Sunday.  The manner of cooking is not laid down but it is boiled, roasted or stewed.</P>
    <P>No hospital patient is ever employed at any work but a suitable prisoner &mdash;<Col N="652" /> not a patient &mdash; is detailed as cook under the supervision of the senior hospital officer.  Like the cooks, and so on, in the prison he is first examined and approved by the medical officer. Nothing is known of the other matters mentioned and no such complaint was made by Captain Cowan during his imprisonment, most of which was spent in the hospital.</P>
    <P>The reply to paragraph 42 is that prisoners serving reasonably long sentences are provided with dentures free of charge when necessary.  The visiting dentist is a highly-qualified man and his efficiency has never been questioned.</P>
    <P>Discussions are at present in progress between the Governor and the Chief Librarian for the City of Dublin for the setting-up of a library service in the prison.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph 61, I may say that on release every prisoner whose home is not in the City is given a rail or a bus ticket to his home town.</P>
    <P>These replies deal in the main with the statements contained in that booklet. I have here two reports of members of the Visiting Committee.  Their visits took place during the time the author of this booklet was a prisoner in Mountjoy.  The first report I propose to quote was made by a member of the Visiting Committee who is also an eminent medical doctor in the City. He says:</P>
    <P>I visited the male section of the prison on the 25th instant.  I interviewed several prisoners in the workshops and received no complaints. I also visited the kitchen and was impressed by the cleanliness and the hygienic conditions under which meals were prepared.  As the evening meal was about to be served I examined the food and considered it sufficient and of good quality. Cafeteria arrangements for serving the meals worked with clockwork precision and ensured a hot meal for each prisoner.  I was agreeably pleased to notice the cleanliness of the prison.  The walls and floors were scrupulously clean and this reflects great credit on the Governor and his staff.</P>
    <P>Another report dated 2nd September <Col N="653" /> 1958 from a member of the Visiting Committee is even more pointed.  She says:</P>
    <P>To-day I visited all parts of the male prison and found same clean and tidy as usual.  I interviewed prisoners and they had no complaints. I saw one, Cowan, in his cell, ill.  He said he was progressing satisfactorily and was satisfied with his treatment.  I saw the evening meal in course of preparation and it was of the usual high standard.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that during the period of the incarceration of the author of this booklet, no complaints were forthcoming from him to the Governor and we must assume that when he decided to write this book, he came to the conclusion that there would be no use in writing a book in praise of the prison and that the only book that would be of any value commercially would be one that would make the type of criticism he has made here, the type which he probably regards as the sensational kind that would make for good publicity from the point of view of sales.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about the juvenile delinquent and the fact is that juvenile delinquents, like any other persons who are sent to prison, are sent there only after they have been tried, after the evidence against them has been carefully examined and they have been found guilty.  What I find in regard to this type of prisoner is that there is an abnormal number of cases in which the Probation of Offenders Act is applied not once, twice or three times but, perhaps, a half-dozen times.  I do not think it was ever the intention that such a degree of consideration should be given.  If a person offends only once, he should be given an opportunity to reform but when he fails to reform on being given another chance and then continues in his criminal career I cannot see that we should shed any tears in this House about the treatment he receives.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that so far as the treatment meted out to these juvenile delinquents as they are called, is concerned, they are under the strictest supervision of the authorities <Col N="654" /> in the prison, including a full-time chaplain who looks after their interests and does everything possible to ensure that they will reform in the course of time.  The medical officer attached to the prison is also a psychiatrist; he examines these prisoners from that point of view so that some of the views and fears expressed here this evening are not justified.</P>
    <P>Most of Deputy Declan Costello's speech dealt with this question of subnormal children.  That has nothing to do with this Bill.  Subnormal children are for another Department to deal with.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not intended to be a general reform of the criminal law &mdash; that matter would require a considerable amount of time before a Bill could be brought in.  This Bill was brought about in the main by reason of my own experience as Minister for Justice.  I was not very long in the Department when I had an application from one of the prisoners for a period of parole to visit his mother who was dying.  I was assured that the mother was expressing a very strong desire to see her son and naturally I felt very sentimental about it and I was leaning very strongly towards granting the parole.  My officials assured me that I had no power to do so.  Nevertheless, I took the risk and granted parole and the man honoured it and came back in due course.</P>
    <P>Very shortly afterwards, a similar case arose and again I took the risk of granting parole.  If these individuals to whom I had given parole were not prepared to come back, there was no law to ensure that they could be taken back; when they were released on parole, they were, in effect, being released from imprisonment.  I decided that if that was the position, it would be desirable that we should bring in a Bill that would enable me or any other Minister for Justice to grant parole in circumstances such as I was confronted with.  This Bill is the result of that experience.</P>
    <P>The officials naturally took advantage of the fact that the Bill was being introduced to bring in the other matters with which the Bill deals, the <Col N="655" /> granting of parole to criminal lunatics and arranging for criminal lunatics to be housed in a mental institution convenient to their homes.  At present there are only three places in which there are prisons and the situation as it exists is that a criminal lunatic can only be taken into the mental institutions in the immediate locality of the appropriate prison which is sometimes very far from the person's relatives and friends.  Under this Bill, we are making arrangements to enable us to have them placed in institutions reasonably convenient to relatives and friends and the costs and expenses which these unfortunate people have to bear will be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton was very anxious that a prisoner, especially in Portlaoise prison, which is a long term prison, should be taught something in the nature of a craft.  That is done as far as it is possible to do it but it is not always possible because very many persons who find themselves in these institutions are not of the type to whom a craft of the kind the Deputy had in mind could be taught.  Some are persons who have only a clerical knowledge and they would not be fitted to take up the type of work that the Deputy had in mind.</P>
    <P>The position in respect to juvenile delinquents will be changed as a result of the passing of this Bill.  At the present time the courts on conviction have no option but to sentence a boy to imprisonment.  We get over that when he has been in Mountjoy for a few hours by transferring him to St. Patrick's Institution.  So that the question of association with hardened criminals does not, in fact, arise at all. One of the things that we are very careful about, whether they are first offenders or boys who have offended on a number of occasions, is to keep them away from the professional type of criminal.</P>
    <P>It occurred to me when Deputy Dillon was talking &mdash; he seemed to me to be half believing the statements contained in the document that has been quoted here to-day &mdash; that one of the best methods by which I could disabuse Deputy Dillon's mind and the <Col N="656" /> minds of other Deputies is to invite Deputy Dillon to visit Mountjoy.  He can pick the day he likes so that there will be no question of arrangements being made for his reception.  If he is prepared to go there and to see for himself, I shall, in due course, make the arrangements which will permit him to do so.  If necessary, I shall include the leaders of the other groups in the House, including a Deputy from the Independent group who could be nominated by that group.  The best answer I could give to the statements contained in the document is to allow the selected members of this House I have referred to to enter the prison and to see for themselves the conditions which exist there.  If they do that, they will come away feeling that the conditions are not anything like those described in this document.</P>

      <P>We shall let them out on parole at any rate.  The prison hospital was situated in a separate building.  That was the arrangement down through the years.  It was, I suppose, deemed right that the hospital should be separate from the prison proper.  In view of the very small number of patients who are in the hospital in recent times we have created in one of the wings of the prison which is unoccupied a very much more comfortable and modern type of hospital bay and in future patients who require treatment will receive it in that wing of the prison and under very much better conditions than before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, the statements contained in the booklet that has been quoted are a gross reflection on the Governor, on the Deputy Governor and on the staff of the prison.  If the conditions were such as have been suggested in this booklet, then certainly these people would not be discharging the duty imposed upon them.  I do not believe for a moment, from my own personal experience, having visited the prison on a number of occasions, that there is an atom of truth in the statemeats <Col N="657" /> contained in this book.  I believe it is done purely for the sake of personal publicity.  As I have said before, to write a book in praise of the prison would be of no use to the individual who wrote the book.  It had to be a book of that type of sensational criticism rather than anything else.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,525,600 be granted to complete <Col N="658" /> the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1961, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard Chlaraitheora) and certain services administered by that Office including grants to local authorities and miscellaneous grants.</P>
    <P>As in previous years, I shall preface any discussion of the Estimate and of the various problems facing my Department by referring to the more significant vital statistics for the preceding calendar year.  The figures which I quote are at this stage provisional, but I do not expect that there will be any serious alteration in them.</P>
    <P>The number of births registered in 1959 was 60,188, as compared with 59,510 in 1958.  The birth rate, at 21.1 per thousand population was again higher than in England and Wales where it was 16.5 per 1,000, and than in Scotland where it was 19.1 per 1,000. Marriages were more numerous in 1959 than in 1958, there being 15,255 as against 15,061.  The general death rate, at 12 per 1,000 population, was the same as in 1958.</P>
    <P>There were significant changes in the rates of deaths from particular causes, among them tuberculosis, the death rate from which continued to decline substantially.  There were, indeed, only 517 deaths from all forms of the disease in 1959, as compared with 581 in 1958 or, to go back a little further to the time when the disease was still a major scourge, with 2,712 in 1949.  The death rate from tuberculosis in 1959 was 18 per 100,000 of the population, which was the lowest ever and compares very strikingly with the rate, five times as high, of 91 per 100,000 which was experienced ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Fewer died in 1959 from acute poliomyelitis, the figure being 2 for the year as compared with 9 in 1958.  In the case of diphtheria, however, there was a significant increase from 6 to 9 deaths, underlining the need to avoid complacency in the matter if immunisation for diphtheria, or, indeed, for any other infectious disease.  Tuberculosis <Col N="659" /> and the other infective and parasitic diseases &mdash; which caused a total of 697 deaths in 1959 &mdash; have, I am glad to say, become one of the lesser categories of the causes of death.</P>
    <P>In 1959, the two major causes were again heart diseases, responsible for 10,821 deaths, and cancer, which caused 4,777.  In the present state of medical knowledge the task of combating these conditions is a formidable one.</P>
    <P>So far no such advance in pharmacology as has provided most effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of T.B. has been experienced in their case, and now they have become a cause of grave and increasing concern to Ministers and Departments of Health the world over.  Among the cancer deaths, there were 601 from the forms of that disease which we group together under the title of lung cancer.  It is to be noted that this was 37 more than for 1958.  The increase is very significant and should be regarded with serious concern and as a serious warning by all who smoke.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report that the maternal mortality rate declined from 103 per 100,000 births in 1958 to 66 per 100,000 in 1959.  There was also a fall in the infant mortality rate from 35 to 32 per 1,000 live births.  Though the decreases registered in these mortality rates are to be welcomed, nevertheless the position in regard to maternal and infant mortality is capable of very great improvement, as experience in the North of Ireland and in Great Britain shows.  Thus in England maternal mortality in 1959 was at the rate of 39 per 100,000 births; in north-eastern Ireland it was 58; and in Scotland 36.  The rates for infant mortality were: England and Wales 22 per 1,000 births, north-eastern Ireland 28.4 per 1,000 births, Scotland 28.4 per 1,000 also.  That our experience of maternal and infant mortality compares so unfavourably with the position in Great Britain and the rest of Ireland, should be of the greatest concern to us all, even allowing for the unusual pattern of relatively late marriages and large families.  I may say that it has been a major factor influencing certain <Col N="660" /> decisions which I have made and to which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>In regard to poliomyelitis, despite vaccination we are still far from the stage where we can afford to treat this disease with unconcern.  I have considered it therefore a wise precaution to ensure that the Regional Poliomyelitis Centres in Dublin, Cork, and Galway should be maintained in a constant state of efficiency and readiness to treat cases of the disease and to deal with a serious outbreak if it should occur. Past experience of the disease furnishes no reliable guide as to its likely incidence in the current or future years and if the available protective measures are not used the disease may continue to exact its toll of deaths and disability. Last year, when the number of cases of paralytic poliomyelitis was 39 with 2 deaths, might be described as a year of mild incidence.  The corresponding figures to date this year of 69 cases and 8 deaths are already higher than the figures for the whole of 1959.</P>
    <P>With the approach of the season when the incidence of poliomyelitis is generally highest, these figures emphasise the need for a high level of vaccination in the community and especially in young people.  Vaccination continues to be our only effective weapon against the spread of the more serious forms of the disease and provides a very high degree of protection. It is important therefore that the vaccination service provided by local health authorities should be fully availed of.</P>
    <P>Substantially more than one-half of the estimated gross expenditure of my Department is represented by Subhead 1, which provides for a total of £8,800,000 in grants to local health authorities in aid of their expenditure on health services.  These grants are authorised by the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, under which the State undertook to meet half of the cost of the local health services.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the services in the present year, having allowed for such receipts as charges made on patients, will be about £17.6 million.  This compares with £16.8 million in the year to <Col N="661" /> the 31st March, 1960, and £16.5 million in the year previous to that. The increase in the present year is due largely to the cost-of-living increase to officers and employees of health authorities.  I should mention here that, in addition to the amount which is paid from central and local taxation, it is probable that a sum of something like £1,250,000 will be paid from the Hospitals Trust Fund to voluntary hospitals by way of deficit grants.  The total expenditure from public funds this year on the health services may be taken, therefore, to be about £18.8 millions.</P>
    <P>It is relevant at this stage to refer to demands which have been made for the State to accept responsibility for the larger part, or even for the full cost of the health services.  To put these demands in their proper perspective, I must tell the House of the position which existed before 1947, when the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act was passed.  Local finances at that time bore by far the greater part of the cost of the local health services and were supplemented only by modest State Grants, grants of which the local authorities were not free to dispose but were obliged to apply to limited specific purposes.  Thus, in the year to 31st March, 1948, these limited grants totalled only about £830,000, no more than a mere 16 per cent. of the cost of the services, whilst the local authorities had to meet the remaining 84 per cent.</P>
    <P>This position was radically readjusted in favour of the local ratepayers by the Act of 1947.  Under that Act the State undertook to meet, for each health authority, the full amount of any increase in the cost of its services until the total cost was twice the amount met by that authority from local taxation in the year ending on 31st March, 1948.  When this point had been reached the cost was to be divided equally between the two.</P>
    <P>Since 1947-48 the total cost of the local health services has risen from about £5.7 million to the £17.6 million estimated for the current year.  In the initial stages of this upward trend, the State bore the entire additional cost. Thus, in the year to 31st March, 1951, the local authorities' contribution, at <Col N="662" /> £4.8 million, was the same as in 1947-48, whereas the State's contribution had risen from the £830,000 which I have mentioned, to £3,700,000.  The State's liability borne on this Vote in respect of the present year's estimated expenditure is £8.8 million, which will be matched by an equal expenditure from the revenues of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that whereas the local contribution has increased by £3.8 million, that is by about 80 per cent. over its 1947-48 figure, the State's contribution under Vote 58 alone has increased in the same period by £7.8 million, and it is now over ten times as great as in 1947-48.  I should point out also that these figures relate only to the contribution which the Dáil makes under this Vote directly and specifically towards the cost of the health services. But it is not the sole contribution that is made out of Central Funds in easement of the cost of the health services to a particular category of ratepayers. A further contribution is made through the Agricultural Grant and that this operates to further reduce the cost to the farming community of the health services will be apparent from the following figures.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Grant for the year 1958-59 was £5,500,000 all of which was appropriated to meet the general cost of the local authority services, including health services.  If we divide this total in the ratio of the expenditures from local funds on the health services and the other local services, we can say that about one-third of it, or £1.8 million, is assignable to the health services.  The total expenditure in the counties on health services, which, after deducting miscellaneous receipts, was £11.6 million, was therefore met as follows:</P>

    <P>Thus to meet the cost of their health services in 1958-59 the Government gave to the county councils not merely £5.8 million from the Health Vote, but £1.8 million through the Agricultural Grant as well.  In other words in the <Col N="663" /> case of county health services, the Government actually paid 66 per cent. of the whole cost, while the county authorities paid only 34 per cent.</P>
    <P>It might be interesting to consider how the revenues out of which the councils met their share of the cost arose.  They were derived from the following sources:&mdash;</P>

    <P>We may conclude from these figures-I think the conclusion is unassailable &mdash; that owners or occupiers of buildings bore, as such, 50 per cent. of that part of the cost of the health services which could be regarded as specially appropriated to their needs; whereas owners of land, as such, only bore 29 per cent. of their share, the Government bearing the balance, that is to say, 71 per cent. in their case.</P>
    <P>In view of what I have said, I do not think that it could reasonably be held that the State has been ungenerous in the provision which it has made for assisting local authorities to finance the health services in rural areas.  The figures and percentages which I have given do not apply to urban areas. In such areas the rates do, in fact, meet half the cost of the health services.</P>
    <P>Last February, the Dublin City Council requested me to receive a deputation for the purpose of discussing with them ways and means of devising &mdash; I quote their resolution &mdash;&ldquo;a more equitable apportionment of the cost of providing our health and social services&rdquo;.  I shall, of course, be quite willing to discuss this matter with the deputation from the Corporation.  But even if I and the Minister for Finance could be persuaded that the Corporation had a good case, the suggestion that the State should bear a greater proportion of the burden of the cost of the health services raises an issue of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>It may readily be admitted that so <Col N="664" /> long as the local finances bear their present proportion of the cost of the health services, it is reasonable that the local authorities should operate the services with only general direction and supervision from the centre.  If the State were to take over the whole, or a substantially greater part, of the burden of the cost, we should have to look anew at the administration of the services and possibly consider whether or not the authority which is the main source of the piper's pay should have more say in the tune being played.  To put it more plainly, if the Exchequer's proportionate share of the cost of the health services were to be increased by more than a casual or insignificant amount, then the Minister for Health, because of his responsibility to the general taxpayer, would be bound to take a more active part in the administration of the health services, even perhaps to the extent of taking them over, or entrusting their operation to bodies nominated by him.  Personally I would view such a development with the utmost disfavour, and I think so would most people.  Nevertheless, if taxation without representations is to be deprecated, so also is local control without local taxation.  In short, those who wish to maintain democratic control in the local administration of the health services must be prepared as ratepayers to pay for it.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that no such proposals for a change in the local administration of the health services are being considered by the Government but those who are pressing for a change in the financial basis of the health services should realise that, if their pressure were to be successful, this issue would be bound to arise. The resolution submitted by the Dublin Corporation also referred to the statutory demands which must be met by it as a rating authority.  The demands referred to were made hitherto on the Corporation by joint bodies, like the Dublin Board of Assistance and the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Board.  They were based on estimates prepared by these joint bodies and Dublin Corporation as the rating authority had no option but to provide for them in striking their rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> The fact that the statutory demands of joint bodies on rating authorities have become very substantial in recent years has caused some concern to the Minister for Local Government and myself, because the rating authorities as such have had no say as to what should be included in the estimates of the bodies making these demands.</P>
    <P>We have, however, taken action by the Health Authorities Act, 1960, to improve the position in respect of certain rating authorities, among them the Dublin Corporation.  Under the Act a draft of the estimate which any of the new Health Authorities may propose to make must be sent before final adoption to each of the rating authorities represented thereon.  Thus the rating authorities concerned will be in a position to make such representations as they may wish about the size of the proposed demand.  The Health Authority in turn will be made up of members of the rating authorities, so that whatever comments any of the latter may make on the estimate should considerably influence its final form.</P>
    <P>Except for Subhead I, the subheads of the Estimate are comparatively small and for the most part the sums included do not differ significantly from last year.  The increase in what is provided for under Subhead A for the salaries and wages of the staff of my Department is due mainly to the recent cost-of-living award.</P>
    <P>Despite all the efforts over the years of my Department and of the local authorities, acting under its instigation, to make the public better informed as to their rights under the Acts, I am forced to the conclusion that ignorance as to the scope and nature of and entitlement to the services available under them is widespread among the public at large.  This want of information would appear, moreover, to be most marked in respect of institutional services.  Frequently where the General Medical Service is concerned, the hardship occasioned to an eligible individual who fails through ignorance to avail himself of it may not be much. On the other hand, I know, and I am sure every Deputy has similar knowledge, that where lengthy and costly treatment in a hospital is concerned, <Col N="666" /> too many people, who are in fact eligible for such treatment either free or at reduced charges are, through ignorance of their rights, incurring bills which they find it difficult if not impossible to meet.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, in the coming year to make available to every household in the country a booklet outlining in simple language what the health services are, and how, and by whom they may be availed of.  By this means and through other advertising media, I hope to make the public at large fully aware of the extent and character of the health services available to them.  I have decided for this purpose, to ask the House to approve an increase of £10,000 in Subhead M over and above the normal requirements for publicising health and the health services.</P>
    <P>There is only one other subhead in the Estimate to which I need refer before moving to mention some of the general matters not specifically related to the Estimate itself.  This is the new Subhead O which provides £3,000 for technical assistance in respect of which a sum was laid aside in the American Grant Counterpart Fund for obtaining advice and assistance on the establishment of a rehabilitation centre.</P>
    <P>As I indicated on this occasion last year, I then had the interim report of the National Organisation for Rehabilitation under consideration.  In that report it was recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that a rehabilitation centre should be set up wherein a programme of physical training and graduated work could be provided for persons who would need such treatment to prepare them to resume their employment or to fit them for training for a new occupation.</P>
    <P>Since then, the authorities of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, in conjunction with the National Organisation for Rehabilitation, have put forward a plan for the establishment at that institution of a rehabilitation centre.  I have indicated my agreement in principle to this plan and the arrangements for the centre are at present under discussion between the authorities of the Hospital, the <Col N="667" /> National Organisation for Rehabilitation and my Department.  The sum of £3,000 provided for in Subhead O will be available for transfer to the Organisation to obtain expert advice in connection with the establishment and development of the centre.  Deputies will note that the expenditure from this new subhead will be balanced by an appropriation-in-aid from the Grant Counterpart Fund.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be in a position to report that the steps which I took to restore the solvency of the Hospital Trust Fund, strongly reinforced as those steps have been by the ever-increasing success of the Hospitals Sweepstakes, are bearing fruit.  A position has been reached when the partial resumption of the Hospitals Building Programme which I initiated last year may be enlarged to enable the planning of certain further urgent works to be begun.</P>
    <P>The present position in relation to the Fund is briefly as follows.  Shortly before the end of the 1959-60 financial year the major portion of the proceeds of the recent Grand National Sweepstakes, amounting to £1.1 million, was paid into the Fund but of course must be regarded as income appropriate to the present financial year.  Therefore, if we ignore that payment, the balance in the Fund on the 31st March last would have amounted to £2.4 million. Against that balance, however, it should be noted that there are inescapable commitments on capital schemes, already in progress or completed but not fully paid for, amounting to £1.1 million, as well as commitments in respect of hospital deficits, which, as I mentioned earlier, may amount to about £1.25 million.</P>
    <P>It may be thought that the improved financial situation offers an opportunity to embark on a large scale resumption of hospital building activities. This is not my view, at least yet, for with the world as it is, we have no guarantee that the present satisfactory trend of the Sweepstake revenue will continue uninterrupted.  Accordingly I have decided to set portion of the fund aside as a reserve to ensure that <Col N="668" /> any commitments that are undertaken can be honoured.  In this connection it may surprise many to know that the capital amounts that would be required to finance the completion of the Hospital Building Programme drawn up a decade ago still stand at about £8 million.  In addition, to provide badly-needed accommodation for mental defectives and to overcome overcrowding and otherwise improve and modernise mental hospitals would require many additional millions.</P>
    <P>Other demands on the Fund, involving considerable expenditure, continue to be made; so that the total requirements far exceed the funds that are likely to accrue for several years to come.  It should be clear, I submit, from all this, that our hospital needs cannot be effectively met by precipitate or ill-considered spending; such as is often urged upon me by those who believe that their demands should have priority over the needs of all others.</P>
    <P>During the year I approved of the resumption of planning on the new hospital to replace the Coombe Hospital.  The Coombe Hospital which has rendered such signal service to the poor of Dublin was founded about 1814.  It was established on its present site in 1826 and the main portion of it was built in 1867.  The provision of a modern maternity hospital to replace the existing institution was recommended in the First Report of the Hospitals Commission for 1933/34, that is to say almost thirty years ago. The proposal was accepted in principle by the then Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Unfortunately, a major difficulty arose concerning the selection of a suitable site and was not finally resolved until 1949 when a site at Donore Avenue was acquired.  Planning of the new hospital was then begun, but once again in the financial crisis of 1956 the project had to be shelved.  The fact, however, that our maternal mortality rate is much higher than in comparable societies, as is also the infant mortality rate, indicates how urgent is the need to make good the existing deficiencies in maternity accommodation.  Accordingly, I decided that if a suitable arrangement <Col N="669" /> could be arrived at in regard to planning and ultimate cost, the new hospital should be given the highest priority.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the authorities of the Coombe Hospital have been most co-operative and willing to meet my requirement in the matter of avoiding over-elaboration and lavishness.  I am glad to pay this tribute to them. The approach in the case of other new building projects will be on the same lines and difficulties will be avoided if other hospital authorities display willingness to co-operate in the same manner.</P>
    <P>For the reasons which moved me in the case of the projected new Coombe Hospital, I have also decided that the project for a new Erinville Maternity Hospital at Cork, the acquisition of a site for which was originally approved of by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in 1937, should be allowed to proceed, subject, of course, to my requirements as to cost and accommodation being met.</P>
    <P>On the local authority side, I have approved of the conversion of the former Tuberculosis Hospital at Lisdarn, County Cavan, to serve as a medical and maternity hospital and the extension of maternity accommodation at the County Hospital, Castlebar.</P>
    <P>Among the other major voluntary hospital schemes to which approval has been given over the last year or so were the provision of a new Nurses' Home at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe; the provision of further accommodation for mental defectives at St. Mary's, Devlin, and at Cregg House, Sligo; the complete renewal of the electrical installations at Jervis Street Hospital; the provision of accommodation for nursing and medical staff and a new out-patients' department at the Adelaide Hospital; and the provision of a new Theatre at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh.</P>
    <P>Some alterations and improvements in local authority hospitals have also been authorised.  These include the provision of accommodation for student nurses at St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork; the provision of additional beds at Sligo County <Col N="670" /> Hospital to enable it to serve as a sub-regional centre for paediatric and ear, nose and throat work and the provision of residential accommodation for medical staff at Galway Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>I have not come to any firm decision yet as to when it will be possible to allow the other major projects in the building programme to be undertaken.  Much will depend, as I have already stressed, on the continued success of the Sweepstakes and of the efforts to establish a sufficient reserve in the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    <P>No significant change can be made in the local authority dental services this year.  As Deputies are aware, dental treatment is provided, free of charge, by local health authorities for pupils of national schools in respect of defects discovered at school health examinations and for children under six years in respect of defects at child welfare clinics.  Persons in the lower income group are also eligible for free dental services.</P>
    <P>As only a limited amount of funds and dental personnel are available to enable local authorities to discharge their obligations to provide dental services for these groups it has been accepted policy for some years past to recommend to local authorities that they should concentrate their available resources mainly on providing dental treatment for children.  This unfortunately means that only a limited dental service is available to adults in the lower income group; in particular the supply of dentures is restricted in many areas to special categories of persons such as tuberculosis patients, necessitous expectant and nursing mothers, and persons in receipt of home assistance.  The cost of providing an adequate dental service even for persons in the lower income group is simply not within our means at present. Moreover, there are not sufficient dental surgeons available to enable the present service to be noticeably improved.  In fact, in some areas there are vacancies for dental surgeons which the local authorities concerned find difficulty in filling.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be aware that an important improvement for young <Col N="671" /> workers was made recently in the treatment benefits scheme administered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Formerly three years' insurance was necessary for all workers before they could avail of dental benefit under the social welfare scheme.  Now, insured persons under 21 years of age need only six months' insurance to entitle them to this service.  This improvement will enable young insured workers to look after their teeth at a very important stage in their lives.</P>
    <P>When moving the Second Stage of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Bill, on the 5th April I mentioned that the extent of dental decay in this country is so great that it is virtually impossible to cope with it by treatment methods alone.  There is every reason to believe that by the operation of the fluoridation scheme provided for in that Bill, there will in future be a very significant improvement in dental health, sufficient to enable us to cope with the problem which will remain.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of dental services generally I might inform the House that following discussions which the Department of Education and my Department had with all the interested parties a new Dental Hospital in Dublin is being planned at present. Subject to certain safeguards I have promised a substantial grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund towards the cost.</P>
    <P>As many Deputies know, the condition of some of our mental hospitals is deplorable.  I was very glad, therefore, that while having due regard to other claims upon it, the improved position of the Hospitals Trust Fund enabled me to permit a limited list of urgently required mental hospital improvements to proceed at an estimated cost of approximately £1 million. Among the works approved in this programme, and now being planned, are new admission units at Ardee, Castlebar and Clonmel Mental Hospitals. I also approved the building, planned some years ago, of an admission unit at Cork Mental Hospital and this is now in course of construction. I am well aware that a much more <Col N="672" /> extensive programme could be justified but the numerous other calls on the resources available left me no option but to restrict the projected works, so as to keep their cost within £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that, in common with other schemes involving major expenditure, the reconstruction and improvement of county homes in accordance with the recommendations of the White Paper of 1951 had to be deferred in 1956.  Having regard to the general improvement in the position of the Exchequer, I have, as I indicated last year, given instructions in my Department to get the schemes moving again.  While continuous pressure is being maintained on local authorities to bring these schemes to fruition, the planning and execution of major projects for these institutions must inevitably take time.  In the meantime, however, I have directed the Department to encourage local authorities to carry out minor improvements, where necessary and practicable, in advance of the main works.</P>
    <P>Extending over a year, discussions were held in my Department on proposals for the federation and ultimate integration of seven Dublin voluntary hospitals.  The hospitals concerned are the Adelaide, Sir Patrick Dun's, the Meath, Mercers, the National Children's Hospital, the Royal City of Dublin and Dr. Steeven's.  Agreement was reached a while ago on the general terms of a Bill to provide for such federation and the Government has authorised me to have it drafted.  I hope that the Dáil will have the measure before it soon after the Summer recess.  Therefore, I do not propose at this stage to go into the details of the proposed association between the hospitals. But I should say that the move towards closer liaison is welcome to me and has my full support.</P>
    <P>I feel that it will put the combined hospitals in a position to continue more effectively the admirable service which they have given to the Dublin public, some of them for over two centuries.  Naturally in negotiating the agreement to federate many cherished views had necessarily to be modified or even sacrificed.  I should like, therefore, to express to all concerned my appreciation of the manner in <Col N="673" /> which those governing the individual hospitals have submerged their particular interests in order to advance the common good.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is not possible for me in present circumstances to contemplate any considerable capital expenditure on the provision of new buildings for the federating group.  I am confident, however, that the benefits of large scale organisation which may be expected to accrue from the federation will enable the various specialities, now such a feature of modern medicine, to be fully developed, and thus ultimately ensure that a more comprehensive service will be provided for the public at no greater cost than at present.</P>
    <P>Amalgamation in another sense was recently the concern of this House in the discussion of the Health Authorities Bill.  Deputies will remember that one of the major objects of this Bill was to establish special new Health Authorities in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  The 1st July is a particularly appropriate day for this purpose.  It will coincide with the conclusion of the local elections and the new Health Authorities will thus take over when the term of office of the present county and city councils ends.</P>
    <P>All the necessary steps for the setting up of new authorities have been taken by my Department and will follow in due course at local levels, and I foresee no difficulties in effecting a smooth transfer of functions to the authorities from the present miscellany of local bodies in these four areas. As I said in the debate on the Health Authorities Bill, I have every expectation that new authorities will be in a much better position to provide a more convenient and more efficient service for the public.  I am sure I am speaking on behalf of the whole House, including those who may have had reservations on the Bill, when I wish the newly established authorities success in their work.</P>
    <P>The other main proposal of the Health Authorities Act, which is the abolition of the legal distinction between the local administration of the <Col N="674" /> mental health services and that of the other health services will also come into effect on the 1st July.  As I indicated in speaking on the Bill, however, this is only a first step in a design to bring the law of the mental health services more up-to-date.</P>
    <P>A further step in this direction will be taken with the enactment of another Bill which I hope to bring before the House soon.  This will be a fairly short Bill to amend in certain respects the provisions in the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, relating to the admission and care of mental patients.  The Act of 1945 is, however, a large and comprehensive measure which introduced what were, at the time, far-reaching and fundamental changes in the law relating to mental health.</P>
    <P>There have been further great changes since then, however, in the treatment of mental illness and in the attitude towards mental disease and, after the interim measure which I will introduce soon, it will be necessary to consider a more fundamental measure to replace or considerably amend the Mental Treatment Act of 1945.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, I recently caused to be published a White Paper dealing with the distressing problem of mental deficiency in this country. The provision of a comprehensive service for mentally handicapped persons is one of the major health problems remaining to be solved.</P>
    <P>The problem is not, I may say, wholly one of accommodation. In all over 2,100 new beds for mentally handicapped persons have been made available since 1932 at an expenditure of £1.6 millions from the Hospitals Trust Fund; 1,300 of them, provided in the period since 1947, being in special institutions catering for mentally handicapped persons.  To these we may add an additional 600 beds which are in immediate prospect. Nevertheless, institutional accommodation is still far short of requirements, for it has been estimated that there may be as many as 24,000 mentally handicapped persons in this country of whom 7,000 would require institutional care.</P>
    <P>It must not be assumed, however, from all this that the question of institutional <Col N="675" /> accommodation resolves itself to the relatively uncomplicated one of providing upwards of 4,000 additional beds for the afflicted, that is, additional to those we have at present and the 600 shortly to be available.  Unfortunately, there is much more involved. In the first place there is a marked shortage of personnel with the necessary experience, training and vocation for the staffing of these special institutions.  Traditionally, the institutional services in this country for mentally handicapped persons have been administered by religious communities who are themselves finding it difficult at the present time to extend their field of activity.</P>
    <P>To relieve that situation, An Bord Altranais have recently made provision for the training and registration of nurses for the mentally handicapped but that arrangement has not been sufficiently long in operation to have relieved the staffing problem to any great extent.  The type of accommodation required also falls to be considered &mdash; whether it should be for children or for adults, whether it should be residential or day accommodation, whether it should be fully equipped to provide intensive training or of the simple hostel type; these are the questions to which in the light of our present knowledge of the problem there is no ready answer.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive service for the mentally handicapped must include the organisation of services for the ascertainment and assessment of the degree of mental handicap; the provision of appropriate institutional accommodation for those requiring it; the establishment of day clinics for the training of persons whom it would be possible to maintain at home; and the organisation of an after-care and placement service which would enable persons following their training in institutions to occupy their particular place in the community.  The provision of such a service would require trained staffs of various types and overshadowing all there is the question of cost.  With health expenditure running at the yearly rate of over £17 millions it is, in my view, essential that the service to be provided, as well as <Col N="676" /> being effective, should be the most economical possible and that there should be no wastage of public funds on haphazard or ill-conceived developments.</P>
    <P>The main problems associated with the provision of a comprehensive service for the mentally handicapped are set out in the White Paper to which I have referred.  I propose, as outlined in the White Paper, to set up a Commission of Enquiry to examine the matter fully and to make recommendations as to how we should proceed. Unfortunately I have not yet been able to come to a final conclusion in that regard.  In the meantime, developments in this field already in train will go ahead and every effort will be made to supply obvious needs.</P>
    <P>In the service for the treatment and alleviation of mental disease-which is, of course, quite distinct from mental deficiency &mdash; we also have our problems. This service caters for almost 20,000 patients in 21 district mental hospitals and auxiliary institutions.  The mental treatment service suffers mainly from the handicap of insufficient and outdated accommodation, not entirely suited to modern concepts of mental treatment.</P>
    <P>Serious overcrowding is undoubtedly one of our greatest single problems and while this exists it will be difficult to bring about a marked improvement in the general standards of the hospitals. However, it is perhaps significant that the year ended 31st December, 1959 saw a fall of 456 in the number of patients in our mental hospitals notwithstanding that total receptions rose from 8,177 for 1958 to 8,559 for 1959.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the programme of extensions and improvements to mental hospitals which has been initiated.  It is indeed a very modest one.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I am satisfied that the improvement of facilities in the accommodation which we have and the establishment of adequate outpatient clinics and psychiatric consultant services are at least as important as the provision of new accommodation. Perhaps more important still may be a service which will give much more <Col N="677" /> attention to the preventive and after-care aspect of mental health.  This I hope will come in time.  Pending the organisation and development of such a service, district medical officers and other medical practitioners can help to lessen our difficulties by spreading knowledge throughout the community as to the nature of mental health and the measures necessary to preserve it.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like to say something about the future.  There is no reason to expect that the present trends in our vital statistics, which are part of a pattern common to most civilised nations, will not continue.  It is reasonable, therefore, to believe that deaths from tuberculosis and other infectious diseases will continue to decline, so as to become almost negligible in their demands on the health services.  On the other hand, heart disease and cancerous conditions are showing a marked tendency to increase and are likely to become even more important among the diseases with which the health services will have to deal.</P>
    <P>As well as ensuring that the equipment and skills are there to treat and ameliorate these conditions, we shall have to play our part in the extensive research on their causes which is being pursued in many countries to-day.  In addition to acute illnesses such as these, we shall have to care increasingly for chronic illness in the aged and greater and greater numbers of old people who, while not actually ill, are unable to fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>When it is completed the programme to improve county homes to which I have referred should leave us with proper facilities for the institutional care of these age groups.  On the other hand, I think that it is better that old people should be cared for at home, so I am hoping that the development of the contributory old age pensions scheme, of which all sides of the House approved in principle recently will encourage this.  I look forward also to great progress in the treatment of mental illness, as more is known of its nature and the factors which give rise to it, as the knowledge grows among the public that in very many cases it is a condition which will yield even to existing drugs and treatments, <Col N="678" /> and as through research the drugs and treatments themselves become more effective.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when a much larger proportion of the mentally ill will not have to resort to institutions for treatment, but may live with their families and in the community while they are being treated and cured. But this day is not yet at hand and in the meantime much remains to be done to improve the accommodation and facilities for treating mental diseases and for caring for mental defectives. As I have already mentioned, a start has been made on this work and, with more surplus tuberculosis accommodation becoming available in future years, we can expect that it will proceed satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Improvements in accommodation and the provision of the equipment and skilled staff necessary for modern treatment of illness and disease will not completely serve their purpose unless there is an efficient organisation of the health services under which those entitled to them can obtain them when they are needed.  The re-defining and extension of the classes eligible for the services which was made under the Health Act of 1953 have only been in full effect for a little over four years. That period is too short to assess whether or not the change will provide a completely satisfactory basis for the development of health services in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I would not be so imprudent as to suggest that the future may not see further changes and developments in the scope of the services, but for the present, the Government do not contemplate any substantial change.  Having regard, moreover, to the raising in 1958 of the income level for eligibility for hospital services and the very good value available at comparatively moderate rates from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board for those outside the classes eligible under the Health Acts, I think that in present circumstances what is provided under the Acts is reasonable.</P>
    <P>As things are our total expenditure of almost £19 million from public funds on health is so very considerable having <Col N="679" /> regard to our resources that we cannot contemplate spending much more in the immediate future.  Our endeavours over the next few years must therefore be in the direction of ensuring that full value is obtained for what we are spending and I propose that the activities of my Department and of the local health authorities should be directed towards that end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is an old and esteemed member of this House and he is an old stager in the political game.  I have little doubt that it is not pure coincidence that the debate on this Estimate takes place this evening, and not last week, and that it takes place after the events in, Carlow-Kilkenny which gave us Deputy Teehan, and after the people voted for the different local bodies throughout the country.  I have little doubt that the House feels that a discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Health would involve much public interest and much public speculation.</P>
      <P>In the course of what I have to say on this Estimate, I am happy to think that because of the Minister's decision to introduce it to-night, my contribution will be more objective, and perhaps more constructive, than events might otherwise have permitted it to be. Before discussing the Minister's speech, which is a report by him of the working of his Department over the past 12 months, I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the officer of the Minister's Department who this time last year, and for many years prior to that, sat on the Minister's right to advise him.  I refer to the former Secretary of the Department of Health, Mr. Patrick Kennedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Kennedy was, I think, the first Secretary of that Department.  He retired from that office since this Estimate was discussed last year.  I think it is true to say that he crowned a long and distinguished career in the Irish Civil Service by helping the new Department of State to function.  He was the official head of the new <Col N="680" /> Department which was set up following the 1947 Act, and he was the official head from then until 1959, and as such, he had to face many crises.  It seems to have been the unhappy experience of one of the newest Departments of State to have met many contretemps and crises in a decade.  I imagine that many of the things Mr. Kennedy had to face as Secretary of the Department of Health might have quenched the spirit and damped the ardour of a lesser man.  Nevertheless, in the face of many of these happenings, he ensured that the Department for which he had responsibility continued to grow in stature and prestige.</P>
    <P>I am happy that I personally had the benefit of his advice, and, at times, his sympathy, as Minister.  I always found the one helpful and the other, at times, soothing.  I should like to wish Mr. Kennedy in retirement many long years, and to extend greetings to his successor. I hope he will continue to see the Department function and grow as it did under the aegis of his predecessor.</P>
    <P>In his speech this evening, the Minister referred to many of the activities of his Department over the past 12 months, and to many of the problems which concern the health authorities and persons interested in health matters generally.  I note that he has left for discussion, presumably wisely, the many criticisms that continue to be made of the administration of our health services.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Estimate is the occasion on which questions of administration and matters of that kind can be ventilated.  I should like to say that the health services themselves, as they are provided under our Health Acts, continue to be a most prolific source of criticism of various kinds, once the subject of health arises for discussion.  In my time, I tried to understand the critics and to meet their point of view, and I have little doubt that the Minister is continuing to do so also.</P>
    <P>The fact is, and remains, that the Health Act, as our health services are commonly known, has not been popular and has not won any popularity <Col N="681" /> in the past 12 months.  The services provided under the Health Act continue to be regarded as something less than people expected.  In his concluding remarks this evening, the Minister said that the period from the coming into operation of the services under the Health Act was far too short to assess whether or not a change in the nature of the services is likely to come.  He went on to say he would not be so imprudent as to suggest that the future may not see further changes and developments in the scope of services but for the present the Government do not contemplate any substantial change.  That is putting things a little bit too far.  I suggest the time has come, and the stage has now been reached, when there should be a full inquiry into the best manner of providing the type of health services which are suitable to our people.</P>
    <P>We have put behind us the controversies that existed prior to the enactment of the Health Act, 1953. We have seen the services under that Act almost fully in operation since 1956.  Now, some four years later and some seven years after the Act itself was enacted, we are still faced with the fact that most people resent the manner in which our present services are rendered.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a continuance of an orderly, proper development in health services, the situation calls for some dramatic step by the Minister to establish a body to advise him and the Government on defects in the present services, defects in their administration, defects in the criticism that is levelled and, further and more important, to advise on how best we should organise, in accordance with our tradition, our outlook and our heritage, the health services for our people.</P>
    <P>I am not biassed or a partisan in this matter.  I do not think it would be right for the Minister or anyone else to shrug off the continuance of criticism of the present health services as being something without foundation.  The fact is that they leave much to be desired.  The Health Act of 1953 is a very makeshift measure.  It was an act of expediency, rather rushed into by the Government of the day, not <Col N="682" /> thought-out or planned properly.  It discloses now the defects of the situation which led to its creation.</P>
    <P>Take the most important services in so far as the general public is concerned. The service which meets them closest and which I would regard as the general medical service under the Health Act is the dispensary system. That applies to close on 900,000 people, old and young, boys and girls &mdash; close on 30 per cent. of our people. That general medical service is the service which this State regards as the means whereby the abject poor are to get urgent, necessary, medical relief when they are sick, when they are aged, when a woman is having a baby, if they are in need of hospitalisation, whatever it may be</P>
    <P>This is the fundamental service provided for the poor in this country. This general medical service now has statutory authority under the Health Act of 1953.  That service was there for over one hundred years before the Health Act was passed by this House. The system of providing medical services for the poor was introduced and came into effect under one of the Relief Acts, commonly called, I think the Medical Charities Act, 1851.</P>
    <P>Under the Medical Charities Act, 1851, the British Government decided, in relation to the poor of Ireland, that they would provide medical relief through medical officers appointed by the different boards at the time and that these medical officers would be paid by the Crown.  They would look after not those who had difficulty in paying but the very poor, the distressed, the paupers, those who were unable by their own industry or other lawful means to provide for themselves. That was the level at which the State, leaving aside the political changes, over one hundred years ago regarded its duty as beginning.</P>
    <P>The State recognised then no duty to anyone except to the pauper, to the unfortunate impoverished person who had not a means of livelihood or of providing for himself.  For that person, under the Medical Charities Act, as an act of charity the State provided a doctor if he were sick and in danger of dying.  The dispensary system bom in 1851 functioned in Ireland throughout <Col N="683" /> the last century and into the present century.  It was carried over when this State was formed.  It was not changed in the slightest.  It was not altered in any part.</P>
    <P>When the Health Act of 1953 came before this House it is notable that into it went the dispensary system unchanged, without alteration.  Today, medical services are being provided for the same type and class of person under the same type and class of administration as was envisaged over one hundred years ago.</P>
    <P>The dispensary system has long outlived its usefulness.  It is absurd that in 1960 we should operate general medical services for our poor in the same way as was thought proper over one hundred years ago.  When I was Minister for Health I announced it to be my policy to alter the dispensary system in such a way that for every poor person there would be provided, where possible, a free choice of doctor; that in the cities and towns and centres of population the State should not grudgingly provide for the poor the services they need but should do it generously and properly and provide for every poor person who was sick and in need of medical treatment the right to which his means entitle him &mdash; to select the doctor of his choice. That was my view as Minister and had I the opportunity it would certainly be now in operation.</P>
    <P>I mention the question of the dispensary system but this is not the first time I have mentioned it.  I think I mentioned it in Opposition before and each time this Estimate has come up for discussion since.  It is difficult to understand the complacent attitude that seems to be adopted in regard to the manner and form of providing these services for the people &mdash; that because it has been there for many years, 100 years or so, it is to be continued. The dispensary system is bad and, in my view, it costs the State a considerable sum of money.  I have little doubt that any person taking a short-term view of costings, or perhaps getting a little too concerned with figures, might well say that one good reason for retaining the present dispensary <Col N="684" /> system is that it does not cost too much.  I concede that point straight away.  On figures it is a very cheap form of medicine and a very cheap type of health service.  I have not studied recent, figures but I have figures for 12 months ago.  Covered are 850,000 people at a total cost of £879,000.  I am quoting figures for 1957-58; the cost may be slightly more now that salaries have gone up.  For 1957-58 the cost was £879,000, in other words, £1 per head per year. That is what we are spending on medical services for the poor.  I concede that it is a cheap service.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see how that £1 is spent.  Of the £879,000, £570,000 was spent on salaries for the doctors; £125,000 was spent on other salaries, presumably salaries associated with the investigation of the claims of those seeking to get medical cards and get on the medical register and perhaps on associated salaries in relation to the local authority personnel; £184,000 only was spent on medicines.</P>
    <P>I want to translate that into £1 per head because that is roughly what it works out at.  Of the £1 we spend under this system of providing a medical service for a poor person, 16/- actually goes on salaries and 4/- per head goes on medicine to alleviate the condition of the poor person and make him better.  I should like the House to consider what that means.  It means that in relation to the provision of medicines, drugs and things of that kind for the poor of the country under the general medical service we are spending almost nothing.  It is a cheap service; it is easily controlled, but what is the result?  If you are going to spend only a token amount on a domiciliary service for a sick, poor person in his home what will happen? Of course that sick person moves to hospital, and the result of this type of cheeseparing has been, as the Minister complained, that our hospitals are full of poor, sick people, many of them people who could be treated and attended in their homes by a doctor. But the doctor cannot do it.</P>
    <P>The hard working dispensary doctor in, Crumlin or in any areas near the <Col N="685" /> city with an enormous number of people on his register has neither the time nor the means of continually visiting an old person who is entitled to avail of his assistance and who, because of his age, requires constant visits.  What the doctor does is to make the necessary arrangements to have the old person brought into St. Kevin's Hospital.  It is the same with any other sick, poor person whom a dispensary doctor may have to attend; if it involves continuous visits, the simplest and easiest thing is to get the person into hospital.</P>
    <P>We spend per head on the poor of the country in the provision of medicines something around 4/- per head per year and apparently we take pride in the fact that we have avoided the cascade of medicines that was the problem in England under the British scheme some years ago.  We may have avoided the cascade of medicines but we have increased substantially the cost of running our hospitals, particularly local authority hospitals.  That system requires investigation; it requires full inquiry.  It is a source of criticism which has always been there and will continue to be there until such time &mdash; I think this matter should be removed from the realm of Party politics &mdash; as a body of trained and specialised persons devise a method or advise on a method of providing for our people the kind of domiciliary medical service which will function properly.</P>
    <P>The present system has operated under a British Act since 1851; that is its only title to be in the Health Act of 1953.  There is no other reason. There is nothing Irish, nothing traditional about it.  It was a measure of British public duty disclosed in one of their Acts in the last century and it is for that reason that it was continued.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister, when it was possible to implement the maternity service for poor people, in 1954, when it was possible to get the agreement of the medical profession in providing for the wife of a person entitled to the general medical services a maternity service under the Health Act 1953, I felt that this was the beginning of the end of the dispensary system.  Under <Col N="686" /> the maternity service provided in the Health Act the wife of a poor person on the medical register is entitled in relation to her motherhood to a free choice of doctor &mdash; a very good provision and a very notable progressive measure in the Act.  It was not easy to secure the necessary agreement in getting it implemented but it was done and under the arrangements made any medical practitioner can sign an agreement with any of the local authorities, in effect, holding himself out as being a person willing to take part in the scheme.  Indeed, most of the doctors in general practice have signed such agreements and are participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the maternity provisions in the Health Act, if the wife of the holder of a medical card or the holder of a medical card herself is about to have a baby she can say: &ldquo;I will not go to the dispensary doctor.  I do not like him.  He is not a sympathetic kind of doctor.  I will select his rival, the other doctor or one of the other doctors practising in the district.&rdquo;  She has the right to do so and possibly many such persons do so.</P>
    <P>There is the absurd situation now that if such a person goes to a doctor, who is not a dispensary doctor, in relation to the child she is about to have, he will attend her of course and look after her.  Possibly, the dispensary doctor may be a little bit annoyed that she had not gone to him but there is nothing he can do about it.  If this woman, having gone for an examination by the doctor she selects, leaves his surgery and goes out on the street, trips, falls and twists her ankle, she cannot go back to the doctor whom she has just left.  She must now go to the dispensary doctor.  She cannot go anywhere else.  She then has no choice of doctor because her swollen ankle is not due to her motherhood.  She then is entirely confined to the dispensary doctor under the present mode of administering the general medical services.</P>
    <P>That is, in my view, a <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i>  In my opinion, once it has been possible to achieve for women in the lower income group, as it is called &mdash;although that phrase is not in the Health Act &mdash; a choice of doctor in <Col N="687" /> relation to maternity it is illogical not to provide a full choice of doctor for general medical services.  I think it can be done and it should be done.  It does not require anything other than a change in administration and in administrative policy.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that for large centres of population &mdash; this city, Cork and some of our large towns&mdash; the doctors in general practice should be invited to do generally for the poor what they have already agreed to do for women in respect of motherhood.  I can see that in sparsely populated areas where there is probably a living only for one doctor as it is, the present system would probably have to be continued.  There are parts of the country where, probably, it will always be necessary to pay a doctor to live there.  In parts of the west, parts of the north-west and probably also parts of the south-west such a system will have to continue but that is a regrettable necessity.  Perhaps if some Government implements its election policies and emigration ceases even that necessity will no longer exist.  But, apart from areas such as I have mentioned, it should be possible, as an experiment, at least in the city or some other centre of population, to provide these services through doctors in general practice.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I had intended to do it in the city.  I have already mentioned it in the House.  I had intended to do it in part of the city where there were temporary holders of dispensary posts. Unfortunately, that is not possible now because these posts have been filled but I have little doubt that it could be done and if it were done the quality of the service being provided for those whom we recognise as being distressed and needy people would be very much better.  That is not intended as a criticism of present holders of dispensary posts.  The present dispensary doctors, I have little doubt, do their best under a system which cannot produce the best in them.  Most dispensary doctors are overworked.  I shall not say that they are underpaid because I do not know enough about their pay situation.  They are certainly <Col N="688" /> overworked and they operate under a system which does not permit them to give of their best to their patients.</P>
    <P>If all that were removed and if a poor person could go to the doctor of his or her choice and if the engagement of that doctor meant for him, as it should, the possibility of an increase in his practice, I have little doubt that the quality of the services would be very much improved.</P>
    <P>Involved in such a change would be a change in the provision of medicines and again this should be faced.  In relation to the quality of the service, I see no reason why the ordinary chemist should not fill the doctor's prescription for such poor people.  They do it already for the poor person who is having a baby.  A poor person who is having a baby can get whatever things are required for such a condition on the doctor's prescription from the chemist.  It was carefully screened and examined in the Department some years ago and what at first appeared to be impossible was found to be possible because a careful pricing was made out and the understanding and cooperation of the chemists were obtained.  The same thing could be done in relation to ordinary medical services and it would be a good thing.</P>
    <P>Such a change as I envisage would cost more than the present system which works out at £1 a head per year, but I do not think it would cost such a great deal more.  We are spending on medicines here 4/- per head per poor person.  In England they spend something around 28/- per head; in Northern Ireland, they are spending something around 22/- per head.  I should imagine that if a change took place here and we modified the dispensary system, our expenditure on drugs and medicines would go up.  I cannot imagine its going up any further than it has gone in the north and even if it did, I have little doubt it is expenditure which would be wise because it is bound to have an effect on the hospital intake. The more people who are properly treated in their homes by the doctor of their choice who will find time to look after them, the better it will be for them particularly and also for the general health services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> There are people in this city at the moment who, when old age forces them to complain of sickness and they go to their bed, cannot be looked after at home.  The service is just not there. The doctor will be called in.  He will examine the patient and he will realise straight away if he is to try to treat that person at home, it will involve probably two, three or four visits a day.  The demands of other patients, and the number he has to look after do not permit that.  The result is that that poor old person, possibly in his or her last illness, is taken away from home and into this strange and unfamiliar situation of being in hospital. We call that the provision of a proper service for the poor.  There is nothing more callous, nothing more brutal than such an outlook.  If we concede, as we must, that a section of our population are unable to fend for themselves, we must not be grudging in the way we provide for them.  We should do it generously and possibly lavishly in order to put them at least in the same position as those better off.</P>
    <P>When I suggest that there are grounds for criticisms of our present services and that the Minister or anybody else should not be surprised at the continuance of criticism, I have in mind the fact that our general medical services are obviously inadequate. When the administrative scheme for our present services was proposed in 1953, it was a tragedy that somebody did not take the dispensary system and have a fresh look at it before putting it in as a foundation stone for the new services envisaged in the Health Act. That was a pity, but merely because it was in the Health Act of 1953, it would be a mistake if we said, as the Minister appears to say in the conclusion of his remarks: &ldquo;It is there only since 1953 and that is too short a time to enable us to examine it.&rdquo;  It was there for a hundred years before 1953 and it has been there far too long. The whole system should now be examined and new thinking done upon it.</P>
    <P>That is perhaps one of the reasons for the continuance of criticisms in relation to health services and that is not something that can be overcome, <Col N="690" /> unless there is a change in the method of administering these services.  But even under the existing dispensary system, there is a continuance of complaints about medical cards and so on, how they are got, how some people have them and other people have not got them, and matters of that kind. That is probably due to the fact that there is no set standard envisaged under our present services and each health authority has the right, a right which it exercises, of deciding who is and who is not an entitled person.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to the view that the clamour for medical cards is due to two causes.  First of all, it is due to the general and rather widespread misunderstanding &mdash; a misunderstanding that may have been born some years back &mdash; that one is only entitled to hospital services if one holds a medical card, and many people have, therefore, sought to obtain medical cards.  Up to recently certainly it was the general view that in order to get Health Act services in hospital one had to have a medical card.  Perhaps publications such as that of Mr. Hennessy, and others, will redress that misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>The second cause which leads to the anxiety to obtain medical cards is the fear &mdash; I think it is a very real one&mdash; that people have in relation to the cost of medicines and drugs.  Many people when they seek to obtain medical cards are concerned primarily with obtaining them because of the cost of medicines and drugs in the chemist's shop.  We subsidise a great many things here and I have often wondered if it would not be a good idea to subsidise medicines.  It is the cost of medicines which makes people seek to get on the medical register.  Perhaps it is because of that concern that there was so much anxiety in the last twelve months &mdash; I shall only make a passing reference to this &mdash; because of the tariff on imported drugs and medicines.  I hope that, if there is to be a pharmaceutical industry encouraged here, the Minister will see to it that there will be established as quickly as possible a bureau of standards.  There is, I know, some thinking along that line.  Certainly such a bureau is necessary.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned at some length <Col N="691" /> criticism of the Health Acts and the services under them, that is, in relation to the manner in which they operate under the dispensary system and in relation to the provision of medical cards.  But there is yet another aspect. I refer to the present hospital system. When a poor person in the City of Dublin falls sick and has to go to hospital, he or she goes in all probability into one of the teaching hospitals.  In the country, the patient goes to one of the local authority hospitals.  The teaching hospitals were in existence long before the Health Act.  Many of them were charitable institutions and they are availed of by the Dublin Health Authority to provide what elsewhere is provided through the local authority hospitals.</P>
    <P>Over the years there has been a feeling in the Department that, while the Minister has to meet the deficits and so on of the teaching hospitals, he really has responsibility only to the local authority hospitals.  Over the past few years successive Ministers have concentrated on raising the standards in local authority hospitals. They have aimed at, and they have succeeded in getting, first-class surgeons appointed.  Generally, they have raised the level of both surgery and medicine in local authority hospitals.</P>
    <P>Probably the Minister &mdash; I can speak only about the present Minister &mdash; feels that, since he has no right of control over and no right to dictate to the teaching hospitals, he must stand back from them.  The result is that, while we are using two different types of hospital for the implementation of the health services, no effort has been made to co-ordinate the system of working as between the two types.</P>
    <P>Consider the position of a county surgeon.  A first-class surgeon is appointed to a local authority hospital. He goes there full of zeal, enthusiam and determination. He finds himself, somewhat to his surprise, the only man in the show.  He has no team available to him.  He has no assistance.  His shift begins at one minute past twelve and continues right round the clock.  Such a man inevitably must become a <Col N="692" /> bit frustrated and disillusioned.  The position is that these first-rate specialists appointed to our local authority hospitals find themselves suddenly cut off from any sort of reasonable discussion or communion with their colleagues.</P>
    <P>A great deal could be done and should be done to try to marry the two hospital systems.  If the Minister sought the co-operation and understanding of the staffs of our teaching hospitals, in this city and elsewhere, he would find it possible to reach a situation in which the teaching hospitals themselves would help in the staffing of minor posts in our local authority hospitals.  This could create a ladder which to some extent would join the teaching and local authority hospitals.</P>
    <P>I should not like to offer anything more than the general headings of my view in that regard, because perhaps I would not be entitled to do so, but I feel in relation to marrying, or getting the two hospital systems to work together, there is quite an opportunity there, and if it is done, I believe it will be a success.  If it is not done, I believe there will be a very poor service provided in local authority hospitals, again not due to the fault of any county surgeon, but because of the system and conditions under which he is expected to work.</P>
    <P>To my mind, it is absolutely scandalous to think of a county surgeon in any county hospital, working far removed from any medical centre, and expected to do many operations each day without the benefit of any assistance whatsoever and expected, as in the case of one man in the south of Ireland, to operate with an anaesthetic service provided by a general practitioner. Those conditions add up to tragedy and unfortunately tragedies have occurred.  No matter who the person may be, or how strong his physique and nervous strength, a life of that kind is bound to have its effect. There is no one who can continue to give of his best if he never gets time off, if he never gets a helping hand, and if he never has the opportunity of fully relaxing without feeling that if he does so he is likely to be called back to duty at any moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> I would regard this question of providing properly qualified assistants in our local authority hospitals as a matter of the utmost importance.  I know that financial considerations are involved but we must have regard to the effect which the continuance of the present system is bound to have.  I know of a case that occurred not 12 months ago, of a man being found on the roadside who was examined by a doctor on the spot and found to be dying.  The doctor phoned the county hospital to have the man brought there by ambulance and to inform them of his condition.  The unfortunate man was brought to the hospital &mdash; not in fact by ambulance, but that does not matter &mdash; and the only person to receive him was the hall porter.  Again that was no one's fault, because there was no way of providing anyone else as the house surgeon in the hospital happened to be the doctor responsible for a dispensary some distance away.</P>
    <P>It is most disturbing to think that in relation to that hospital at that time &mdash;for that day&mdash;there was no doctor living in, and when an emergency arose, the hall porter had to phone a doctor who was &ldquo;on tap&rdquo;, who came immediately, who did all that was necessary and did it extremely well.  A situation which permits that to happen is a situation which is bad.  I think a great deal of that is due to the fact that sufficient attention has not been paid &mdash; in recent years certainly &mdash; to trying to get these two hospital systems working together.  There was some talk about that some years ago and I believe it should be followed up.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the charges which the Minister imposed some 18 months or two years ago, for specialist services and X-rays.  Last year, I believe the revenue for these charges in the entire country amounted to £28,750&mdash;call it £29,000.  That was for the half-crown charge for specialist services and the 7/6 charge for X-rays, and all the rest of it, and I want to suggest to the Minister that for the sake of £29,000 it just was not worth all the pother, excitement and difficulty involved in relation to the issue of stamps in this city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> If the total revenue from Cork, Dublin, Limerick, and throughout the country amounts merely to something around £29,000 or £30,000.  I suggest it might be wiser to go back to the original provision in the Health Act under which these specialist services were provided without any charge.  The result of these charges has not been to reduce the cost of the provision of the services in any way.  I assume that the imposition of the charge was not intended and could not have been intended to discourage people availing of the services.  I have little doubt that it has not discouraged them.</P>
    <P>I was interested to see also that the revenue collected from the 10/- per day charge from different people in the hospitals throughout the country amounted in 1958-59 to £245,000. Again, with regard to that, it is I think worth saying that when the Health Act of 1953 was introduced in this House it was urged on behalf of the measure &mdash;and certainly urged when I was being asked to implement the Act subsequently &mdash; that one of the benefits of the measure was that no longer would county councillors, members of corporations and public representatives be asked to try to use their influence to get bills reduced.  We were supposed to have the position where from this on a person entitled to Health Act services could go into hospital, there would not be any charge made and all this business about approaching public representatives to get hospital bills reduced would disappear.</P>
    <P>Of course, that has not been the position.  Particularly since the charge went up to 10/- per day, I think most Deputies and most county councillors find the position to be precisely what it was before the Health Act of 1953. We get the same approaches on the same grounds as was the case prior to the Act.  Often the bill is sent out by the local authorities in faith, hope and confidence and without any idea that they are going to be paid the amount of the bill.  I find in my own experience that frequently, as a result of directing the attention of the local authority to the obvious facts of the case, an account is waived and disregarded. I do not know whether or not <Col N="695" /> the Health Act was really intended to be an advance, but certainly if you reenact in relation to hospital services the same kind of system, only calling it another name, you are not doing anything except trying to fool yourself.</P>
    <P>The total revenue from the 10/- per day charge amounted to almost £250,000.  That is not much related to the entire cost of our health services. If you take the charges for specialist services and the charges for all the hospital beds throughout the country, the total amount is £300,000.  Again, I think it might be wiser to forget about these charges altogether.</P>
    <P>The matters I have mentioned in relation to the present services, as I said at the beginning, give colour to the criticism which has continued unabated in relation to the Health Act and the Health Act services.  Many people feel quite genuinely that we adopted the present form of our services some years ago not because it was felt here it was the just and proper thing to do but rather because they were doing it elsewhere. We adopted here a pale copy of the British system rather because the British had done it and, therefore, we should do something along the same lines.  I think the experience since has shown that the system of providing these services has not been perfect.  It may be that any system will have its defects, of course, but it is very essential for the proper functioning of the health services that they should have the confidence and support of the people.</P>
    <P>No one can say of us on this side of the House&mdash;particularly of us in the Fine Gael Party who were strongly opposed to the Health Bill of 1953&mdash; that we have not made a very full contribution towards the implementation of the services in an effort to make them work.  Nevertheless the confusion continues and the criticism has not abated in the slightest.  Therefore, I would urge on the Minister, in the interests of a future orderly development, that the time has surely come to have a full, unbiased, unprejudiced, non-political examination of this entire problem so that sociologists and persons experienced in and concerned with <Col N="696" /> these matters and who are divorced from the arena which concerns us in this House, would be in a position to advise fully on defects, if defects exist, in the present services and on a proper development for the future.  I would urge the Minister to consider that suggestion in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Before referring to other matters, I must say I was frankly surprised that the Minister's statement to-night gave the House no information about health insurance and the work of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  It is frankly quite disturbing to me to find in an hour's speech by the Minister not one single reference to the work of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>

      <P>It was to enable the Minister to say that that I made the reference.  I have not got the figures but I hope the Minister, when concluding the debate, will give us the present position so far as the Board's activities are concerned.  I saw from one of its statements in April of this year that the membership of the Board now extends to 83,000 people and has increased by some 57 per cent. over the previous year.  That is a very notable increase and I hope that the work of the Board and its attraction will continue to develop in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the legislation which led to the formation of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board was brought before this House some years ago, provision was made for an initial loan to the Board by the State to enable it to go into business.  I think provision was made for loans by the Minister for Health not exceeding £50,000.  It appears from the last report of the Board that it asked for and obtained a loan of something over £13,000.  It also appears that that loan has since been repaid in full, with interest, to the State.  It surely is noteworthy that a Board of that type should have so quickly discharged an initial loan of that kind and that, in fact, what was claimed for the Board, when the legislation was introduced, should come to pass that, in fact, this measure of social legislation has not <Col N="697" /> to date and I hope it will continue&mdash; cost the taxpayer one penny.  I hope that is understood and appreciated by the public generally.</P>
    <P>Health insurance is a new measure in this country.  It is an effort to encourage a person to stand on his own two feet.  It is an effort to teach people, where they can afford it and where they are not distressed, not to have their hands out always seeking State assistance, to teach them to join with others to help themselves.  I am happy to think that the measure of success achieved by the Board since it started operations in October, 1957 has been an extremely satisfactory one.  The Board now covers over 80,000 persons and I hope that in the next year it will continue to increase its membership because the more people realise that they have a duty to fend for themselves and a particular duty to safeguard their own health and the health of their families the better for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In that regard might I say something further to the Minister?  I understand from a discussion we had earlier this evening on the Finance Bill that the Health Insurance Board continues to be taxed, to be liable for income tax at the hands of the Minister for Finance.  I shall not blame the Minister for Health for what the Minister for Finance may decide but I should like to urge this on the Minister because I gather from what the Minister for Finance said that, perhaps, the Minister for Health may not have placed the full story before the Minister for Finance.  I would urge on the Minister to do all he can to ensure that this income tax liability should be dispensed with.  The fact is that in the Voluntary Health Insurance Bill a section was contemplated&mdash;certainly it was in the draft&mdash;providing that the Board, since it was non-profit making, would not be liable for income tax.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Finance learned of the inclusion of this measure in the Bill, they informed the Department of Health that the Department of Finance was still the Department of Finance and that a measure of this kind was proper only for a Finance Bill and not for a Bill dealing with health insurance. <Col N="698" /> In the light of that information which was also conveyed at Ministerial level, it was agreed that the Section would be taken out of the Bill and that it would be considered at the time of the Finance Bill which was contemplated shortly after that.  In fact, it was not included in the Finance Bill of 1957.  It certainly was a measure which should have been included.</P>
    <P>To-day the Minister for Finance said that he was not completely aware of that background.  Perhaps, the Minister might check what I said and acquaint himself with it.  It is true to say that income tax relief is already provided under the policy of the State for co-operative concerns of different kinds&mdash;co-operative concerns that, in fact, engage in commerce and that, in fact, make a profit. Here is a measure of social co-operative insurance and no profit can be made under the Statute; any surplus of revenue over expenditure must be utilised either for the reduction of premiums or an increase in benefits.  It does seem a bit absurd that the mere process of collecting premiums should in itself be taxed as income moving from one person to another.  I would be out of order if I said anything more about it but I would ask the Minister to take up the matter again with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred in his statement here this evening to rehabilitation. I am glad to learn from the Minister that progress is being made on this matter.  It was not an easy one.  It was a difficult examination and I hope that the centre which the Minister envisages will be successful.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred in his speech this evening to the hospitals building programme and he reported that the steps which he had taken to deal with the position of the Hospitals Trust Fund were now bearing fruit.  I just do not know what steps the Minister took.</P>

      <P>Very easy.  It might have been more difficult if the Minister had continued to mount and provide for the programme which I left behind.  It would have been a difficult job in financing, I have no doubt, but with faith in the continuance of the Hospitals Sweepstakes and of the <Col N="700" /> accretion to the Trust Fund the programme could have been carried out.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30th June, 1960.</P>
