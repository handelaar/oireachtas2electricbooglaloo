      <P>asked the Taoiseach the periods from 18th September, 1959 to 10th June, 1960 during which the Attorney General has been absent from Ireland, the duration of such absences, and the purpose of each such absence; whether the expenses of any such absences were defrayed out of public funds, and, if so, how much such expenses amounted to; and whether his authority was delegated to any person during his absence, and, if so, to whom</P>

      <P>Between 18th September, 1959, and 10th June, 1960, the Attorney General was absent from Ireland for the purpose of attending the Second Conference on the Law of the Sea at Geneva and a preliminary meeting at Strasbourg with the President of the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights.  He was absent at Geneva from 15th March to 2nd April and from 5th to 28th April. The cost to public funds of his attendance there was about £350.  On 10th June in answer to a Question in this House I gave particulars relating to the Attorney General's trip to Strasbourg.</P>
      <P>The answer to the final part of the Deputy's question is in the negative. During the Attorney General's absences abroad he remained in touch with his office and gave instructions when sought.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Attorney General has appeared as such in any court or courts outside the State since his appointment; if so, the number and times of such appearances and the designation of the courts; the number of times on which he has appeared as such in courts within the State since his appointment, and the designation of the courts concerned; whether he has appeared as Attorney General in the High Court or Supreme Court since his appointment, and, if not, why; and the number of occasions on which since his appointment he has appeared as counsel in his private capacity in the High Court and Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General did not appear as such in any Court since the date of his appointment. During his appointment from 20th March, 1957, to 23rd June, 1959, he appeared twice before the European Commission on Human Rights at Strasbourg and once before the Detention Commission at the Curragh. The Attorney General is not required to furnish details of his private practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what is the present position relating to the proposal to build a new county hospital in Longford; whether the proposal has been abandoned, and, if so, what he proposes to do with the site; what is the cost of development and the purchase price of the site; and what revenue is received by the Longford County Council from letting of (a) the house and out-offices and (b) the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. Kennedy) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. Kennedy)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme to provide a new County <Col N="1842" /> Hospital at Longford is one of the projects included in the Hospitals Building Programme which were deferred some years ago due to the difficult position which arose in relation to the Hospitals Trust Fund.  While income from sweepstakes source has improved considerably in the meantime, there has also been an appreciable increase in the revenue deficits of voluntary hospitals for which provision must be made.  The result is that while the improved financial position has made it possible to allow the commencement of a number of urgent schemes which had been deferred, it has not been possible to allow a general resumption of hospital building activity.  The position in regard to the remaining schemes has to be considered in the light of the magnitude of the grant expenditure involved&mdash;approximately £8 millions&mdash; the prospective income of the Fund in the years to come and the need to establish a reserve sufficient to ensure that any commitments that are undertaken can be honoured.  While no decision has been taken to abandon any of the schemes that have been deferred it is not possible as yet to say when any of those projects will be allowed to proceed or whether they will be undertaken precisely on the lines originally intended.  A further point to be considered is the order of priority in which the deferred schemes will be undertaken.  As soon as a decision can be arrived at in regard to the Longford project I will get in touch with the local authority in connection with the matter.</P>
      <P>The price of the site was £4,697 (including legal expenses).  The cost of developing the site (including fees and miscellaneous expenses) was £8,045.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main house and outoffices and portion of the site were sold by the Longford County Council some years ago for £2,600.  A gate house at the back entrance has been demolished. The total amount received by the council from letting the houses and outoffices before they were disposed of was £1,054, while the total revenue received up to 31st March, 1960, from <Col N="1843" /> letting the lands amounted to £2,129. The revenue from the current letting of the unsold lands is £140 per annum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that a T.B. patient (name supplied) who has been in Newcastle Sanatorium for the past fourteen months made repeated application within the last six months to the assistant medical officer of health for a suit of clothes and received a reply indicating that the matter was receiving attention; if so, if he considers that there has been undue delay in this case; and if he will state the cause of the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having made enquiries in the matter, I do not consider that there was undue delay on the part of the Health Authority in providing this patient with a suit of clothes.  Deferment in complying with an application is not necessarily synonymous with delay; it is a matter for the Health Authority, acting through their responsible officers, to decide whether a particular application should be granted and, if so, at what stage, having regard to the needs of the person concerned.</P>
      <P>Since the patient's admission to Newcastle Sanatorium in June of last year he has been supplied with two sets of underwear, two pairs of pyjamas, one pullover, a pair of shoes and two shirts. The issue of a suit of clothes to him was deferred as he was not regarded as being in need of it.  As, however, there is some prospect of his early discharge from the sanatorium, a suit has been placed on order for him.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the patient's household consists of himself, his wife and an adult son and that the present income of the household is over £9 a week.  Having regard to the fact that the patient is being maintained free of charge, I do not think he has been treated unreasonably by the Health Authority in the matter of the supply of clothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider six months an undue delay considering that one patient in hospital, who had three times the salary of a Minister, had not a week's delay in being supplied with clothes?  A man with £9,000 could get the clothes inside a week.  The nurse suggested that he should see the assistant medical officer of health and he got the clothes without delay.  Since I raised this matter, the man concerned has had to refund the cost of the clothing and I suppose that would not have happened had I not reported the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that a T.B. patient (name supplied) in Newcastle Sanatorium who received an acknowledgment to his application for a suit of clothes on 17th February, 1960 has not yet received the clothes; and, if so, if he considers that there has been undue delay in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having made enquiries as to the circumstances in which the issue of a suit to the patient in Newcastle Sanatorium, referred to by the Deputy, has been deferred, I do not consider that there has been undue delay on the part of the Health Authority in providing the patient with a suit.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the patient, since his admission to the sanatorium, has been supplied with clothing on three separate occasions but the provision of a suit was not considered necessary.</P>
      <P>As it is likely that the patient will be discharged shortly a measurement form for a suit has been sent to him and on receipt by the Health Authority of the form, duly completed, the suit will be ordered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should perhaps, mention that, <Col N="1845" /> according to my information the patient is aged 63, unmarried, has no dependants, is entitled to 30/- a week Social Welfare Benefit.  In these circumstances and as the patient is being maintained, completely free of charge to him, I do not feel that he has been treated unreasonably by the Council in this matter of the supply of clothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to say when did this man receive the form because the letter I have states that he applied for it six months ago and up until last week he had not received it?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary inquire into the administration of the supplying of clothes to poor patients within the last six months?  I said last week that the nurses and doctors were trying to organise a political organisation and had no time to look after the patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of a proposal to close the present weekly dispensary session at Cabinteely, County Dublin; that patients who attend this dispensary would be required to attend the Ballybrack dispensary and that this would involve hardship on the persons concerned; and, if so, if he will ensure that a weekly dispensary session is retained at Cabinteely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The continuance or discontinuance of sessions at dispensaries or dispensary premises is a matter for the health authority in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I am informed that a weekly dispensary session was held at rented premises in Cabinteely until recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was represented to my Department by the health authority that the continuance of sessions at these premises <Col N="1846" /> would not be justified as the attendance was small&mdash;sometimes no patient attended and sometimes two or three; that alternative arrangements have been made for the attendance of these patients at Ballybrack Dispensary; and that the owner of the premises was anxious to terminate the letting.  The health authority also stated that there is a satisfactory bus service to Ballybrack for the persons concerned.  On the basis of this information, I approved, on 30th ultimo, the proposal of the health authority to discontinue the weekly session.</P>
    <P>Proposals by the health authority for the reorganisation of dispensary districts in the area are at present under examination in my Department and the authority have indicated that the general position regarding dispensaries in the district will be reconsidered when the position regarding the revision of dispensary districts has been finalised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs why his Department took from the 23rd of June to the 27th June to decide to repatriate an Irish seaman in Bremen who was in distress and carried a recognised seaman's book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory provisions governing the treatment of distressed seamen, which are contained in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906 and the Distressed Seamen Regulations, 1921, do not oblige a diplomatic or consular officer to repatriate immediately any seaman who notifies the officer that he is in distress.</P>
      <P>A seaman who informs a diplomatic or consular officer that he is in distress is entitled to relief and maintenance but only until employment can be found for him or arrangements made for his return to a proper return port.  An Irish seaman who is in receipt of relief and who is unable to find suitable employment either on a ship or otherwise, is repatriated, preferably on an Irish or foreign ship returning to an Irish port or, if this is impracticable, by any other reasonable means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seaman named Heaney notified the Irish Embassy at Bonn on 23rd June, through the British Vice-Consul at Bremen, that he was in distress and received immediate relief.  Accommodation was obtained for him in a seaman's hostel.  The Embassy discussed with the British Consulate at Bremen the possibility of finding suitable employment for the seaman either <Col N="1848" /> in Bremen or Hamburg or, alternatively, of finding him a berth on a ship bound for an Irish port.  Neither of these solutions to the problem was however practicable.  It was, therefore, necessary to repatriate Heaney by ordinary transport.</P>
    <P>Heaney was but one of a group of Irishmen, some of them seamen by profession, who had accepted employment with a German firm in June last and who had subsequently refused to work for the firm.  The circumstances of these men were reported to the Embassy on the same day as the case of Heaney.  The Embassy, which was greatly concerned at the position which had arisen and the possibility that as many as twenty-four men would have to be repatriated if no other solution to the problem was possible, kept in close contact with the German firm and with the Department in the matter.  It eventually emerged that, of the total number of forty-eight, thirty-six were prepared to honour their engagement with the firm. The remainder were repatriated.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that a full and proper examination of the case necessarily took a few days.  There was no question of the men being destitute while this examination was in progress. Heaney and another member of the group, Martin, were accommodated in a seaman's hostel in Bremen which is comfortable and run on the lines of a hotel; the others were kept in a hostel belonging to the German fishing firm, the conditions of which are also good, as I mentioned in my reply to question No. 4 put by the Deputy on Wednesday, 13th July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on the day Heaney applied for repatriation a colleague of his, an Irishman with a British passport, applied at the same time to the British Embassy, and does the Minister not agree that the treatment given by the Department of External Affairs of this country compares very unfavourably indeed with the treatment accorded the Irishman carrying a British passport, who was repatriated there and then? Is it not a fact that the Irish Embassy in Bonn did not communicate to the <Col N="1849" /> British Consul in Bremen that our Department of External Affairs was prepared to bear the cost of repatriating one of the men until the British authorities, out of decency and Christian charity, had themselves repatriated him and had so informed the Irish Embassy?</P>

It was a case of a number of men, and the Department of External Affairs is bound to make certain that the taxpayers' money is reasonably safeguarded.  There was no hardship on this man.  He was kept in reasonable conditions while the officers of the Department of External Affairs were examining the whole case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of the Minister's reply, why did our Department have to take five or six days to do what another country could do in a few minutes?  That is what I want to get at.  If the Minister and the Government have no sense of shame, the Irish people have a sense of shame.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time the Deputy got a bit of sense.  The people understand that if there are 24 men involved in a case of repatriation, which may cost quite a lot of money, the officials of the Department of External Affairs abroad have to be careful to see that the taxpayers' money is used in the best way.  This was not the case of a single individual.  At times in the year, the Department very often have to return a seaman in distress or <Col N="1850" /> who is left ashore in various ports, but this is a case of 24 people.  The officials had to be careful to see in this case that the taxpayers' money was safeguarded.</P>

I gave very full consideration to the further representations made to me in the matter but I found it necessary to confirm refusal of the application pursuant to my statutory obligations under Section 11 of the Road Transport Act, 1932, to have regard to the necessity for the proposed service in the light of the existing passenger services on or in the neighbourhood of the proposed route.</P>
      <P>Should, however, the application be altered to provide services which would not compete directly with existing services, either because they are operated on different days or because they would cater for people travelling from Westport to Connemara and back, rather than people travelling to Westport from Connemara and back, I would be prepared to give the matter further consideration.</P>

      <P>The accounts of Irish Shipping Ltd. for the year ended 30th April, 1960, which have been presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas today, contain the information sought by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it has not yet been presented to Dáil Éireann could I prevail on the Minister to extract the figure from the report, which apparently he has in his hand and communicate it to me now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The document should have been presented.  I am sure it will be available very shortly.  The depreciation on vessels in the accounts of Irish Shipping Limited for the year ended 30th April, 1960, is £695,547, which represents a full year's depreciation at full normal rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it a desirable practice to publish a preliminary statement for the information of the public that Irish Shipping has, in a given year, made a trading profit of £216,000 without reference to the fact that the figure has been arrived at before making allowance for £690,000 worth of depreciation which the auditor of the company considers to be a necessary and proper provision and which converts what the public were led to believe was a trading profit of £216,000 into a loss of £400,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is being slightly unfair because in the course of my speech on the Estimate I made it clear that all the shipping companies doing tramp shipping business are going through a difficult period and I pointed out that I have confidence in the future of Irish Shipping Limited.  I did mention, as the Deputy will find&mdash;I have not the text by me&mdash;if he reads the whole of what I said on the operations of Irish Shipping Limited, that they were in a difficult position because of the reduction <Col N="1861" /> in freight rates consequent on an excess of shipping.  If the Deputy reads the whole of my Estimate speech he will not believe that I was deceiving the public in any sense.  It is a matter of opinion of course, but, in my opinion, I did not deceive the House or the public in what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not primarily concerned to comment on the state of Irish Shipping's balance sheet as of today.  The only question arising is that I read in the newspaper a preliminary statement sponsored by the Minister long before he made his Estimate speech in which he recorded that Irish Shipping had made a trading profit of £216,000.  Subsequently I put down a question in terms similar to this question today and the Minister said he would prefer that I should wait for the publication of the report. I have now repeated the question and there emerges the fact that what people have been told is a trading profit of £216,000 is, in fact, a loss of over £400,000.  My sole concern is that inaccurate preliminary information of that kind does more harm than good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must appreciate the fact that the Irish Shipping Company as a company, from the point of view of its company finance, is a very solvent company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Its assets in the form of ships are very significant and important, and one simply has to accept the downturn or upturn in freight rates over a long period of years.  Sometimes units of 20 years are taken for the purpose of estimating the prosperity of shipping companies. The Deputy can examine the history of British tramp shipping companies and other companies who operate on the same lines and he will find a similar story of alternate downturns and upturns.  Speaking of the general picture I have confidence in the future of Irish Shipping assuming that the world remains sane and assuming that general world prosperity and trade <Col N="1862" /> continue to grow as they are growing.</P>
      <P>That is all I intended to convey to the House and the Deputy need not accuse me of trying to conceal something from the public.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether Aer Lingus and Aerlínte Éireann consulted him before adopting Irish Airlines and Irish International Airlines, respectively, as substitute titles; and if in view of the actions of the two concerns in assuming titles other than those created by Acts of the Oireachtas he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The names Aer Lingus and Aerlínte Éireann were not, in fact, created by acts of the Oireachtas, except in so far as each company is incorporated under the Companies Acts.  The name Aer Lingus, Teóranta, is mentioned in the Air Navigation and Transport Acts, 1936-1959 which, however, do not themselves create the name of the company.</P>
      <P>I was advised of the adoption by the air companies of the added descriptions mentioned by the Deputy.  These are not in substitution for the legal titles of the companies but are merely marketing descriptions, additional to the titles, adopted to assist publicity abroad.  The legal titles of the companies are used in their timetables, tickets, accounts and reports and on their aircraft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that new planes put into service by these companies have on them the only description, &ldquo;Irish International Airlines&rdquo;? Would the Minister not agree with me that when other countries such as Germany, Belgium and Holland can use the titles of Lufthansa, Sabena and KLM without losing the influence <Col N="1863" /> which they hope to gain in foreign markets, surely this country ought to use the Irish titles, first of all, and use the others, perhaps, in addition?  It appears that the company, in many cases, is using the English alternatives in substitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case. The Company, for marketing purposes, makes use of the titles which they feel are most suitable to assist publicity abroad.  The foreign companies are accustomed to use English titles quite freely.  In the case of KLM it is Royal Dutch Airlines; and in the case of Sabena, Belgian Airlines.  I think a balance is maintained by Aer Lingus in arranging to use titles which are in consonance with the development of publicity and markets abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to the coming into operation of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948, pensionable local officers were entitled, on retirement, to an annual allowance based on 1/60th of pensionable remuneration for each year of service without any lump sum.  The 1948 Act, which applied to officers appointed on or after the 1st April, 1948, and to existing officers at their option, provided for a lump sum and a smaller annual allowance based on 1/80th of pensionable remuneration for each year of service.</P>
      <P>Existing legislation does not enable a local officer who has retired on pension to accept a lump sum in lieu of the whole or part of that pension and the introduction of amending legislation on the matter is not contemplated. Civil servants are in the same position as local officers in this respect.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy, possibly I should say&mdash;and it may cover the cases of hardship he has in mind&mdash;that there is in Section 51 of the Local Government Superannuation Act, 1956 a provision whereby an officer or servant of a local authority may on retirement surrender portion of his pension in consideration of an allowance for his wife or one specified dependant.  This provision has been in operation since 1956.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A special grant of £12,500 has been notified to the Kerry County Council in the current year for the Headford/Kenmare road to deal with the problems created by the closing of the Headford Junction/Kenmare branch railway line.  It is proposed to allocate further grants for the same purpose in each of the three coming years.  A special grant has not been allocated in respect of the road between Farranfore and Cahirciveen since the special funds made available for such purposes are confined to cases where the road problem is clearly created by the railway closing and is such as cannot be dealt with under the other grants available to the council.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> As Deputies are aware, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has requested the Government to contribute a Battalion of Irish troops to the United Nations Force which is at present being constituted for service in the Congo.  The Government have decided to comply with this request and the purpose of this Bill is to enable them to do so.  Although they are largely a matter of public knowledge, I think I should perhaps begin with a review of the circumstances in which the Secretary-General's request to the Government came to be made.</P>
    <P>After consultation with the leaders of the various national movements in the Congo, the Belgian Government decided earlier this year to grant the Congo its independence.  This decision was in line with the far-reaching political developments taking place in Africa under which territories formerly subjected to colonial rule are achieving their freedom and independence and becoming sovereign members of the world community.  The new Republic of the Congo became independent on the 1st July of this year and the large number of countries, including Ireland, represented at the independence celebrations in Leopoldville indicated that the new State was being recognised by all leading States of the world, including the Kingdom of Belgium.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the achievement of its independence, the Republic of the Congo applied for admission to membership of the United Nations.  Its application was considered by the Security Council which unanimously recommended that the Republic of the Congo should be admitted to full membership at the next session of the Assembly.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as Deputies are aware, the new State found itself confronted, almost from its inception, by serious internal difficulties and disorders, including local mutinies of some of its armed forces on which it relied for the preservation of its domestic peace and stability.  These disorders were marked by attacks and outrages on European residents, resulting in loss of life in some cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> It is unnecessary for me to enlarge upon these incidents, of which Deputies are now well aware.  They are, I feel sure, a source of regret and anxiety to all who have the welfare of the new State at heart and who realise the significance of the position of the Congo from the point of view of the African continent as a whole.  These incidents gravely disturbed public opinion in Belgium.  The Belgian Government found itself impelled to send contingents of paratroops into the new Republic of the Congo to protect the European residents from the attacks to which they were subjected.</P>
    <P>Faced with this, the Government of the Congo appealed to the Security Council of the United Nations.  The situation was considered as a matter of urgency by the Security Council.  Its deliberations resulted in two decisions. In the first place, it called upon the Government of Belgium to withdraw its troops from the State of the Congo. In the second place, it authorised the Secretary-General to take the necessary steps, in consultation with the Government of the Congo, to provide that Government with such military aid and assistance as was deemed necessary until such time as, in the opinion of the Government of the Congo, the national security forces of that country might be able to meet fully the task of preserving internal law and order.</P>
    <P>As is well known, the action of the Security Council has only too often in the past been hamstrung by the exercise of the veto.  In this case there was no veto.  Not all members voted in favour of the resolution, but none voted against it.  The resolution represents, therefore, a positive concrete decision by the Security Council of the United Nations.  It is in accordance with this decision that the Secretary-General has addressed his request to the Government of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I shall now turn from this brief review of the circumstances of the Secretary-General's request to say something about the considerations which the Government of Ireland had in mind in deciding to comply with it.  It is a weakness in world organisations that their members often tend to be more conscious of the advantages <Col N="1878" /> these organisations seem to afford them than of the obligations which membership of them implies.  That was the principal point made by the then Taoiseach when seeking the approval of the Dáil for Ireland's application for membership of the United Nations.  The present is a case in which we must bear in mind what our obligations are as a member of a world organisation.</P>
    <P>Article 2 (5) of the United Nations Charter obliges all members to &ldquo;give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the Charter&rdquo;.  By Article 25, all members of the Organisation &ldquo;agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council&rdquo;.  Under Article 43, all members undertake to make available to the Security Council armed forces and other facilities necessary for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.</P>
    <P>We are naturally anxious that Ireland should honour her obligations in this respect in the spirit as well as in the letter.  The Charter provisions are obviously pertinent to the request now addressed to the Government of Ireland by the Secretary-General.</P>
    <P>The question naturally arises why the Secretary-General should address his request to Ireland rather than to other members of the United Nations which, from many points of view, might seem better able to contribute to the United Nations force than ourselves. The answer is provided, I believe, by the special position we occupy in relation to world affairs and by the policies we have been able to pursue since we became a member of the United Nations in 1956.  We have tried to deal with world problems and issues on their merits and to arrive at fair and impartial conclusions with regard to them, in the light of our obligations under the Charter and of our own national traditions and outlook. In deciding which countries to approach, the Secretary-General must naturally have had regard to the many difficulties in the present situation.  I think it is wise to assume that the facts I have just mentioned were foremost in the mind of the Secretary-General when deciding to make his request to us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> It is obvious that, in the situation that exists in the Congo, the national troops constituting the United Nations Force must command the confidence of all the parties immediately concerned. The more they do so, the more successful they are likely to be in achieving their objective.  It is a fair assumption that this, more than any other, is the consideration which has determined the composition of the United Nations force and influenced the Secretary-General's decision about whom to invite to participate.</P>
    <P>This is a situation in which Ireland has an opportunity of contributing to the maintenance of peace and order under the Charter of the United Nations.  The composition of the United Nations Force has yet to be finally determined.  Four African states&mdash;Tunisia, Morocco, Ghana and Ethiopia&mdash;have already contributed contingents, and their troops are already in the Congo.  Last week-end the Secretary-General invited five other States, three European&mdash;Ireland, Sweden and Yugoslavia&mdash;one Latin American&mdash;Haiti&mdash;and one Asian&mdash; Burma&mdash;to send troops.  Sweden has already agreed.  Besides the nine states I have mentioned, at least twenty countries are sending auxiliary services, transport and supplies.  In other words the present endeavour is a great co-operative effort of the world community, and we hope it proves a valuaable precedent for the future.</P>
    <P>The latest reports from the Congo suggest some improvement in the situation, but the difficulties facing the United Nations Force should not be minimised.  The complexity of the local situation will be obvious from the press reports and, though we hope for an early solution, the future is still unpredictable.  We all hope that the intervention of the United Nations will achieve its objective and that the Government of the Congo will be able to proceed with the tasks confronting it in conditions of internal peace and order.  Deputies will realise that it would not be desirable, if that hope should be destroyed, that Ireland should appear to have failed to play its part.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> I should like to make it quite clear that during its service in the Congo the Irish contingent will be under the orders of the Supreme Commander, General von Horn, who has been selected by the Secretary-General, under the authority given him by the Security Council.  The contingent will be acting on behalf of the United Nations, subject to orders of the Supreme Commander and not to the orders of the Irish Government.  It will be for the Supreme Commander, and not the Irish Government, to determine the day-to-day measures and dispositions necessary to achieve the purpose of the Force.</P>
    <P>Members of the Dáil will wish to be clear, I am sure, as to what precisely the purpose of the Force is.  As I have said, the situation in the Congo is one of extreme complexity.  Apart from the breakdown of the national security forces in that country and the consequent lack of protection for lives and property, internal political dissensions which threaten the territorial integrity of the country have developed between different parts of the Congo. The question naturally arises of the role, if any, the United Nations Force is intended to play in these political difficulties.  The answer to this question was made public yesterday in an interim report made by the Secretary-General to the Security Council.  I shall quote the three relevant passages of this report.  First, &ldquo;the Force introduced is to be regarded as a temporary security Force present in the Republic of the Congo with the consent of the Government&rdquo;.  The second quotation to which I wish to draw the attention of the House is as follows: &ldquo;Although it may be considered as serving as an arm of the Government for the maintenance of order and protection of life &mdash;tasks which naturally belong to the national authorities and which will pass to such authorities as soon as, in the view of the Government, they are sufficiently firmly established&mdash;the force is necessarily under the exclusive command of the United Nations, vested in the Secretary-General under the control of the Security Council.&rdquo; The third quotation reads: &ldquo;The authority granted to the United Nations force cannot be exercised <Col N="1881" /> within the Congo either in competition with representatives of the host Government or in co-operation with them in any joint operation.  This naturally applies <i>a fortiori</i> to representatives and military units of other Governments than the host Government. Thus, the United Nations operations must be separate and distinct from activities by any national authority.  Likewise, it follows from the rule that the United Nations units must not become parties in internal conflicts, that they cannot be used to enforce any specific political solution of pending problems or to influence the political balance decisive to such a solution.</P>
    <P>In brief, the purpose of the United Nations Force in the Congo will be to act as an independent entity for the purpose of protecting lives and property wherever they are endangered in consequence of the inability of the Government of the Congo to ensure such protection from its own resources. The rôle of the United Nations Force will be limited to that task.  It will have no role to play in any problem of a political nature in the Congo, existing or future.</P>
    <P>The sending of Irish troops outside the limits of the State requires legislation by the Dáil.  Foreseeing the possibilities that requests, such as the present, might be received, the Government have had legislation for this purpose under consideration for some time.  It was proposed to ask the Oireachtas to pass a permanent Bill with a clause requiring approval of the Dáil by Resolution before it could be applied in any specific instance. The urgency of the present request from the Secretary-General has prompted the Government to seek the co-operation of the Dáil in the passage into law, for a limited period of six months, of the special temporary measure now before the House.</P>
    <P>The permanent measure the Government has in mind will be introduced before the termination of the six-months period.  The purpose of the present measure may be simply stated. Its purpose is to authorise the sending of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force outside the State for <Col N="1882" /> duties of a police character on behalf of the United Nations and, secondly, to provide in respect of such members of the Defence Forces as may volunteer for service overseas during the period of its operation the same statutory conditions of service as apply to members of the Defence Forces stationed at home.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that the intention is to recruit our contingent from existing members of the Defence Forces on a voluntary basis. Those who may join the Defence Forces during the validity of the present measure would accept the liability to overseas service, subject to the terms of the measure, as part of their conditions of service.  We are relying for recruitment of the force on the necessary numbers of volunteers coming forward from the existing ranks of the Defence Forces.  I have been informed by the Minister for Defence that the numbers who have already indicated their intention to volunteer is much more than adequate and there is no doubt that, on a volunteer basis, we should be able to provide a force which will do credit to the Army and to the country.</P>
    <P>Two years ago we provided a force of 50 officers for service in the United Nations Observation Group in the Lebanon.  All the reports I have received speak in the highest terms of the efficiency and the devotion to duty they displayed.  Indeed, I might mention, as a matter of interest, that one of these Irish officers, Colonel Justin McCarthy, has just been appointed to replace General von Horn, now in the Congo, as Acting Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East.  I have no doubt that the battalion we propose to provide in response to the present request from the Secretary-General will maintain the high standard set by our officers in the Middle East, that it will redound to the credit of the Irish Defence Forces and uphold our reputation as a loyal member of the United Nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot follow the Taoiseach in his speculations as to why the Secretary-General called on YugoSlavia, Sweden and Ireland to assist <Col N="1883" /> in this situation.  All we know is that he has done so and we accept that, as members of the United Nations, we must accede to that request of the Secretary-General.  Accordingly, we shall facilitate the Government in the passage of this Bill to make that contribution by us to this joint force within the shortest possible time.  We feel, however, that though the Taoiseach has been in a position to read out for us some extracts from the statement by the Secretary-General as to the functions of the proposed international force acting under General von Horn, of which our battalion will form a part, the Government has not only a right but a duty to seek from the Secretary-General a further clarification of the scope and the duration of this assignment in the Congo. I do not think it is unreasonable in the circumstances, with the House about to adjourn for the Summer Recess, that we should ask the Taoiseach to reassure us that he will keep us informed of any information that may reach him.  Subject to these observations, we accept our liabilities as members of the United Nations, recalling that Deputy Cosgrave attended there first on behalf of the Irish Government, and we shall provide the Government with the facilities it seeks to pass this Bill today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us regret the special necessity for a Bill of this kind but in view of what we know and in view of what the Taoiseach has said, there is no objection&mdash;I am sure there will be no objection from any part of the House&mdash;to the speedy passage of this measure.  As the Taoiseach and Deputy Dillon said, we have an excellent record in international organisations and have always demonstrated that we are prepared to accept the responsibilities we accepted when we joined them.  In view of the fact that we are members of the United Nations Organisation, and that we knew when applying for membership that such requests might be made to us, I think it only right that we should act in accordance with our responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said, and it is <Col N="1884" /> widely accepted, that the reason for forces travelling from different countries to the Congo is the preservation of law and order, but I feel that there are not many in the country, or in this House, who have a full appreciation of what the situation in the Congo really is.  Neither do I think that anybody in the country, the Taoiseach, nor anybody on any side of the House, would try to make it more obscure and confusing than it is, but one of my observations to the Taoiseach on this Bill would be to make sure that we are not involved too much.  Our volunteers will be sent there in good faith by the Government, with the consent of this House, to police and patrol under the direction of a General appointed by the Security Council or by the Secretary of the United Nations.  I would ask the Taoiseach to send someone there outside the Army, who would keep an eye on the situation to see that our volunteers are not involved in something in which they should not be involved.</P>
    <P>Our volunteers, as I say, are going as a peace force to patrol and police, to try and ensure that there will be law and order, but we do not know whether in two weeks' time, or in two or three months' time, there may be a different situation.  None of us can pretend to understand fully what colonialism has been in the Congo, and Africa generally, and cannot know what developments might take place in time to come.  For that reason I think there should be some member of our Diplomatic Corps appointed&mdash; if there is someone there already it is all right&mdash;to act as liaison officer to see that we do not become too involved.</P>
    <P>At all events, I applaud the idea of sending this volunteer force because the important thing is the preservation of peace in what has been known as the Belgian Congo, and possibly it is a contribution towards peace in the world.  I do not know whether, in his long statement, the Taoiseach has stated the number of volunteers who will be sent.  The newspapers have been speculating as to the number and their estimates have ranged from 500 and 600 up to 1,000.  I should <Col N="1885" /> also like to ask if there is any period specified for this service?  I do not know how intense this operation or manoeuvre will be, but I think there ought to be an understanding with the Security Council, or with General Von Horn, who is in charge, as to the period in which our volunteers will be, so to speak, on active service.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill that members of this force should be volunteers is a good one, and it is gratifying to know that so many over and above the number required have volunteered for this particular type of service. I also think that the Taoiseach has the care of these volunteers uppermost in his mind.  It is a grand gesture for us to say we are sending out 500 or 600 volunteers, but we must understand that when the operation ends&mdash; it may be in two weeks' time, a month's time or three months' time&mdash;we shall have questions in this House as to how they were treated and as to things that were not done for them.  I believe we ought to satisfy our minds on these problems before we disperse today.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill includes a provision that members of this Force, for the purposes of pay and pension, will still be regarded as members of the Defence Forces and that their pension rights will be safeguarded, but I do not know what the intention of the Minister for Defence is in this matter.  Does he contemplate sending them out to-morrow, at the weekend, or in two weeks' time?</P>
    <P>I know there are problems in trying to ensure that the officers and volunteers will not contract the diseases peculiar to that part of Africa. That is one of the little administrative details which, in the ordinary course of events, might be undertaken by the Army, but this is the first venture of the kind for this country.  It is hundreds of years since an army sponsored by an Irish Government has gone overseas, and for that reason I should like to be satisfied that all these little personal matters in respect to personnel would be taken care of properly.  These would be normal to Governments who control armies that usually go from one country to another, but I <Col N="1886" /> think we ought to be satisfied now in our minds about them, and I think the Taoiseach should make a statement to the effect that all necessary safeguards will be taken before our volunteers embark for the Belgian Congo.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to say, on my own behalf and that of my Party, that we wish these volunteers well.  Their mission has been described, more or less, as a police patrol but we do not know how it will develop.  The intention of the Security Council and of the forces of the various countries going to the Congo is to preserve law and order, but the preservation of law and order has not meant much to us beyond the Civic Guards.  This will be a little more than that.  There may be a conflict, there may be lives lost, and again I should like on my own behalf and that of my Party, to wish our volunteers well and that they will return home unscathed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We, too, in this Party give our fullest support to the Taoiseach on this measure.  We do that for two reasons, the first being that we know it was a very welcome day for Ireland when it was accepted as a member of the United Nations.  It is all very well accepting something that is beneficial, but it is very nice to know we are all agreed on shouldering our responsibility, now that a small measure of it devolves upon us.  The second reason is that I think this is a step to what some people regard as a dream, a world Parliament and a world police force.  If the United Nations Organisation is properly backed up by its members I believe its influence will spread&mdash;perhaps not in the very near future&mdash;to prevent world conflicts, two of which have occurred in the lifetime of most of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point I should like to mention to the Taoiseach is the possibility of disablement or death of any of these volunteers in the course of their duties. Is there any provision for that?  Who bears the responsibility?  Is it the country to which they go or is it our own country, and is there any fund to meet such a contingency?  Deputy Corish mentioned that he would not <Col N="1887" /> like to see this force involved in anything other than police work and I feel we can trust the Commander-in-Chief under whose orders they will be to see that that will be so.  The Bill clearly specifies they are to be a police force to help in establishing law and order without taking a part which might leave them in the position of being accused later of taking sides in politics out there.  We welcome this move and give our full support to the Taoiseach in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">

      <P>There is just one point I should like to make.  In recent months the F.C.A. have shown up tremendously well in direct competition with the Army.  I should like if a unit of the F.C.A., a platoon or a company, might be considered for this type of service.  They now train with the regular Army, although they are volunteers soldiers.  I feel that on their showing in recent competitions it would be a great encouragement to that section of the Army if a unit were considered for overseas service.</P>

      <P>To me and most Irish people the Congo is as remote as outer space.  Nevertheless, it is a new nation.  We have commitments to the United Nations which we must fulfil.  However, there are a few points I want to raise.  It has been suggested that this new force should be given the title of &ldquo;The Casement Brigade&rdquo;.  We all know that Casement came into public life originally because of his disclosures of the ill-treatment of natives of the Congo.  I am sure that the title &ldquo;The Casement Brigade&rdquo; would appeal to the natives of the Congo and bring home to them the work of Irishmen, particularly that of Casement.  It would, perhaps, give them protection and make for respect.  The question of naming the force in honour of Casement should be seriously considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our taking part in police work in the Congo could be a very serious matter.  We do not know what the development will be.  The Congo is a huge country, 1,500 miles in length and at least 1,000 miles in breadth, as long as from here to Vienna.  There has been a secession of one party and <Col N="1888" /> there may be other troubles.  We do not know.  What exactly will be the duties of our Force?  Will they be there to protect the lives and property of farmers or the lives and property of the natives?  Supposing internal differences are aggravated and some sort of civil war breaks out&mdash;we hope it will not happen, but it is not impossible&mdash;would the fact that we were protecting the natives embroil us in trouble involving casualties?</P>
    <P>It is my experience that human beings, whether few or many, do not change at all.  Down deep they are all the same.  It has been my personal experience that when people intervene in a family argument, even though they mean well, they are often lit upon by both sides.  That is what we must keep in mind.  Protecting the lives and property of foreigners is one thing. Those are the grounds on which the Belgians claimed they had a right to re-enter and those are the grounds on which the United Nations are now asking the Belgians to retire and allow outsiders with no past to come in. I know this is a matter for the United Nations, but it is a serious matter. We will be there merely to carry out police work at certain points.  In a country as large as this the United Nations Force would be like a drop in the ocean.  I presume it will be centred around towns and ports.  In my opinion nine-tenths of that country is just as primitive to-day as it was 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>If men wanted to back out of this Force and return home, could they do so?  I know there will be no shortage of volunteers.  I would have a go myself if I had not other responsibilities. In life there are only a few exciting periods in which, whether there is a risk or not, you take a chance.  Priority should be given to single men and men who know French.  Those are administrative matters.  We ought to consider this question of giving the Force a name and we should be very careful about what is involved.</P>

      <P>If the Government feel that the Irish troops are being used, or attempted to be used, for a purpose other than that for which they were sent out, have the Government <Col N="1889" /> the right to withdraw this Force? I think we are perfectly right in acting up to our responsibilities as a member of the United Nations.  It would be disastrous to leave things as they are.</P>

      <P>When this country applied for membership of the United Nations and was accepted, we signed a Charter and accepted certain commitments to be carried out on request by the United Nations.  As the Taoiseach said, this Government wish to honour their obligations under the U.N. Charter.  I believe the majority of the members of this House are anxious to honour their obligations, but I must confess to a feeling of amazement when I hear this Government worrying about keeping their word in regard to this Charter.  Only three years ago this very Government, members of which played an active part in preparing the Charter of Human Rights, was the very first Government in Europe to flout the terms of that Charter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I have to say about it.  This House is rightly going to honour its obligations in this regard once the request was made by the Secretary-General of U.N.O.  However, we would want to be a lot clearer in our minds as to the task which lies ahead of this Irish contingent.  I doubt very much if the Government, in their exuberance and flamboyancy, have given full consideration to the implications of this decision.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to the comments of the Taoiseach with regard to his version of what has led up to this situation in the Congo at the moment. He pointed out that the date on which independence was conferred on the Congo was the 1st July, 1960, but he gave far too brief a description of what led up to it.  I should like to quote from a statement made in this House by Deputy Gerald Boland on 4th July, 1956, in reference to the Congo and other such states in his contribution to the debate on External Affairs.  He said:</P>
      <P>These people in Western Europe have been exploiting the people of Africa for centuries.  Western Europe has been enriched by loot extracted from Africa by Britain and other countries of Western Europe.  That has got to stop.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>If these people continue to act like that they will have the whole of Africa and Asia against the Western States.</P>
      <P>The reason I quote that statement is that I congratulated Deputy Boland on it when he made it.  His statement was a prophecy and he was quite correct.  It would appear that the Belgian Government decided, quite recently, to give independence to the Congo.  We know that in January, 1959, the King of Belgium and the Belgian Government decided on independence for the Congo and we know that the date of that independence was July, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted by the Belgian Government that between January, 1959, <Col N="1891" /> and July, 1960, nothing whatever was done by them to prepare the way for freedom.  I am satisfied, and I think there is no denying it, that not one responsible African was put alongside a Belgian to be trained for any function of Government or administration. Nothing of importance was handed over by the Belgian Government or the Congo companies to the Congolese. The Congo is as large as Europe and in that entire vast State there are only 16 University graduates of Congolese extraction; there are only 12 senior civil servants of Congolese extraction.  Not one police or one army officer, since the Congo has been in the possession of Belgium, has been a Congolese.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that 18 months elapsed from the time it was decided to grant independence to the Congo and the actual date of independence, no steps were taken to train any officer of Congolese nationality for the army or police force.  Is it not startling to find that a nation such as Belgium has deliberately brought about this position of chaos in a newly born state?  We must remember that big business has a lot to do with the troubles in the Congo at the moment.  The Congo companies have a history that goes very far back and that is anything but good.  It is a history that has a close connection with Ireland inasmuch as it was an Irishman who exposed the atrocities of these people, people whom we are now sending our troops to protect.</P>
    <P>I think all Ireland has deep sympathy with the women and children who have been caught up in this turmoil. Everything possible must be done to protect these women and children but I have grave doubts if it is the function of an Irish battalion to move into the Congo to protect Belgian property.  That is what I want the Taoiseach to clarify.  Is the function of the Irish contingent which we propose to send out to be of a police nature? Whom are they to protect?  Are they going as friends of the Congolese or as neutrals?  We have got no clarification of those questions from the Taoiseach this evening.  We are very anxious to beat the drum and make a <Col N="1892" /> big show.  We are very anxious to jump into the bog and then, when we are in it up to our knees, we start wondering how we are to get out.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will clarify those matters because we have the situation now that a very important province, Katanga, has declared its independence of the Congo and the Premier of that part of the country has stated that under no circumstances will he have anything to do with the remainder of the country.  That is one of the wealthiest portions of the Congo and it is a place where the Congo companies also have their finger in the pie.  Which does the Irish contingent fight for if there is trouble between the Katanga Province and the Congo itself?</P>
    <P>When we let our contingent go they will come immediately under the control of the General of the United Nations and we shall have no further say with regard to their use.  I think we shall require much more knowledge of how they are to be used if disturbance arises between the Congo Government and the Katanga Government. It would be a tragedy if the good name of Ireland were to be misrepresented in this matter.  If we are to act as neutrals in this matter we may bring the fire of both sides on us.  There should be no doubt that our sympathies are with the Congolese and I believe it is they who need protection and help.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has referred to the fact that the Government have been considering permanent legislation which would enable them to send our permanent Defence Forces outside the State.  I am sure that comes as news to many Deputies.  I am rather disturbed at hearing the Taoiseach say that this measure, which is only a temporary one, will be replaced, possibly, before the six months elapse, by permanent legislation.  Is it envisaged, on that basis, that this contingent of 500 or 600 may be in the Congo for the next 12 months or two years?  Is that his feeling when he suggests that this permanent legislation will come in before the temporary legislation lapses?  That is the impression I get&mdash;that their stay will be very prolonged. <Col N="1893" /> On the question of personnel, I have talked with a number of officers and they are straining at the leash.  Practically the entire Army, as far as I can see, has volunteered for service.  That is a very healthy sign of the young men in the Army.  It also pinpoints the fact that they are all anxious to get away from the sheer boredom of the barrack square, the drill room and manoeuvres in the country.  We should consider at this stage how many men we can afford to send&mdash;and not in terms of finance.  The Minister for Defence is in the House and I am sure he is in a position to give the strength of the Army.  My information, over a number of years, is that the Army is short of troops to carry out the normal functions of a peacetime Army, fatigue duties, protection work, maintenance of barracks and, at the same time, to keep the field companies up to a certain strength.  While we have been short of troops all along we have never been short of officers.  My recollection is that for every five or six men in the Army we have an officer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that in dealing with this matter it would <Col N="1894" /> be a little late to raise it when the Defence Estimate comes up next year. If we are to send a battalion to the Congo we must consider the increased duties that will be imposed on the troops left behind.  Deputy Noel Lemass made a suggestion, with which I do not agree, that a contingent of the F.C.A. should be sent with the Army to the Congo.  Instead, immedate steps should be taken by the Minister to bring in the F.C.A. on permanent service to replace the existing personnel who will be going abroad.  It is absolutely essential to do that because of the burden that will be placed on the unfortunate troops remaining behind.</P>
      <P>I should like the Taoiseach to elaborate on this very important point made, I think, by Deputy Russell and other Deputies&mdash;what exactly are the functions that our contingent will be expected to perform in the Congo? How can we have some say or control over that contingent in the event of its being used for purposes that this House did not envisage when permission was being given to send them abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reinforce some of the points made by other Deputies.  I am very glad that this procedure has to be adopted under the Constitution by which the Government must come to the Dáil before allowing troops to go abroad for service. I am with Deputy McQuillan in that I should like to hear more from the Taoiseach.  Would the Taoiseach expand the reference he made to the introduction of permanent legislation to allow the sending of troops abroad as a matter of course?  Does he mean that he wants to take away from us the Constitutional right which we appear to have at present of considering the circumstances of each occasion on which it is likely that troops may be sent from Ireland to take part in police or other operations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this is an ideal procedure and I hope it is not the intention of the Government to depart from it or depart from the principle that our soldiers or service men should not have to take part in an operation of <Col N="1895" /> any kind abroad other than one sanctioned by Dáil Eireann.  With an inspiration lacking in so many other organisations at the formation of the State, our forces were well named &ldquo;Defence Forces.&rdquo; For that reason I think they should retain that overall implication that they should not be used as forces for offensive action.  I hope power will not be taken from the Dáil to decide each issue as it arises.  I could envisage a Government coming into power here which might have quite different views from those of the present Government on political or military matters generally and if this power were taken away from the Dáil it might be vested in a Government or in a Minister of a Government in such a way as to allow them to act without the consent of the Dáil and embroil us in obligations of a nature which might not be in accordance with the wishes of the people.</P>
    <P>Taking the present context of international political and world affairs generally into account, I think it would be a most dangerous development and I sincerely hope that it is not one that the Taoiseach has in mind.  Probably the Taoiseach is aware that this is a desperately serious situation and serious, it seems to me, at any rate not only from the complications which he envisages in the quotations he gave from the U.N. Secretary General's report regarding the likelihood of the development of internal political troubles in the Congo, the resolution of which we cannot begin to guess at&mdash;particularly with our own rather bitter experience of such problems.</P>
    <P>It also seems to me that there is the very much greater problem in the Congo at the moment that concerns the very delicate and dangerous relations existing between East and West in relation to the Congo.  I am rather concerned about both aspects of this affair at present.  Broadly, we are glad to see&mdash;personally, I am delighted to see&mdash;pictures of the white people fleeing from Africa.  I am glad I have lived to see that day.  It is about time that they got out.  It is <Col N="1896" /> their own fault that they waited to be hunted out.</P>
    <P>I want to re-emphasise that, as far as I am concerned, any soldiers of ours going out there should go out completely dedicated to the principle that they are sent to these countries to preserve the rights of the natives in those countries, the African people, and we do not give two damns for the Belgian interests except on the humanitarian grounds of the women and children, as mentioned by Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Sherwin; nor are we concerned with the preservation of the rights of any of the financial interests concerned in the exploitation, the rape and loot of the Congo which has gone on for 100 years and more by the mining corporations and the great financial houses, or the invested capital of the various countries, as well as the Belgians; that we are not interested in preserving that kind of property or the rights of that kind of property; that we are, if anything, simply concerned with the transfer of all those rights to their rightful owners, the people of the Congo, and that we shall not be used or allow ourselves to be used or allow our troops to be used as a pawn in the game that is going on at the present time with the great financial interests concerned with the attempted forcible secession of the Katanga Province which is of such vital interest to the whole future prosperity, security and social and political welfare of the whole of the Congo.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the Taoiseach or the Government can preserve this attitude in regard to the whole of the Congo with our tiny force sent forward now under the control of a soldier over whom we have not any control but I think that we are facing a very dangerous situation. I think that the suggestion made by Deputy Corish is a good one, that there must be some political liaison officer, a diplomat, sent with our soldiers so that they will be in a position to try to assess this terribly complicated internal problem which is likely to result from the proposed secession of Katanga from the rest of the Congo. <Col N="1897" /> Obviously without any bitterness or any attempt to revive bitterness, I would ask Deputies here who were so deeply involved in the instance of our own country only 40 years ago, to think of a united force coming over here and attempting to mediate between the different factions at that time, those in the North-East and those down here, regrettably divided as they were at the time and to think then of asking that force to carry out police action on behalf of the Government. Which Government?  To whom would such a force have owed loyalty at that time&mdash;the people in the North, or which side in the civil war?</P>
    <P>It must be clear to all of us that these soldiers are going into an extremely difficult situation and I do not think it is quite fair to allow them to do so with their limited military knowledge&mdash;of an extremely high level, no doubt, and they are extremely competent, no doubt; but they are in no way equipped or educated to deal with the likely situation which could arise, as Deputy Sherwin suggested, should a civil war develop over the question of the right of Katanga to secede.</P>
    <P>We know the consequences of the secession of our own very important industrial arm 30 to 40 years ago. Quite clearly, it is the device of the Belgians to attempt to create a similar situation in the Congo.  What are our soldiers going to do placed in a situation of that kind?  What will be our position should the colonial or the settler element in the Security Council preponderate in the deliberations as to the action to be taken in relation to the Congo, whether Katanga should be permitted to secede or not, and in that way completely castrate the whole freedom movement in the Congo if they were permitted to do so?  What action are we to take if the Security Council and the General appointed to control our forces decide that this secession would be tolerated or permitted?  Should the settler influence in the Security Council dominate, are we to go along with them?  Are we to feel that whatever obligations we have to the United Nations do not permit us to withdraw our forces in that event?  I should like <Col N="1898" /> to join with Deputy Russell in asking the Taoiseach to please answer that question.  Could a situation arise in which we would have to withdraw our forces?  If a question of this kind arose in the Security Council and a Russian veto were imposed, which side do we take?  Are we to allow the attitude which has been prevalent over such a long time in relation to Russia, that anything Russia does is wrong, to dominate our decision should we be faced with a problem arising out of the Katanga position?  Will the Government be prepared to act with Russia should the occasion arise and will they be prepared to withdraw our force rather than allow ourselves to become the tool or the instrument of the financial interests concerned in preserving their illgotten, misbegotten, evilly begotten rights in the Katanga Province?</P>
    <P>There is a second issue involved here also.  I have always felt that one of the difficulties in talking about foreign affairs in the Dáil is that one always talks in the shadow of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle;</i> one feels one has no right to comment on things which concern large Powers, that one can be tossed aside as a small nation without being allowed any say.  For the first time, that is no longer so. Because of our special position, we have now whether we like it or not, to play a part in world affairs and the colonial countries such as America, Britain, France and Russia have been excluded from taking an active part in the sending of forces abroad.  That still leaves us with the fact that there is a great global struggle which is to a certain extent between the East and West, between Russia and America, which is to a certain extent now being centred on this struggle in the Congo.</P>
    <P>I am completely ignorant of the finer points involved except to know broadly, as the Taoiseach said, from Press reports, that such a struggle is taking place.  It is very important that we should continue to maintain our position of neutrality in this struggle and that, in this present dangerous situation, we do not allow ourselves to be drawn into one or other side by any mistaken act on the part of this <Col N="1899" /> force which we are sending to the Congo.  For that reason, again, it is imperative that the Taoiseach should seriously consider sending out some form of political diplomatic liaison officer who will be in a position to keep him informed of every internal matter to which he referred but also to these other matters which are referred to in the public Press at the present time, that is, the struggle between Russia and America as it relates to the Congo.</P>
    <P>I saw recently, putting it more particularly, the fact that Russia has objected to 20 American troops being in Leopoldville.  The fact that this proposal to send the security force to the Congo was passed without a veto is an advance for the United Nations. I welcome the decision that such a force should be sent and I wish it well. However, there has been this nominal or superficial goodwill, or whatever you like to call it but it is very effective goodwill, leading towards the general idea that this colonial Power should be hunted out of the Congo and that it should be replaced by a Government native to the country.  Are we to any extent exacerbating the difficult feelings that exist between the Americans and the Russians on this issue? Are we likely to lend ourselves in any way to such exacerbation?</P>
    <P>Arising out of that, I should like to ask the Taoiseach if there is any truth in the suggestion that our troops are to travel in American Globemaster aeroplanes.  It may be a very insignificant aspect of the whole matter but I was surprised to see that the Russians objected to the presence of just 20 American soldiers in Leopoldville.  I have no doubt that the Americans would object to 20 Russian soldiers there.  If it is true that our troops are to be transported in American aircraft would the Taoiseach not consider the advisability of transporting them in our own aircraft?  That may not be possible but there must be an alternative to transporting them in American aircraft, say, Swedish aircraft or aircraft of some other nation which might not be involved in this great global struggle that would enable us to keep <Col N="1900" /> far away from these two great poles of power and dissension as the Minister for External Affairs has done so creditably over the months in the United Nations.  We should maintain that stand as far as we can in future.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling of the greatest perturbation about the sending forward of these troops but I do not think we have any alternative.  Going on their record in the Middle East, I am certain they will be a great credit to our country but I should like to be certain that they will not inadvertently, through no fault of their own or through some failure on our part, stumble into some dilemma or some crisis which we can prevent arising by equipping them properly with political or diplomatic advisers, advisers who will be able to steer them on the proper paths.  These are our own people and we have the right to protect them in a very dangerous situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach, although I know it is an unpredictable situation, if he has taken every possible precaution to preserve, first of all, our position of absolute sympathy with, and our anxiety, for the emergent people of the African Continent, and to preserve our right to debate in the Dáil each issue for the sending of troops abroad as it arises.  Whether it is in Africa or in Europe there are situations in which many of us would most vehemently and strongly protest against the sending out of our forces on a side of which we do not approve. We should reserve that right to the House to debate these issues on each and every occasion so that we will be in a position to consider the advisability of withdrawal in certain circumstances and so that our non-involvement in the East-West conflict will be preserved at all costs.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy Corish asked some very proper questions regarding the functions of the United Nations Force in the Congo and the probable duration of the period in which it will be necessary to keep it there.  It appears to be necessary to restate that the United Nations Force is going into the Congo at the urgent request of the Government <Col N="1901" /> of the Congo.  That fact, I think, answers very many of the questions which Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Browne have asked.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have agreed to send a contingent to join that United Nations Force in the Congo on the clear understanding that the function of the force there will be, as has been stated by the Security Council of the United Nations and the Secretary General, solely to protect life and property and to preserve order, and that it will not be used in any circumstances for the resolution of any political problems arising in the Congo.  Deputy Russell's question can, of course, be answered in the affirmative.  It is, I suppose, inconceivable that the United Nations would propose to use the force in the Congo for any purpose other than those I have stated but if it should happen we would, of course, be free to withdraw our contingent without delay.</P>
      <P>As regards the duration of operations, the time in which it may be necessary to keep a United Nations Force in the Congo or an Irish contingent in the force, it is difficult to give a precise answer.  We have asked of the Secretary General of the United Nations for his estimate of the probable duration of the period in which a United Nations Force in the Congo will be required.  The understanding is that the United Nations Force which went there at the request of the Government of the Congo will stay there for so long as the Government of the Congo think it necessary to have it there for the preservation of order.  The Secretary-General of the United Nations did not feel that he should attempt to forecast how long that may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the question as to how long it may be regarded as necessary by the Government of the Congo to retain the United Nations Force there, it would clearly not be practicable for us to undertake to keep our unit with the force for a protracted period.  We understand that the <Col N="1902" /> Swedish Government have indicated that their contingent would stay there for one month subject to reconsideration of their decision to have a contingent with the force at the end of that period.  It is clear that the Government of Sweden is holding itself free to reconsider its decision as circumstances develop.  If any circumstances should arise which would prompt the Government of Sweden to withdraw its contingent from the United Nations Force in the Congo, it is a fair assumption that the very same circumstances would cause us to take a similar decision.</P>
    <P>We can express the hope that the need for the retention of the force in the Congo will be for only a very short period.  Deputy Corish said rightly that none of us is sufficiently informed about the situation to make a proper appreciation of it.  That is, of course, perfectly correct but I do not think we should regard ourselves as being under any obligation to make that appreciation. Literally, the position is that the United Nations Organisation has decided to meet the request of the Government of the Congo to send this contingent for as long as the Government of the Congo thinks necessary, and as loyal members of the United Nations we are co-operating in that decision of the Security Council in the manner they have requested.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the force will consist of approximately 650 men in all, including officers and N.C.O.s, medical personnel and other necessary units of one kind or another.  The force will consist entirely of members of the permanent Army.  It is quite impracticable to utilise for this purpose members of the Volunteer Forces.  The force will be transported to the Congo in planes provided by the United Nations for that purpose.  It is hoped and expected that the contingent will move out on Wednesday next.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick asked about responsibility for payment of compensation in the case of soldiers who may suffer injury or illness.  As far as compensation is concerned, the Irish Government will take care of it in the first instance but will present claims later to the United Nations for recoupment. <Col N="1903" /> As far as members of the force are concerned, they are guaranteed by the Irish Government compensation in accordance with the Army Acts.  It must be remembered that our Army Acts do not provide for compensation in respect of death or disability due to illness.  That is because it is assumed that the circumstances under which soldiers serve here do not warrant a provision of that kind.  We contemplate in this instance, however, that the amendment of these Army Pensions Acts will be necessary to provide that soldiers serving in such a force will be entitled to compensation for death or disability due to illness contracted on service.  The necessary legislation for that purpose will be introduced in the autumn session and the soldiers concerned are being made aware of the intention to enact such legislation.</P>

However, I think the House would like an assurance that, in this short time, it will be possible to take all the necessary prophylactic measures to ensure the safety of the troops in a tropical climate.  I would be glad of an assurance that this aspect has been considered.

      <P>As Deputies are aware, it is customary for the Taoiseach on this Estimate, which affords the final opportunity for debate on Government policy in this session, to give, in general outline, a review of the state of the national economy, to refer to outstanding developments in the previous year, and to attempt to forecast, so far as is wise and practicable, economic trends in the year ahead.  I propose now to adhere to that practice notwithstanding certain views I expressed here last year relative to a more suitable time for attempting such a review.  The statement I shall make will be mainly factual and will, as usual, be highly accurate.  I cannot undertake that it will be entirely non-contentious, although contention will not be the object of the statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the past year the Government programme of economic expansion was applied with all vigour.  Most of the legislative measures and administrative arrangements which were foreshadowed in it are in operation.  The Government are now occupied with new plans and proposals which were not elaborated in the programme published in 1958.  For example, legislation which was indicated in a subsequent White Paper published by the Government in which we set forth our decisions upon recommendations embodied in the report of the Agricultural Marketing Committee has yet to be submitted for the consideration of the Dáil.  Proposals bearing upon the development of our sea fisheries are at present before the Government. Other proposals designed to facilitate the country's rate of economic expansion are also being formulated and may involve legislation for the consideration of the Dáil later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated on former occasions that the programme of economic expansion <Col N="1909" /> was not intended to be, and would not be allowed to become a strait-jacket of any kind; that it set forth minimum targets only; and that if, as we believed, a greater rate of expansion was found to be possible, there would be no hesitation or delay in trying to achieve it.  During 1959, external payments on current account showed a deficit which is now estimated at £8.7 millions.  That was much less than I forecast this time last year.  The improvement was due to a very noticeable and very satisfactory upward trend in the country's economic progress in the second half of the year.</P>
    <P>The 1959 deficit on current account was clearly more than covered by an inflow of external funds on capital account and indeed the external monetary reserves of the Central and commercial banks, and of Government Funds, had increased by the end of the year by £4.3 millions.  The external trade position in this year to date is better than last year.  For the first six months of the year the import excess was £4,000,000 less than in 1959.  There is, therefore, clearly no cause for anxiety at this time in regard to external payments.  We do not anticipate that any surplus will emerge in the year but a serious deficit is now highly improbable.</P>
    <P>The object of Government policy, as has been frequently stated, is to raise the level of economic activity in all sectors and success in that purpose must involve a higher level of imports, particularly of equipment and raw materials, although some important new industries to produce industrial equipment have been, and are being set up.  If, therefore, the balance on external payments which now seems to be established, is to be maintained when a higher all-round level of economic activity has been realised, then clearly the drive for expansion of exports must continue and must succeed.  It is only by exports of one kind or another, including invisible exports, as they are called, like tourist receipts, that we can earn the resources required to enable payment to be made for necessary imports without pulling down our financial reserves.</P>
    <P>I think all Deputies are aware that <Col N="1910" /> this country is not without reserves and capital coming in from abroad may cover the cost of some imports of equipment but, nevertheless, we can be sure that progress will continue on a sound basis if, and only if, we can keep the country's external payments in balance.  That, therefore, is an important aim of Government policy. As I said before, and I repeat again, we do not wish to do more than that. We do not see any national purpose to be served at this time by seeking to add to the country's external financial reserves.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered, certainly by Deputies opposite, that in the years 1955 and 1956 a heavy deficit developed on external payments, a deficit which has to be financed by drawing down these reserves and, very particularly, drawing down the external assets of the commercial banks.  That created a situation which threatened the continued viability of the State. To cope with that situation the then Government imposed restrictions on imports in the form of special import levies which, together with the credit and hire-purchase restrictions applied at that time, operated to reduce the effective internal demand.  A balance upon external payment was eventually achieved by these means but only after the level of economic activity within the country had been very drastically lowered.  In effect it meant that the country's standard of living was reduced, but the experience of that time showed that the consequences were not felt equally by all individuals and all classes.  Indeed, the main burden was borne by workers who lost their employment, and I refer to that fact for the purpose of emphasising that it is very important in the particular interests of wage-earners that a similar situation should never be allowed to recur if it is within our power to stop it.</P>
    <P>Between the first quarter of 1956 and the first quarter of 1957 the average weekly number of workers in paid employment fell by over 50,000, from 581,900 in 1956, to 531,500 in 1957, and the total national income and the country's industrial output had also fallen substantially before the <Col N="1911" /> situation was rectified.  It cannot be said, I think, that all the detrimental consequences of the measures taken during that period had been fully repaired by the end of 1959, but in the main the tasks of recovery had been completed by then and the nation's economic progress had been resumed.</P>
    <P>The total industrial output of transportable goods has since increased substantially and, indeed, in 1959 was the highest ever recorded, the output index number rising from 105 to 115. Recovery in the industrial sector was not at a uniform rate in all the main industrial groups, though it may be that non-economic factors were operating in some instances as, for example, in the case of tobacco.  Every industrial group, however, increased output in 1959 as compared with 1958.</P>
    <P>The most significant increases were recorded in three industrial groups, the metal and engineering group, the chemicals group and the mines and quarries group, and a measure of our industrial progress is found in the fact that in the financial year 1959-60 the units of electricity produced by the E.S.B. were higher by 10.4 per cent. than in the previous year.  Deputies who remember old discussions in that connection will be interested in that statistic. In the two previous years the rate of increase was 7 per cent.  In 1959 also current national savings at £63,000,000, and domestic capital formation at £100,000,000, were also the highest ever recorded.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, be aware from reports which have been given to them from time to time that progress has been mainly in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy.  To some extent that was to have been expected because it was in non-agricultural activities of all kinds that national development had been most retarded and where the scope for expansion was greatest.  Agricultural output, however, was adversely affected by exceptional weather conditions in both 1958 and 1959, a substantial fall in the output of crops and turf in 1958, due to bad harvest weather, being followed by a drought in 1959 which reduced <Col N="1912" /> milk yields.  The agricultural net output index number was 95.7 for 1958 and 100.9 for 1959 as compared with 108.1 for 1957.</P>
    <P>Agricultural policy and conditions have been discussed in the Dáil in the past few sitting days on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  I have no desire, and I am sure Deputies will not wish me, to cover the same ground again.  I hope that Deputies will not avail of my restraint to allege that that is due to any lack of appreciation of the overriding importance of agriculture in the country.</P>
    <P>The main point that I am making is that, notwithstanding these adverse conditions affecting agriculture, the fact that total real national income increased in 1959 by three and a half per cent. must be regarded as very encouraging indeed.  That increase took place in conditions of relative price stability.  The cost of living index number has remained virtually unchanged since the beginning of 1958. Judging by statements which I have seen attributed to some Deputies opposite, not all of them seem to have grasped either that fact or its significance and importance.  It looks now as if the continuous inflation, the fall in the value of money due to rising prices, which bedevilled our economic progress since 1947 has at last been arrested.  We must not, however, get over-confident or drop our guard.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer said during the course of the past few days that inflation is likely to remain Britain's main economic enemy for the next decade.  Because of the intimate trade and financial relations between this country and Britain, British inflation is our enemy also.  We have therefore a very lively interest in the measures adopted by the British Government and applied in Britain to check it.  Although inflation seems to be under control here now, we know that our defences are inadequate against inflation imported from Britain if the British measures to check it are not effective.  If our progress&mdash;and I mean real progress and not merely an inflation of the money value of our output and earnings&mdash;is to go ahead, it is <Col N="1913" /> essential that we should avoid courses here which might start the inflationary process spiralling again.</P>
    <P>The employment position has continued to improve.  The total number in paid employment this year seems much higher than last year.  In the first quarter&mdash;and it is only in respect of the first quarter that the figures relating to the sales of social insurance stamps are yet available&mdash;the weekly average number in employment was running about 20,000 higher than in the same period last year.  The total number of all ages and both sexes who are described or describe themselves as occupied in agriculture, whether or not they were paid for their work, continued to decline, as in almost every year since the end of the war and in almost every European country.  As the Central Bank said in its latest Report:</P>
    <P>It is not to be anticipated however that expanding agricultural output will be accompanied by a substantial increase in labour engaged in that branch of activity.  A movement away from rural occupations into other activities is common to all developing countries and it would seem improbable that Ireland will prove to be an exception to this trend.</P>
    <P>I think it is correct to say that that view of the country's economic prospects has been generally accepted on all sides of the House in previous discussions here.  While plans which are now being applied or discussed to achieve expansion in horticulture, fruit-growing and fisheries may, and indeed could very well change this pattern, and while those who are associated with these plans and developments have expressed very optimistic estimates of employment possibilities, they are likely for a number of reasons to develop gradually. It seems obvious that for the time being the achievement of conditions of full employment and reduced emigration depends on success in expanding other activities, particularly on the development of our manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>To the extent that the elimination <Col N="1914" /> of unemployment and emigration are the immediate goals of national endeavour, it is the measure of industrial expansion at the present time which records our progress towards them.  In industry progress has been considerable and promises to become even better.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave some information on that situation in his statement on his Estimate.  In Irish circumstances the growth of industrial expansion is popularly measured by the number of new factories set up, although that is a very incorrect and very inaccurate yardstick.  The most important aspect of industrial production now taking place is the expansion of the output of existing concerns, and it is that which last year brought total industrial output to a record level and which boosted the national income level.</P>
    <P>However, using that yardstick and taking as a factory a manufacturing concern in which a minimum of £10,000 has been invested, the position is that in the 12 months to June 30th, 88 new undertakings or extensions to existing undertakings, which were equivalent to new undertakings, came into production involving a total investment of £4,000,000.  There are at present 34 new factories or similar extensions in course of construction involving a total investment on completion of £13,750,000.  There are a further 40 new undertakings for which all arrangements are completed or where factory construction is about to begin involving a total investment of £10,000,000.  The producers' estimates of the number of new jobs to be created in all these new concerns amount to 13,000, rising to that figure from an initial recruitment of 9,000.</P>
    <P>Of the additional investment in manufacturing industry of £27,000,000, which all these new enterprises represent, approximately £4,250,000 is on public as distinct from private account, notably the Irish Steel extension plans and the Irish Sugar Company's new enterprises in processed vegetables and fruit.  That is in accord with the Government's policy of using public enterprise to supplement private enterprise which has been an outstanding <Col N="1915" /> feature of Irish industrial development.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to promote undertakings of that kind, that is to say, new developments as State projects wherever they may be practicable and wherever our assumption is that private enterprise is unlikely to succeed.  There is an encouragingly large number of proposals for new undertakings in industry under discussion which involve important developments.  It is right to assume that not all will materialise and that not all which materialise will be successful but most will.  The accelerating rate of industrial expansion gives every justification for optimism.  I have no desire to exaggerate what has been accomplished but I think it is important that it should not be minimised either. The capital outlay involved and the improved employment prospects created are certain to have beneficial consequences on other economic activities, including agriculture and should, and we hope will, set in motion a chain reaction of expansion.</P>
    <P>It is worthy of note that almost all these new industries are planned for the export trade.  Protection for the home market is not being sought or desired by them.  The majority of these new undertakings are being promoted by Irish interests.  That has been, and probably always will be the case, and it is desirable for many good reasons that it should be so.  There is, however, an increasing number of new projects being proposed by external firms or by external firms in association with Irish interests.  We welcome that development.  It would be difficult to establish the rate of expansion which we need here without greater success in our efforts to encourage firms from abroad contemplating new developments to select Ireland as the location for them.</P>
    <P>In the highly competitive external markets of the world success cannot be won by amateurs.  External firms which can bring with them technical experience and, particularly, established market connections give us <Col N="1916" /> prospects of industrial expansion which we could never realise ourselves.  The advantages of Irish locations for manufacturing enterprises and the value of the inducements being offered by the Government are becoming more widely known throughout the world as is evidenced by the greatly increased interest in them now being displayed.</P>
    <P>Last year an attempt was made in a section of the British Press to start something of a scarce over the association of Japanese interests with a couple of Irish undertakings and more recently some articles were published, and it is only fair to say that they were not all unfavourable, commenting on German association of some of these new activities.  I suppose we must expect that and I do not think we need pay too much attention to it. I should make it quite clear that we welcome firms from abroad who bring with them some industrial opportunity which we could not have won for ourselves. We are concerned more with their competence and prospects of success than with their nationality.</P>
    <P>I have said that the great majority of the new undertakings are being promoted by Irish firms.  That fact requires to be emphasised in view of the natural tendency, even in our own Irish newspapers, to give more publicity to the advent of a new concern sponsored by external interests than to a concern sponsored solely by Irish interests. I have endeavoured as far as possible to ascertain the external associations of new undertakings, when such seem to exist, and the order of importance appears to be first, American, and then British, German, Dutch and French in that order with a smaller number of enterprises with associations in Italy, Sweden, and Japan.  In all instances, and I have had the opportunity of personal discussion with the promoters in many cases, there is confidence that Irish productivity, aided by Government policy and linked with competent technical direction, can beat the world.  It can be hoped that they will.</P>
    <P>As a result of these developments living standards have improved, which is the aim of all economic endeavour. Earlier in this year, in a previous discussion, <Col N="1917" /> I expressed some anxiety about the effect of recent wage rates upon the cost of living.  That anxiety has since been in very large measure relieved. Although some price increases were inevitable&mdash;and some more may occur &mdash;the overall picture is not at all unsatisfactory. Partly because of favourable import prices but mainly because of higher productivity, no rise has taken place in the general cost of living.  The cost of living index figure in mid-May was, in fact, one point less than it was in mid-May, 1959.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have studied the statistics supplied to them will have noticed that industrial output is rising much faster than industrial employment. That adds up to increased productivity but we need not be too complacent or self-congratulatory about it.  It has been the universal experience so widespread as to be regarded as an economic law, that in times of expansion, output rises more rapidly than employment.  In times of depression the opposite happens and output falls more rapidly than employment.  An expanding economy is always the more competitive.  That is not merely true of national economies as a whole but it is true of individual commercial concerns as well.</P>
    <P>It is a lesson which some Irish industrialists have yet to learn.  The firm which is continuously striving for expansion is always more competitive than the firm which is content to mark time.  The tendency of a few, and there are still some, Irish industrial concerns assisted by tariffs to establish a satisfactory and profitable level of operations, and to go no further is always detrimental to their continued efficiency.  Efficiency is the reward of continuous striving for expansion.  It has been said that no country can sit on its posterior and slide downhill into prosperity.  I think that is true of individual commercial concerns also.</P>
    <P>However, having said that, I think it is only fair to all the enterprising and progressive Irish manufacturers to state the extent to which they are rising to their opportunities and meeting the national need.  There has been in recent months a striking&mdash;I do not <Col N="1918" /> think it is inaccurate to use the word &ldquo;spectacular&rdquo;&mdash;increase in industrial exports.  Over the five-year period from 1955 to 1959, increases in the value of exports of over 100 per cent. were recorded in respect of electrical machinery, wool yarns, knitwear, footwear, leather, glass, metal manufactures, jute yarn, cement and agricultural machinery. Even more striking increases were made in the case of rubber manufactures, which increased during that period by more than 500 per cent.; by cordage and ropes which also increased by over 500 per cent. and by furniture exports which increased by over 600 per cent.  The most spectacular of all was the increase in the export of outer-wear garments over that period which was nearly 1000 per cent.</P>
    <P>Exports of manufactured goods, excluding foodstuffs, drink and tobacco, scrap and industrial waste were valued at £13,523,000 in 1955.  They fell to £13,176,000 in 1956; they rose to £17,700,000 in 1957.  They rose again to £18,008,000 in 1958 and then they jumped to £24,522,000 in 1959 and they are still rising.  Exports of manufactured goods to date this year are runing approximately 80 per cent. higher than in the corresponding period of last year.</P>
    <P>Reference to these rapidly growing exports of ours brings into consideration international circumstances affecting our trade expansion prospects. The position is still overshadowed by uncertainty as to what may happen in Western Europe.  The rift in the economic relations of west-European countries will, if it persists, involve consequences which are at present incalculable. I must say that there are at present no signs that the rift will be speedily healed and there are indeed some indications to the contrary.  It is true that there are signs that some reassessment of former conclusions is proceeding in some European capitals and the tendency to hold less rigidly to positions previously taken up so as to make a general European arrangement less difficult of realisation has been given impetus by the collapse of the Summit conference and the subsequent deterioration in international relations, but it would not be sensible or realistic <Col N="1919" /> to expect any early, major developments.</P>
    <P>In the light of this situation what is the wisest course for us?  While we are keeping in very close touch with events both through our membership of the Special Committee on Trade which was set up at the beginning of the year, and through our diplomatic representatives in the various European capitals, it is our present view that because of our special circumstances it is not in our interests to seek unduly to intrude our particular problem into the discussions which are going on or to press now for a precise definition of our future relations with the Six or the Seven or, indeed, to take any course which might possibly be regarded by either group or by any member of either group as discouraging to their hopes or contrary to their interests.</P>
    <P>Spokesmen of both the Six and the Seven groups have expressed their understanding of the problems arising from this situation for this country and for other European countries which are not members of either group and assurances have been given that they will be taken into consideration in any changes which may be discussed.  I am certain&mdash;and in this matter it is necessary to rely upon personal conclusions&mdash;that we are not losing any advantage by not seeking, fussily, to get our prospects clarified at this stage.  We are sustained in that decision by the realisation that no difficulties affecting our trade have yet arisen or are likely to arise soon and that as of now&mdash;as of to-day&mdash; we are better circumstanced in regard to our western European trade than any of the other countries concerned by reason of the reaffirmation, in the circumstances of this year, of the special trade relationship expressed in our agreement with Great Britain and that in respect of more than 90 per cent. of our exports to the west European region, we have tariff-free access to the markets which matter to us.</P>
    <P>The British Trade Agreement is, as I have previously described it, the keystone of our external trade structure and in anything which may <Col N="1920" /> emerge from discussions about European trade or in the development of these European trade groups, the preservation of the chief characteristics of that Agreement must be a main objective of our policy.</P>
    <P>Another main objective must be to secure access, if possible, to agricultural markets in Western Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our exports to Western Europe, other than to Britain, are predominantly to the countries of the Six and not to the other countries of the Seven in the proportion of seven to two.  That is an important factor in our thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the rift between the Six and Seven continues, these aims which I have stated&mdash;on the one hand, the preservation of our special trade relations with Britain and on the other hand securing access to European agricultural markets&mdash;are, to some extent, in conflict with each other. Unless the present <i>impasse</i> can be broken and trade arrangements between all the members of the O.E.E.C. can be organised on a western European regional basis which includes agriculture the danger is that the agricultural arrangements of the Six, which it is proposed should become fully effective within a period of six years, may become increasingly protective in their character.  Having regard to the nature of the agricultural proposals which are under consideration by the Six and which, so far as one can judge from the indications given, are likely to be accepted in the main by them, that danger is very real notwithstanding their protestations that their aim is otherwise, and events developing in that way could have for us the double effect of penalising our exports to the markets of the Six and of intensifying competition in other markets including the British market.  These considerations support us in the conclusion which we have reached that it is in our interests and particularly in the interests of our agriculture that the rift between the Six and the Seven should be healed upon some mutually acceptable basis, including agricultural <Col N="1921" /> trade, in which non-members of either group could participate, even if, as I have said elsewhere, there is some reason to think that the present circumstances may give us the benefit of some short term impetus to our industrial expansion drive.  So far as we are concerned, therefore, we are supporting every movement which may help to promote the prospect of agreement between the Six and the Seven and are doing so primarily in the interests of our agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>We have made it known that we are prepared to agree to start the process of reducing our industrial tariffs in the context of a Western European regional arrangement in consideration of our getting access to European agricultural markets.  To be quite realistic, however, we must discount the prospect of an agreement for free trade in the full usual sense of the term in respect of agricultural products.  There are very few European countries prepared to agree to it.  Perhaps we are not even prepared to agree to it ourselves.  A managed market for agricultural products is what the Rome Treaty envisages and is the more likely prospect in a wider European arrangement should that prove to be possible and, from our viewpoint, it could prove to be the more beneficial provided circumstances develop so that we can fully participate in it.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the British Trade Agreement, to which I have made brief reference, arise also in connection with our consideration of the wisdom of joining the Gatt. Essentially, the Gatt&mdash;the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs&mdash;is a world-wide agreement for the avoidance of discriminatory practice in trade as well as a device for bringing about freer world trade.  I do not want to suggest that the character of the Gatt is static.  That is not so and, indeed, important changes in it in the early future are not improbable.  The text of the Gatt recognises and provides for the maintenance of the preferences now extended by us to Britain but there is need to clarify our future obligations in that regard if we apply for membership.  Discussions to that end have been in progress and they <Col N="1922" /> will be resumed in the very early future.</P>
    <P>This is a matter to which it is desirable to direct public opinion.  It should be understood that acceptance of the principles of the Gatt could in effect involve also a decision to forgo, except to the extent permissible under the agreement, the idea of operating discriminatory import arrangements here directed against particular countries with which we have adverse trade balances.  That idea of unilateral action against imports from some countries has from time to time been discussed here and its possible advantages must weigh in our decision.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered also that the Gatt is open to all countries&mdash;communist countries as well as democracies, countries that have highly developed State trading systems as well as free enterprise countries like our own, countries in the East as well as in the West.  It is world-wide in its scope.</P>
    <P>It is true that tariff reductions previously negotiated in the Gatt have been generally extended by most countries to our products.  One reason why we must look again at the question of joining it is that in the new circumstances that may not continue to be so.</P>
    <P>As a matter of interest, in connection with the British Trade Agreement I should mention that we have not yet received proposals from the British Government as to the order in which they wish the review of our tariffs for which the Agreement provides to be undertaken and it does not now seem likely that these reviews will commence or that the order of priority will be determined before October next.</P>
    <P>The aim of Government policy is to bring about an increase in population on the basis of full employment and reasonable living standards.  It is clear that that great aim cannot be realised easily or speedily but that is what we are trying to do and we are convinced that it is a realisable aim.  The measure of success of the economic expansion programme up to date has reinforced us in that conviction. We do not want to push ahead <Col N="1923" /> with economic development without regard to its social or other consequences. I have dealt in this statement which I am making solely with economic affairs and the more material aspects of the national situation but we have other aims also.  His Lordship the Bishop of Limerick said recently that we in this country have inherited a worthy way of life even if it needs to be modernised and brought up to date.  Like the Most Reverend Dr. Murphy, we would wish to see the main characteristics of that valuable inheritance of ours preserved as we strive ahead in economic progress. It is perhaps natural that the Government would place economic progress in the position of first importance and it is true also that the realisation of that wish to preserve the distinctive features of our way of life is less a matter for Government than for people outside the immediate circle of official administration, people whose influence and example can promote what is desired and who appreciate its importance to the happiness of our people.  In short, it is an aim for everyone to keep in mind.</P>
    <P>We have a long way to go yet before we can feel that we have broken the back of our economic difficulties.  It never has been our purpose over here to minimise the tasks to which we are committed.  We do not claim to have done as yet much more than to make an encouraging beginning but that claim I do make.  It seems clear now that we are working on right lines and with the encouragement of that understanding we can press ahead with greater confidence in our ultimate success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. I suppose there never has been a Minister of State in this country more adept that the present Taoiseach at climbing the tops of mountains, turning corners and promising paradise around every new obstacle with which he finds himself confronted.  I was familiar with that technique so long as the present Taoiseach was Minister for Industry <Col N="1924" /> and Commerce.  I have listened to it for a great many years but to-day he speaks as the head of the Government and to my way of hearing he speaks as a man who is completely out of touch with what is going on in the country for all sections of which he ought to feel himself responsible.</P>
      <P>He has spoken to-day at very considerable length on the expansion of industrial exports.  He spoke in terms of 500 per cent.; he said he did not think the adjective &ldquo;fantastic&rdquo; was inappropriate for what he had to tell.  I think it is right that instead of dealing in fantastics we should try to deal in realities.  The national income figures provided in the Government's own statistics published in <i>Economic Statistics issued prior to the Budget</i> 1960 are set out in page 25: &ldquo;Table 12 (b).&mdash;Gross national expenditure at constant (1953) market prices.&rdquo; When we come to study that we find that gross national product at constant market prices amounted to £537.9 million in 1957, £521 million in 1958, and £539 million in 1959.  That represents an increase in the national income of £1.1 million, as between £537.9 million in 1957 and £539 million in 1959.</P>

Our industrial exports are unquestionably significant and important. They amounted in 1959 to approximately £25 million, that is, exports of manufactures other than foodstuffs and drink.  Our total exports amount to £131 million approximately.  The exports of manufactures other than foodstuffs and drink represent about 24 per cent. of our total exports.  When we come to examine that figure of £25 million which causes the Taoiseach such rejoicing, it is only commonsense to face the fact that in that figure appears an item of £1.2 million for used motor cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it quite clear in regard to the figures I gave that items of that kind, and also food, drink and tobacco, are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am saying. I am referring only to exports of manufactures other than food and drink.  It is important to realise their relation to the total export trade of this country.  It is important to realise the spheres in which certain increases have taken place The exports of used cars amount to £1.2 million; the exports of sewing machines assembled here represent approximately £1.4 million; the export of used aeroplanes £.3 million.  We have every reason to rejoice in that we now have petroleum oil product exports as a result of having established a refinery at Whitegate. How far, on balance, that yields any return to us other than the employment it provides I do not know, but I have said here repeatedly that it is the employment we want and in so far as it provides our people with employment in refining products it is welcome and the increase in that industrial export is something in which we have good reason to rejoice.  I think Parties on all sides of the House collaborated in inducing the oil companies to establish that refinery at Whitegate and I have no doubt that its establishment was an eminently desirable thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is refreshing to hear from the Taoiseach who was himself the author of the Control of Manufactures Act that he now welcomes the introduction of foreign capital.  I am glad to hear <Col N="1927" /> him glory in the activity of the Industrial Development Authority and its operation in promoting industry here, both native and that based on foreign capital.</P>
    <P>But I cannot help recalling that when the Taoiseach stood where I stand now he told the House with vehemence, on the day we established the Industrial Development Authority, that if he ever had the opportunity to return to office the first thing that he would do would be to wind it up.  We are all glad to notice that the first class inducements offered to manufacturers to stimulate them to enter the export market are beginning to yield results. They were initiated by our Government, expanded by our Government and demonstrated again and again that if you want to maintain a free economy the best possible stimulant is to provide a profit advantage for those who engage in it.  I think the Taoiseach is wise in saying that one should not measure all industrial expansion exclusively by the number of factories that are set up. That is a dangerous test to apply. Deputy Briscoe might be able to tell us about the factory set up at Shannon Airport to make ninepins and which has so sadly closed down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I had nothing to do with it whatsoever.  The Deputy must control his stretch of imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I understand they had closed down that factory because some development in international trade had rendered that enterprise unprofitable.  I do not know what our liability is in respect of it but whatever it was has gone down the drain.  However, that would not discourage me.  We are bound to have a certain percentage of industrial reverses, and the fact that we should have them should not discourage us from trying to draw into our economy useful foreign enterprise which will provide decent employment at fair rates of wages for our own people and, at the same time, expand the export potential of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to notice that the Taoiseach has adopted the point of view pressed by these benches more than <Col N="1928" /> once that in many sectors of the export market the difficulty that we habitually experienced of breaking into existing markets could not be surmounted without the assistance of people who had access to those markets, because unless we had access to the marketing machinery in being we were perennially encountering the difficulty that we could not sell the goods produced and that if we went out to seek the market preparatory to producing the goods we were later likely to lose the market by failure to deliver when the time came.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing to get as many firms as we can to come in and endeavour to pass through their marketing organisations the output of our industrial potential.  I agree with the Taoiseach that, given the know-how and access to markets, ours should be as good if not better than any other country in the world.  But I have always the fear&mdash;and it is abundantly justified today&mdash;that when we start in this House considering legislation to send troops to the Congo, and when we start speculating on the possibilities of contacting European markets we have never before entered, and feasting our eyes on the far horizon under the incurable optimism of the Taoiseach&mdash;of which he is very proud&mdash; we are very liable to forget what is happening in our own back yard, what is happening to the neighbours among whom we live.</P>
    <P>I like optimism as much as any man alive, but there is a certain kind of optimism which is generated sometimes in public life for a dual purpose &mdash;one, to make people forget the seamy side of life and two, to erect a structure which it becomes heresy to assail.  There is a poetic expression for that.  It used to be expressed in my childhood in the unaristocratic area of Britain Street in the form: &ldquo;Hit me now with the baby in my arms.&rdquo; There is no man better in this country for throwing the shawl around his shoulders, producing a baby and stamping up and down Dáil Éireann with the baby of Irish industry in his arms and saying : &ldquo;Hit me now with the baby in my arms&rdquo; than the Taoiseach. And anyone who says a word <Col N="1929" /> of criticism against the baby he is engaged in nursing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The baby is weaned long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest the Taoiseach was so intimately associated with the baby as all that.  He has the baby still in his arms and, as far as I can see, he will go on carrying that baby so long as he is physically able to bear the burden.  He regards it as a great guarantee and insurance against effective attack from any angle.  I am very glad the Taoiseach should have this agreeable company to carry around with him.  But it amounts to national insanity when the Prime Minister of this country can come in here dwelling on what represents about a quarter of the economic activity of this country and a tithe of the national assets of this country and write off the rest of them by saying: &ldquo;You have heard enough about that from the Minister for Agriculture who spoke last night.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach read what the Minister for Agriculture said last night?  Did the Taoiseach listen to what the Minister for Agriculture said?  It was just like Barnum and Bailey's circus in its most depressed year of operation and anybody here in this House who understands the country in which we live is faced with the fact that over a very wide area a degree of depression and something approximating to disaster is spreading rapidly.  Now, mind you, that is not peculiar to rural Ireland.  I am told that in the city of Dublin there were never more empty houses in the Corporation housing schemes than at the present time, largely due to emigration of entire families from this city.  That is a very remarkable phenomenon.  It is not so long ago when there was no prospect of getting a Corporation house unless a family of five children were living in seriously inadequate accommodation or unless there was serious illness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is&mdash; and I have heard it statistically confirmed by the Minister for Local Government&mdash;that there are large numbers of vacant houses in the Dublin Corporation housing schemes and that those have been vacated as a result of entire families moving out. I find part of that explanation in the dramatic decline in the building programme which had been going on in the city of Dublin over the last ten years.  There is less employment.  I suppose people are more mobile than they used to be and, instead of registering now for unemployment here, they are much more prone to go down, get on the Liverpool boat, and clear out the moment they find they are no longer able to get work here.</P>
      <P>I was immensely struck to-day by the strange remoteness of the Fianna Fáil Party from the conditions that ordinary people live with and with which ordinary people come in contact in rural Ireland.  Certain Deputies here drew the attention of the responsible Minister to the repercussions on ordinary people living in the country, and trying to make their living, of the new Licensing Act in seaside resorts and country places.  The representations were received with derision and laughter.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole thing was nonsense&mdash;all cod.  The fact is that, so far as I am informed, the people who make their living in seaside resorts and tourist resorts are suffering acutely, partially, I suppose, as a result of the industrial disputes that have been holding up transport between here and Great Britain; but, in addition to that, their sufferings have been gravely aggravated by the impact of the provisions of the Licensing Act on their trade.  I have heard people describe conditions in Bundoran, in my own part of the country, in Monaghan, and in the other counties bordering the Six Counties. They will tell you that their losses are menacing as a result of the operation of the new Licensing Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> It seems to me perfectly clear that some measures will have to be taken to relieve that circumstance at an early date.  I do not think we are entitled to sit philosophically by and let people drift into something approximating to bankruptcy before we take any remedial measures at all. Certainly, sooner or later, some measures will have to be taken because, I think, the outcry will grow in volume with the passage of every week.  But it seems to me that measures ought to be taken promptly rather than at some distant date when certain individuals will have suffered losses from which they will never be able to recover.  What strikes me as so arresting is that Fianna Fáil seem quite blind to the position, quite untouched by it, do not know, and refuse to listen.</P>
    <P>That factor seems to operate also in regard to the general condition of the people in rural Ireland.  I listened to the Minister for Agriculture last night, and one would be ashamed to listen to him. His general line of country, and he is the Minister for Agriculture, was: &ldquo;I know the people are leaving agriculture. Sure, we cannot stop them and, if the truth were told, it is not so easy to earn a living on a small farm any more.&rdquo; That was his reaction to the present situation in rural Ireland.  To my way of thinking, what is going on is catastrophic and will eventually disrupt the whole social pattern of our life.  I think it is being suffered to happen because this Government just does not give a damn.  I think this Government have made up their minds to leave agriculture to Deputy Paddy Smith, that it is pretty safe in his hands, and leave it at that.  I do not think the Taoiseach knows much about it, and I think he cares less.  I think he has devoted his whole life to this business of tariffs, and bricks, and mortar, and he believes that is the be-all and end-all of the economic life of this country. I should not mind if he were assisted by an energetic and enthusiastic Minister for Agriculture because I believe a reasonable balance would then be maintained.  But I believe that the Minister for Agriculture also does not give a damn about agriculture, or <Col N="1932" /> about the future of agriculture, because he has no belief in it.</P>
    <P>What people in the Fianna Fáil Party seem to forget is that the only natural asset we have is the 12,000,000 acres of arable land and, if that is not the foundation of our economic life, we are at the mercy of anybody.  I am all for bringing in industry into this country, but I am not in favour of placing our people in thraldom to those whom we invite in to establish industrial enterprises here.  There is a great inherent danger in peripheral industry. What I mean by peripheral industry is the establishment in our economy of branch factories deriving from big foreign centres of manufacturing.</P>
    <P>If you get a big manufacturer concentrated on Philadelphia and he establishes subsidiary factories in Holland, Belgium, Ireland, Sweden and Norway, so long as he is in an expanding market, everything will go on like a wedding bell; and Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Holland and Ireland will all benefit from the expanding business that he is engaged in.  But if there comes a day when he experiences the shock of a trade recession he will not start cutting down operations in Philadelphia.  He will start cutting down in Norway, then in Sweden, then in Belgium, and then in Ireland.  Remember, we are giving high hostages to fortune because we are practically building his factory for him and giving him all the inducements possible to come here.  I think we are right to do that but we cannot afford to become entirely dependent on that.  There is a very grave danger that that is what this Government has made up its mind to do.</P>
    <P>It is right to bring in that kind of peripheral industrial development.  It is valuable and useful provided it does not become the exclusive foundation of the economic life of this country. But what I see in the approach of the present Taoiseach to our whole industrial problem is an excessive readiness to accept such economic development as an adequate substitute for the nondevelopment of our agricultural potential which is founded on the inalienable land that no one can take from us <Col N="1933" /> and on the thousands and thousands of families firmly rooted in the soil, whose production can provide us with a volume of universally necessary essentials, which nobody can either check or stop so long as we continue to develop.  Listening to the Taoiseach here to-day speaking of the glorious developments that are in process of evolving in this country, I recalled the fact that recently I went down to Carlow and Kilkenny.  The Taoiseach went there too, and I recalled in the presence of the people there that he had promised to produce 100,000 new jobs in this country.  Now remember, it was in 1956 he was making that promise.</P>

It was to be 100,000 jobs spread over a period of five years, and remember that promise and prognostication was made with the same panache, made with the same confidence, made with the same resolution and determination as was employed today in making his review of the economic state of the nation, and there is not the slightest doubt that a great body of our people swallowed that and believed it.  There are 40,000 fewer people working in this country now than there were when he was making that promise, and he has been head of a Government with a clear majority in this House for three and a half years.</P>
      <P>He himself is the man who went to Athlone and described our allegation in 1957 that if he got into office he would abolish the food subsidies as being a fantastic misrepresentation and he wound up by saying : &ldquo;How often is it necessary for me to repeat it isn't true?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That same Minister returned to office after those emphatic denials, upon which I think he staked his personal honour by the terms he chose to employ, and he bluntly proceeded to put 20/- on the 10 stone of flour, 5d. on the 2-lb. loaf and ultimately 10d. a lb. on butter.  He said at the time it was vitally necessary to get the money because, without the money provided by that procedure of wiping out food subsidies, they could not carry on.  That operation of removing the food subsidies reduced the expenditure of the incoming Government by £9,000,000 per annum. They took £9,000,000 off the burden of expenditure which the Government had to carry in 1957, and yet I think it is true to say this Government are spending £20,000,000 more than was their declared intention of spending in 1957 so that, since taking off the food subsidies, they found themselves able to raise £20,000,000 more in place of the £9,000,000 they had actually saved.</P>
      <P>This Government came into office pledged, and with the assurance that the present Taoiseach had the means substantially to reduce emigration, and yet in the three years he has been here, according to his own colleague, the Minister for Finance, 100,000 people have emigrated from the country in the years 1957, 1958 and 1959 taken together.  Those figures, taken together, present a pretty grim picture not only in themselves but because they have done the public life of this country I think a well-nigh irreparable damage in that they have shaken the confidence of our people in the undertakings of any public man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1935" /> Much as we may differ with the Taoiseach, and much as we may engage in appropriate political recriminations in this House, the Taoiseach is Head of an Irish Government, and I think the fact that our people discovered a man in his position giving such undertakings so casually and so brutally and flagrantly repudiating them after securing a clear majority in this House, is repugnant to all our standards of public life and shakes our confidence in all of them. But, over and above that, what Fianna Fáil appears to have forgotten is that that increased cost they put on the people has had this dramatic result of sweeping 100,000 people out of the country, and that mass emigration may have masked the unemployment which their activities have created.</P>
    <P>This increased cost has had to be borne by the small farmers of the country and they constitute a very large part of the 100,000 who have gone and are going, and they are going in a way they have never gone before. I sometimes feel almost like a voice crying in the wilderness in addressing the solid phalanx of Fianna Fáil on this topic because they do not seem to care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is in cuckoo land if he believes that. Let him ask any of his own Deputies from west of the Shannon about this extraordinary phenomenon that has begun to sweep across the country, that whole families of small farmers have just given up the fight and are leaving their homes and holdings abandoned.  I have never before seen that in my lifetime.  I am not making the case that emigration has not gone on for the last 40 years.  I was reared in the country and my memory almost goes back to the time when it was emigration of the old and evil kind, when people were leaving the country from sheer poverty, though there was very little of that evil in my youth; but I have seen emigration continuing where it related mainly to young people because they preferred to live in Philadelphia, as used to be the case, than to live in North Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there came the vast emigration <Col N="1937" /> of our people to Great Britain due to its ready accessibility, but that has assumed an altogether new form in the last two or three years which derives from the fact that you have all overlooked, and that is that in piling up this burden, the only section of the community for whom you could provide no remedial compensation was the small farmers who, in the words of the Minister for Agriculture last night, have to sell their stuff for what they can get, and if they are not prepared to sell it for that, then they can keep it.  But the result of that is that they will not produce the stuff.</P>
    <P>What I cannot get the Fianna Fáil Party to recognise is this.  I do not think the Taoiseach knows about it. I think he is quite at sea about the situation in the west of Ireland.  I do not blame him.  Quite apart from the social catastrophe of it, this country cannot afford to lose the production that results from thousands of acres of land being abandoned by the people who lived on them.  If a family leaves a holding of anything from ten to 40 acres in rural Ireland, what happens is that that land itself ceases to produce.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary pattern a family moving out like that will not sell the land readily to the incoming farmer. They set it; and you see rushes moving into the place that family used to till and on which they used produce fat cattle, pigs and sheep.  The lean store cattle are put on these holdings which are depasturaged under conacre settings.  If that is allowed to continue we shall suffer the whole economic foundation of this country to be eaten away, and when it is too late we shall discover that the elaborate superstructure we have erected upon it will collapse.  If only I could get the Fianna Fáil Party to wake up to this fact! No country ever goes really bankrupt.  What happens to a country when it goes bankrupt?  It does not mean we all go round hungry.  What happens is that somebody from outside comes in to dig us out.</P>
    <P>We have got an example in our own personal recollection of that economic dialectic.  The oldest independent <Col N="1938" /> nation on the North American continent abandoned its fundamental industry which was fishing.  I am referring to the democracy of Newfoundland. They sought to erect a superstructure on the uneconomic basis they had which the substructure would not maintain.  They got too grand to fish&mdash;that is the plain truth of it&mdash;and they awoke one morning to discover that they could not pay their way. What happened was that they could not pay the civil servants, they could not pay for social security and the weekly charges that the Government had to meet.  The remedy they sought &mdash;and they could seek it consistent with their history and dignity&mdash;was that they asked the British Treasury to send out a Commissioner to take over the Government of Newfoundland. Three British Treasury commissioners were sent out and they took over.</P>
    <P>Ultimately a day came when the three Treasury Commissioners said: &ldquo;Now you are back on an even keel. You must make up your minds what you want to do.  Do you want to resume independence or federate with Canada because we are not going to carry you on our backs any longer?&rdquo; After great spiritual agony, Newfoundland made up its mind that it had no prospect of survival as an independent nation. They determined that the time had come to abandon their claim to independence and they have become a province of Federal Canada.  With their history behind them, that was consonant with their dignity and national outlook.  It was no humiliation for them in that they were merely entering a Federation which by reason of history, geographical propinquity and a variety of other considerations was very natural for them.</P>
    <P>We cannot do so.  It is not open to us to do that.  I put it to this House: what is going to happen if the land of this country and the people who live in it cease to be viable?  There will arise a crisis in this country of a character for which I know no solution. I believe that is the factor on which Fianna Fáil are quite cheerfully turning their back.  I want to see industrial development and expansion <Col N="1939" /> here, but I want to see it on a firm foundation which preserves for our people the political and economic independence we must have if we are to be a sovereign nation.</P>
    <P>As I said when speaking on the Estimate for Agriculture in this House, it is not part of my job to propound policy to the present Government. But I am getting a bit tired of seeking to propound policy in public and finding Fianna Fáil walking away with my clothes as quickly as I display them.  I am perfectly convinced that it is possible to restore profitability to our agricultural industry. I recall that in the ten years between 1947 and 1957 we increased the value of our exports from £39,000,000 to £131,000,000.  A substantial part of that was due to increase in prices, but we actually increased the volume of our exports by 100 per cent.; and of those exports more than 80 per cent. were agricultural output.</P>
    <P>I believe we have got to face the fact that the quality of our agricultural output may require adaptation to the new world situation in which we find ourselves.  I want to say this, and it is a thing I have thought about a great deal in recent weeks.  I do not know what happened in London when the Taoiseach and his Ministers went to negotiate a trade agreement with the British Government.  I believe in the principle of economic integration between these two countries. I believe that once we have settled on a mutually satisfactory basis, at least in respect of this part of Ireland, our political relations with Great Britain by the separation of our two political Governments, as Norway and Sweden did in the past, it is the obvious policy for both countries to proceed to economic integration closely equal to that which Norway and Sweden succeeded in achieving after they had taken precisely the same political step.  It is noteworthy that according to these Scandinavian countries themselves, that degree of intimate economic integration and co-operation was impossible so long as the political <Col N="1940" /> link existed.  It was only when the two Crowns were separated it was possible for them to approach one another <i>ex aequo</i> and arrive at the kind of economic integration they now enjoy.</P>
    <P>I still believe in that principle between here and Britain.  I do not know what transpired in London or if our Government were prepared to offer to the British Government the kind of arrangement that would have redounded greatly to the ultimate advantage of this country.  I believe if that had been done it ought to have been possible to persuade the British Government of the desirability of such an arrangement.  If it has not been done so far, it should not cease to be our policy to work towards that ultimate end in the future.  But over and above what such an arrangement would provide between ourselves and Great Britain, I believe that a completely new orientation of our agricultural industry may be necessary.  I believe that to achieve that we must have effective and adequate national agricultural advisory services to assist farmers in such change-over as may be requisite for that end.</P>
    <P>I said at an earlier stage that I had referred to the Taoiseach's promise of full employment as published in the supplement to the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 15th October, 1956.</P>

      <P>I think that the supporters of Fianna Fáil are influenced only by the headlines published in this paper.  That is what I remember.  That is what the people remember.  That is what the people read and believed. I should like to add that the paper goes on to say that in the first year of the proposed programme there will be a contemplated capital investment outlay of £13 million providing 20,000 new jobs.  In the second year the capital investment outlay was to be increased by £20 million <Col N="1942" /> with a further increased employment of 20,000 people.  In the third year there was to be a further increase in gross expenditure of £20 million with a further 20,000 new jobs. Need I read it all?</P>
      <P>It goes on to say: &ldquo;By the fifth year on this calculation full employment should be achieved with the level of gross expenditure raised by £100 million and 100,000 new jobs created&rdquo;.  Could anything be more specific than that?  This is not the headline.  This is the small print and is a true report of what the Taoiseach said&mdash;&ldquo;By the fifth year on this calculation full employment should be achieved with the level of gross expenditure raised by £100 million and 100,000 new jobs created&rdquo;.  Does that answer the Taoiseach?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is a later publication which was published after mature reflection.  It was part of the Fianna Fáil propaganda for the general election.  It said that over 90,000 people were out of work and that the Coalition Government could do nothing for these men.  It said that Fianna Fáil pledged itself that work must be provided at once.  They go on to say they were going to end the depression and add: &ldquo;All our energies are to be devoted to one aim &mdash;full employment&rdquo;.  I must say, in justice to them, that in this document for the general election I cannot find anything so specific as was set out in the Taoiseach's speech of 15th October, 1956 where he is on record in saying that, by the 5th year on this calculation, full employment should be achieved with the level of gross expenditure raised by £100 million and 100,000 new jobs created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have alluded to that speech for the sake of satisfying the Taoiseach that he had said what he did say. I do not want to be deflected from the main purpose of what I am concerned to put before the House and that is that the Taoiseach's view of the trend of this country is a most magnificent piece of self-deception.  I <Col N="1943" /> know that I am contending against considerable odds in trying to restore an atmosphere of reality in the present situation.  The Taoiseach disposes of three newspapers whose job it is to boost him.  He disposes of a very complacent majority in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He disposes of the loyalty of people like our old friend Deputy Corry who, when told that the farmers of the country were repudiating him and that if he did not like it he could lump it, said that he had come in here as a member of Fianna Fáil and that whatever that Party did he would remain a member of it to the end.  That is an admirable display of loyalty and it is a loyalty which many other members of Fianna Fáil display towards the Taoiseach and the Party. We are faced with that mentality which is peculiarly characteristic of many of the Taoiseach's supporters.</P>
      <P>We are faced with the fundamental fact that people prefer to hear good news rather than bad news.  We are all familiar with the carnival at which the gypsy in her tent, who tells young girls that they will meet a young gentleman, does much more business than the old hag who sits in the other tent and who sees the ace of spades in the cards and foretells that her customers will meet with misfortune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that point of view the Taoiseach is always on a winner.  He is always in a gaily decorated tent, reading hands and telling people that round the next corner there is a handsome young gentleman waiting with a great fortune or that if they keep on travelling over the next hill they will find a pot of gold under the first bush they come across.  That is a popular tale.  I have been listening to him telling it for close on 30 years and I have watched the vast variety of picturesque ruins left behind always in the confident belief that the public memory is short and that, if only they can be led on to some other proposal, all will be well and they will forget the ruins.  And they do forget.  They forget <Col N="1944" /> the economic war and the many injuries that have been done in the past and the great bulk of humanity is greatly encouraged by the hopes the present Taoiseach holds out.</P>
    <P>I myself feel a sense of elation when the Taoiseach gets up and demontrates with eloquence that all is well; all we have to do is to struggle up to the next crest, turn the next corner and the sunlight will come streaming down on the glorious prospect before us and, for all the world to know, nobody can make his fortune by sitting on his &ldquo;behind&rdquo; and sliding down into prosperity.  All must square their shoulders, brace their sinews and advance to the glorious horizon, see the sun rise over the side of the hill and everything is rosy to the lands' end.  That is grand talk but there is no reality behind it.  If you bring your pigs to the bacon factory, and are told that the guaranteed price is 245/- per cwt. but that your pigs are Grade C and you will get only 170/- for them, you are going to lose money on them; if the calf your cow has had and which was worth £20 last year is worth £10 now; if your rates are going steadily up, if all your costs are rising and all your revenue declining, there is no good telling you to square your shoulders, stiffen your back and struggle on.</P>
    <P>Our people did a lot of struggling in their day and achieved great results thereby but the plain fact is that the people on the land are not prepared to be hewers of wood and drawers of water any more and the sooner the Taoiseach wakes up to the fact that we cannot survive without them the sooner he will realise the urgency of the task of helping them in their present situation.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, I think the situation here is extremely dangerous. There are many people much more pessimistic.  I still believe that we can secure for our people a good living in dignity, security and peace.  We must realise that for those for whom material wealth is the only consideration, the great industrial civilisations will inevitably have a greater attraction for them than anything Ireland will be able to offer.  I believe there <Col N="1945" /> will always be a sufficient proportion of our people profitably to operate the country on the basis the country can afford.  I believe that is a decent standard of living, a good standard of living and a better life than is to be obtained in most other countries in the world.  But I am seriously apprehensive, and I believe that many other people who really know the country share my belief, that if the present trend continues the viability of this nation will cease to exist.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that without the land we cannot make this economy tick.  I warn the Taoiseach that if things continue as they are now, within a decade so large an area of our land will cease profitably to produce that the whole economy of the nation will be in immediate and grave jeopardy.  If action is not taken now to restore the balance between town and country this dialectic will begin, if it has not already begun: the land will slowly fall into disuse.  The first repercussions from that will fall on the country towns and villages&mdash;I wish Deputies would remember how many people are getting good livings in those country towns and villages&mdash;and they will be forced out.  If they are, we may acquire export markets for much industrial output&mdash;I hope we shall&mdash; but if we lose their entire demand or the bulk of it through the incapacity of the people who live on the land to pay for it, Irish industry will feel the draught in good time.</P>
    <P>To me that means that there will spread over this country the sort of paralysis that was in the process of spreading over it in 1946-47.  I do not think we can afford to go through that experience again.  Our people have acquired a mobility that they never had in the past and a tendency simply to move out rather than endure that kind of hardship.  It will be a great tragedy if that is suffered to happen in our time.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that any Government here, in the presence of such developments, would face them and undertake the measures necessary to put them right but I am bound to say that I do not believe Fianna Fáil under its present leader ever will. <Col N="1946" /> Therefore, I adopt the words of an ex-President of the United States when he was asked: &ldquo;What is the remedy for our present ills?&rdquo; Without any personal reflection on the members of the Fianna Fáil Party I repeat in the words he used: &ldquo;There is only one remedy&mdash; put the rascals out.&rdquo; I see no prospect of reversing the present trend with the present Government.  When I am asked ultimately: &ldquo;If you complain of what this Government is doing, what would you do?&rdquo;, my advice to the people is: &ldquo;There is only one thing you can do; put the rascals out and leave it to others to do what they are unable, unwilling or incompetent to do themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is for a relatively small amount of money but, as is the practice, it is taken as an opportunity by the Taoiseach to review the economic state of the country in the past twelve months. Without intending to contribute at length I am bound to say I was rather surprised at some parts of the Taoiseach's speech.  I was amazed at his optimism and I think the Minister for Social Welfare would also be amazed.  The Minister for Health, who is also the Minister for Social Welfare, had certain measures before the House recently and he protested the relative poverty of the country. His attitude was that whilst the State would love to give a shilling more to old age pensioners and a little more to recipients of social assistance it could not be afforded.  Listening to the Taoiseach's description of the state of the economy tonight it seemed to me that we could well afford much more than was proposed in recent legislation in respect of these people. I do not want to pursue that point but I was genuinely amazed at the bright picture the Taoiseach attempted to paint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comment of Deputy Dillon was reasonable&mdash;it is a comment I made in the Budget debate or in the debate on the Vote on Account&mdash;that the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Government and the Taoiseach seems to be &ldquo;Do not hit me now with the child in my arms&rdquo;.  That is fair criticism. One wonders what is to be the rôle <Col N="1947" /> of the Opposition if they are not to be critical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that. Deputy Dillon said I said it.  You can hit all my children as hard as you like.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Taoiseach's pardon.  It was the Minister for Finance, in his Budget Speech.  In the concluding part of the speech he said words to the effect that he was critical of the fact that the Opposition were critical of the Government and its efforts.  What is the rôle of the Opposition if we are to sit here and say &ldquo;Aye&rdquo; to everything proposed by the Government and applaud everything that is done or that is attempted to be done?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has been Taoiseach for a little over a year.  I do not think there has been any spectacular advance in that year.  I will certainly give the Taoiseach and the Government credit for things that they have done.  I was one of those people who believed that Mr. de Valera's occupancy of the office of Taoiseach in the latter years was bad for the country and I thought that in Deputy Lemass we would have an energetic man with a lot of push in the matter of conducting the affairs of the country but there has been no radical change.  I often wonder if the political ghost of Éamon de Valera is still hanging around Government Buildings.</P>
      <P>I am not alleging that Mr. de Valera influences Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach in any way but I think the present Taoiseach has adhered to old policies as a tribute to the former Taoiseach or else he is bereft of policy or, should I say, bereft of any idea of changing policy because we seem to be going along in the same way over the years. Even in the last few years methods have not changed.  We always seem to be the victim of circumstances over which we have no control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's criticism about the last Government usually has been in respect of what they term the bad year of 1956.  I do not think you will get any Deputy on this side of the House to protest that it was a good year but it <Col N="1948" /> was not as bad as some of the critics in the Fianna Fáil Party pretend.  It was bad due to circumstances outside the control of the inter-Party Government and which would have been outside the control of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>We are told also that many of our speeches are akin to sabotage.  Yesterday, Deputy Davern said to a speaker on this side of the House that when the inter-Party Government relinquished office and Fianna Fáil took over there was a bad pound and a few threepenny bits in the kitty.  I do not know what sort of criticism that is intended to be.  Since Fianna Fáil assumed office on 20th March, 1957, they have talked in millions.  They bought jet planes and committed themselves to jet planes for millions and millions of pounds.  The Taoiseach to-day talked about the tens of thousands of pounds available for industry. Where did it come from?  Was that accumulated in the last three years by the efforts of Fianna Fáil?  I think that sort of criticism is stupid at this stage.</P>
    <P>I did not hear Deputy Lemass at the time the statement was made but I honestly believe that he promised that the food subsidies would not be touched.  I honestly believe that Deputy de Valera, as he was then, promised in Belmullet that the food subsidies would not be touched.  They were removed and the excuse given by the present Taoiseach and the former Taoiseach was to the effect that they did not know what the situation was. That is rather infantile from such hardened campaigners and from such an intelligent man as Deputy Lemass&mdash;&ldquo;We did not know what the situation was.  We did not know we would have to touch the food subsidies.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In this debate the Taoiseach has a certain advantage over many others in that he has up-to-date statistics.  In my comments I am not going to depend entirely, if at all, on statistics.  In the debate on the Vote on Account and the <Col N="1950" /> Budget, Deputies quoted from the booklet published by the Government, <i>Economic Statistics</i>, and the Taoiseach, while he used certain of the information contained in the Tables, told us that generally speaking these statistics could not be relied upon. Whether that should be accepted or not I do not know.  I suppose we can only take the Taoiseach's word that they are to a large extent unreliable.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach spoke here to-night about emigration.  One can take any figure and say that that is the figure for emigration in any year.  The true test is the census of population taken approximately every five years.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach has made any announcement in connection with that matter but I assume that there will be a census of population taken this year.</P>

      <P>That will give us an indication as to what change there has been in the population.  The fact remains that emigration is going on apace.  I think the Minister for Finance said in 1959 that emigration figures would amount to something like 40,000.  That is a pretty big figure.  I know in other years other statistics of inward and outward traffic movement can be shown to be something in the region of 50,000 but it does not get away from the fact that emigration is proceeding, that the population is being bled and there does not seem to be any remedy so far to check substantially that emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to unemployment, this booklet <i>Economic Statistics</i> tells us that there were 51,000 people fewer in employment in 1959 than there were in 1956.  Compared with 1955, agricultural output is down and industrial output is also down.  The Taoiseach gave what could be regarded as encouraging figures for the first half of this year but I cannot accept his claims <Col N="1951" /> with regard to factories established. I cannot say that there is X number of factories established, that Y number of factories is in the course of construction or that we shall have Z number in the next six months or so.  I see no evidence of it, which leads me to believe that these factories are not of a very substantial nature.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a Parliamentary Question some time ago how many new factories had been established in the last three years with State aid and he said there were 54; there were 30 in what the Government and other people regard as the undeveloped areas and 24 in the rest of the country, outside what are deemed to be the undeveloped areas.  The Taoiseach tonight gave a figure of 88 in respect of the expansion of factories, the establishment of new factories and factories that would be in the course of construction within the present year.  I do not see much evidence of that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make my periodical criticism about the attitude of the Government and other people in the House with regard to the particular attention being paid to what are deemed to be the undeveloped areas. Within the last 12 months legislation was passed here which promised a similar aid to factories that would be established outside these areas, under certain conditions of course.  Again I must say I do not see much evidence of many factories being established, at least in my part of the country.  The Government should give equal aid to factories whether they are established in the undeveloped areas or in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>It is especially difficult for me coming from an urban area to talk at all about agriculture.  However, one is forced to ask oneself: what is wrong with the agricultural industry? I suppose traditionally the farmers of this and every other country are regarded as groaners but it is a little more serious than that in Ireland.  As far as I can judge the State gives, and has given down through the years, substantial financial aid to the farmers.  My query to the Taoiseach is&mdash;I posed this before but he did not <Col N="1952" /> answer it; in speeches in which he replies to debates of this kind I know he cannot reply to everything&mdash;is he satisfied that the £12,250,000 that we are to give to agriculture is being spent in the right direction?  The reason I ask is&mdash;and I suppose the same could be said for industry in some cases&mdash;that as far as I can judge in agriculture there is a better opportunity for the big farmer, the big landowner, to avail of Government grants than for the small holder.  The same can be said of industry and, a better example, the same can be said in respect of housing grants, more especially house reconstruction grants. Is accordance with regulations, in order to qualify for a housing grant at present one must engage in a certain amount of work to qualify for any money.  That means one must have a certain amount of money to carry out the work before State aid is given at all.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that there are many small and middle-sized farmers who cannot avail of the generous grants which have been given by Governments down through the years. I do not advocate an absolute means test but there are big landowners&mdash;I shall not put a figure on the size of their holdings because it would not be right to do so&mdash;who can avail of every single penny provided by the State although they do not really want it.  However, the small farmer&mdash;his holding may vary according to the part of the country in which he lives but a farmer in Wexford who has a farm of 30, 40 or 50 acres is not regarded as a big farmer&mdash;cannot avail, as far as I know, of many of the grants because he has not the initial money to spend on the project. The size of the holding may vary in the west and in other parts of the country, where a small or middle-sized farmer might be regarded as one with 20 acres.  The Taoiseach should carry out a review of the generous assistance we give to the agricultural industry and see whether or not it is distributed to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>It has often been said&mdash;the Taoiseach is one who says it repeatedly and I do not think we can argue with him <Col N="1953" /> on it&mdash;that if we are to survive we must produce.  There are many contradictions to that sort of advice.  In many instances, both in agriculture and in industry, greater production does not give the desired effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that sometimes greater production does not always have the desired effect or produce the right results.  There is a perfect example of that in wheat and in beet.  Many farmers that I know have continued to produce more and more wheat and more and more beet especially over the last two years only to discover that the crop was overproduced.</P>
      <P>There are examples where greater production has caused difficulties in industry as well.  As a matter of fact the Minister for Industry and Commerce received a deputation of workers recently with regard to the production of anthracite coal.  Here was a situation where management and workers combined to give greater production only to find they had stocks on their hands of which they could not dispose. Workers were laid off.  That has happened in many other branches of industry and until we can tackle a situation like that there is no use in our exhorting certain workers and industrialists to give us greater production.</P>
      <P>I spoke a minute ago about generous assistance to agriculture being misdirected and asked the Taoiseach to review the position.  I think the same could be said in respect of industry. Again, it is the case that it is the big man with the financial resources who is most able to avail of grants given by the State.  I think there should be a new deal for the small man so that grants in his case, whether they be for the renewal of machinery or the reconstruction or extension of premises, could easily be availed of by him for those purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a cloud of secrecy, as far as the Government is concerned, with regard to the Shannon development area.  Whether the Government has extensive responsibility for this area or not I do not know.  Perhaps those Deputies who represent that part of the country know a lot about it.  I wish they would tell us because I know very <Col N="1955" /> little except for the various reports in the newspapers to the effect that some chap from Belgium or Germany, Japan or somewhere else is to establish a factory there.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present</i>,</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much I want to say but I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could give us some information.  Or perhaps the Minister for Transport, who has had a lot to do with the Shannon area project, could give us some information.  I think in fairness, the House should be told and the country should know what the developments have been and what the prospects are.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach welcomed the idea of industrialists coming into the country to establish factories here and I do not think that anybody disagrees with the proposals of the last Government or the Government now to assist in the establishment of these industries.  However, the Government should not sit back and depend entirely on private enterprise to provide these factories and consequently more employment for our people. Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have always protested in this House that private enterprise should have priority in industry but neither has protested very loudly that if private enterprise did not do the job the Government would step in and take over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing to see a German, a Britisher, an American or a Dutchman coming in here to establish factories, but progress has not been sufficient to absorb the large number of our people who are becoming unemployed, particularly in the rural areas. I think it is about time the Government seriously considered sponsoring industries itself.  They have been pretty successful in the past in the establishment of industries and in the running of the concerns so established.  They entered the field of electricity through the establishment of the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;not the present Government <Col N="1956" /> but it has been done by a Government. Different Governments have entered the field of industry, too, in Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping, Irish Sugar Company and in forestry which I would now term a commercial undertaking. Yesterday we had legislation giving a sum of approximately £200,000 for the expansion of Irish Steel Holdings.</P>
    <P>All these ventures have been highly successful and should be an example for others.  They have given quite an amount of employment and the Government should seriously consider the establishment of industries in fields where they think there is a necessity for them and where they know that private enterprise is reluctant to venture. The Department of Industry and Commerce through their various sections have the best advice as to the type of industry that is needed.  They know what commodities are imported and they know where export possibilities lie.  I think they could go a long way towards the establishment of more such industries.</P>
    <P>Then, after a while, they could hand them back and declare them to be public companies.  It has always seemed to me that private enterprise has not been sufficiently alive to the financial aid and other types of assistance that have been made available for their benefit by the various Governments, who have held the money out to them, so to speak.  But they have not availed of it.  Where we have emigration and unemployment at such a high rate, it is the duty of the Government to consider seriously and immediately the possibility of establishing factories in communities for whom private enterprise has failed to cater.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that we should exhort our people frequently to buy Irish goods.  I have said this in the House during debates like this but I do not believe the Government have been serious in a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  I do not want to infer that they have tried to dampen down the campaign which exists, but their recent efforts have been very puny.  The Government should realise the <Col N="1957" /> importance of our people buying Irish goods.  Unfortunately many people do not appreciate what an advantage it would be if all our people were determined to buy Irish-made goods wherever they were available.</P>
    <P>The last campaign conducted by the Government consisted merely of the sending out of very small and very inadequate leaflets to those on the election register exhorting them to buy Irish goods.  There are many reasons why our people should buy Irish goods, reasons which can be expressed very easily and very forcibly in Press advertisements.  Radio Éireann could be used for the same purpose.  I would ask the Taoiseach to consider seriously an all-out campaign to get our people to buy goods manufactured in Ireland.  The importance of buying Irish comes home locally, but I am afraid it does not come home to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>In my home town we appreciate the importance of inducing the farmers to buy agricultural machinery manufactured in Wexford.  In Kilkenny, the workers, and the people generally, appreciate the importance of selling Kilkenny footwear.  Similarly, in relation to Waterford, Dundalk, Limerick and Cork, and all the other manufacturing towns, the people appreciate the importance of people buying articles made locally.  But if one suggests to a farmer in, say, Kilkenny that he should buy a Wexford-made plough he does not regard the suggestion very seriously.  I suppose if I were to go down to Wexford, on the other hand, and advise the people there to buy Kilkenny-made shoes, they would listen to me, and that would be that.  If it were brought home to them that, in buying Kilkenny or Dundalk footwear they were keeping Irish men and women in employment, that would have an effect.  If the people in the farming areas were told that by buying Wexford manufactured agricultural machinery they were keeping men in Wexford in employment, they would appreciate the importance of buying Irish.</P>
    <P>I believe the trade union movement could possibly do more in that respect, <Col N="1958" /> but I think anything done should be done in co-operation with the Government and, in particular, with the Department of Industry and Commerce. One of the unions affiliated to the Trade Union Congress engaged in a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign some years ago.  Because they were not equipped&mdash;I do not mean financially but in other ways&mdash;to conduct that sort of campaign it was not as effective as it could have been.</P>
    <P>We have an inferiority complex about goods made in Ireland.  We should make an attempt, first of all, to get rid of that inferiority complex. I appeal to the Taoiseach to consider initiating a really big campaign in an effort to get our people to buy Irish manufactured goods.  A satisfactory response would help to solve a good many of our problems.  It would help to solve the problem of unemployment and an adverse balance of payments position.  It would make some contribution&mdash;I think a not inconsiderable one&mdash;if the campaign were conducted in a really big way.</P>
    <P>There is just one final comment I wish to make.  In view of the fact that this debate is a general survey of the economy and the economic prospects of the country, I do not think this is the right time, at the end of the session, to have this debate.  I remember one year here, when we were running late into July, possibly into August, by agreement, there was a token vote of £10 for the Department of the Taoiseach and the main debate on the Estimate was held in the following October or November.  That was a very successful debate.  Speakers are limited now because we must adjourn not later than 2 a.m.  Many Deputies want to contribute.  I think it is a pity that time will not permit them to contribute.  I ask the Minister for Transport and Power to convey to the Taoiseach that, in my opinion, we should have this debate earlier in the summer or, if that is not convenient, then in the autumn, when franker and fuller discussion will be permissible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the limited time I shall make my contribution as brief as possible.  One of the things which alarmed me when the Taoiseach <Col N="1959" /> was giving the House his annual review of the position of the country was the apparent complacency with which he regards the agricultural industry. During Deputy Dillon's speech he interjected on a few occasions, and his interjections had the effect of making uneasiness still greater.  The Taoiseach does not know that things are as bad as they are.  He showed quite clearly that he believes agriculture, and the position of the country generally, was never better; everything in the garden is lovely.  That is the alarming feature of the Taoiseach's attitude.</P>
      <P>I shall not cover the ground covered by Deputy Dillon, but I want to ask the Taoiseach one question: Does he realise that a huge section of our people&mdash;the small farmers under £10 valuation&mdash;is becoming a thing of the past?  I take the valuation because it is a more genuine yardstick than acreage by which to measure potential livelihood on the land.  Despite the fact that this class is rapidly disappearing, the Land Commission are striving to bring those under £10 valuation at the moment up to that level.  They are years behind.</P>
      <P>Urban Deputies may ask why this class is disappearing.  The answer is that the ever-increasing cost of living plus a declining income from the land has produced an ever-widening gap. The farmer has no option but to emigrate or go into the county home. Whole families are tearing themselves out by the roots and vanishing from the countryside.  Rural Deputies are in touch with the situation.  I ask those who have no real personal contact with the land if they think it possible for a farmer to rear a family on a farm of £10 valuation, consisting usually of 15 statute acres of mixed land&mdash;seven, eight or ten acres of fairly good land and the rest poor land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not minimise the situation. I went to the trouble of finding out how many holdings there are of £10 valuation, and under.  Out of a total of 378,676 holdings 195,797 are under £10 valuation.  I want to bring home to the Government now that we are going to lose 195,000 families.  I do <Col N="1960" /> not suggest that there are actually 195,000 houses, because in some cases a farmer owns more than one holding. I would say that in the 190,000 odd holdings under £10 valuation it is a fair assumption there are 160,000 homesteads.  These cannot survive and I want to warn the Government that the crisis facing the country at the present time deserves more attention than anything else.  We are losing these people.  We have lost many of them already because they have emigrated with themselves and their families.  I think there is only one way to save them for the country and that is the introduction of fixed minimum prices for the major items of agriculture which they are producing.</P>
    <P>At the present time farmers who have sufficient acreage of land of the requisite quality are growing wheat, barley, and beet at guaranteed prices, but in many cases small farmers cannot grow any of these crops.  The very size of their holding prevents small farmers from speculating too much in these crops.  The average small farmer may grow half an acre or an acre of wheat but, even with a fixed price, that is not sufficient.  He may grow an acre of beet, but that is about all, as he has to keep land for the grazing of the few head of cattle which are his principal business.  In addition he must grow corn, potatoes and other things for consumption on his own farm.  One of the incongruities of the present situation is that the big farmer has a great measure of security provided for him by the Government, but the small farmer cannot avail of that security by growing enough of the crops for which guaranteed prices are fixed.</P>
    <P>The pattern on small farms from Donegal to Kerry, even in the midlands and the south, is that they carry a small number of cattle and the sale of two or three of them each year is the main source of income.  The small farmers' women folk may also keep a few fowl, turkeys, and perhaps a few pigs, but pigs are an absolute gamble at present.  Indeed the greatest gamble of all today is in cattle, which were once a sure source of income for the farmer.  Turkeys are now also another gamble and if we are to hold these <Col N="1961" /> 160,000 farmers who have holdings of £10 valuation and under, we shall have to fix minimum prices for the produce they produce so that when they start production they will know exactly where they stand.</P>
    <P>By midland or southern standards I am not a very large farmer but I know that in every aspect of farming in which I partake, as far as income is concerned, it is a pure gamble.  The sowing of crops is a gamble.  Last year was an excellent year for the growing of grain and root crops, but this year is shaping pretty badly at present.  The small farmer has no guaranteed price for eggs, turkeys, sheep, cattle, and potatoes.  Rearing cattle for sale is a complete flop at present, and I blame the Government to a large extent for allowing the Danes and the Dutch to get such a large share of the British market.</P>
    <P>May I ask what exactly did take place in London at the time of the collapse of the trade agreement talks last Spring?  All that I know about it is that the Taoiseach came home and made a statement at the airport which was published in the papers, and a very gloomy statement it was. After that there was nothing to be heard but, since we are one of Britain's principal customers for industrial goods, I think the Government have a powerful weapon in their hands in bartering our agricultural produce for the goods Britain produces.  I am not saying that that is not acknowledged. Everybody who comes to this country or to England regards Irish produced food as the very finest, whether it be beef, eggs, butter or anything else.  We do not buy very much from other countries like Germany, Sweden and the United States of America.  We put all our eggs in one basket in regard to imports, and we should see to it that Britain takes our eggs from us in return.</P>
    <P>Speaking of these 160,000 odd small farmers and of methods to keep them in the country, I repeat that they will have to be given some security.  Every other class in the country has security of one form or another.  The working man has a secure wage.  Civil Servants, Gardaí and teachers have security and <Col N="1962" /> pensions when they retire, but the one crowd who are paying their share equally with them in providing such security, the small farmers, have no security themselves.  The result is that they are doing the obvious thing, they are moving out, leaving their land behind them and the country is going back into ranches.  In my opinion within the next 10 to 15 years the greatest part of the country will have gone back into ranches unless a strenuous effort is made to ensure a proper livelihood for the small farmers.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the Government's failure on prices for agricultural produce is a complete absence of employment in rural districts.  At present employment is provided only on a little arterial drainage scheme at one spot in Galway and another place in North Mayo, but that is neligible.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act has been completely ditched by the present Government, with what end in view I do not know.  I never heard one reasonable argument put forward to explain why it was strangled. Afforestation and the Land Project were two other excellent developments which, not alone were providing steadfast employment in rural areas, but were doing good for the country as a whole.  In districts where no other work could be provided they were a great boon.  They were some of the things which the inter-Party Government advanced but they have been more or less damped down by the present Government and some of them, as I say, have been killed.</P>
    <P>If any of us had to survive on a small holding, under present conditions, I do not think we would last six months.  During the debate on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture I said that the income derived from a holding of £10 valuation or under, does not provide sufficient means to bring up a family in the standard which was previously enjoyed by small farmers.  At present a farm of £10 valuation is just a &ldquo;hoy&rdquo;, a plaything for a bachelor farmer.  Anyone who travels through the country will see that that is so.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach came home <Col N="1963" /> from London last spring after the collapse of the trade agreement talks, he gave a promise to relieve the position of small farmers, and one of the items he mentioned was the de-rating of out-offices on agricultural holdings.  Why did he break that promise?</P>

      <P>The first step towards stabilising the livelihood of the farmers on small holdings is a fixed minimum price.  That might lead to a flood of production, but, nevertheless, farmers would know where they stand.  To-day they do not know where they stand. This time last year a suckling calf made £25.  To day you can buy the same calf for £10.  Deputy Killilea can bear me out in this.  Saleable store cattle are down £15 a head or even more since last year&mdash;that is the few you can sell this year.  A good deal of blame has been laid on the bovine T.B. eradication scheme.  I do not see that it is interfering with it. What has killed the cattle trade this year is the failure to send the cattle across the Channel to our old customers in England.  The bovine T.B. eradication scheme had very little to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Deputy Corish refer to the money the Government is spending on agriculture.  It is not the first time I heard him do so.  I presume he was referring to the relief of rates on agricultural land.  The Government is <Col N="1964" /> spending little or no money on the development of agriculture in comparison to what is being spent on other projects not nearly as worthwhile. More money must be spent on agriculture. Fianna Fáil seem to regard agriculture as a kind of permanent cow, always there to be milked but which never needs any food or attention. That cow is vanishing hard and fast.</P>
    <P>The picture Deputy Dillon painted was perfectly correct.  If we undermine the solid foundation of this country&mdash;the small farmer under £20 valuation&mdash;in our time, and that foundation is being rapidly undermined, I can easily see the whole structure of the State as we know it to-day toppling. Every person who leaves the country is a tax-payer and a potential source of employment gone.  If we are to lose our population, I can assure the Taoiseach that the factories in which he and all of us take such pride will be very little good to us.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us that the Government have some new plan for sea fisheries.  What we want is something more definite than plans.  The Taoiseach at this time of the day might have a little public decency in him. For too long he has fooled the people with his plans.  I remember when he came into the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis last August two years and said he was going to spend £100,000,000 in five years.</P>

He went down to Ballina&mdash;I do not want to parrot things I have said here so often but this bears repeating&mdash; before the last election and conveyed to the people that the food subsidies would not be removed.  He became Minister on the 20th March, and on the 13th April the food subsidies were removed, doubling the price of bread and increasing the price of butter from 2/10d. to 4/4d. per lb.</P>

      <P>The people lose all confidence in the country when they hear statements at election time made to capture their votes.  It was purely bidding for votes at the last election that these promises were made, and inside of four weeks after getting into power they shamelessly went back on them.  The Minister for Transport and Power knows as well as I do that these promises were made.  The Taoiseach made almost the same statement in Waterford on the night Deputy de Valera, the previous Taoiseach made his statement in Belmullet that the subsidies would not go.  He did not say it in those words, but he said that the prediction made by inter-Party speakers that Fianna Fáil would remove the food subsidies was false and without foundation.  &ldquo;We never do what they say,&rdquo; is what he said.</P>
      <P>That kind of conduct&mdash;buying votes by false promises they had no intention of fulfilling, just like the 100,000 new jobs&mdash;undermines the confidence of the people in Government institutions. We must be the quietest people in the world that there has not been a revolution or that some section of our people are not goaded into taking the law into their hands when they find themselves so badly sold by such rotten promises.  We have the name of being a rowdy race, of causing rows and trouble in every country in which we go.  Yet we can swallow the most appalling lies from our own and we seem to understand instinctively that they are meant for swallowing.  I like being a member of the Dáil but I would much rather stay out of it than buy myself in by such promises and dirty tricks as that.</P>

      <P>The last thing I want to say is on this question of Irish industry.  Some Deputies who have spoken have said that there should be a &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  We all like to buy Irish but sometimes we are accused of having a grudge against Irish-made articles and a prejudice in favour of foreign articles.  I want to put this question: Did anyone ever hear of an Irishman wanting to buy foreign cement, foreign sugar or foreign asbestos goods?  I never did.  These Irish-made articles are the best in the world.  Even in Belgium, where they make a good brand of cement, they are anxious to import as much Irish cement as they can get.</P>
      <P>We would not want a campaign to buy Irish if our manufacturers turned out articles as good as those turned out by the foreigners.  The Irish purchaser is as keen a judge of good quality as any other purchaser in the world.  It fell to my lot two or three years ago to be somewhat critical of certain Irish industrialists.  I got some hot letters about that criticism and I sent back letters that were equally hot. I spoke from experience of Irish made articles that fell to pieces in my hands but I am glad to say that the quality of those articles has improved immensely and I am glad to feel that some of my remarks have caused improvement in various Irish articles.  I cannot conceive of any Irish man or woman being so thoughtless of the employment given in Irish industry as to buy foreign goods in preference to those made at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, some years ago Irish industry was turning out some not very desirable articles, the quality of which was none too good.  Of late years the quality of the majority of Irish manufactures has improved immensely.  That <Col N="1968" /> is the one way to enable manufacturers to sell their goods.  The average person spending money wants to get the best possible value for it.  He does not want an article, it may be a tool of some sort, which will break in his hands when using it.  There is no better campaign to persuade Irish people to buy Irish goods than that the manufacturers should turn out good quality articles.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem facing the Government at the moment is to save the 160,000 small farmers in the country. The Government will be in power for the next 12 or 18 months and if something is not done for those people they will all emigrate to England.  The Taoiseach opened his eyes in horror to-night at the suggestion that such a thing was happening but I can give him proof of two parishes I know in which it is happening.  I know of one parish in which 80 new houses are closed up and in the other parish over 40 of them are closed.  I can prove that is the case.  If that trend continues for another 10 or 15 years you may have good industries but you will have a desolated countryside with no one in it to provide a home market. It is up to the present Government to find out how that section of our people is to be saved.  If they do not do that they, and indeed all of us, will stand condemned before posterity.  If we let this happen we shall, as Deputy Dillon has stated, undermine the foundations of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be as brief as I can in the circumstances, Sir. Listening to the Taoiseach to-night I could not help feeling that whatever consternation there may have been in the minds of the Opposition, as expressed by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Blowick, it can be as nothing compared to the apprehension in the minds of the rural Deputies sitting behind the Taoiseach. In listening to that speech they must have found very little comfort for the rather bitter lesson which they recently had with regard to the position in rural Ireland.  I am referring to the very considerable drop in votes in the recent election in Carlow-Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that many of them must <Col N="1969" /> have felt disappointed, after listening to his very able dissertation on the Department of Industry and Commerce as they did some years ago when they listened to another speech, which has been referred to so often here, which he made in Clery's and in which he discussed the plan for 100,000 new jobs.  I am not concerned with bringing that up but it was noticeable at that time to most of the rural Deputies that throughout the speech much was said about industry and commerce but that little or no mention at all was made of the part of rural Ireland or of agriculture in the drive towards prosperity which he foresaw or in the giving of employment.</P>
    <P>Listening to him to-night they, like myself, must have felt that he obviously had learned nothing and forgotten nothing in his present position as Taoiseach.  It is quite clear that in his new post as Taoiseach he is still obviously the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Quite obviously he is now exercising over the position in which he had qualified control for 30 years the power of being the absolute director of policy.  Consequently he does not appear to have understood that the transition from the post of Minister for Industry and Commerce, or from any other Ministry for that matter, to that of Taoiseach requires a completely new outlook, a more global outlook on national problems than he appears to be capable of giving in his new character as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to listen to people who express something in a particular way, so that one is helped in finding out those people's mentality, outlook and personality.  From that point of view it was very interesting to hear the Taoiseach diffidently dismiss the question of agriculture by saying that we had already debated the Estimate for Agriculture and that he did not propose to enlarge on the subject again to-night.  He then went on to give us a very prolonged and detailed analysis of the position in relation to industry.  It seems to me that if the Taoiseach felt he would be out of order in re-debating the Estimate for <Col N="1970" /> the Department of Agriculture, he was equally out of order in restating the position in relation to industry in the last six months or in the last year.</P>
    <P>To my mind he showed by that&mdash;a seemingly clever evasion of a debate on this most important question of agriculture &mdash;that he sought to evade the discussion and felt that he had cleverly got out of talking about something in which clearly, as Deputy Dillon said, he had very little interest and about which he probably knows very little. I do not think it is wise for a Taoiseach to allow himself to remain in such a position while in that very responsible post.</P>
    <P>To me it seems that the Taoiseach, in his speech, concentrated on the last period&mdash;the first six months of this year&mdash;and then went into very great detail about the projected expansion of capital investment in various industrial enterprises.  I think that that enabled him to put what I suspect will turn out to be a most fallacious and misleading gloss on the true position in the country and, rightly or wrongly, I believe that, consciously or unconsciously, he has tended to mislead the Dáil by this picture of a society throbbing with prosperity and with industries expanding on all sides offering employment opportunities on all sides, creating products of one kind or another for our greatly and rapidly expanding export markets.</P>
    <P>He must bear in mind the period since he was first responsible for the creation of industry in Ireland in the 30's.  He could take the picture since that time, or since the 20's, if he believes that Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael made any notable contribution to the expansion of industry and he could try to glean from it, from the results of our economic policies over that time, assistance, information and experience which would guide him for the future.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, he could take that period and I think it would show quite incontrovertibly that the economic policies pursued show themselves to have been, or to be, a monument to the failure of the bi-partisan belief <Col N="1971" /> in private enterprise as a dynamic for the creation of a socially just or prosperous society over the last 30 or 40 years.  I think that is undoubtedly the case and I hope to demonstrate it to some extent.</P>
    <P>In the realm of non-productive capital investment, there is no doubt the State has spent money lavishly and to great good purpose in various activities mentioned by Deputy Corish &mdash;road-building, house-building, provision of hospitals, land drainage, harnessing of rivers to provide energy and utilisation of bogs to provide fuel.  In these non-productive capital investments the State has spent vast sums. Equally, in a limited number of the productive capital investment type of undertakings, such as Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, Irish Steel Holdings and the Sugar Company, the State has also most profitably made considerable capital investment.  But where the State has left investment to private individuals or capitalists for the provision of industries or factories which could, would, and should have absorbed the inevitable emigration, and the migration from rural Ireland to the towns and big urban centres and absorbed all the young people coming from the schools and absorbed the unemployed to a total running up to 80,000 or 100,000 people, there, in that sector of our economy which has been left practically exclusively to private enterprise, I do not think anybody can doubt that it can be quite clearly shown that private enterprise has failed the nation quite remarkably.</P>
    <P>The total number of jobs required worked out, I think, at something like 12,000 to cater for those who leave the land each year, 12,000 for those leaving school each year and between 40,000 and 80,000, or sometimes 90,000 for the unemployed.  Those persons are in addition to the many thousands who have to emigrate, but the total number of jobs required was something in the region of 80,000 and the approximate number of new jobs created each year was, I think, in the region of 8,000 to 10,000.  I do not know if it is even as high as that; I <Col N="1972" /> think it is very much lower, but certainly not higher.  The net result of all that has been a failure of growth in our national income and a failure to provide sufficient employment with well paid jobs.  The system has had the end product that we have all talked about, the emigration since the State was founded of over 1,000,000 people.</P>
    <P>We have all examined that problem on many occasions, but I am afraid that the depressing thing, as I said at the beginning, is that the Taoiseach seems to have learned nothing from the fact that he has entrusted the expansion of the employment potential and the export potential to private enterprise because he believes in it. He has said he believes in it; he is quite within his rights to believe anything he wants to believe, but to go on believing in something long after it has proved to be a failure is inexplicable to me.  I do not know how often he has talked of doctrinaire socialism and its dangers but what about doctrinaire conservatism which, because he happens to believe in it as an economic doctrine, he refuses to change even though he has evidence before him proving that no matter which aspect of our economy one looks at, it has failed?</P>
    <P>Our views, of course, depend on the target we hope to achieve, the type of society we want to create, but the failure of private enterprise to expand our national economy to an extent sufficient to develop export markets on a sufficiently large scale has left us in the position that we have had a serious lack of jobs.  We have had the position where various Government Departments have had to turn down necessary expansion because of lack of funds&mdash;that is the excuse given, at any rate.  The Minister for Health is unable to provide us with proper health services.  No doubt he would like to do it if he could but he says he cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education gives us grossly inadequate educational facilities and provides inadequate scholarships for children to secondary schools.  Old people are living on 28/6d. a week which everybody knows <Col N="1973" /> is grossly inadequate and, in spite of the rosy picture the Taoiseach paints, the Minister for Social Welfare tells us he cannot afford to give any more. This all seems to me to add up to failure of private enterprise through the years to take advantage of the opportunities offered by various Governments because, as I have said, there is absolute bi-partisanship about this economic policy in this House. These people have failed to accept the opportunities given to them to expand, to invest capital and get into the export market so that we could increase the national income and create a socially just society here.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach comes in tonight with exactly the same formula, the same failed ideas, the same failed statistical clap-trap and economists' clichés which time and time again he must have given to this House.  I have listened to him for ten years but no doubt there are Deputies who must have been listening to him for the last 30 years saying much the same as he is saying now, broadly promising them the same things as he is now promising, that prosperity is around the corner, that we are just over the top of the hill and that any day we shall arrive at the end of the rainbow.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must get tired making these demonstrably silly statements. Obviously, with one thing and another, what may be a prosperous year in the first six months could be disastrous in the second six months. Nobody knows that better than the Taoiseach.  When he realises the full significance of his reference to the possibility of a recession in Great Britain, Great Britain being the keystone of our prosperity, he must realise the inherent fallacies in dealing in six month periods in the life of a nation.  I think he would have been justified in referring to the broad picture over the last 20 or 30 years or in referring to the position since 1957.</P>
    <P>The figures quoted in the booklet <i>Economic Statistics</i> compiled by the Central Statistics Office are significant. They show that the total exports in 1957 were £131.3 million and in 1959 were £130.7 million&mdash;a reduction.  On <Col N="1974" /> page 21 it is shown that the index number of the volume of agricultural output went from 109.9 in 1957 to 103.3 in 1959, base 1953=100.</P>
    <P>One marvels at the ingenuity of various Ministers and Taoisigh from time to time explaining why there is a drop in agricultural output or in industrial output.  There is always an explanation. The explanation in relation to agricultural output varies from a very dry summer to a very wet summer and the bovine T.B. eradication scheme.  I know that one must depend to a considerable extent on the weather in a country such as ours but we have lived here for a very long time and must know or should know this climate fairly well.  There must be some precautions that we can take in order to guard against these acts of God over which we have no control at all.  There must be some way in which we can organise our agricultural industry so that we are not completely dependent. Science has advanced so much that there must be some way by which we can obviate the possibilities of damage to crops as a result of unsuitable weather.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The third excuse is the bovine tuberculosis eradication question. It has always struck me that this is a very weak and a very lame excuse because we knew long enough about the necessity for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and there was no reason in the world why we should be caught unawares.  We got sufficient warning and should have taken action earlier.</P>
      <P>The figures I have quoted show the drop in agricultural output.  On page 22 we see that the total number of males engaged in farm work dropped from 398.6 thousand in 1957 to 389.1 thousand in 1959.  That is another figure that the Taoiseach did not deal with to any degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to a statement made by some council that the flight from the land in Ireland was paralleled in other countries.  The use of this statement seemed to me to be <Col N="1975" /> an attempt by the Taoiseach to legitimatise his own attitude to agriculture and to agricultural interests in this country, his indifference to their present position, his disbelief that they could be made to become the great source of national prosperity.  The fact, of course, is that in other countries in which there has been a flight from the land the conditions are entirely different.</P>
    <P>If one takes Denmark, Holland, Sweden, Norway or New Zealand the position is that the land, from which the rural society there is fleeing, is land which has been developed to the maximum, from which the optimum amount of output has been achieved by the use of scientific advances in agricultural know-how as well as generally by the use of the co-operative movement.  Their use of both of these has provided a prosperous agricultural economy in those countries.  Because of the introduction of machinery, there has been a surplus population in those countries and they have necessarily moved into the small towns or villages in which there are factories based on the output of the agricultural industry or into the larger cities in which they have work in the perfectly natural industrial and textile industries established in these countries.  There is no comparison between that drift from the countryside in those countries and the headlong flight from rural Ireland into the cities and across the water. Until we have reached the position in which we have developed agricultural potential to the maximum we cannot be satisfied with the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>I am greatly disturbed to find that the Taoiseach has intended to wash his hands of this whole problem.  He seems to feel it is insoluble, that there is very little he can do about it, that the best thing to do is to throw the people the odd sop of price supports, to try to keep them quiet by various minor concessions, to concentrate on building up industries on the periphery of the countryside, in the big cities, Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway, and leave agriculture to fend for itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1976" /> That is the most serious trend disclosed in the Taoiseach's speech.  His admission in that regard is the most disturbing of all.  As long as there is this decay in our agricultural economy, with uncertainty of prices and cynicism among the farmers, there can be no substantial industrial arm created because that industrial arm must be based on rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The other figure which was not mentioned was the figure for the number of persons at work in the main branches of non-agricultural economic activity.  In 1957 the number was 703,000 and in 1959 it was 692,000, another drop.  I do not think that adds up to a genuine picture of prosperity in anything like the terms painted for us by the Taoiseach.  As I said, it depends entirely on the type of society which you are trying to create.  The export figures show a very unhealthy trend because of the low agricultural content in these export figures.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in spite of the talk we have about the industrial boom over the past two years there has in fact been a decline in total exports from £127 million in 1957 to £125 million odd in 1959.  The other disturbing fact is that the breakdown of the increases in exports shows that petrol products account for about £500,000&mdash;I am giving approximate figures&mdash;metal wrought and un-wrought, £500,000; electrical machinery, £437,000; sugar roughly £500,000; footwear £500,000; cement £320,000; ores and concentrates, £500,000; and second-hand cars, £500,000.</P>
    <P>That is an unhealthy, undesirable pattern because our exports should stem from produce processed either from the seas around the country or from the land.  It should be clear to everybody that an export like second-hands cars is an absurd export item in a country such as ours.  It is an extremely undependable item.  As regards metal, wrought and un-wrought, I do not know whether that is scrap iron or what it is but if there has been any finished steel product export increase it has been largely due to the industry mentioned by Deputy Corish, Irish Steel Holdings.  Ores and concentrates <Col N="1977" /> are one of the most depressing exports of all in so far as we are exporting raw material for an industry in respect of which we should have provided a State industry for ourselves in order to get the total value of the mineral wealth in our mines.  That is &ldquo;one of the saddest thoughts of all, that this is increasing and that the real wealth is going to countries other than our own.</P>
    <P>The only healthy export increase that I see is sugar which is based on one of the most prosperous of our industries, the sugar industry, probably the most desirable of all in so far as it is based on the produce of the land and because, from the ground right up to export, Irish men and women are employed in growing it, harvesting it and processing it.  That seems to me to be the ideal pattern for development of industry in Ireland and it is to be preferred to an absurd development like dependence on items such as second-hand cars.</P>
    <P>Other interesting figures show that farmers' incomes rose by 4 per cent., a very small amount.  Wages and salaries rose by 3½ per cent. and companies' profits rose by 17 per cent., that is to say, companies' profits were five times greater than the increase in wages and salaries.  Once again we got from the Taoiseach, as we do from all these people, the Federation of Manufacturers and industrialists of one kind or another, the usual homily to the workers that they should be very careful about demands for increases in wages; if we increase their wages we will be taxed out of the export market; that they are putting us into an inflationary spiral; that they are making it necessary for us to close down industries; and that, generally, if they look for an increase in wages as a result of increased production they are doing something approaching sabotage of the national interest.</P>
    <P>Yet I have never heard from anybody a lecture or a homily addressed to the Federation of Manufacturers, the industrialists, telling them they should put a curb on their profits, on the dividends they distribute from time to time to their shareholders.  As a Socialist I do not believe in private enterprise at all.  I believe the worker <Col N="1978" /> has an absolute right to the product of his skill and his labour.  I do not believe a penny of that belongs in unearned income to the moneylenders, which is what the shareholders really are.  I do not think the pockets of the workers should be pilfered by any of these people.</P>
    <P>It is becoming quite obvious that we are the last preserve of private enterprise in a wonderfully anti-private enterprise world and that the change will come to Ireland as it has to so many other countries.  I do not understand why the workers tolerate this extraordinary situation&mdash;an increase in wages and salaries of 3½ per cent. and an increase of 17 per cent. in profits. The most interesting fact of all seems to be all the talk about increases in wages in the last twenty years when the worker of to-day is making little more than he did 21 years ago&mdash;in purchasing power very much less.</P>
    <P>Using figures supplied by the Central Statistics Office, it is possible to show that, in fact, incomes have not increased&mdash;actual incomes in terms of purchasing power&mdash;since 1930.  This is during a period in which, year after year, mounting profits and dividends are being issued in bonus shares of one kind or another in different companies and different industries.  It is, of course, completely wrong and I think it is one of the points to which the Taoiseach never seems to advert nor does his opponent on the other side. They do not seem to concern themselves as to for whom they are running our society, for whom are they organising our economy.</P>
    <P>The number of people affected by the wages standstill in effect over the last twenty years is something like 60 per cent. of the workers engaged in industry.  That has gone on, that restriction in the workers' purchasing power, at a time when there has been virtually no expansion in our social amenities.  There have been no free health services.  There has been no appreciable expansion in opportunities for higher education for the middle class and lower income families.  The old age pensioner and the widows and orphans are all living in a state of <Col N="1979" /> semi-starvation because of the gross inadequacy of their allowances.</P>
    <P>That conservative policy of successive Governments has driven the best part of one million people out of the country.  It has made it impossible for us to give the people a proper health service, to give our young children proper education; it made it impossible to provide playgrounds or other recreational amenities of that kind which are restricted to the children of wealthy parents.  Our leading politicians are the architects of one of the most backward societies in Europe.  And this is after forty years of internal peace and with no great war damage or the repairs that were required in most other European countries.  We have had none of those difficulties, disabilities or drawbacks and yet we have succeeded in creating this ghostly, defective society.</P>
    <P>I marvel to listen to the political leaders on both sides who dogmatise to us with such conviction.  At last, they say, we are facing prosperity; at last we are turning the corner and prosperity is just upon us.  These are the same trite nostrums from the political leaders that have been reiterated for the past twenty, thirty or forty years.  But that is not so bad.  What is worse is that they are not learning from their repeated mistakes over the years.  The Taoiseach conceded, and it is rational, of course, that the keystone of our economy lies in Britain&mdash; that due to our nearness to Britain it is the obvious market.</P>
    <P>Years ago it was natural we should find ourselves in that position, but I charge the Taoiseach with being largely responsible for the position in which we are inevitably dependent on the prosperity of Britain for a prosperous Ireland.  And yet, by the refusal in the 1930's to face this problem, he did not put investment into the creation of industry of one kind or another, based on the agricultural produce of Ireland.  Because he did not do that, because of an inferiority complex he appears to have had about ourselves and our country, he opened the door for the British manufacturer to come <Col N="1980" /> in here and establish the subsidiary industries here to which Deputy Dillon referred.  That is the fact.</P>
    <P>That is one of the most damning features of the policy because, as time goes on, we shall realise more and more how completely dependent we are on a prosperous Britain for our prosperity here.  Britain is now facing the consequences of the Tory Party's election gimmick, the opening of the doors to hire purchase and cheap money in order to expand the sale and use of consumer goods to keep the wheels of industry turning over, creating the philosophy of &ldquo;I am all right, Jack&rdquo; for their own election purposes.  They are now beginning to feel the hangover of that dishonest device, a device they used in order to win the election. But I am not concerned with that except in so far as it affects us, for we are tied to the tail.  We must go wherever they go.  If they go up, we go up a certain distance also; if they go down, we go down with them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must know enough about developments in Britain to be very worried about the fact that Britain is the corner-stone of our economy and the foundation stone of our prosperity. In Britain, they are very worried indeed about the failure of private enterprise to expand export markets in competition with countries like Western Germany, Japan, America and so forth.  We are in a very delicate situation indeed.  I cannot understand why the Taoiseach should have had this inferiority complex about ourselves.  It seems to me to disclose a curious dichotomy, an unreasonable dichotomy or schizophrenia in the Taoiseach because, on the one hand, we provided the capital, the personnel, the technicians, the craftsmen, the labourers, right from the bottom up&mdash; all the prerequisites &mdash; of the marvellous industries which we have.  One has only to look at the developments in housing and in hospitals to see the pattern; we provided the architects, the engineers, the planners, the finances, the professional people, the craftsmen, the artisans, the labourers, and the firms with the commodities required to erect these magnificent hospitals and housing estates.  All this was done by Irish personnel.  It did <Col N="1981" /> not matter whether it was unskilled labour or the highest professions; we had them all.</P>
    <P>The personnel in Aer Lingus are Irish.  So are the personnel in Comhlucht Siúicre, Irish Shipping, Irish Steel Holdings, Bord na Móna, the Electricity Supply Board, and so on.  I can never understand why the Taoiseach ever thought it would not be possible for us to find the technicians, the capital and the know-how to do the samething in industry which could have gone into the export markets in the same way as Comhlucht Siúicre has done in recent years.  They have had no difficulty.  The Taoiseach said something to the effect that if we did not have these tie-ups with the Japanese, the Germans, the British and the Americans we would be denied access to markets.  The fact of the matter is the Sugar Company has been able to develop export markets on its own.  It has been able to establish the necessary contacts abroad.  Aer Lingus has done very well on its own in competition with the best in the world.  It seems to me that all the facts disprove the Taoiseach's contention that we had to have this contact with outsiders in order to establish, maintain and develop our industries to the maximum of which they are capable.</P>
    <P>Our dependence for prosperity on the prosperity of Britain is a very good argument why we should refuse to extend that dependence to embrace other countries as well as Britain.  If we continue in that fashion, we shall find ourselves in a very short time dependent on a prosperous Japan, on a prosperous Western Germany, on a prosperous America, and so forth. When they go into recession, we shall go into recession too.  And the Taoiseach will tell us: &ldquo;It is just too bad&rdquo;. If a bunch of extremists get a hold in Japan and wreck the industries there, what will be the result on us?  Our industries will close down, and that is an end to Shannon.</P>
    <P>The position is well illustrated by the possibility facing us as a result of a possible recession in Britain.  I find it difficult to understand why the Taoiseach, <Col N="1982" /> with his considerable intelligence and ability&mdash;much more intelligence and ability than anything I can command&mdash;should not be clearly aware of the facts.  He may have had certain views in the past.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Whatever views he may have had, it is now clear that, with the best will in the world, these people are incapable of expanding exports at a rate which will give us the expansion we require in order to reach a national income which will permit us to create a socially just society.  I suppose that is where we really differ in this House.</P>
    <P>I believe the Taoiseach said something to the effect that he did not want to develop our economy at the expense of values that we might have here.  I do not know if he really gave that statement of his any really serious thought because, quite clearly, over the last 40 years we have developed our economy without giving a single thought to the creation of a socially just society for all our people.  There is a minority who live in conditions of very great privilege, who have access to magnificent schools for their children because they can pay for them, who have access to first-class health services, again because they can pay for them, and who do not have to worry about their old age because they can pay the necessary moneys to look after themselves in their old age.  That is a privileged society but is that really what the Taoiseach had in mind when he started out 40 years ago to try and build up a new Ireland, a new society?</P>
    <P>At the present time the trend, as I think I have shown here, is that there has been no real expansion in the purchasing power of the income of the wage earner and salary earner.  There has been, in my view, a disproportionate increase in profits made from the worker, and there has been practically a virtual standstill in the expansion of social services of one kind or another because various Ministers say that the money is not there to provide it. There have been continued decreasing opportunities in finding employment in the country and there has been continued <Col N="1983" /> emigration, as rural Deputies have pointed out, of disastrous proportions in country areas.</P>
    <P>The only development which has created a gloss of prosperity has been the great easing of cheap money and hire purchase facilities, which has spread here from Great Britain and which has put the consumer, the worker, the salary earner in the position of buying essentials&mdash;at any rate what have become essentials&mdash;under the hire purchase system.  The result is that the average white collar and working class family are up to their necks in debt to these hire purchase companies.  That is a very unhealthy situation and it is largely due to the fact that their purchasing power has not increased to any appreciable extent in the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Taoiseach seemed to hark back to the many speeches he made as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He did not really take into consideration the fact that he is now a person who has responsibility for over-all policy as it concerns all Government Departments and that, where they are defective, he should have tried to give us an explanation as to why they are defective and what steps he proposes to take to remedy the defects he finds in them.</P>
    <P>Of course the great trouble, as far as I can see, is that there will be no appreciable difference in financial and economic policy even if the principal Opposition Party goes back into power. That is one of the most distressing truths of political life in Ireland at present but, while I do not wish it on the Government, it seems to me that they will be facing up to a time of very great difficulty because of the failure of their agricultural policy, because of their failure to provide outlets for agricultural produce at stable, guaranteed prices and because, as has been shown by each of the consultative councils of the bodies set up to advise on the marketing of agricultural produce of one kind or another, they have failed over the past 40 years to provide the necessary marketing facilities for farmers.</P>
    <P>In addition to our internal problems <Col N="1984" /> it seems to me that the Government will be facing a really greater problem of a possible recession in Great Britain in which case, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, we on the periphery must be amongst the first to suffer because of the fact that British capital controls so many of our industries and there will be very little we can do about it.</P>
    <P>The curious inconsistency in the Taoiseach's policy is that he said we must bring in foreign capital.  I personally think that by the many excellent industries which he helped to establish he has disproved that.  But the inconsistency comes from the fact that, at the same time as he said we must have these foreign industrialists in the country, he boasted that in fact most of the capital invested in the new industries about which he was talking is Irish capital.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that when speaking today I would not have to refer to any of the &ldquo;opuses&rdquo; produced by Fianna Fáil when they were out of office but, in the course of Deputy Dillon's address, the Taoiseach flatly denied that he ever mentioned a policy of £100,000,000 and 100,000 jobs.  I quote now:</P>
      <P>Mr. Seán Lemass last night spoke to Comh-Comhairle Átha Cliath on Proposals for a Full Employment Policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>it goes on to mention the proposals</P>
      <P>...100,000 new jobs after five years.  It will be noted that in the first year of the proposed programme, it is contemplated that public investment outlay will be expanded by £13,000,000, raising national expenditure by £20 million and creating 20,000 new jobs.</P>
      <P>He goes on, of course, to fill up the whole 100,000 jobs.  That is dated October 15th, 1955.  Here it is in the paper, the one the Minister, or should I say, the President, owns, that is run for the Party and for the Party alone.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach also went on to say that he never promised anything about the food subsidies.  That stuck in my head because, on the Friday night before the general election in 1957, the then Taoiseach, now President, went down to Belmullet accompanied by an army with banners.  There was a promise to the farmers: &ldquo;Anything the Coalition promises to do, we can do better with the inspired leadership... We will call back the emigrants who during the dismal reign of the Coalition&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can produce the <i>Irish Press</i> for the Taoiseach.  As a matter of fact, I was thinking of getting it printed at my own expense and sticking it up again on the billboard the Taoiseach had it up on in Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the present Taoiseach came down to Waterford on the 1st March, 1957, he said practically the same thing as the former Taoiseach said in Belmullet.  There was a bit of collusion there.  I remember mentioning at the time that the present Taoiseach could not avail of the hospitality of the Fianna Fáil organisation in Waterford because he had to dash back to Dublin and get down to Burgh Quay to see that this got <Col N="1986" /> the prominence he wanted.  This is what he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Some Coalition leaders are threatening the country with all sorts of unpleasant things if Fianna Fáil becomes the Government&mdash;compulsory tillage, cuts in civil service salaries and a lot more besides.  A Fianna Fáil Government does not intend to do any of these things because we do not believe in them. How definite can we make our denial of these stupid allegations? They are all falsehoods.</P>
    <P>Earlier at Mallow, he gave utterance to this view:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Subsidies must be accepted as likely to remain a permanent feature in the Estimate unless a very steep fall in the cost of living takes place and that is not very likely, to put it mildly... I should like to express a personal viewpoint which I hold strongly, that the maximum advantage can be obtained by concentrating all the money that can be voted for subsidies on flour and bread alone.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach interrupted me, I was about to deal with the question of butter.  &ldquo;A Promise to Farmers to Maintain the Price of Wheat.&rdquo; This document was circulated in my constituency by the Fianna Fáil organisation. I have it here.  It was called: &ldquo;Full Employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>...A promise to farmers to maintain the price of wheat has been broken.  The drop in wheat prices threatened not only the farmers but the entire community which relies for its food on the farmers.  Yet, it is a bread and butter election.  The Coalition is taking the bread out of your mouths and is buttering you with the only butter they think you are worthy of&mdash;golden promises which are broken.</P>
    <P>The only trouble about the Taoiseach's promise was that it was not golden it was counterfeit.  It would be better for the Taoiseach to stand over that now and say: &ldquo;I said it.  I did trick the people.  I am in now and I intend staying in.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I intended reviewing the policies of a few Government Departments and <Col N="1987" /> I might as well commence with the Oireachtas.  A lot of sacrifices were made in order that this Parliament might be established.  A lot of people were starry-eyed looking forward to the day when Irishmen would come in here.  I was very pleased to hear some of my colleagues from the other side speak in Warsaw of the Parliamentary rights of our people.  They said that anybody here with a grievance could approach his Deputy and that Deputy could get an answer in this House from the appropriate Minister.  That is a most important right, and I do not think it is proper that Ministers should try, as they do, to avoid answering questions here.  It is most discourteous of them to refuse to answer questions when they have the information at their disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's policy in regard to our agricultural trade has been a failure.  You can judge by the results.  Prices are down and we are selling less produce.  But we did one thing with a great flourish of trumpets.  We voted £250,000 and we said that great things would be done.  We were going over to Great Britain and across the seas to find alternative markets and boost the markets we had.  We have not done anything.  Indeed, we appear to have depressed sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the salesmanship inherent in Irishmen was lost due to the policy of the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce because he created so many monopolies that the salesmen who had jobs in these factories had actually to <Col N="1989" /> be sent for by their customers if they did not call on them.  The whole race of salesmen or commercial travellers became representatives of monopolies and so they never had any experience of competitive selling.  That is one of the technical skills that we are short of in this country; people do not know how to sell things.</P>
    <P>We did have a man who knew how to sell things and in connection with that I shall come now to the Department of Lands and Fisheries and deal with the policy of that Department.

The Taoiseach and the present Minister for Industry and Commerce heavily escorted the Minister for Agriculture over to London when the Danes had already wiped our eye.

In the matter of Industry and Commerce, many industries have been set up in this country and they are practically monopolies. They have set themselves up so that they can do anything they like. They can supply certain people with the commodity they are manufacturing and they can deny that commodity to other people.  I think this is a very serious matter.  I have a case before me of a reputable manufacturer in this country who makes a very good product.  That manufacturer is protected and if somebody decides that he is going to open a business and sell that manufacturer's products, the manufacturer is in a position to say that he cannot do so, that he will not supply him.</P>

      <P>I think it is a matter of Government policy that they allow people to do that.  When these people will not sell their products to Irishmen the Minister should give an import licence to the Irishman who is trying to do that business.  He wants to buy the Irish article and they will not sell it to him.</P>
      <P>I do not know where I am in this matter of order and policy.  I did not want to repeat what Deputy Dillon has already said.  It would be very easy for me to go over the figures that he gave but instead I want to draw the Taoiseach's attention to certain aspects of the policy of different Departments.  It has been the policy of the Government to spend millions on arterial drainage; the figure is £13,000,000.  I would say that that expenditure is necessary but I should like to see some of the money spent in the south-east of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Regarding the policy of the Government and the state of the country I would say, having listened to the Taoiseach's speech about sunshine and roses in this country, that he is out of touch with the people down the country.  He is out of touch with the shopkeeper in the country town, with the small farmers and with the very small industries in the country towns. The man who is in business in a small way in the country towns is now in an awful state.  All his overheads have gone up and his sales are dropping every day owing to emigration.  Most of his customers have gone away.  I think I am in order in drawing the Taoiseach's attention to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I tried to raise and, on every occasion on which I brought it up, I was told that it was relevant to another Vote or that I should raise it at some other time.  That is the matter of another £250,000 voted in this House.  There has been a veil of secrecy over this. We do not know how it will be administered or what will be done with it. We only know that they are going to <Col N="1992" /> build the Abbey Theatre.  We do not know who will administer it.</P>

I was told that it was a matter for the Department of Finance who would be administering it.  Now, I do not know where I stand but, having said so much, I suppose I must be satisfied.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed, Sir, that you are not a little more lenient with me having regard to the manner in which I was treated yesterday by a Minister who forced me, aided by the Minister for Health, into raising a question on the Adjournment.  That comes up on the adjournment to-night or, I should say, in the morning.  I shall say no more about it but I want to say to the Taoiseach that this is no time for the complacency he has shown this evening. He was not in his old form last year; this year he was full of his old &ldquo;brass&rdquo;.  He put a brazen face on the whole business.  I quote the words he used: &ldquo;The keystone of our economy is the British market.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I bow to the Taoiseach. I want to say this now that the Taoiseach is here.  He has come a long way.  Those were fighting words at one time and if any man said them from a platform in any part of the country he would get his poll broken by Fianna Fáil supporters.  All I can say is that this must be a great country to have survived all these years of Fianna Fáil administration; a great country to have survived the last three years of what must have been a great disappointment to the people.  But the rumbling came in Kilkenny and I think the Taoiseach should take notice of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not seek political advantage <Col N="1993" /> when I say that this Government should pay more attention to the agricultural community, to the people living in the small towns and villages and to the fact that emigration is continuing. Instead of looking for industrialists at the ends of the earth they should look nearer home.  If the Government want to bring in more foreign industrialists they should endeavour to bring in American or British industrialists and not industrialists whose race our people hardly know.  So far as colours are concerned we do not know where we are with them now but I do not think we shall build up anything for ourselves by allowing Ireland be a place where these <i>entrepreneurs</i> will make their products to &ldquo;duck&rdquo; them into the British market under the imperial preference we enjoy.</P>
    <P>I do not think that bringing the Japanese into Shannon to make transistor sets will be of assistance to the very good radio factories here in Dublin making Pye and H.M.V. sets.  I never thought that I should say a good word about H.M.V. in Dublin.  However, we shall all be loyal to industries which pay good wages and give good conditions.  I know some Waterford people who have come to Dublin with H.M.V.; they are very good employers and make very good articles.  I doubt if it is a good policy to bring in the type of people that come from countries where it is known that the knockdown article as it is called, is the product of sweated labour.</P>
    <P>When the Government got into power the Taoiseach was very active, going to Paris, to O.E.E.C. meetings and various places investigating markets and seeing what countries he would tie up with.  But it was all on the &ldquo;never-never.&rdquo; We were told in the papers: &ldquo;Farm Income Level Cause of Concern... Farm Incomes Must Rise... Despondency Is Now Gone.&rdquo; I think it was a shame to fool people with that kind of thing.  There is something here about Deputy Corry being ordered to leave the House. Here is another: &ldquo;Our Standing Never Higher... Trade Talks Initiated.&rdquo; What happened about the trade talks? I should like the Taoiseach to answer. <Col N="1994" />&ldquo;European Trade Pacts... considered joining.&rdquo; We were just considering it but we are going on and on.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is now giving us the old line about increased production being the answer to every problem. Tell that to the farmers and I am afraid they will not swallow it; tell it to the factories.  I have a factory in Waterford in mind which gave great output and now their warehouses are full and their workers on one-third time.  That is not good.  That brings me to the important thing&mdash;what we really lack is salesmanship.  We are not selling our agricultural produce to the best advantage.  We had a claim the other day that our bacon made more in the British market than bacon from any other country.  I should like to know how many sides were involved.  The usual way I have seen bulk selling done for Ireland is to cut the price even though what they have to sell, whether butter or bacon, is as good as, or even better than the others because only the best in the top grades is shipped.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne spoke about setting-up State concerns.  I am afraid of State concerns when it comes to getting the goods sold.  Private enterprise, encouraged by the Government, is the best way to do it.  One of the most important tasks facing the Taoiseach and the Government is to ensure that our agricultural produce is sold to the best advantage, not only in the British market but in every other market to which it is possible to gain access.</P>
    <P>There was reference to countries with which we have an adverse balance of trade.  Our attitude towards these countries must be tougher.  If they do not remedy that imbalance, the Government should impose tariffs against their goods coming into this country and give preference to countries which buy our commodities. I have nothing further to say to the Taoiseach except that his brief this year is one of despondency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to occupy the time of the House with only two or, at most, three points of <Col N="1995" /> general Government policy or what I conceive ought to be general Government policy.  I appreciate the fact that the Taoiseach has carried on the practice of giving an economic review in opening the debate on his Estimate. The fact that I do not deal in any detail with the various economic topics to which he devoted attention does not in any way detract from my appreciation of his carrying on that practice. As I said, I have only two or three topics on which I propose to occupy the time of the House.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Taoiseach has given such a comprehensive review of the economic conditions of the country, even though people on this side of the House may not agree in every respect with what he said, is perhaps very largely due to the fact that he has continued what was very much in embryo in my time&mdash;an Economic Section advising him.</P>
      <P>The first point I want to make is that I approve of the setting up of that Economic Section but entirely disapprove of its having been transferred from his Department to the Department of Finance.  I should think that it would be very much in the interests of the present Taoiseach and in the interests of any future Taoiseach that such an Economic Section should be in his Department rather than in the Department of Finance.  Very good work for the country and for the assistance of whoever is Taoiseach can be done and ought to be done by such a section advising the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are fortunate at the present time in having an outstanding economist with wide views, liberal views, on economic affairs and even financial matters.  That may not always last. We know, and I think nobody knows better than the Taoiseach, the sort of narrow view that the Department of Finance has on projects of expansion and of expenditure and it would be for the public good and also for the benefit of the Government as a whole that such an Economic Section should advise him so that he can be in a position, with expert economic and financial advice of his own, to deal <Col N="1996" /> objectively with the views of the Department of Finance which must, in view of the functions that they have to fulfil under the Constitution and in the general administration of affairs in this country, be rather narrow in outlook and largely actuated by their negative attitude towards expenditure in general.  However, that is a matter that, I suppose, cannot be changed now but I would suggest to the Taoiseach that he should consider whether the suggestion I throw out would not be for the general public good, not merely in present circumstances but in any conditions that are likely to arise in future.</P>
    <P>I do approve of the policy&mdash;I think it has the approval of the Taoiseach&mdash; which was referred to by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Speech, of getting what are known as quality men in the Civil Service.  It is very important from the point of view of good administration, from the point of view of getting new ideas to meet changing circumstances in a very afflicted world, that we should have in our public service men, not merely of integrity and devotion&mdash;which we have in fact in abundance&mdash;but men of high quality, of intellect, of training and of specialised knowledge.  The fact that the Government have set about reorganisation of the Civil Service I hope will be all to the good and while it may result in less Government expenditure, I hope it will also result in the getting of the best possible brains in this country in the service of the policy that should be carried out by the present or any future Government.</P>
    <P>The first topic I want to emphasise arises out of some remarks the Taoiseach made in the course of his economic survey.  He drew attention to the fact, as he put forward, that there had been great expansion in the country, in our export trade, great expansion, also, in Irish industry, and that it was a matter of some gratification that many of the new projects which it is hoped will be established in the country are being financed by Irish finance and worked by Irish brains. That is a matter, of course, of gratification to all of us if it comes to fruition.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also referred to the <Col N="1997" /> increase in the capital coming in from outside.  We all know the dangers that may surround the investment of outside capital.  Equally, it was part of our policy over here to attract that capital. I may, perhaps, be allowed a passing feeling of gratification that it was in October, 1956, when I spoke at the Engineers' Hall that I announced the giving of the incentives which have resulted in such a wide expansion of our exports.  But the real point I want to make is that, whether it is Irish capital that is being invested in Irish industry in this country or in any Irish enterprise by which it is hoped to expand our economy and to give employment, there should be no feeling either in this country or abroad amongst people who have capital to invest that any of the incentives, inducements or encouragements that will be given through Government action or legislation of the Oireachtas in any way depend upon political patronage or political pull.</P>
    <P>I gravely fear that there is in existence amongst people, entrepreneurs and people with capital, the belief that it is a good thing to know somebody who has pull with the Government.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that in the public interest he should make it part of Government policy, made known to all and sundry in this country and outside it, that the inducements held out here at the taxpayers' expense, that the encouragement given through legislation and the welcome that is given by this Government or any Government to any person who risks his capital, whether he be a foreigner or an Irishman, depend upon the merits of the proposal and not upon any political pull he may have.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the remarks I am making here are not directed at any particular individual or individuals, at any outside people or at any member of the Government or any adherent of the Government.  It is a matter of such wide public concern and of such importance that it should be made as clear as noon-day that there is no foundation for the notion that a person will get benefits or advantages over a rival through political pull.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> That leads me to the second point which is really the general principle which governs the point I have stated. This Government ought to make it clear that it is their policy to exclude, as far as possible, all public patronage. We have got to the stage where the public interest demands that there should be an end to any Government patronage or any patronage through a particular Department or any appointment by the Government through a Department.  If I may be permitted to give one example merely to illustrate what I am saying, I think the situation that has developed in the appointment of rate collectors has become a public scandal.  This Government or any other Government of the Irish people would gain great prestige and increased respect if they combined with all Parties in this House and agreed that there should be an end to all political patronage so far as it can possibly be done.</P>
    <P>This is an important moment for me to raise this issue.  I know that political Parties have their followers who expect that if their Party becomes the Government something of what they call, or miscall I should say, the fruits of office, will be given to them. Very frequently votes depend on that and I know that a Party that goes out and says that political patronage will be no part of their policy may possibly lose votes.  My mind goes back to the early stages of this State when the Government under Mr. Cosgrave not merely announced their policy in that respect but got the necessary legislation passed through the Oireachtas&mdash; the Local Appointments Commissioners Acts, the Civil Service Commissioners Acts and other Acts&mdash;taking away their power of appointment or almost all their power of appointment to the local authority service and practically all appointments to the Civil Service.  It will be admitted now, after the experience of nearly thirty years, that those measures brought great unpopularity to Cosgrave's Government but in addition to that it must be admitted that they have brought great prestige to this country and great respect for the administration both of the Civil Service and the local authority service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> It would be something that would redound to the credit of the Government, although they might lose votes at the general election&mdash;certainly it would redound to the credit of this country&mdash;if all Parties in this State combined to put an end to political patronage of any kind and made it clear to everybody, in the State and outside the State, that the Civil Service has been carried on, as it has, with complete integrity, as have the Garda Síochána and the Army, and the local authority service to a considerable extent but not to the full extent, that there will be no more political patronage, that everybody will have equal opportunity no matter what Party he belongs to and no matter on what political principles he may rest his fate.</P>
    <P>This matter has been in my mind for a long time.  I think this is the proper time to do it before the general election is held.  It might mean a loss of votes but that is a passing thing for any Party.  If every Party in this country, now when there is not an immediate prospect of a general election, declared that that was a fundamental principle upon which all Parties in this State were agreed, great benefit would come and great respect would inure to the institutions of this State, and our own people, who perhaps sometimes, particularly the younger people who take a cynical view of our institutions, would at last rally round and see that they have a real Parliament, a real Government and real institutions in this State to which they could give their full allegiance and their profound respect.</P>
    <P>I hope I do not infringe the rules of order in referring to the last point I wish to mention.  It is a matter of Government policy on which I wish to make one point very briefly.  It was announced by the Taoiseach in the past few months that it was the intention of the Government to set up a Commission on Higher Education.  I impress upon the Taoiseach that when this Commission is being set up, it should be laid down as Government <Col N="2000" /> policy and as an instruction to the Commission which will advise the Government on higher education, that in their advice on University matters they must preserve the autonomy and the independence of University institutions.</P>
    <P>I listened with some concern to talk in the course of various debates recently with reference to University matters, it being stated that he who pays the piper must call the tune. Whatever may have gone on in connection with University matters recently, whatever anybody's views may be in reference to that, I urge upon the Minister in the public interest the necessity of its being Government policy and the subject of a Government direction to maintain the autonomy and the independence of the Universities.  There will, of course, have to be certain necessary safeguards but that fundamental principle should be laid down for any commission set up to consider higher education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will agree that indications which the Taoiseach made in his speech confirm the fact that 1959 was, generally speaking, a year of advance for the country.  From a superficial look at these indexes all would appear to be well with the future of our small State.  However, I do not think it is either wise or realistic to take one year, take out the satisfactory features and then sit back and regard all in the garden as being rosy.</P>
      <P>There have been, as I think the Taoiseach would be the first to admit, certain very cogent reasons why a substantial advance, particularly in the industrial sector, has been made during 1959 and I think it is not unfair to go back two or three years to find the reason for that advance and also to take a look into the future to see if we can anticipate these conditions continuing in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult when getting figures for the total number of persons employed to assess the value of the Government's economic policies over the past three years.  I have always found it one of the most difficult <Col N="2001" /> figures to get.  One can get figures at various times for industrial employment, at other times for agricultural employment but it is very difficult, indeed, to get a figure that relates to the total number of people in employment. It is not altogether sufficient to get regular weekly figures of the total number of persons on the live register.  These figures show a very encouraging trend over the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>Taken in isolation, it might be thought we are making very considerable progress in dealing with the problems of unemployment and emigration, but until the 1961 census is taken I think it would be quite unrealistic to believe our troubles in regard to these problems are solved.  First of all, any Government must have regard to the cost, in terms of capital outlay, of talking about solving the unemployment problem in this country. Over the past three years, we have spent a sum in excess of £100 million, but for that outlay there has been disemployment of some 50,000.  The advance made in the industrial sector has not been sufficient to offset the continuing disemployment in the agricultural sector or to take care of the natural annual increase in the population.</P>
    <P>The result has been that in spite of the falling number on the live register, heavy emigration has continued and indeed all the indications are that the trend has increased in the past year. It is quite true, as the Taoiseach has pointed out, that the downward trend in agricultural employment is world wide.  It has been estimated that in the European countries in general the downward trend has exceeded two per cent.  The difference between most European countries and our own is that increasing industrial sectors have taken care of the decrease in agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>Here we have to rely on the British economy to look after our people leaving the agricultural areas who cannot find employment in the industrial sector here.  There has been a good deal of talk about the Government's failure to deal with agriculture and the <Col N="2002" /> people living on the land.  Coming from a near-agricultural constituency, I can confirm that the falling numbers in the rural areas are having a disastrous effect on the country towns and villages.  In my own native city, which draws its prosperity largely from the rural hinterland, we suffer from the fact that, due to the decision of the Government not to extend to Limerick the benefits applicable to the underdeveloped areas and to our nearness to the Shannon Development area, we find ourselves between the devil and the deep blue sea.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that Limerick people should show greater initiative. But I would point out that Limerick is at a serious disadvantage which has been accentuated by the fact that, going 10 or 12 miles from the city, an industrialist can enjoy substantial benefits in the way of grants and so forth.  I would repeat a request I have made several times, not necessarily to extend the Undeveloped Areas Acts to include Limerick, but to grant similar benefits to specific important industrial projects which might be started in Limerick.  That would have very beneficial effects in a city which has been most unfortunate in industrial development in recent years.</P>
    <P>I think it would only be fair that some tribute should be paid to the previous Government for the unpleasant levies they had to impose in 1956, at a time of very serious crisis in our economy.  Charges of mismanagement have been hurled at them from the Government side of the House, but any fair-minded person will admit that from 1955 to 1957 was an extremely difficult period, not for reasons within the compass of the Government of that day.  The present Government were left to benefit by the imposition of the levies in 1956 and, subsequently, by their own action through the removal of the food subsidies which is still being reflected in Budgets.</P>
    <P>The Government have also been favoured by improving terms of trade over the past few years and by the fact that the British economy has served <Col N="2003" /> us in two very useful ways&mdash;one, taking our exports and, two, taking our surplus population.  Whether that will continue in coming years is a matter of grave doubt and I shall be referring to that later.</P>
    <P>The last Government and the present Government are to be complimented for the incentives they have given to industrialists to increase our exports to various markets abroad.  In spite of the strictures levelled at private enterprise, I think there has been a welcoming sign that industrialists in this country have become very much alive to the growing necessity for exporting our products.  That trend must continue; industrialists must be encouraged to continue that if the country is to expand its economy.</P>
    <P>The last Anglo-Irish trade agreement did confirm the very favourable position which we enjoy on the British market, with one exception, to which I alluded in my remarks at the time the agreement was signed&mdash;the duty on Irish-made cloth that has a manmade fibre content.  I understand from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that recent discussions have taken place on that particular imposition and I do hope, for the sale sake of the Irish clothing industry, particularly in relation to Limerick, that something will be done very soon to eliminate that discrimination.</P>
    <P>In taking credit for the terms of the Anglo-Irish trade agreement, it is well to have regard to the conditions in which that agreement will operate in the years ahead.  Almost concurrently with the signing of the agreement there had been very significant developments in European trade quarters in which Britain itself took a very important part.  One has been the formation of the European Free Trade Association or, as it is better known, the Outer Seven.</P>
    <P>One of the results of that has been that Denmark, against whose bacon products a tariff of ten per cent. had been imposed in past years, has succeeded in getting that lifted.  From now on the Irish farmer, who has been on lean times during the recent years, <Col N="2004" /> will have to compete against the very efficient Danish farmers on the British market.  That alone will make things extremely difficult for the Irish farmer. It will have the effect also that Irish industrialists who have been exporting their goods to England in increasing volume, will have to compete now on the British market with the efficient and, in most cases, larger plants of the other members in the group. When we come then to pat ourselves on the back and consider what a very advantageous position we have on the British market, I think it is as well to be realistic and to appreciate that, in the years ahead, that market will not be ours for the asking and we shall have a much tougher fight, not only to increase our exports to the British market but to maintain our present position there.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that whether we decide to join the &ldquo;Outer Seven&rdquo; or whether we decide to continue our present policy of remaining aloof from any entanglements with either the &ldquo;Outer Seven&rdquo; or the Common Market, we will of necessity have to make some form of trade association with other European countries.  If we do succeed in making these trade arrangements, and succeed in expanding our exports to the countries concerned, it is almost certain these countries will insist on a <i>quid pro quo</i> in the way of reduced tariffs to enable them to enjoy a share of our market.  It is not being too pessimistic, therefore, to anticipate that in a very short time we shall be faced with competition, not only abroad but also in our own at present highly protected home market.</P>
    <P>I wonder what plans the Government have prepared to deal with this, in my opinion, imminent situation. Have the Government made any assessment of the industries which are likely to expand and prosper in these wider trading groups?  Have they made any assessment of the industries that will inevitably go to the wall under conditions of free trade?  The situation calls for some very serious thinking on the part of the Government.  In fairness to the industries, or groups of industries, I think too that some plan <Col N="2005" /> should be forthcoming to let them know where they stand.  The Taoiseach and other members of the Government have appealed on many occasions for greater efficiency on the part of Irish industrialists and on the part of the Irish people generally. That is an appeal with which we all agree.  It is also one which we must, of necessity, support if we intend to expand our economy.</P>
    <P>I should like now to make an appeal to the Taoiseach to start at the top &mdash;however he will do it&mdash;and stop the mounting costs of public services; that is proving a greater detriment to the expansion of our economy than anything else.  Over the past ten years there has been something like a 70 per cent. increase in the cost of government. I agree with the Central Bank in its report the other day that the figure is a formidable one in our small economy with its limited resources. The best possible incentive that could be given to an expansion of our economy, particularly in the private sector, would be a substantial reduction in taxation.  That would have far more beneficial effects than taxing the private <i>entrepreneur</i> and using that taxation to subsidise industries which, if they had to survive on their own resources, would not be able to stand on their own two feet.  In conditions of free enterprise the private <i>entrepreneur</i> can make better use of his own capital than can a Government agency.</P>
    <P>Part of the result of rising Government expenditure has been the necessity to service a proportionately rising National Debt.  It is not without interest to note that the servicing of our National Debt now costs some 4/- in the £ as compared with 2/3d. in Great Britain.  That is a very significant feature.  The Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement said that there was a decline in the proportion of the national income spent on public services.  He also said that the proportion spent on public services was lower than that spent in many European countries.  He went on to say that there was no reason for complacency. Now, I do not think that <Col N="2006" /> the comparison is an altogether valid one because the countries to which he compared our economy are far richer.  Most of them are suffering from the aftermath of war and are compelled to finance a very heavy defence programme.  Our country has been burdened with neither of these disabilities.</P>
    <P>It is also true that the failure to expand our economy has in the past been due largely to the very poor return on both State investment and investment in the private sector.  The return we get compares very unfavourably with the return in other European countries.  I think that the calculation is one-third.  I believe that unsatisfactory return is now being remedied; I believe some step to remedy the position has been taken&mdash;wisely taken&mdash; by the Government judging by the publication of its recent five-year programme. It is obvious the Government realise that a trend towards more productive investment is absolutely necessary if we are not to dissipate our very scarce capital resources.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Taoiseach that the present five-year programme ought to be carefully screened again.  I am not satisfied with all the items in that programme.  I am not satisfied that those which are alleged to represent productive expenditure do, in fact, represent such expenditure in the correct sense of the term.  Even if the Government find, after the first year or two of operation, that it is not getting a sufficient return, either by way of capital or the vitally necessary increased employment, it should have the courage to revise the programme and deflect investment into more truly productive lines.</P>
    <P>If it is our intention to expand our economy to the extent to which it will almost certainly be necessary, the Government should ensure that a far greater proportion of our national income is invested for productive purposes. We may have to think in terms of 20 per cent. of our national income. Instead of £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 per annum, we shall have to talk about £120,000,000.  That will call for very radical changes in many of <Col N="2007" /> our ways of living.  It will mean a considerable increase in savings both public and private.  It will mean inevitably the imposition of many restrictions which we do not have to suffer today.</P>
    <P>If we are to be serious in expanding our economy and providing the necessary investment to do that, we may have to put up with restrictions and impositions that we do not worry about at the moment.  If it is necessary to expand capital investment, both in the State and the private sector of the economy, the Government should take their courage in their hands and impose whatever restrictions are necessary to achieve that aim. A programme of the size I have mentioned will certainly call for very strict supervision of Government expenditure, and will certainly entail a very great departure from many of the economic shibboleths preached principally by the Taoiseach's own Party over the last 20 or 25 years, but I think the Taoiseach has shown that he himself is not afraid to depart from some of the treasured ideas held by his Party in the past.  If he takes his courage in his hands I am sure he will get support, not only inside his own Party but outside it.</P>
    <P>Another speaker has dealt with the merits and demerits of what he called private enterprise.  I think it is generally held that there is place for both State and private enterprise here, and that of necessity the State had to step in where private enterprise was unable to do the job.  I am not one of those who subscribe to the opinion that private enterprise has failed.  There are many reasons, historical and otherwise, why private enterprise has not expanded here to the extent that it has in other countries, but I hold that private enterprise must undertake certain types of enterprise in which the State cannot usefully take part, and I think we must give it a fair reward. In recent years I think that has been realised in the export incentives and tax inducements which have been provided. Certainly they were a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to urge on the Taoiseach the necessity of spending <Col N="2008" /> more on education, particularly technical and technological education.  In the final analysis, if we did not invest in our most important raw material, that is our young people, to give them an opportunity to earn a future for themselves and the country, all the money spent on grandiose projects of one kind or another would be completely wasted.</P>

      <P>Following from that, I am convinced that the only firm basis for the survival of human relations or political relations, either internally or internationally, must be the truth. When the use of the truth falls into abeyance, either by neglect or by the deliberate act of those whose responsibility it should be to defend it in all its aspects, then public institutions, public men and all the framework of a community or a State will fall asunder if given sufficient time.  There has to be somebody, or some body of people, who must combat that process&mdash;the process of, on the one hand, allowing the truth to fall into abeyance or, on the other hand, permitting its deliberate neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with that in mind I confess that some few months ago, when Deputy Dillon as Leader of the Opposition, casually inquired of the <Col N="2009" /> Taoiseach about the now notorious 100,000 jobs and the Taoiseach replied that to attribute that statement to him was unjust and unfair, I gasped in horror at such a deliberate and wanton betrayal of the truth and such a shameless denial of what he had undoubtedly said.  During the Carlow-Kilkenny by-election campaign when, because of speeches from those opposing his Party or questions put to him at one meeting, the Taoiseach even as late as that, impliedly admitted he said on that occasion in Clery's Ballroom that 100,000 jobs could be achieved within five years by the injection of £100,000,000 into the economy, and that all he asked was the co-operation of the people to bring that about.  He impliedly admitted that when, in relation to the unemployment figures prevailing at the time of the by-election, he said that what was needed now were 50,000 new jobs to meet the situation as he then saw it.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any new jobs that have been created, except jobs within the Government itself.  One of them has resulted in higher fares and fewer trains.  The other has resulted in a state of business chaos among the community of licensed traders and those who work for them, in this city and in the seaside resorts of our country. A vital blow has been struck at tourism through the miscalculated position obtaining under the recent Licensing Act, a situation which to-day has seen a prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Burke from County Dublin, owing to the unsatisfactory nature of the replies he received on this matter, wanting to raise on the Adjournment something for which a bare few months ago, due to the ill-conceived direction of the Whips of his Party, he was forced to walk into the Division Lobbies to vote, something which he knew even then would be to the detriment of the people he represented.  I look forward to his raising it on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>Deputy John A. Costello has raised a subject about which I must say I myself, and certainly my Party, feel very strongly.  He referred to the loss sustained by the then Government of the country under Mr. Cosgrave by the <Col N="2010" /> institution of the Local Appointments Commission, and the successful attempt in those days to encourage the motto of fair play for all, and appointments by merit and merit alone.  It is true to say that during the reigns of successive Governments the Local Appointments Commission has been preserved.  I believe that even in the worst days, the early days, of Fianna Fáil the spirit of the Local Appointments Commission was preserved but damage was done to it by Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party up and down the country making people believe that the Appointments Commission could be got at or interfered with.</P>
    <P>It is that kind of propaganda that damages institutions deserving of our respect, institutions that should command a position of very great prestige in our community.  That propaganda applies not alone to the Local Appointments Commission and to its working; it applies to every single post in this State from the very top to the bottom.  I have no hesitation in charging the Fianna Fáil Party through their propaganda with establishing in the minds of the people the false notion that it is only through them, either collectively or individually, that people can obtain that to which they are really entitled by the statute law of this country and by regulations made thereunder.</P>
    <P>To my own knowledge some Deputies have reduced this thing to a fine art.  I heard a story the other day that a Deputy is able to convince people in his constituency that he can be most influential in the matter of getting a driving licence for somebody, and he operates that successfully.  That is bringing Parliament and its members into very grave disrepute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Taoiseach ever did.  But I think the Taoiseach knows as well as I do that the notion has been very carefully <Col N="2011" /> and successfully established in the minds of the people, principally by the members of his own Party. There are cases where the fruits of Government will naturally go to Government supporters in the absence of any other scheme to avoid that.  I refer to the appointment of members of the Judiciary, the appointment of the Attorney-General and such other appointments as do not come within the framework of the Appointments Commission or some similar institution. But at all other levels the very idea of patronage could be removed from the minds of the people by an advisory service side by side with the services available to the people but about which they are not too clear.</P>
      <P>I am referring in particular now to the services for which the Tánaiste is responsible&mdash;the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare.  I must say that the Tánaiste is to be complimented on the excellent book on the health services he has sent out to Deputies.  It is a valuable composition and it is one that, if expense would allow, he might consider sending to every county manager, county councillor and urban councillor in this country.  It would let the people know they have these services, and Fianna Fáil would no longer be able to operate on the basis that they, and only they, from Deputies down to town commissioners, can get something for a person to which that person is entitled in law, thereby building up a reputation on completely false premises.</P>
      <P>In the matter of Government policy as far as education is concerned, I think there is something in what Deputy J.A. Costello has urged in relation to matters which have been referred to the Commission, that the Commission would be best directed to consider methods rather than to foist a policy on a Government through its report.  The Government itself should have the fundamentals of its policy and the Commission would be the channel through which the best methods might emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach cannot feel too happy &mdash;and I am sure he does not&mdash;about <Col N="2012" /> the situation with regard to unemployment and emigration.  I know he will urge that unemployment figures have fallen considerably.  I know they have, but that has been due to two reasons. One is seasonal and the other is emigration.  I think there are 51,000 fewer people in insurable employment than there were two or three years ago. Put that with the figure for those who have emigrated and we have a figure of 106,000 odd for the years 1957-58. They have been going steadily ever since.  But as I said on other Estimates, principally the Estimate for Agriculture, I can well understand the necessity, particularly on the smaller holdings where the families are relatively large, for their having to go. Their remittances help to bridge the gap between the income of the small holding from its various sources and what has to be paid for the maintenance of the family remaining on it.  But that is not what is happening at present.</P>
    <P>The pattern of emigration now in rural Ireland is a picture that is pathetic in the extreme, and it will be extremely damaging to the country as a whole if it is allowed to develop. Whole families are now taking flight. The reason is that they are unable to bear their family budget with the resources at their disposal, either through the sale of what they produce or even with the help of the social welfare benefits obtainable.  They have given up the struggle.  It has become unequal.  It is worthy of note that that struggle really became unequal since the Budget of 1957, the policy of which was to raise the price of essential foodstuffs, and that policy has been incorporated in our national Budgets since.</P>
    <P>It is good to know that, side by side with this picture of gloom, the incentives given to our industrialists are beginning to bear fruit.  We on this side of the House can take credit for having conceived the idea and the Government can take credit for having realised it was a good idea and putting it into operation.  That may be a good policy as a part-time policy to get things under way, but for how long can incentives costing so much be continued?  I have read that the <Col N="2013" /> Taoiseach said, and I think I have heard him say on a few occasions since he became Taoiseach, that the day was fast approaching when the whole tariff policy of this country would have to be reviewed and when it would be necessary to be in a position to compete with those offering similar services in other countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell referred to the high cost of Government.  I remember the Minister for Finance, when introducing his first Budget, promising that that cost would be reduced.  I do not think the reduction, if any, has been considerable, nor do I think that the two things announced in relation to the civil service will be as good as people think.  It would be well if the Government examined the matter of University education in the light of its contractual nature.  How can they force anyone trained in law, economics or anything else to remain as servants of the Government when they can command a job worth three times the amount of money in this country or elsewhere?  All they could do is to take back the fees spent on the education.  It is unfair to the people already in the service and it is not a system of recruitment that would give the best value.  If you want to attract people of that kind you must create a special grade and pay them. The abolition of the clerical officers grade for men is one which will result in more emigration of our manhood and we shall reach the stage eventually when our civil service will be composed, in the main, of women.</P>
    <P>Much has been said, not only on this Estimate, about private enterprise. I think we would all agree with the sentiment expressed by Deputy Russell that private enterprise should be the basis of our industrial expansion except where the enterprise is of such a stature that it cannot be undertaken by private individuals.  I do not accept for a moment the views expressed by Deputy Dr. Browne that Socialism is the answer and that everything should be done by State enterprise.  I can see the danger into which that could lead us.  I would rather have private enterprise and have the strike weapon left in the hands of the workers, even <Col N="2014" /> if it is abused, than a regimented community in which individual rights would be suppressed and in which freedom would no longer exist.</P>
    <P>The prosperity of this or any other country must be based on long term planning.  The plan must have as a necessary ingredient the fact that it is propagandised as a long term plan so that the people can accept it as such and take the good year with the bad year.  It is no use growing something this year, having a bumper crop, growing much more next year, having a bad crop and then growing nothing the following year.  That is bad economics.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach will put the best face on things and will continue to use the expression used by himself and other Ministers from time to time in this House or throughout the country that everything is well, that things are beginning to take a turning for the better, that prosperity is looming up ahead.  All these statements make queer reading, indeed, for our agricultural community who are bringing their cattle on fruitless drives to the fairs, to the people who are travelling by bus and by train from the furthermost parts of the country in an effort to get work elsewhere.</P>
    <P>What is the basis for these happy pronouncements?  Are there figures to show that there has been an increase in employment, that there has been a decrease in emigration, that the drift has been halted?  I think the Taoiseach would do well, even at this late hour, and would do himself a great personal service and the office he holds a greater service, if he admitted here and now that on the 11th November 1955 he did have a plan for 100,000 new jobs by the injection of £100,000,000 into the economy of the country, that he was mistaken, and that it was something that did not prove feasible when he came into office.  That would be the honourable course to take.  I am not suggesting that the Taoiseach is not capable of taking an honourable course.  I believe he is, that he should do so and that if he does it might be a turning point in the thinking of our people who have come to regard all of us here as people who have no word, who are capable of promising anything <Col N="2015" /> at the moment to bring us an immediate reward instead of contemplating what is best for our people and devoting our thoughts, words and actions to their benefit in so far as the power within us lies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Slightly over 12 months ago the present Taoiseach's name came before the House for nomination as Taoiseach.  I happened to speak that night and I made a statement that some people throughout the country could not understand that I was sorry I would have to vote against him because, in my years in the House from 1943, I looked on Deputy Lemass, later Minister for Industry and Commerce, as a decent man.  The reason I gave for voting against his nomination was that I believed the people I represented, the people in rural Ireland, thought he would not be a suitable person, as he held the city outlook.</P>
      <P>I could not blame him for that.  He is a city-born man, but I gave it as my reason for voting against him.  I listened to him here this afternoon in his introduction of his Estimate and he glossed over rural Ireland and only referred to its problems in passing.  He even went so far as to say that, as far as agriculture was concerned, that Estimate had been discussed and he would not touch it again.  To make things worse he referred to another very important item.  I shall not refer to the 100,000 new jobs; they have now grown into 100,000,000 new jobs, they have been mentioned so often.</P>
      <P>He just told us that a few Japs, a few Germans and a few Americans are about to start something in some part of Ireland and that round the corner there will be employment some time. What good will that employment be when all our people have gone away? In the last four years 200,000 left the land; 50,000 a year went.  Yet, after nearly 18 months in office, the Taoiseach introduces his Estimate and just glosses over rural Ireland and over agriculture, the backbone of the nation.  That cannot be denied.  I am sure Deputy Corry will tell him that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach knows that he has behind him a group who will do what <Col N="2016" /> they are told and as they are told and nod every time he tells them nod in the appropriate direction.  When the vote is taken at 2 o'clock, or whenever it is taken, he will have a majority, all ordered to get away until October 26th and come back again.  When I was a young lad I was told stories.  I was told that in certain parts of Ireland people sometimes found what was called the leprechaun.  If you could catch one&mdash;he was always at the end of the rainbow&mdash;he would surely show you where there was a crock of gold. Listening to the Taoiseach to-night&mdash; not that I want to make the comparison&mdash;it struck me that if anyone ever acted the leprechaun it was the Taoiseach in telling us that if you keep on around the corner there is gold but you must keep turning and keep on the road.  It is as likely a story as that of the leprechaun and his crock of gold.  We shall never reach it but it is always coming.</P>
    <P>Whether the Taoiseach knows of them or not, it is my job to tell him of the antics of Fianna Fáil throughout the country.  In Galway&mdash;I am glad to see one Galway Deputy here at the moment&mdash;there is a County Council on which Fianna Fáil, I regret to say, have a majority.  That is not my fault. Not so long ago a resolution was passed unanimously by that Council with its Fianna Fáil majority.  I think it was proposed by a Fianna Fáil T.D. who is a councillor.  That resolution was to the effect that the Local Authorities (Works) Act be restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows the fraud of Fianna Fáil.  That is what I am trying to point out.  As you have made the ruling, I shall come to the Estimate. One section of the community the Taoiseach, the Government or any future Government must look after is the small tillage farmers.  They are the backbone of the nation.  The position in the west of Ireland to-day is that the man with the holding of £10 to £20 valuation has gone away.  In former days the father or mother of a family selected what they considered the best member of the family to whom to give the place.  Now the entire family emigrate and in many cases the father and mother emigrate with them, the key is turned in the lock and the house is left derelict.  In the village where I live there were 11 families at one time.  To-day there are only seven. <Col N="2019" /> The reason is that the small farmer has to depend on a few cattle, a few sheep, a pig and what he can get for potatoes or the few acres of crops that he raises.  Last year the few sheep that he had could not be sold.  In the later part of last year he had to pay £22 and £24 each for suck calves. Having kept them for 12 months, he will not get what he paid for them 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>The potato crop last year was good. I am afraid it will not be as good this year.  Last year the potatoes had to be thrown by the ditch.  The farmer had to sell them in the market at 3d. a stone in Galway and Mayo.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry often refers to wheat. We have not land in the West on which to grow wheat.  The only crop for which the small farmer in the west of Ireland got any return was beet, for which he had the slave labour of his own family that he could not afford to pay.  This year a farmer who wanted to add a half acre or a rood to his acreage of beet was told that he could not do it.  The reason for that is that there is a certain penal tariff imposed by the British Sugar Board. That penal tariff cost us over £800,000 on sugar that we exported last year. The tariff on the sugar we exported was distributed to our competitors from Commonwealth countries who were exporting sugar to England.  I would ask the Taoiseach and the Government to see that that penal tariff be abolished so that the small farmer can grow whatever acreage of beet he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach may talk about industries to be established.  The one industry that has proved its worth and that will not be rooted out of the country is the sugar industry.  The reason for that is that the raw material is produced at home and our people produce that raw material willingly. In no small way the success of that industry is due to the General Manager. He recognised the producer and regarded him as of first importance.  He appreciated the producer and looked after him.  The credit for the establishment of the industry goes to the first Government that we had.  For the <Col N="2020" /> success that has attended it the General Manager deserves credit.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Taoiseach made certain reference to &ldquo;the Government of Northern Ireland.&rdquo; I could hardly believe it.  As far as we are concerned and as far as the Constitution is concerned, there is no such thing as &ldquo;the Government of Northern Ireland.&rdquo; There is a puppet Government holding six of our northern counties. It is not the Government of Northern Ireland.  I hope I shall not hear from the Taoiseach again the expression, &ldquo;the Government of Northern Ireland.&rdquo; There is no such thing.</P>
    <P>Not long ago Deputy Booth, referring to a remission of death duties, said that this was the dearest country in the world in which to die.  I do not know about that because I have not died yet but I know it is the dearest country to live in.  Fianna Fáil have made it dear for the man who has to live in it and, according to Deputy Booth, it is the dearest country to die in.</P>
    <P>I have given as honestly as I can my views in relation to rural Ireland. I would ask the Taoiseach to turn his attention in that direction.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance said recently by way of interruption that the small farmer is getting everything, that he is getting a reduction in rates.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the land of this country soon will not be worth the poor rates on it.  The main cause of the increase in the poor rates was the abolition of the food subsidies by Fianna Fáil.  When there was an increase in the price of food supplied to institutions the county councils had to increase the rates accordingly. Wages were increased to meet the increased cost of living caused by the abolition of the subsidies.  That reacted on the local authorities and, in turn, on the ratepayers.  The result is that at the moment in many parts of the west of Ireland the land is not worth the poor rates levied on it.  I would appeal to the Taoiseach to reconsider the question of the subsidies. People at one time used to buy a bag of flour; today they are buying only a stone of flour, which is all they can <Col N="2021" /> afford.  I would ask him to restore the subsidies and to restore the Local Authorities (Works) Act, two things which were of importance to our people.  Tribute should be paid to the late Tadhg Murphy, who as Minister for Local Government introduced that Act.</P>

      <P>I am simply asking the Taoiseach to restore the Act.  It should be remembered that it is the tenant farmers, the people on the land who are the mainstay of our economy. The people in other industries are only trafficking in money, buying a pound's worth and selling it for £1 1/- or £1 5/-, whatever they can get for it.  Any new money coming into this country, apart from what our emigrants are sending in, is coming from the land.  It is gained by the toil and sweat of the workers on the land.  Those are the people who should get first consideration, regardless of what Government is in power.  They are the people who are leaving us.  The more of them who go the greater the loss will be and when they have all gone there will be no use in complaining about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the Trade Agreement and the breach of the Trade Agreement which, as has been admitted on all sides now, has been committed.  I am referring to Deputy Dillon's statement on Article 5 of the 1948 Trade Agreement which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government of the United <Col N="2022" /> Kingdom undertook that where goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland are dutiable at preferential rates of duty they will not vary the existing preferential treatment of these goods in such a way as to put any class of goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland at a disadvantage in relation to goods of that class from other sources enjoying preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>I hold that the present levy placed on sugar and sugar goods leaving this country for Britain is a breach of that clause of the agreement inasmuch as that levy has been used for the purpose of subsidising against our produce the produce of the Commonwealth countries sending sugar to Britain.  It represents a market of £2,000,000. In speaking of the position of farmers I have in mind what Deputy Donnellan said: he took up a line here by listening to what I have been stating since last January on this matter.  I also have in mind the position of farmers in my own constituency where this is practically a life and death matter as it is for the tillage farmers of Wexford, Tipperary, Kilkenny and Carlow.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should take up this matter immediately with the British Government.  We have from now until next October when the next beet contracts will be issued.  When the beet contracts are issued it will be too late to look for an increased acreage of beet or to look for that market to which we of the agricultural community are entitled just as the people manufacturing artificial manures or manufacturing agricultural machinery for our use, are entitled to preference and to protection of their markets here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan gave a reason why the sugar industry was a good one.  I put forward the greatest reason of all, that is, that a body of us farmers drawn from different Parties&mdash; Deputy Lehane from the Farmers' Party, the late Deputy Hughes from the Fine Gael Party, the late Deputy Beegan from our Party and myself&mdash; came together and laid down the political franchise of the agricultural community, <Col N="2023" /> that they should be paid for the produce of their land at least the cost of production plus a fair profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair rules on that line&mdash;that agriculture is not relevant on this Vote&mdash;then I would ask the Chair why agricultural policy &mdash;the production of beet and of the sugar which we use&mdash;was not relevant on the Vote for Agriculture or on the Vote for Industry and Commerce last week.  All I can do is to refer the whole matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which I shall do very definitely.  If the Chair rules me out of order in this way, I shall not go any further on it except to appeal to the Taoiseach on this Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, while he has the opportunity now, to see that a market worth £2,000,000 to our farmers is preserved. On the general Estimate, I should like to raise the position in regard to beet and sugar but I have been ruled out of order.  I am referring that to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges together with the stopping of my references to the position during the debate on Industry and Commerce and Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be discussed in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  As regards farmers leaving the rural areas, I should like to deal with two points of view.  I should like to allude to the position in respect of the wages paid in agriculture as compared with those of workers in industrial pursuits in this country.  The wage under which beet is produced in this country is £5 10s. per week for a labourer.  It is upon that wage that the costings of beet production are made up.  Compare that with the wage paid in any industry.  If a young man <Col N="2024" /> employed as an agricultural labourer at £5 10s. walked into Irish Steel Holdings he would get £12 a week. Would he not be a damned idiot if he did not take it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The wages paid to agricultural workers are not relevant on this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the position in industry where a labourer can get a wage of £12 a week by comparison with the position obtaining in agriculture is relevant.  We in the agricultural areas, on account of the prices we get for our produce, cannot pay a higher wage than that.  We, too, find that costs are going up.  Our rates have practically doubled in ten years due to the Health Act and all those other Acts.  But the prices we get for our produce have been reduced.  That is why you have the doors locked and the farmers gone.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Taoiseach and the Government on behalf of my constituents for the work they have done in the past three years, as far as the area I represent is concerned. You cannot find to-day in my constituency ten men looking for work. In fact, we have to go up to Mayo, to Deputy Lindsay's area, when we want workers to single our beet or to harvest it.  We are looking for those men who had previously to go to try and find work in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very glad to come and they get much better conditions from us than from the farmers in Britain; at least we treat them like human beings.  I would remind Deputies of the appeals which the former Deputy O'Gorman, who represented the constituency with me, made in years gone by when he had to stand up here and make appeals from the bottom of his heart for the unfortunate unemployed men in Youghal.  Where are they to-day?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies might like to hear it.  Welcoming teachers <Col N="2025" /> last year when they held their Congress in Youghal, Mr. O'Gorman told them: &ldquo;Welcome to a historic town which has no unemployment.&rdquo; I was very glad when I opened the newspaper this morning to find that the wire factory there is being extended and giving employment to a further 80 hands in a town which already has no unemployment. The people who have gone to England can come back to us.  We shall give them work.  What a change this is in the past few years.  The same applies to Midleton.  To-day you cannot find an unemployed man there.  In that background we must recall the conditions at the end of 1956 and early in 1957, under Deputy Lindsay's Government. Over 100,000 workers were queueing up looking for work because the local authorities had no money, because there was no confidence in the Government, because nobody was prepared to invest money in industry.  We must remember that state of affairs in which a Government were driven from office three years after coming in because they had no money to pay off their debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the Vote for £250,000 which was passed here in 1953, for the extension of the Irish Steel Mills at Haulbowline.  What became of that money?  To what use was that money put which was intended for the extension of an industry?  Why was it that that extension stopped three months after the Fianna Fáil Government left office?  That was the position until Deputy Seán Lemass came back again to turn the wheels of the mills and get them going.  For once let us look things in the face and let us look at them as we find them.  Every week for the past four months 50 men have travelled over there to work, an extra 50 every week for that industry.  That is the position now.  Before we took over office in 1932 you had an auction of scrap and machinery at Haulbowline every six months.  That was the only time you saw any activity there except for a few caretakers who were strolling around pretending to oil the works. To-day that island is a hive of industry. To-day on that island there are over 600 men permanently employed in Irish Steel and the outlook is that <Col N="2026" /> within the next two years that number will have increased to 1,000.</P>
    <P>That is a change.  That is the outlook, that the young men will no longer have to go abroad to look for employment.  That is the change which you can see on the spot and I invite any Deputy to come and look over the works himself.  At Rush-brooke Dockyard there are 400 men busily employed in building a new dockyard and anybody who reads the newspapers will have seen that the first group of our young men have come back from Holland, fully trained, to start work as steel workers and over 200 more have been called in for training.  That is a change which I have witnessed in my own constituency. Those are the facts and nobody can deny them.</P>
    <P>I am not at all selfish and I should like to see something being done for Fermoy which is the one blot left in my constituency.  I should like to see some industries being started there to give employment.  I should like to see industries started in an area in which I travelled during the recent county council elections&mdash;places such as Skibbereen and Clonakilty which require industries.  The openings are there and with a little encouragement the people will get the industries going and give employment to their people. That is what is required.  What was required at first was to make the people confident that the Government would help them.  That confidence was not there and therefore there was nothing done whilst the inter-Party Government were in office.  That was their record.  The people had no confidence that if money were voted for an industry, or for the extension of an industry, they would get the money, as happened in the case of Irish Steel.  So far as the young people are concerned I have the utmost confidence that with the extension of industry we shall find further employment for them.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that most of us can find grounds for growling off and on about this, that or the other thing, but what we are all concerned with is that we should not have any district <Col N="2027" /> in which the father and mother are rearing up a family with only one out-look&mdash;the emigrant ship.  I am sure if Deputy T. Lynch spoke the truth he would say there have been many changes and many industries started in his county since he saw the inter-Party Government leave office in 1957.</P>

      <P>Earlier to-day I mentioned <Col N="2028" /> that on the adjournment last year I received no opportunity of making my contribution.  I want the Chair to understand that I do not think the ruling is unfair in any way. I think the Chair is pretty fair in spite of the views of some Deputies. At least I get a fair hearing.  I suppose with 147 Deputies an Independent Deputy cannot expect too much in proportion to the numbers of each of the groups here.  I came here as an Independent and I was sent here by people who have little faith in Parties.  They are a considerable number judging by the apathy in the recent municipal elections.  I represent a good many of them.  However, having being sent here I intend to say my piece and I am not claiming to be always an expert.  But 80 per cent. of the people are not experts.  Nevertheless they have certain feelings and they expect me to speak for them.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker always puts up a fairly good show, but I am not fully in agreement with him that there is as much prosperity in the country as he says.  He may be fortunate enough in parts of his constituency, but I represent a Dublin constituency and I am aware that there are at least 20,000 unemployed persons in Dublin. I am not aware of any factories that have been opened in Dublin in the past 12 months and I am certainly not aware of any unemployed manual workers who have found employment in the past 12 months.  I am aware that factories have been opened from time to time which employ girls, but I do not know that the employment of girls is of any great assistance to a family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment of manual workers would mean an income of £8 per week to a family, but the employment of a girl under 16 years of age means only 25/- a week to a family.  Over 16 years of age the wage would be £2 per week, and the maximum is £4 per week in the case of a girl over 18 years of age.  As Deputies can see a factory can employ four girls of 16 years for the price of one labouring father or son.  That is what I mean when I say that the type of employment obtainable in Dublin is mainly <Col N="2029" /> for girls.  That is why there are so many unemployed manual workers in Dublin, and it is on their behalf I speak.</P>
    <P>I am not an authority on agriculture and I shall leave that to other members of the House.  I am not an authority on a number of matters, but on some matters I have as good a knowledge as anybody else and, as I say, I speak on these matters on behalf of a vast number who want me to speak about the things they need, things which were promised to them. They want to know why the things they were promised have not been delivered.</P>
    <P>We had a wealth of discussion here tonight about the promises made by the Fianna Fáil Party.  All Parties make promises.  I heard one speaker mention a man who said he was a millionaire because he worked hard and told the truth.  Machiavelli says differently.  It has been my experience that it is very difficult to succeed in politics by telling the truth.  I know that every time people come to me looking for houses I tell them they have no chance.  They go away, saying: &ldquo;You are no use&rdquo;.  My wife often says to me: &ldquo;Do not always tell the truth; say you will do the best you can&rdquo; but that would be tantamount to a lie, and I will not tell a lie.  I can quite see it is very difficult to succeed in politics by telling the truth.</P>
    <P>I suppose, if the Fianna Fáil Party are blamed for telling lies, they are just doing what other Parties do to succeed.  It may be their own fault but I suppose Parties who tell the truth would not succeed in being returned to office.  By telling lies, and big lies, one can succeed&mdash;at least so the Baron said.  However, it is my job as an Independent to call the bluff of the Parties.  Fianna Fáil happen to be in power at present, and I shall certainly do my best to call their bluff. On another occasion, if I happen to be here, I shall call the bluff of other Parties who may be in power.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the present Government that in spite of their promises of 100,000 jobs, and their later statement <Col N="2030" /> about putting husbands back to work, so far as Dublin city is concerned, very few husbands have been put back to work; only children of 15 or 16 years of age have been put to work.  I should like to remind the Taoiseach that about a year ago I put down a Question asking what work of a constructive nature he had in mind in order that manual workers would obtain employment and he said he was prepared to consider schemes of economic merit and to encourage local bodies to put up proposals.  We in the Dublin Corporation had a long session dealing with these proposals but, to my mind, we might as well have been dealing in red herrings.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unfair to the Taoiseach.  I believe he is a man with his head on his shoulders and his feet on the ground.  The fact that I make that statement about the Taoiseach, does not mean that I think the same about his Party.  I believe he has done as much as any Party leader could do. What he has failed to do, of course, is to implement the promises he made&mdash; particularly the promise about putting so many people into work.  The people are anxious to know what hopes they have of work, especially work of the magnitude he promised.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the whole policy here is productivity, and to me that means more production at less cost.  How that can create employment beats me, because if more is to be produced people will produce that more at a lesser cost, and they can do so only by the use of machinery or automation, or by employing fewer people.  How the Taoiseach hopes to implement his promises of employment, I should like to know.</P>
    <P>Again, as I say, while he may create employment for certain technicians and children, how he hopes to create employment for the manual workers, and particularly for the manual workers in Dublin, I should like to know.  One of the reasons the people sent me here was to put questions to those who made promises, to make difficulties for the Government by asking awkward questions.  That is my policy here.  It will continue to be my policy to ask the straight questions: <Col N="2031" /> when are they going to produce the goods they promised?  When are they going to ease the position in Dublin city for the 20,000 unemployed workers?</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters which I think are the responsibility of the Taoiseach.  I want to mention one matter because I think it should be mentioned on the Adjournment Debate.  I refer to the Partition of this country.  I realise that nothing much can be done.  Nevertheless, it is one of the problems of the State and it is one of the Taoiseach's responsibilities. Mention of Partition should at least be made.  If we reach the stage at which we no longer want to bother, at which we no longer think it worth mentioning, we shall reach the stage which has been reached in Scottish and Welsh politics where the freedom of those countries is no longer a matter of practical politics.  We shall reach the stage, as far as the North is concerned, at which we shall cease to have hope.</P>
    <P>That will be the position if we cease to talk about Partition.  If it were nothing other than just talking about it and making a protest we should do so at all times on the Adjournment of this House.  Some reference should be made to Partition if for no reason other than to maintain that passion for independence which seems inborn in us.  If we ever lose that passion and that interest, Partition will cease to be a matter of any political importance in the country.  I shall mention it on each occasion, even if nothing comes of it.</P>
    <P>I hope I shall not have to walk to Portmarnock tonight.  That is where I reside.  I am bound to get a lift. I consider it my duty to stay and to say a few words on behalf of the people who sent me here.  I want to protest against the magnitude of unemployment in the city of Dublin. On the national plane, I want to protest against the continuation of Partition, even if nothing can come of it, because it is our duty to refer to it and to protest.  I will say for the last Taoiseach that at all times he referred to it.  While nothing much can be done, it is our duty never to forget that the problem is there.  It is a problem just <Col N="2032" /> as unemployment is a problem and with these two issues I am particularly concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>As an Independent and not as a member of the Government Party I hope I shall introduce a refreshing note.  I do not feel it is the duty of an Opposition at all times to speak against Government policy and to express pessimism.  Deputy Sherwin, my colleague from Dublin, is disappointed with the unemployment position and the failure of the Government to provide jobs.  I hope I shall never again hear hackneyed utterances regarding 100,000 jobs and: &ldquo;Put your husbands out to work.&rdquo; I have heard such utterances on more occasions than I care to remember.</P>
      <P>I am acquainted with the building trade.  Whether it is due to emigration or some other factor, there are no skilled workers available in Dublin at present.  I shall leave it to the House to decide whether that is due to emigration or whether we have at last turned the corner referred to by the last speaker.  I hope we have turned the corner.</P>
      <P>The Government and, I am sure, their predecessors in office, must have the ambition to provide good government. I should like, in particular, to ask the Taoiseach about the means test and the ceiling.  The matter is vitally important to people in need of help. Increases were sponsored by this House for Judges, civil servants, Deputies and others because of the increased cost of living.  Old age pensioners and other people are being penalised to such an extent that it is a disgrace.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to see that there is some change.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is responsible for Government policy.  If he did nothing but help the people on whose behalf I speak in this matter so as to give them a measure of equity in our community, his leadership and direction would not be in vain.  I referred on another occasion to a person who is penalised.  He gave everything to the country and is one of only two, as I understand it, who has not benefited. The Act in question is preventing him from enjoying what normally would be his right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2033" /> I would also ask the Taoiseach to give consideration to the factor under the Department of Local Government which prevents a person who has not five children from enjoying the benefit of poor law relief&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The theme of the Government as outlined by the Taoiseach and, indeed, as outlined by the Minister for Finance in the Budget <Col N="2034" /> speech some two months ago is that everything in the garden is beautiful. I wonder in what sphere is the Taoiseach living?  He must have gone into the stratosphere.  He certainly cannot have any contact with the country. Anybody who goes up and down the country at the present time knows perfectly well that the people in the country feel exactly the reverse.</P>
      <P>The theme of the Government is that we are swimming along; that everything is perfect and that the Government deserve to be clapped on the back for it&mdash;clapped on the back for what?  For greater emigration in the past three years than there was for a very long time before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell Deputy Moloney what happened in Kerry and Deputy Moloney can go down to Kerry and ask whether it is true or not.  His own supporters will tell him it is true. Houses and farms have been shut up in the past three years.  The owners have gone away.  The whole pattern that there used to be of one or two young people leaving the family and going away to seek their reward elsewhere is finished.  Since Fianna Fáil came back in 1957 that pattern is gone. The pattern now is that the key is turned in the lock.  That is not only true of Kerry but I think it is true throughout the whole west of Ireland. Unfortunately, it is even true in regard to my own constituency of Kildare where the situation is not what it used to be of one or two people leaving a family and the roots remaining behind. Now, when people go, the whole family packs up and goes.</P>
      <P>The Government think everything is beautiful in the garden.  It is not only the Government who seem to work on the same principle.  Other people, too, believe that by saying and repeating things often enough they will become what they are not.  I was amused particularly to read the last Central Bank Report and to put it side by side with the previous one.  I want to choose my words quite deliberately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank has a function in our economy.  Their function is to tell the truth, whether it hurts the Government <Col N="2035" /> in power or not.  I regret to say that the Central Bank have departed from their duty in the last Report.  I am going to repeat it.  I do not mind where I repeat it.  In 1959 the Central Bank correctly ascribed certain drops in production to the disastrous harvest of 1958.  They were right; I have said it often enough in this House and I repeat it often enough in this House.</P>
    <P>They made a report this year.  What did they say?  Did they start, as it was their duty as impartial observers to start, from an average year?  They did not; they took as their base the year that they had themselves previously stated was an abnormally low year and they tried to make their prognostications from that.  I do not blame the Central Bank for having been totally wrong when in their Report for the year 1959 they said that agricultural production in the current year, the year ended last March, was going to revive and that there was every reason to believe that 1959-60 would be a year in which there would be progress in agricultural production as there had been in earlier years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This year did they go back on that?  Not at all.  They took the line of starting in a most dishonest fashion from the previous year in calculating their three and a half per cent. real income increase from the previous year which they had correctly stated was due to the adverse weather conditions of the harvest year of 1958. We shall not progress unless we make an effort truthfully to assess what our possibilities are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truthful assessment of our possibilities is that we have not progressed at all since 1957.  The gross national product at constant prices is up one-tenth of one per cent.  per annum since 1957 and that is a shocking situation compared with the <Col N="2036" /> rest of the world.  In the first six months of 1959 Swedish exports increased by ten per cent.  Ours increased by a half per cent.  That is something in respect of which the Taoiseach would like us to believe that everything in the garden is wonderful.</P>
    <P>We have got a position here in which in relation to our balance of payments last year we ate into the capital to save on current account. I am delighted to know that we had the capital transactions to meet the balance on current account but nobody can say that it is satisfactory to be living on capital.  We have a balance of payments situation this year which from all the indications we can get is a carry-over of exports not put through last year.  Either we were in default last year or we had the carry-over and did not use it last year.  That means we are in default this year.</P>
    <P>We have been terribly lucky in that the terms of trade have turned with us all the way but nobody can believe for one second that we are in anything like a satisfactory position.  The truth of the matter is that in relation to employment the Government have failed miserably to redeem the promises they made to the electorate at the last election.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of living, this Government have failed miserably to redeem the promise they made at the last election.  In relation to production, with a great flourish of trumpets, they said they would be able, when they came in, to shoot up production, agricultural and industrial, at once.  They have failed miserably to get any adequate overall increase.  There has, of course, been some, but the issue is not whether or not there has been some increased production.  The issue is whether we are keeping pace with the rest of the world.  As against keeping pace, we have gone back since Fianna Fáil assumed office.  There is only one way in which there can be any alleviation of the situation.  That is that a Government who do not know where they are going should get out and make way for those who do.  We heard the Taoiseach today talk about <Col N="2037" /> G.A.T.T.  He talked in terms that clearly showed that he has thrown overboard all the policies he has adumbrated and held for the last 25 years; and it is not merely the Taoiseach alone who realises the import of what he has said about G.A.T.T.  His former friends outside, on whom he has depended in the past, realise it too.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in this end-of-term atmosphere I do not intend to try to deal with all the absurdities and falsehoods spoken by Deputies on the other side of the House during the course of this discussion. I confess that some of them irritated me, but it is my hope that I will be able to send Deputies into the Adjournment in good humour if I am allowed.</P>
      <P>I was, I confess, taken aback by the tone of some of the speeches.  Recently I read a report of what I regarded as an important speech delivered by Dr. Greene, the very intelligent President of the National Farmers' Association. He said, amongst other things worth noting, that there is a need in this country to make humbug unfashionable. If Dr. Greene had been in the Gallery yesterday and had listened to some of the speeches delivered here he would realise that his hope of making humbug unfashionable will not be realised very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He would realise how ill-founded his hope was if he had listened, in particular, to the speech of Deputy Dillon.  I know an addiction to humbug is very hard to break, but I honestly do not think Deputy Dillon is even trying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was deciding upon the form of the speech I would make introducing this Estimate I came to the conclusion that I should not devote the same amount of time to the problems <Col N="2038" /> and the prospects of agriculture as I intended to devote to other topics. I knew Deputy Dillon would say that that was evidence that I had no interest in agriculture and did not appreciate its importance in relation to the national economy.  Deputy Dillon is in grave danger of becoming known here as the Deputy-of-one-speech-only, because there is very little difference, even in the verbiage he used, between the speech he delivered yesterday evening, the speech he delivered on the Budget and the speech he delivered earlier on the Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>I deliberately decided that, the Dáil having being occupied in debating the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture for four of the five last days on which it has met, it would not be necessary for me to cover the same ground.  But there was a further reason.  At seven o'clock this evening I am due to address the annual convention of Macra na Feirme in Limerick.  I propose to talk there mainly upon agricultural topics.  In so far as that address is reported in the papers I hope Deputies will regard it as an addendum to the speech I delivered yesterday afternoon.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government is to make agriculture more productive and more profitable to the farmers.  We are seeking to do that by various methods, of which Deputies are well aware.  We have extended considerably the range of fertiliser subsidies.  We propose to extend it still further later in the year. We have provided very substantial aids to increased agricultural efficiency and, in so far as the problem is one of marketing, we have indicated in a White Paper the nature of legislation we intend to introduce to strengthen the marketing arrangements in existence and the Dáil will have an opportunity of debating that legislation later in the year.  It is utterly nonsensical and absurd to suggest, as Deputy Dillon appeared to suggest, that there is a necessary conflict between the aim of expanding agricultural production and that of stimulating industrial expansion simultaneously. To suggest that is to suggest that the Danes and the Dutch, and other European countries, do not know what they are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I never suggested any such thing, and the Taoiseach well knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a far more progressive agriculture than we have yet achieved.  At the same time they are striding ahead at least as rapidly as we are in industrial development, and in one case with considerably more rapidity.  As I said, it is absurd to suggest we cannot do likewise.</P>
      <P>Let me deal now with this question of the 100,000 new jobs.  I do not expect that anything I may say in this regard will convince Deputies opposite that what I said in 1955 was sensible and has a direct relationship to the policy the Government is now applying. In 1955, I attempted to review the economic conditions then prevailing, using as the basis for that review the available statistics, which related to the year 1954.  I then estimated that, if we were to bring about a position of full employment and create a sufficient number of new jobs to abolish the then existing back-log of unemployment, and provide for the number of people leaving school each year who would require paid employment in order to secure their livelihoods, we would need to create, over five years, a situation in which 100,000 new jobs would be established in the country. That estimate was made, as I said, in 1955.  It was based on the 1954 statistics, relating to the period just after the Coalition Government had come into office.  Conditions had changed very considerably when the people succeeded in getting them out of office again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Taoiseach still got a lot of votes on the promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last year of the Coalition Government the number of people in paid employment went down by 50,000.  Surely that was a relevant factor in the situation.  In the three years of the Coalition Government 135,000 people emigrated. Deputies spoke here yesterday evening as if the problem of emigration was of recent origin.  Neither last year, nor the year before, was the number of emigrants, as calculated in <Col N="2040" /> passenger movement statistics, equal to the number in any single year in which the Coalition Government were in office.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of my calculation then, and any calculation I may attempt now, I do not suggest that the 135,000 people who emigrated in those years, or all those who emigrate now are necessarily wage earners who could have been kept in this country by the provision here of jobs for them. Everybody who wants seriously to understand our problem of emigration knows that it is not merely a matter of creating new jobs here.  There are other factors operating.  Many of those who emigrate leave employment here.  Indeed, in the last two months I have had discussions with people who have started important new industries and they expressed to me their surprise that many of the workers they took in and trained, when they had completed their training, decided to leave their employment for the purpose of emigrating.  They mentioned the additional established costs which they had to bear on that account and which they assumed would equally have to be borne by anybody establishing new enterprises here. I do not want to get involved in a deep analysis of the emigration situation at this hour but figures are thrown around here which always tend to exaggerate it, not that it is not serious and does not require our most urgent attention.</P>

The number of people registered as unemployed at the present time is less than 40,000 and it is many years since the number fell as low as that.  I think it fair to assume that to absorb all those who leave school every year, and who require paid employment for the purpose of livelihood, we would need to have the prospect of about 15,000 new jobs every year.</P>

Basing our calculation on the same information&mdash;the number of social insurance, stamps sold&mdash;the weekly average is 20,000 more people in paid employment now than at the corresponding period last year.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has refused to put forward constructive <Col N="2045" /> alternatives to the policies which the Government are applying.  Leaving that aside for the moment, leaving aside whether this new programme will ever see the light of day, there are other questions upon which not merely members of the House but the public in general are entitled to know the views of Deputies opposite.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has just been talking about G.A.T.T., and several times this year I have spoken about the developments taking place in Europe and about the attitude of the Government to those developments. I have explained our attitude regarding the European Free Trade Association and the European Common Market and I discussed here to-day our attitude towards joining G.A.T.T. Is there any Deputy in the House who has a hint of the views of the Fine Gael Party on those matters?</P>

Surely all the information that Deputies want to reach a conclusion is as available to them as it is to me and certainly, in so far as it was in my power to make available to Deputies, by statements here and otherwise, I have endeavoured to give them that information but without avail.  Whether or not we are interested in their views on these matters surely their supporters in the country would be interested if they have any views to express?  No Party in opposition and certainly no Party that ever hopes to be an alternative.  Government can play their cards quite so close to their chests as all that.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I was trying to preserve a sense of good humour. There is one serious note I want to strike.  Among all the speeches delivered here there was one which was exceptional in both substance and tone. I want to express &ldquo;appreciation of the statement made here by Deputy J.A. Costello.  It was in marked contrast, both in the matters to which he referred and the manner in which he dealt with them, with the other speeches we had.  He referred to serious matters in a constructive commonsense. <Col N="2047" /> way; and I want to refer now to some of the matters he mentioned.  He questioned the wisdom of the decision to locate the new economic development branch in the Department of Finance.  He approved strongly of the decision to establish that branch, but he urged that it should be kept in the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with that.  First of all, I think the Department of the Taoiseach is, because of its character, incapable of ensuring an effective system of administration in any organisation working directly to it.  I believe that the picture in the public mind&mdash;and certainly in the mind of many Deputies&mdash;of the Department of Finance as a block on the road to national progress is a false picture. But to the extent that there may have been justification for it, it was we ourselves who made it possible.  We always regarded the Department of Finance as being the Government's critic, the expert critic available to the Government of plans initiated in other Departments.  For many years under the Fianna Fáil Government it was the accepted procedure that other Departments were responsible for the initiation of proposals and that it was the duty of the Department of Finance to criticise these proposals and ensure that by the time they reached the Government for decision, every possible argument, <i>pro and con</i>, would be available to Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past two or three years, and to a large extent because of the new approach to the work of the Department of Finance of the present Minister, Deputy Dr. Ryan, that situation has changed completely. Indeed as a Minister of long experience I still remember the shock of surprise I got shortly after I came back into office as Minister for Industry and Commerce when I got a letter from the Minister for Finance urging me to consider the practicability of some development which would have cost a great deal of money and which the Minister for Finance wanted to see go ahead.  It was to help that process of change, to assist it and encourage it, that I decided that this economic development branch, which has specific <Col N="2048" /> responsibility in respect of the exploring of new development possibilities, should be co-ordinated with that Department.  If Deputy Sweetman ever gets back or if Deputy Lynch ever replaces him there, they will find a new atmosphere in that Department.</P>

      <P>Deputy J.A. Costello also referred to the matter of political patronage, and with almost all of what he said I am in complete agreement.  It is perfectly true that the area now available for the exercise of Government patronage is very limited.  Deputy Costello spoke particularly about the appointment of rate collectors.  I do not know sufficient about the working of local authorities to make a comment on that.  I know that there are very many members of county councils of my acquaintance who would very much like to be relieved of the responsibility of nominating persons for appointment as rate collectors, but I do not know what other procedure could be substituted for it.  I am sure that the Minister for Local Government would be as interested as I am to explore possibilities in that regard.</P>
      <P>As far as Government administration is concerned appointments in the nomination of a Minister without any process of examination or any selection board procedure relate only to very junior temporary staff mostly of the messenger and cleaner grades, with one exception: the subpostmasters.  I personally know the view of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that he would like very much to devise some system which would remove altogether from his responsibility the selection of subpostmasters and subpost-mistresses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello suggested that political Parties might <Col N="2049" /> lose votes at elections if they surrendered all these chances of patronage. I do not believe it.  I believe the best thing any political Party can do is to avoid the exercise of patronage of any kind.  For every position there will be 20 applicants, and only one can be successful.  And the man who is successful does not always remain your supporter, as most of you know.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello referred to the impression that prevails in some quarters that the Government can also influence the allocation of grants to industrial firms embarking upon new enterprises.  I know that impression exists.  Deputies are aware that in respect to the income tax concessions which have been allowed to industrialists, they are stated in the law; and any firm that qualifies in accordance with the law receives these concessions. They also know that in respect of industrial grants, and other financial aids available to industrialists, we did our best by legislation to remove the Government entirely from the administration of these schemes. We set up statutory independent authorities and we gave them the last word in the allocation of these grants. We have repeatedly asserted here that the Government not merely do not attempt to check or veto the decisions of these authorities in respect of these matters, but they do not try to influence them in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know some people do not believe it.  There are still people who, when they send an application in to the Industrial Development Authority or to An Foras Tionscal, for good measure send a copy to the Minister for Industry and Commerce or to myself.  To an extent we here are responsible for the prevalence of that erroneous belief, because there are probably Deputies on this side who, when some firm succeeds in an application for an industrial grant suggest to them that it was because of representations made by them; and there are many Deputies on the other side who, when some firm is refused an industrial grant, attribute that refusal to the decision of the Government and probably say it was a result of <Col N="2050" /> political prejudice by the Government against the applicants.</P>
    <P>Certainly I think that it is highly desirable, if we are going to operate a system of inducements, that it should be widely understood that the Government does not interfere with. does not attempt to and will never try to secure a reversal of the findings of the bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy John A. Costello referred to the Commission on Higher Education. We have not yet got down to the final drafting of the terms of reference of that Commission but it is the accepted view of the Minister for Education and of the Government that the independence of the Universities should be preserved.</P>
    <P>The Independent Deputies will realise that they have raised such a variety of questions that it is impossible to refer to them all.  Other Deputies referred to specific matters which are primarily the responsibility of other Ministers and, although as Taoiseach, I have some general responsibility in regard to them, I do not propose to deal with them now.</P>
    <P>In my introductory statement I tried to give a factual review of the state of the economy of the country.  It is all very well for Deputies opposite to say that there was a time when agricultural employment was higher than it is now.  The point which is important is that from the beginning of 1956 until the end of 1957, and because of developments in 1956, the economy of this country was going downhill and going down rapidly.  We did not succeed in arresting that trend until the end of 1957.  In 1958 we succeeded in having the programme for economic expansion published.  The legislation to put that programme into operation was passed in the first half of 1959 and from that time on the economy of the country has been moving upward at an accelerating pace.  It is not where we were at any particular time that matters.  It is where we are going now and we are going up.  That is all that matters.</P>

      <P>When the false courage has died down perhaps the Taoiseach will explain how he makes <Col N="2051" /> out that the trend was downward from 1956 to 1957 when gross national production was up by £12,000,000 in 1957 over 1956.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask three questions on this Bill.  First, as we have not the time to read the Bill in detail, can we have the Minister's assurance that the Bill is in ordinary standard form and includes nothing unusual?  Secondly, will the Minister explain to the House how it is that under this Bill be is expending and therefore taking from the people £136,633,000 compared with only £118,791,000 in 1956, notwithstanding that in the interval he has also saved £9 million in subsidies and is therefore taking £27 million more out of the pockets of the taxpayers?  Thirdly, last night I tried to get the Minister to endeavour to teach his colleague the Minister for Agriculture a little mathematics.  Now will he try to teach his Leader, the Taoiseach, a little mathematics?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said a few minutes ago that production fell in 1957 from 1956.  The Minister for Finance circulated to us at Budget time&mdash;and I have already complimented him for his courtesy in so circulating&mdash;tables of economic statistics.  Those economic statistics show that gross national product at constant prices in 1956 was £525,700,000; in 1957, £537,900,000.  To the ordinary person that is an increase of £12 million.  To the Taoiseach, when he wants to chances his arm, it is a decrease.  The plain fact of the matter is that he was just chancing his arm, and did not give a damn about what he was saying, whether it was right or wrong; just anything would do to suit his argument.  That sort of thing is unbecoming in a Taoiseach and it should not be necessary to point out on an Appropriation Bill that the Taoiseach, in closing the debate on his Estimate&mdash;I was going to say deliberately but you, Sir, would not allow me to say that under the rules of the House&mdash;recklessly and without belief in the truth of what he was saying, misquotes statistics of gross national product at constant prices which the Minister for Finance himself circulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to explain my real reason for keeping the House so late.  I have been advised by your secretary that I would have to confine myself to the purchase of the boats, that their operation and maintenance are matters for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and that the Minister has no responsibility in that connection. However, he is held responsible for this Adjournment matter because he sanctioned the original purchase.</P>
      <P>I have here a Parliamentary Question to the Minister's predecessor.  Deputy Bartley, who was then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and was in charge of Fisheries. I quote from Column 292 of Volume 135 of the Official Report of the 27th November, 1952:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Purchase of Trawlers.</P>
      <P>Dr. Esmonde asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state (a) the price paid for the three German trawlers purchased by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara recently, and (b) if those boats were submitted to efficiency trials prior to purchase by technical experts; and, if so, the names of those experts.</P>
      <P>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Bartley): The price paid by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the three trawlers recently purchased by them in Germany was £50,250.  The vessels were surveyed by a marine surveyor of the Department of Industry and Commerce prior to purchase.</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Donnell: Is it a fact, as we have been led to believe it is, that these vessels were reconditioned prior to coming to this country?  If so, why are they now in the Dublin docks for outfit?</P>
      <P>Mr. Briscoe: They came through a storm.</P>
      <P>Mr. Sweetman: The Government is in a storm at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2060" /> Mr. Dillon: When does the Parliamentary Secretary expect the boats to start operating?</P>
    <P>Mr. Bartley: Almost immediately.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: This side of Christmas?</P>
    <P>Mr. Bartley: Yes.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Does the Parliamentary Secretary intend to keep them permanently at sea?</P>
    <P>Mr. Bartley: Yes.</P>
    <P>I should like to know who is the marine surveyor of the Department who passed these boats because, although £50,000 was paid for them, they needed an overhaul almost immediately after being brought here and they have been consistently overhauled ever since.  Of course in various debates here Deputy Bartley's successor, Deputy Dillon, was blamed because he spent money on them.  I am not so much concerned about who spent the money on them as who bought them, who started this noble experiment, as it was called.</P>
    <P>If these there trawlers were left at Killybegs, or wherever it was, with the engines falling out of them and if they were sold for scrap it might have been thrown up at Deputy Bartley's successor that it was the sabotaging of a noble experiment, but evidently they made up their minds to try to keep them at sea.  They were not able to do that because the additional outlay from July, 1952, to 31st March, 1953, was £14,600.  There was a further outlay to 31st March, 1960, exclusive of £3,353 for asdic equipment retained on sale of vessels and £3,444 recovered from insurers, which amounted to £41,000.  That brought the total outlay up to £106,000.</P>
    <P>The net amount, after deduction of ship brokers' commission, realised on sale to Claridge Trawlers Ltd., Lowestoft, Suffolk, was £33,000. Total depreciation was £72,000 and there are many other figures in respect of operations up to 31st March, 1960.  I do not know whether I am allowed to mention them but the list is not very long.  The gross value <Col N="2061" /> of fish landed was £255,000 and the net value of the fish was £236,000. The outgoings, including interest to the Exchequer, crews' shares, repairs, management expenses, etc., was £288,000.  It cost £288,000 to catch £236,000 worth of fish.  Losses amounted to £52,000 and the average loss per vessel per year was £2,177. The total amount for depreciation and operational losses was £125,000.</P>
    <P>According to this reply the three vessels were bought and sold together and a separate price was not determined for each of them.  Figures for the operation of the vessels for the year ended 31st March, 1960, are subject to audit and those since 31st March, 1960, are not yet available. Furthermore, the value of the catch of each of the vessels cannot readily be segregated for the entire period.</P>
    <P>The Minister should hold an inquiry in his Department as to who surveyed these boats.  As I mentioned to-night to the Taoiseach we are short of salesmen.  Certainly the salesman who sold these boats to us did a very good job.  The sailors who succeeded in bringing them here are to be commended. It was an epic to get them here.</P>
    <P>This was called a noble experiment but the only thing that came out of it&mdash;and it is one of the mysteries of public administration and of political life&mdash;was that the man who bought these boats and lost £125,000 of the taxpayers' money was promoted from being a Parliamentary Secretary to be Minister for the Gaeltacht, as he is at present.  I would what would have happened if he had shown a profit of £125,000 or a quarter of a million pounds?  Another reason I bring this up is because of the manner in which the Department continue to fling money away on schemes which are not commendable and which have shown themselves to be failures.  I asked the Minister in his first year of office to change the policy of his Department.</P>

      <P>I hope the Chair will admit that one of the things which a Deputy should do is to try to influence Ministers and Departments. If the Minister's Department had not got a profit in this they had experience and from that experience they should adopt a wiser course in the future.  When the Department is planning schemes, whether in regard to the purchase of boats or plant, the plans should obviously be sound ones. Boats should not be bought which are unsuitable.  We should not have plant erected in parts of the country where there is no business for it.</P>
      <P>I deplore the fact, when I look at this loss of £125,000, that the money was not channelled into places where fish are being caught, or that they did not buy smaller boats and give them on the hire purchase system to ports where there are fishermen who will go out and fish, and to ports in the vicinity of proven fishing grounds. I do not think I have anything more to say about this matter but I do say I would not be here if the Minister had shown me the courtesy of reading out this figure of £125,000 and if his colleague the Minister for Health had not jibed me into coming in here tonight.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would allow me a few minutes to speak as my name has been mentioned in connection with this matter.  I am glad that the Minister did handle it in the manner complained of by Deputy Lynch and this gives me an opportunity to present part of the other side of the story.  Here are one or two of the salient facts.  Boats bought for £50,000 were valued by experts at £100,000.  They have been sold now, after a considerable amount of mistreatment by the Coalition Government, for the sum of £35,000.  I am entitled to claim that the classification <Col N="2063" /> which they held when they were sold recently, as being A1 at Lloyds, is borne out by these two figures.  I should like to recall the minds of older Deputies to the chartering of boats by the Party to which Deputy Lynch belongs.  They chartered boats from England&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will give the Minister time.  I do want to say that Deputy Dillon as Minister for Fisheries deliberately set out to damn these boats simply because they were a Fianna Fáil venture, as he dubbed them.  He refused the board permission to reengine two of these boats although the board in question was a board appointed by himself and he refused to allow them to sell the three boats for a lesser figure than £90,000.  I take it that these two actions combined, on the part of Deputy Dillon, were designed to achieve one result, that they could be neither serviced nor sold and of necessity would have to be tied up at the South Wall as a visual demonstration of Fianna Fáil's fishery bungling.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon stated they were a political embarrassment to him.  I think that was the term he used.  While we had to endure all this smear campaign, before Deputy Dillon took office, and all the ill-founded advice as to what should be done with them, including getting rid of them, it was only in the last couple of months in which Deputy Dillon was in office that he gave permission to sell the boats, with the stipulation that these useless boats, as he alleged, should not be let go for less than £90,000.</P>

      <P>That was the price stipulated for these hulks about which Deputy Dillon has talked so much.  It <Col N="2067" /> is very clear now, I think, to all concerned that when Deputy Dillon gave this order in the month of September, having sat down on the job for nearly two years and done nothing about the boats, he gave the order with a specific stipulation.  From that time until the day he went out of office he never did another thing about them and never did another thing to them.  The conclusion is inescapable.</P>

The fact is these boats were used for training purposes. They were used as training vessels. They were the only training vessels the country had at the time.  Ponder on this: the best skipper we have in the country today was trained on one of these boats.  Another interesting fact is that the boats landed £250,937 worth of fish at a time when fish was very scarce.</P>
