      <P>I think it desirable at this stage that we should take stock and know what we are doing. There have been all kinds of criticism of one kind or another over the introduction of this Bill.  I appreciate the approach of the Minister in regard to the difficulties in which the University was placed.  We here are interested in what the University provides for the nation but, just as we are interested in clocks and use them daily, none of us would want to have the responsibility of taking a clock to pieces and seeing exactly how it works. While Parliament has a big interest in University education, it has shown that in the discussion which we had on the position with regard to its finances, <Col N="1620" /> the Oireachtas is not the place in which to examine the exact details of how a University is put together, works and functions in detail.  In the passing of this measure, I think we are proceeding in an absolutely proper and Parliamentary way.</P>
      <P>Certain exceptions have been taken to the fact that a Statute is being passed apparently to do something for the University College, Dublin and it has been suggested that that is a little bit undesirable.  I think it is well to look at some of the points which have been made regarding the position of University College, Dublin and I should like to refer to an article by Dr. Alfred O'Rahilly in the issue of <i>Hibernia</i> of the 6th May which deals with the alternatives which they might take.  He says&mdash;</P>
      <P>U.C.D. has several alternatives.  It could legally appeal against the decision.  It could pass a new Statute providing that selected Assistants (specifically called such) might have the additional title of Surgical Tutor or College Lecturer. Or finally the College could ask for a short amendment of the Charter. British University Charters may be amended at the request of a specified majority of the Body.  Belfast has a similar provision; so has T.C.D. since 1911.  By anyone acquainted with the working of modern university institutions this latest decision, if allowed to stand, would be regarded as an undesirable legalistic technicality.</P>
      <P>We all appreciate how undesirable it would be that Parliament or the Government would intervene in a way that would appear to interfere with the recognised freedom of University institutions in carrying out their functions.  The Minister has given clear indication that there is no desire either through this Bill or in approaching the matter in future to interfere with the normal recognised freedom of the University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report of the Board of Visitors brings out clearly that with the approval of the Senate, whose power in relation to University Colleges is not fully understood, and with the <Col N="1621" /> complete approval over a long period of the Governing Body of University College, Dublin, certain steps have been taken to provide for the effective and efficient carrying on of the institution in Dublin.  I think it is well to emphasise one or two of the points. The present difficulty arises out of the fact that the Charter prescribes certain methods of appointing Lecturers by the Senate of the University.  In their inquiries the Board of Visitors reported that they accepted that that prescribed system was costly, undignified and undesirable, that the prescribed system would have made it difficult and unwieldy to have Lecturers appointed by the University in the numbers which the College considered necessary in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>The Board also considered that that system might also have the effect of deterring a suitable person from becoming an applicant.  The Charter contains this clause:</P>
    <P>... shall be taken and construed and adjudged in all Our Courts or elsewhere in the most favourable and beneficial sense and for the best advantage of the said University, and for the promotion of the objects of the said recited Charter, and of this Our Charter, any misrecital, non-recital, omission, defect, imperfection, matter or thing notwithstanding.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances accepted by the Board with regard to the existing system as prescribed in the Charter, with the powers and responsibility implied in that, with the agreement, tolerance, or anything else you like to call it, of the Senate of the University, and with the full concurrence of the Governing Body of the University, the Governing Body have made appointments which according to the Report of the Board of Visitors have assisted in giving flexibility in the running of the Faculties and it is not suggested that the standard of the teaching staff of the College has suffered.</P>
    <P>In University College, Dublin, an institution whose activities have been increasing with enormous rapidity over the past few years, tremendous work <Col N="1622" /> is being done to make the College an institution that attracts increasing numbers of students from every part of the country.  In these circumstances, the Oireachtas can be satisfied that it is doing a practical and a businesslike piece of work and we can appreciate the Minister's approach to the matter when he says the Oireachtas will line up with the Senate and the Governing Body in giving consent to what is being done&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in giving consent to its continuance.  Whatever our approach to the functioning, working or development of our university institutions, I want to say that we appreciate the Minister's approach in the matter and the approach he has made in so far as the Oireachtas is concerned, so that we shall get our business in relation to the University running in an easy and satisfactory manner while we await the report of any body which may be dealing with the situation in the future.</P>

      <P>I am amazed that Deputy Mulcahy has attempted to give the meaning to this debate that he has done.  I would ask the Minister to point out that Deputy Mulcahy is incorrect when he says that the Government and Oireachtas are conforming with what the Governing Body of University College, Dublin has done. This Bill has been introduced to enable University College, Dublin to put its house in order.  There is not a suggestion in the Bill that what has been done is in any way correct or that the Government or the Oireachtas are a Party to it or give approval to it.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of the Bill is validating the creation of posts and the making of appointments purporting to have been made.  Section 2 of the Bill gives power to University College, Dublin, to make appointments of College Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers but does not exempt the Governing Body from the procedure whereby these posts are created by Statute of University College, Dublin, subject to the Senate of <Col N="1623" /> the National University agreeing to the institution of the posts.  I do not know if that is quite clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing with this matter, we are dealing so to speak, with a matter in transit, a matter which will be the responsibility of the new Authority.  In the meantime, certain money is required to enable that Authority to function and last night a Deputy raised the question that the House might be required to subsidise this Authority.  In my opinion, the new Authority will have a problem in that respect.  In the case of broadcasting, one can listen to the same band every night and never get tired of it but one does not look at the same picture every night.  It would want to be a very extraordinary feature for one to look at it a second time.</P>
      <P>The question of providing material for television is one which the new Authority will have to face and unless it is good material, you will find that people will still want to turn to the B.B.C.  There is nothing so boring as looking at a dull picture.  To get a good act will be pretty expensive and the trouble we have is that because there are limits to what we can pay for a good act, we may be stuck with bad material and there is a danger that the commercial people will not subscribe to the new Authority. The new Chairman stressed the fact that there is a difficulty in getting material.  That was one of his arguments as to why he gathered material that would be of some use in the new service.  It is because films will not be looked at if they are not very good that we have a certain number of evil plays for which, strange as it seems, there is a certain audience who never tire of them.  That may be the reason why we have had so many suggestive plays coming from the B.B.C., but I hope there will not be a temptation to present similar material here.  Good material is essential because while you may listen to the same band every night you will not look at the same picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be at least a half hour's televising of Dáil proceedings. That would be an item of interest. People ought to know what the members, who are always in the headlines, are like.  They may be very disappointed <Col N="1625" /> but it would eventually raise the standard of the debates if Deputies knew the proceedings were to be televised.  Those who made the best contributions would get the votes and the dullards would be put out, which would not be a bad thing.  There is no room at the top for mediocre people; there is too much competition.</P>
    <P>Although I object to certain types of plays, I do not object to plays of an instructional nature.  There is a vast difference.  Sex is of great interest to people.  The affairs of men and women will always attract interest.  There is nothing wrong in that, but some people go a little beyond into the realm of privacy and try to exploit matters which should not be made public.  The commercial people do not care who sees these plays as long as the audience is big enough to buy their goods.  War is a peculiar thing; whether it be with atom bombs or with pounds of sugar, people want to succeed and they are not very particular how they succeed.</P>
    <P>The Authority will have a problem in getting good material to maintain public interest.  I happen to have a television set but I seldom look at it.  It impresses me very rarely.  However, I expect a better standard, certainly a better moral standard, from this Authority than we have had from the B.B.C. and big nations like the United States where there seems to be a great deal of licence.  Because of the influence of the Church here I am sure no one will get away with that here.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how the Minister will deal with the problem of the double licence.  Eventually radio will be incorporated in the television structure. At the moment there are very few television sets with radio incorporated. One licence should suffice for both.  The television licence will be a few pounds and it would be asking for jam to expect a person to pay 17/6d. for a radio licence.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is a matter for the Minister or the new Authority but there ought to be a special rate for persons known to be in poor economic circumstances.  A television set will be a great boon to old people living at home.  They will have <Col N="1626" /> the world brought to their little homes. The price of a licence would be prohibitive for those people.  It is one thing to make up 17/6d. but another thing to make up £3 or £4.  While the cost of a television set is prohibitive for those people at the moment, it will become cheaper.  I believe that before long it will be possible to buy a set for £40 and to rent one for 5/-.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the problem of the licence fee in regard to certain people on social benefits such as old age pensions.  There ought to be a special, cheap licence for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate which we are discussing with the general Estimate brings before the House the old problem of the new Television Authority.  I am bound to place on record again our considered view that the conflict of interests which has been created by the choice of Chairman is in our judgment a most unfortunate development in the life of this country.  I do not believe you can make wrong right by legislation in this House and it just is not good enough to say: &ldquo;We know there is a conflict of interests but we are going to declare by legislation that there is no harm in it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is a bad principle that any man should be charged with the responsibility of presiding over the Television Authority at a time when it is universally known that he is in a very large way of business offering material to the Authority of which he is the Chairman.  If that principle is generally accepted in our public and private life, there will have been a very serious lowering of standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to maintain that all the people in this country are angels because they certainly are not, but it is possible to assert that certain standards of conduct have always been recognised as being the ideal towards which people should aspire. One of those standards, in my experience, has been that if you accept the obligations of public office or employment you accept at the same time the self-denying ordinance that you may not derive profit from contractual relations with the public <Col N="1627" /> authority of which you constitute a part.</P>
    <P>Nobody has ever denied that that does involve some measure of sacrifice on the part of county councillors, district councillors, urban councillors, T.D.s and all other public officials.  I admit at once that the general principle applies in varying degrees.  I think it is true to say that if a member of this House wishes to address the House on a specific subject in which he has a personal interest, it is generally accepted that, if he declares those interests and informs the House that he has a personal interest in the matter to which he is referring, the House can then judge the value of his observations in the light of that declared interest.  A member of the House would be thought poorly of if he intervened in a debate and sought to sway the opinion of his fellow Deputies in favour of a particular proposition, if he did not reveal that his own personal interest was involved in the matter under discussion.</P>
    <P>I do not think that degree of revelation is sufficient where the Chairman of the Authority is himself one of the persons who must determine from day to day what material the Authority will purchase and use on the general programmes when he is himself offering material to that Authority.  It is not sufficient precaution to say that where he is himself offering material to the Authority, he can leave the room and leave it to the other members of the Authority to determine whether the material he offers is good value for money or not because his position would become absurd if all that he offers to the Authority were perennially rejected by that Authority as inferior in quality or too expensive to justify acceptance. Such repeated decisions would be a declaration by the man's own colleagues that he was not fit to be Chairman of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I want to go on record again as saying that, in our judgment, a conflict of interests arises in connection with the present Chairman in view of his business interests which he has declared and that, in our opinion, the Chairman of the Authority should <Col N="1628" /> either relinquish the post of Chairman or relinquish his business and disclaim any intention of tendering for contracts for work to provide programmes for the Authority over which he is to preside as Chairman.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters of a more routine character to which I should like to refer.  I am bound to say, from what I have heard the Minister say in connection with this business, that I gravely doubt whether the Minister himself believes that this television service will ever become self-supporting.  I doubt it.  However, it is arguable, I admit, as to whether, if you make up your mind this is going to involve the Exchequer in an annual subsidy, you should go on or not.  Some will argue &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and some will argue &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but there is one thing certain, that is, that we should not embark upon what is virtually an irreversible programme in connection with television without some reasonable certainty of what the economic prospects are.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is right for the Minister to pretend to the House that he believes it will be an economic proposition if, in fact, he believes it will involve an annual Exchequer subsidy in perpetuity.  I believe it will if it is to be carried on at all.  I think the House is entitled to know now what that probable annual charge is to be so that we can consider, in competition with the other claims made upon the Exchequer, the propriety of undertaking what I believe will ultimately be a substantial annual financial liability.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider the measure of that liability, it ought to be borne in mind that, whether one accepts Deputy Sherwin's view that everybody in the country will ultimately have a television set or, the more conservative view, that only a limited number may have, there will be an immense capital investment in television, if we proceed with this programme.  It will constitute quite a material burden on the whole economy of so small a community as ours is.  Therefore, we should be able to reckon with reasonable certainty what the true annual cost of this new departure is likely to be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  I recognise that under the statutory set-up here, it is the Authority itself which appoints the Director.  I am sure it will not be absent from the Minister's mind that, perhaps, the most vital decision in that matter is who that Director will be. We can only hope it will be somebody who is suited to the post.  It may not be easy to find many who will qualify for that description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note in the Minister's statement that he now says the line system is susceptible of ready adaptation from 405 to 625, if Great Britain makes the change.  I understood, when the Bill was going through the House, the Minister to say that such adaptation would be virtually impossible.  Was I mistaken?  I should like to ask this question.  I see statements in the English Press to the effect that the B.B.C. is contemplating an early change from the 405 line to the 625 line system.  It may be possible readily to adapt the broadcasting or televising machinery, but is it equally <Col N="1630" /> easy to adapt sets?  If there is to be an early change from 405 to 625, would it not be better to take a decision about that before we start providing television programmes from this station and stimulating the purchase of television sets based on the 405 line, if it is to be a very costly procedure to adapt sets from 405 to 625?  Am I right in believing that the British Press are announcing that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided the problem is present to the Minister's mind, I am satisfied.  I want to ask the Minister now what may seem to him a relatively unsophisticated question but one which troubles the minds of many. We are faced with the fact that in a large part of the country Radio Luxembourg is very much more popular now than either the B.B.C. or Radio Éireann.  I tentatively raised this matter with the Minister when we were discussing the Bill.  He said we <Col N="1631" /> were members of some International Convention to which Radio Luxembourg does not subscribe and, therefore, Radio Luxembourg has freedom to extend the power of its transmitters to cover Ireland and a very large area which is not available to us.  I should like to ask the Minister what advantage do we get from this International Convention, to which we subscribe and to which Radio Luxembourg does not subscribe, that Radio Luxembourg does not enjoy?  It is quite manifest that Radio Luxembourg enjoys one great advantage over us: it can command an advertising revenue from a vast market in Great Britain and a not inconsiderable market in Ireland.  That is made doubly clear by the fact that the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes, desiring to cover not only the Irish market but any other market that will listen to them, transferred their advertising from Radio Éireann to Radio Luxembourg and find they can now cover not only the Irish market but a variety of other markets.  Why can we not avail of that apparently immensely valuable advertising revenue which is pouring into the coffers of Radio Luxembourg?</P>

      <P>I am sorry to have to tell the Deputy that that is not the reason recommended to me.  It is usually a passionate desire to listen <Col N="1632" /> to &ldquo;Elvis the Pelvis&rdquo;, and I cannot pretend to enjoy that buck.  I recognise freely that there are others who do, and every man is entitled to enjoy what he likes best in the form of music, whether it be Elvis or Ludwig von Beethoven.  Certain it is, however, that the net result is that Radio Luxembourg gets immense advertising revenue.  If we could command a tithe of the advertising revenue Radio Luxembourg enjoys, we would be able to achieve what I think is the ideal: we would be able to cater on one wavelength for the fans of &ldquo;Elvis the Pelvis&rdquo; and, on another, for the enthusiasts for Mozart and Beethoven. Perhaps the Minister would explain to the uninitiated amongst us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You were then a sea dog.  We even had some sea dogs in this country, male and female, and we hold them in great admiration.  Granuaile, as she is commonly called, was a privateer.  We describe her as a &ldquo;Queen&rdquo; because she was successful. I think there is a good deal to be said for privateering, if you can get away with it and if you conform to the ordinary obligations you have as a member of the comity of nations.  I have never heard it suggested that the State of Luxembourg is doing anything disreputable or contrary to the comity of nations by operating Radio Luxembourg.  I do not understand why we cannot do the same.  There may be some explanation for it but it has so far eluded me.  I should be grateful to the Minister if he would give me the explanation.  If we could get the revenue that is available to Radio Luxembourg, we could then provide <Col N="1633" /> what is the really urgent necessity from Radio Éireann.</P>
      <P>I hear a great deal of criticism of the programmes from Radio Éireann and, to tell you the truth, I think the trouble with Radio Éireann is that it falls between two stools.  In its endeavour to cater for everybody, it manages to please nobody.  I think it is very difficult on one wavelength to provide a programme that will be universally accepted because in fact you thrust upon everybody, as a result of your effort to please everybody, something he does not want to hear. If you had two wave lengths as they have in Great Britain&mdash;one for the Light Programme and one for the Home Service, and they even have a Third Programme&mdash;you could very reasonably provide for everybody who listens to the radio.</P>
      <P>I think it would be a very happy thing if we could have a first-class programme in Irish, a very Radio Luxembourgish kind of programme in English and then a third programme of more serious musical and literary interest, to which those who choose that kind of entertainment could turn. That is, of course, a very high objective which we could not contemplate from our resources if we did not have the kind of advertising revenue that Radio Luxemburg has but, if we did, I think we could provide that kind of entertainment.  It is almost a matter of urgency that there should be two programmes broadcast from Radio Éireann so that the people who wanted to listen to serious stuff could get it and those who elected to hear lighter material could enjoy it without feeling that more ponderous material was being thrust upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want by any means to say that I consider the programmes of Radio Éireann to be anything approximating to perfection but I am bound to say this, and I should be glad to hear the comments of other Deputies upon it.  I do not hear any programmes from any station, at home or abroad, that can be described as approximating to perfection.  On the whole, looking back on the last few years and remembering the obligation thrust upon Radio Éireann to provide <Col N="1634" /> a certain minimum of entertainment through the medium of Irish and a certain minimum of Irish music, and recognising that it is only outside that minimal appropriation of time for that kind of material that Radio Éireann has discretion, I think Radio Éireann does not do too badly at all. When you compare its performance with the B.B.C., which has three programmes operating in the domestic market, and with Radio Luxembourg, which has a vast revenue and which is obviously providing what it thinks the largest number of popular audiences will wish to hear, I do not think Radio Éireann comes badly out of the comparison at all.  I venture to think that if they had the means to provide two programmes, and were permitted to segregate the more serious material in the one and the light material in the other, they would qualify for an even more generous meed of praise than I feel free to give them now.</P>
    <P>There are only two other points I want to mention.  I have always a certain sympathy with Deputy Sherwin's interventions in our debates. I am a little bit uneasy about that because I often find in my experience in this House that when I find myself growing to sympathise with a Deputy on the independent benches, he not infrequently puts his finger in my eye and I discover too late that I have been taken for a ride. Subject to that qualification I am often struck by the quality of Deputy Sherwin's contributions.  He spoke of broadcasting the proceedings of Dáil Éireann, and that suggestion is often received in this House with a sort of derisive laughter.  I agree with Deputy Sherwin.  I think the people who sent us here are entitled to be brought into intimate contact with our proceedings.  If those proceedings excite derisory comment among the people of this country, it is time we examined our consciences.  If the people who sent us here are shocked by hearing our proceedings, we ought to examine our consciences.  But we maintain a Public Gallery to which any citizen of this State has a right to enter and to watch our proceedings.</P>
    <P>I have experience of deliberative <Col N="1635" /> assemblies all over the world.  I think Dáil Éireann compares favourably with any deliberative assembly of any country in the world.  I think it is a very much better Assembly for debate than the British House of Commons and I think it is an infinitely better debating House than the Senate and Congress of the United States of America.  Of course, it is not on the magnificent scale of either of these Assemblies that preside over great and wealthy countries, but when it comes down to the effective discussion of legislation and administration, as it affects the lives of the people, I do not think this Assembly has any reason to fear comparison with any other deliberative assembly in the world.  If we have a fault it is that we are too good; there are too many of us to know too much about too many things.  Therefore, on occasion debate in this House becomes extremely trenchant and even violent, which is a good thing in a living Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that outside many people who do not understand the procedure of our Parliament fall into the error of imagining that trenchant debate must inevitably involve personal antagonism, and not infrequently they are disedified when they see two Deputies from opposite sides of the House, who have exchanged violent recrimination in the course of a hotly contested debate, meeting and speaking in a perfectly friendly way outside the Chamber.  It is only by making them familiar with the atmosphere of this deliberative Assembly that our people will come to realise that this is a part of Parliament and always should be a part of Parliament.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of cases where a violent clash takes place in this House the antagonism is not between individuals but between the policies for which they stand.  The ordinary debating convention of our House is that you identify the individual with the policy he seeks to sustain and, for the convenience of debate, your attack is directed on the Deputy who advanced a certain argument.  It is desirable that, ordinarily, we should <Col N="1636" /> debate calmly and with detachment the various issues which arise; but if Parliament becomes too polite in all its deliberations, Parliament will cease to function.  We ought to feel strongly on certain issues, and if we do feel strongly we ought to say so&mdash; and here is the place to say it under the Rules of Order of this House and as part of the deliberations of a free Parliament.</P>
    <P>Bearing all those considerations in mind, I think there is a lot in what Deputy Sherwin says.  The more intimately the people are brought in contact with Parliament, the more often they see the Ceann Comhairle presidinn over Parliament, the more it will be borne in upon them that, so long as Parliament functions, the humblest man or woman in this community will be free and that the moment Parliament ceases to function no man or woman, great or humble, can long hope to remain free where Parliament is no longer conducting public business in public.  If it is to be conducted in public, the more public we can make it the better.</P>
    <P>I want to tell Deputy Sherwin in particular that he is not the first person who thought of this.  Much the same sentiments inspired the Parliament in New Zealand and they made the experiment, and it had this human but rather tragic consequence.  They used to turn over the national broadcasting system in New Zealand to a broadcast of the proceedings of Parliament two hours every day.  I think it was from 5 to 7 o'clock and one of the unfortunate results of that was that 5 to 7, no matter what was under debate, the whole House rose to be recognised to get a chance of speaking and that from 3 to 5, and 7 to midnight, not a creature could be induced to say a word at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>They were all at their best during the broadcast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They thought they were at their best.  They were very much inclined to come into the House with carefuly prepared manuscripts.  Pity the House if a fellow got called who had a large wad of manuscripts prepared because he read it out slowly <Col N="1637" /> and eloquently, and stretched it out as far as he could so that nobody would hear anybody else.  I understand it was not easy to overcome that and I am not sure that the thing has not been dropped.  To tell the truth, I am reluctantly driven to the conclusion that the only satisfactory way you could broadcast Parliament would be to have a wavelength reserved for that, and to turn it on at 3 o'clock and leave it on until 10.30 p.m.  If nobody listened what matter, and if anybody chose to listen, let them listen.  Ideally that would be a very good thing to do. A lot of people might say: &ldquo;Nobody listens to it,&rdquo; but if they do not want to listen that is their business.</P>
      <P>Sometimes the Gallery of this House is crowded by people who want to listen to the proceedings.  On other occasions there is not a single creature in it, but the important thing is that it is open, just as in the Four Courts when days may pass and not a creature goes into the public galleries and on other days the galleries will be taxed to capacity.  The important thing to remember is that the galleries are there and justice is done in public, and any member of the public who wants to go there, is entitled to go, and it is very important that anybody who wants to see our proceedings should be free to do so.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Sherwin if our people were afforded the opportunity of listening in here to our proceedings, but I do not think the suggested course of broadcasting the proceedings for a limited period is a good thing.  It has been tried elsewhere and did not work.  The ideal thing would be to turn on the broadcast at 3 o'clock and turn it off at 10.30 at night, giving it a wavelength of its own and let those who want to listen, listen and those who do not need not. Nobody could say afterwards that they were not free to participate in all that passes here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing to which I want to refer is one which I think is very important.  People in this country, and in every other country, are grossly underestimating the appalling power of television.  Radio is powerful enough, God knows, but it requires a certain amount of concentration to <Col N="1638" /> listen and apprehend what is being said on the Radio.  We have all had the experience&mdash;and I speak in no irreverent sense&mdash;of listening to an eloquent preacher and you will hear any number of people coming out of church saying: &ldquo;That's a wonderful preacher.&rdquo;  But, if you ask them what he did say they are not too clear, because it requires sustained mental concentration to listen to a learned discourse on any topic and carry away what constituted the argument, or the theme.  People might have a general idea, but to say they could faithfully, or even approximately, repeat the main fruits of a discourse extending over half an hour would be claiming too much.  However, take a young child to the pictures and ask him afterwards what happened and he will give you a very fair description of all the outstanding events that transpired on the screen.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing is that the more impressionable a person is who goes to an exhibition of that character, the more retentive his memory will be of the events that have transpired. I have frequently gone to the films, both with adolescents and with children&mdash;when I speak of adolescents I mean persons between the age of 18 and 23&mdash;and they will remember vividly details of the visual picture that they have seen in the film that would escape my notice altogether. <i>Vice versa</i> I could go with the same company to a lecture, debate or sermon and I will remember much more clearly the argument or theme of the discourse than they could possibly do, but the visual impression upon the impressionable is terrific.</P>
    <P>I think we have had the necessary precautions in this country against obscenity and indecency, but there is an added immense danger and it is no use closing our eyes to the fact that international communism is forever on the march and its technique in a country like this is never overt. Its whole skill is that it approaches our people under a hundred disguises. It either represents itself as being the extreme left wing of nationalism, or it is not unprepared to appear as the champion of religious freedom.  I reeve <Col N="1639" /> member discovering that a notorious Communist paper was being sold under clerical patronage in the front yard of a church in Portsmouth because the priest believed it to be a patriotic publication for the benefit of Irish nationalists, and never looked at it and never read it until I drew his attention to the nature of the publication. We have got to live with that fact but the fact that we have got to live with it should not paralyse us from taking effective measures to protect our people against it.</P>
    <P>I know the average Communist can describe me as a Fascist beast because I say you have to watch these people, and the minute they put their heads up, hit them.  You should not be ashamed to do it because if you do not hit them they will kick you in the stomach if they can get away with it, and one of their means of kicking you in the stomach is by their pernicious propaganda.  One of the greatest dangers in dealing with the communistic type of degradation is that in an effort to defend yourself against the contamination they purvey you may be seduced into adopting their methods, and if they can succeed in degrading you to their own level they have achieved their purpose.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be forced into the position of exclusively restricting our own people's liberty even for the purpose of defending ourselves against such an abhorrent contamination as dialectic materialism, as preached by Marx and Lenin.  We should not allow ourselves to be paralysed and I think when they proceed to disseminate propaganda, as they have recently sought to do in the cinemas of this city, it is very doubtful whether we should accept the proposition that such propaganda should be suppressed because, if it should get to the stage of suppressing propaganda, it is very hard to draw the line between what is legitimate freedom of expression and what is the abuse of individual liberty which our society is concerned to preserve.  But, I do not think it would be excessive to mark that kind of material as propaganda and, where we were satisfied <Col N="1640" /> that that kind of material was emanating from a propaganda machine, that we should require the film or the television show to be preceded by a notification to all, &ldquo;This is issued by the Friends of Soviet Russia&rdquo; or &ldquo;by the Association for the Promotion of Soviet-Irish Friendship&rdquo;, so as to forewarn those who were to be exposed to it that this is a dramatic presentation which has a purpose, which is designed to convey a message and to put those who are circumstanced to see it on notice that this is propaganda material.</P>
    <P>I think it is probably true to say that no propaganda material should be allowed on television but it is hard to lay down a definite rule.  I am thinking of this picture that was recently displayed in Dublin, which purported to be a précis of events in the last war and which was certainly a communist propaganda film which they very skilfully deceived some people in this country into displaying&mdash;I think in the belief that it was an ordinary war film. I imagine that the broadcasting authority here if it knew the origin of such material would turn it down on its merits but I agree with the Minister that he should not be called upon to function as a censor.  I think we are right in confining our censorship restrictions to the grounds on which they are at present founded&mdash;indecency, blasphemy, or matters of that kind, with which our censor is entitled to deal.</P>
    <P>I am not asking that the Minister should exercise the right of censorship but if, in his judgment, material is being televised which is of a propaganda nature, he should have the same power to require that a note would be attached stating that this is propaganda material.  The House will remember that when the Bill was before the House I pressed strongly, and the Minister accepted, an amendment that the Television Authority itself would have the right in respect of any statement that he required them to issue to declare that they were issuing this statement, not of their own volition, but under the Minister's order.  I think the Minister might very well consider <Col N="1641" /> requiring a corresponding right of directing the Television Authority to say in certain circumstances that this material about to be broadcast could be constructed as propaganda.</P>
    <P>I admit that this is a very difficult and serious decision to take but we have got to open our eyes to the fact that we have to live in a world in which new problems are perennially arising.  One of these problems is the immense growth of the power of propaganda as an instrument of the incessant war which is being waged in the world today against the system of government in which we believe and the system of freedom for which we have so long contended.  Against that incessant war we should arm ourselves with appropriate weapons, not discarding the fundamental rights which are an integral part of the system we are concerned to defend but not being so solicitous about those fundamental rights as to be afraid to adopt essential measures for their effective protection against the everchanging techniques of dialectical materialism and Marxist Communism in their perennial efforts to destroy freedom and to establish a worldwide dictatorship of Russian Communism.</P>
    <P>I hope this television project will turn out for the best.  I hope it will not involve us all in an unbearable burden of cost because I do not think it ought to come high in the order of priorities for which public money, in our circumstances, can be appropriated with propriety.  I deplore the conflict of interest which is enshrined and I hope that sooner, rather than later, that conflict of interest will be eliminated from this public service. Subject to those reservations, I wish the Minister well in his project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon covered the ground fairly well so far as censorship is concerned.  In this matter we in this country are well capable and intelligent enough to make up our own minds between right and wrong.  While an Irish television broadcasting service would be of great benefit to the country and would <Col N="1642" /> feature our way of life, I do not think that it is a service to our people to be too narrow as far as censorship is concerned because people have to leave this country and go to countries all over the world.  We should educate our people to realise that we have something in our way of life which is of greater value than the way of life which it is sought by Communist Russia to get people to adopt.</P>
      <P>To counteract the insidious propaganda on cinema and radio, these people should be taught that we have something better than they have, that our tradition is better, our spiritual way of life is a good deal better and that all they are trying to do by their insidious propaganda is to get people to adopt their materialistic viewpoint.  I would recommend that there should be more lectures given to our people which would enable them to compare our way of life with the way of life in Communist countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over a long period, people have tried to do damage to this country.  We had the Connolly Clubs in England and a number of other people indulging in that type of propaganda.  Our own people had to leave the country where they were protected by censorship and other safeguards.  Our radio should be used to a greater extent for educational purposes and to demonstrate that our way of life, compared with the way of life in other countries, is something we should cherish and be proud of.  Lectures on economics given periodically on the radio are very heartening to those who love their own country.  It is encouraging for them to hear of the great possibilities of this young nation.  We have been free for only a few years and while we have achieved a good deal, we are far behind in some respects compared with the development that is taking place elsewhere.  Therefore, we should use the wireless, and now the television service to inculcate into our people in all walks of life a desire to promote the interests of their homeland.  People from outside may try to discredit us, and even within our own shores this or that Government will be criticised, but I should like to see an economic national resurgence. <Col N="1643" /> Wireless and television offer a great means of bringing that about.</P>
    <P>Everybody should consider the effect of different proposals made from time to time on the welfare of the country as a whole.  The radio and television service can help them to do that.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that television is a powerful weapon.  When you go to a cinema, you are more impressed by what you see than by what you hear.  Possibly that is why you are entertained.  I believe the television service will be a national benefit.  Every free country has established a television service.  If we were to depend on the service we get from neighbouring countries, our people possibly would be assimilating much of their propaganda.  We know that items of national culture on the radio and talks and plays in the Irish language are appreciated as this upholds Irish traditions and upholds what many of our people, young and old, fought and died for.</P>
    <P>The best way to counteract the attempts made to discredit us is to reawaken the national spirit and to get the people to realise that no matter what Government are in power, they need co-operation.  The Government is merely a manager trying to do his best.  No Government want to do their worst and all Governments look after the finances of the State and try to protect our industries as far as possible. Such considerations should be featured to a greater extent in our radio programmes and now on television. The great countries of the world have achieved prosperity, I think, only by getting more and more into the export market with their surplus goods.  I welcome the advent of television and, in conclusion, I wish the Minister well and congratulate him on the work he is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we all hope that the venture into television, which is new in this part of Ireland, will not involve embarking on any of the proposals Deputy Burke advocated because if our people think that television is to be used mainly as a medium of propaganda, it will certainly not reach the level of success that we all wish it to attain.  No doubt it can be <Col N="1644" /> generally conceded that television is a mighty weapon, that its influence is almost inestimable on the minds of the people as is known where people have experience of its use over some years.</P>
      <P>Our people, I think, will be called upon to pay for this service by licence fee and possibly by State subvention and I think they will expect to be entertained and to be educated but they would resent very much any Government or authority seeking to use that medium as a vehicle of expression of Government policy or anything like that.  It would be deplorable if that tendency were to develop and possibly Deputy Burke did not intend to go as far as that.  Nevertheless, if any Government were to embark on a policy of using this medium for the purposes Deputy Burke advocated, no other construction would be put upon it but that the authorities were using the national television service for somewhat the same purposes as Fidel Castro is using it in Cuba.</P>

      <P>If they indicate how we could become cleaner, I would not see anything wrong with that.  That would be pretty laudable and we might even make a few pounds on the side.  At any rate, ideas are being put across on the various radio stations and television stations other than the one Deputy Moher adverts to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to sound broadcasting, I want to say how pleased I am at the fact that in recent years Radio Éireann has extended its broadcasting time.  It was at a distinct disadvantage, at least, during the time when its programmes were not available and people had, willy-nilly, to tune in to another station.  It is enough to have it alleged that when there is a matter of choice, Radio Éireann is not fully availed of, but at least the extension of time is something which I like and, I must say, in recent years the standard <Col N="1645" /> of sponsored programmes seems to have improved.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat something I said here on previous Estimates which so far has not got any favourable reception.  I refer to the advisability of more summarised news broadcasts. There is too much detail in our news broadcasts.  I wonder what kind of a world do the people who are responsible for the compilation of the news items live in?  I know I was shocked to hear the death of a member of this House given as a news item at the end of the news.  The death of a member of this Assembly was given as an item of news from the provinces.  An incident such as that leaves a bad taste in people's mouths. That is the measure of the importance which such an event holds for our national broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>Considerable detail about foreign events is given and it is only right and proper that we should hear extremely important news pertaining to matters of worldwide interest, but nevertheless, if that is given at considerable length and some domestic matters are glossed over, the people will be apt to lose interest.  It would be quite helpful if we had more frequent and more summarised news items.  With regard to the recent innovation of the Sunday night feature &ldquo;News Talks,&rdquo; the idea and the presentation are excellent but there are times when the content makes one grind one's teeth.  I can only hope the reportage of foreign events is closer to the truth than some of the comments on our domestic situation.  I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the broadcasting of plays, we certainly can hold our own in that sphere with most other countries.  It is regrettable that Radio Luxembourg have the advantage over us of not being required to conform to international principles.  They can beam their programmes over this territory and, on the other hand, those who reside in Munster, and particularly in parts of county Cork, find it extremely difficult to get good reception from Radio Éireann.  I welcome the recent statement by the <Col N="1646" /> Minister that his Department are, at the moment, applying themselves to an improvement of reception within our own shores.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon and other speakers who said it is a great pity that we cannot use our national broadcasting service to more advantage and to beam its programmes further than we can at the moment.  When we realise how many millions of people of Irish extraction are resident within 200 or 300 miles radius of Radio Éireann, the fact that we cannot relay our Irish programmes to them is a pity.  Any investigation that would secure, first of all, permission for, and afterwards an implementation of an extension of the range of Radio Éireann broadcasts, would be a distinct advantage in maintaining communication with and relaying information to those hundreds of thousands of our people who are, unfortunately, compelled to leave our shores and who are resident within such easy reach of us here.</P>
    <P>With regard to this great venture on which the Government have decided to embark, the institution of a television service, I hope it will meet with success because, if it does not, it will be a severe rebuff to the whole country. It would certainly be an intense disappointment to the people who will invest so much of their savings in the purchase of television equipment, and to those who are looking forward to being entertained and instructed through this new medium.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Dillon, I think it very unfortunate that we should have arrived at this situation relating to the appointment of the Chairman of the Authority.  Anything we could pay to obtain the advice of the eminent gentleman who has been appointed in an advisory capacity to assist in the establishment of the new Authority would have been very well spent.  I cannot at all agree that it was a wise thing to combine the positions as they have done, putting him in the unenviable position of having a commercial interest in the operation of T.V. in this country and, at the same time, being placed at the head of the organisation that will examine submissions <Col N="1647" /> from him in relation to his own interests in other concerns.  That was an unfortunate start and I hope it will be overcome.  Nevertheless, it was unwise on the part of the Government to put this man in that position and to create such an unwarranted precedent in the making of appointments.</P>
    <P>It is not very long since we had a discussion on this measure and to go into detail again on this Estimate would be repetitive.  Consequently, I have no more to contribute at this stage, other than again to say how pleased I am at the extension of the broadcasting time of Radio Éireann and to advocate summarised news talks.  I suggest that more care should be exercised in contributions made by people who are eminent in their own spheres but who propagate views over Radio Éireann that are very far from being agreed by the people of the country.  If that were to develop any further on the lines suggested by Deputy Burke, a situation could well be created in which a furore would arise and allegations would be very strongly made that the Radio Éireann network was being utilised for political purposes.  That is something we must guard against at all costs, because it is the national network, and the people who purchase licences are shareholders, so to speak, in that venture.  People become very perturbed and angry if they find that views are being advanced over the national network with which they are not in agreement.</P>
    <P>New information is certainly welcome at any time but when views that are very far from being unanimous are advanced in relation to current happenings and on matters on which there are extreme divergences of opinion, then, indeed, the situation could become very unhappy.  Useful debates have been held in relation to current topics and they have certainly been very fruitful and very helpful to the people interested in them.  The new programme on Saturday nights inviting people who are interested in topics of general interest to speak on them is a very good development and <Col N="1648" /> a very good programme.  In the main, the content has been very well produced and considerable interest is taken in that programme.  It is a type of programme that could be developed still further in the future.</P>

      <P>It must now be evident to everybody that we have come to the crossroads, so to speak, as regards radio and television.  Whether we like it or not, television has come and we must prepare our people to meet its impact.  No matter what it costs, we must do something to prevent our culture from being completely submerged by foreign influences and we must have our own television service in order to counteract that danger.  It is reasonable to assume that, some years hence, by pressing a button, any person will be able to see on television something which is happening not merely in England, Scotland or Wales but much further afield.  The time will come when, by pressing a button, one can view television from any part of the world.  If we have nothing to counteract the effect of such reception in the homes of our people, we shall lose our individuality and culture.</P>
      <P>I feel confident the television service will eventually be self-supporting.  We must address ourselves to the task of preparing our people to accept our service favourably and not to compare it, as has been done with Radio Éireann with services from infinitely wealthier countries.  We want our people to accept a service which is suitable and which the nation can afford.</P>
      <P>Television reception in the south of Ireland and certainly in Cork city and county is not good at present but to judge by the forest of masts along the east coast, it is evident that the people there receive good or fairly good service. Television can be a medium for evil or for good.  I am not despondent about the television service we shall provide.  We are rich in cultural activities.  We can provide choral, dramatic, ballet, dancing, including Irish dancing, programmes and Irish culture of all kinds.  I feel confident we shall produce a more acceptable television service than has been the case with the radio service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> There is an old saying that you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.  You cannot please all of the people all of the time so far as radio and television services are concerned. That is evident even among the members of this House.  Various Deputies say they like this type of programme or that type of programme.  They become impatient with people who prefer other programmes.  They may be somewhat prejudiced against what does not appeal to them.</P>
    <P>Radio Éireann has not received half the credit due to it for its work since its inception.  On a very tight purse-string, they have had to bear comparison with services from countries which are immeasurably better off financially. Deputy Dillon spoke about the desirability of having three wavelengths to cater for the tastes of three different types of people.  That is a bit farfetched. Desirable as it may be, I do not see how we could afford to do so. It is quite common to hear people in Britain criticise the B.B.C. just as strongly as some Irish people criticise Radio Éireann, despite all the services the B.B.C. provides.</P>
    <P>I want to place on record my appreciation of the service Radio Éireann has given to the community. It has not received the credit due to it for its rôle as an educator.  There is a very high standard of appreciation among our people of symphony music, good drama, opera and various cultural activities which, in no small measure, is due to Radio Éireann programmes. I remember when jazz first came out. Some people considered it a great evil.  Now we have &ldquo;rock 'n roll&rdquo; and there are people who consider it a great evil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Jazz was not an evil. It was most enjoyable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say so.  I said that some people considered jazz an evil when it first came out and that now some people consider &ldquo;rock 'n roll&rdquo; an evil.  Maybe it is not, but some people think it is.  Some people consider television from the point of view of the evil it may produce.  It can be an influence for good and for happiness in this country.  In spite of its drawbacks, it could do a lot to <Col N="1650" /> unify the family again and keep it at home.  In the course of the past 25 years, we have seen the end of home life as we knew it.  Most people used to have their meals at home and would go out between times.  Now, television will help to keep the family together and if suitable entertainment is provided great good will flow from it.</P>
      <P>I shall conclude by again paying tribute to Radio Éireann.  In Cork, we are grateful for the String Quartet. Radio Éireann has done a tremendous amount of good among a growing generation.  It has brought into their homes culture of various kinds which they could not possibly have enjoyed but for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When television was first introduced, I met a man who came back from the United States and I asked him what he thought of it.  He said he hoped we would never see it in Ireland and that, if we kept it out, Ireland would be an oasis in the midst of a world of darkened rooms and shushing people.  He said it was no longer possible to go into a saloon bar and have a pint of beer in peace and talk to your friend or to the friend you made standing with your foot on the brass rail because you were shushed when you went in as everybody was concentrating on the glass image.</P>
      <P>Some people here talk about our Irish way of life and our Irish culture. To me, that sounds like claptrap.  It means nothing.  Nobody ever gives a definition of it but I shall endeavour to give a definition of the Irish way of life.  The Irish way of life in rural areas was that people, without invitation, went to their neighbours' houses and just talked there.  That was a very fine way of living&mdash;a very fine, simple way of living.  They talked about what had happened during the day, about crops and so on, and perhaps there was some back biting of some of their neighbours in the way of saying: &ldquo;He is going to be run out of his farm because he is doing no business there,&rdquo; or there were references to what happened at such and such a fair and who received a good price.  All that will die out.  Of course, we have to move on; we have to make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1651" /> Deputy Healy and Deputy Burke spoke about concerts and Irish music. For a long time, many people have misunderstood me and thought that I was antagonistic towards Irish music.  I shall back my library of traditional Irish records against the library of any Deputy.  I did not buy them within the past ten years; I have been collecting them all my life. If we are to have on the television service some of the programmes which we had on Radio Éireann, it will not be sufficient.  I repeat&mdash;and it is a rather dangerous thing to repeat things in this House but I said this last year&mdash;that it is not sufficient to say we are endeavouring to propagate this thing called Irish culture by having a programme of traditional music, whether it be contributions by singers or violinists, unless these people are competent.  If they are not competent they should not be put on at all.  I shall leave it at that, but it should be the rule in Radio Éireann and in the new television service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Healy referred to the people's love of symphony music.  I recently came across the Journal of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Services of Ireland, 109th session, Volume 9, and the table of contents contains the Radio Eireann Listener Research, 1953-55.  That was the latest taken. I notice that in regard to symphony concerts, people at one stage did not bother to state their likes and dislikes, but later it appears there were 19 persons who liked them and 170 who disliked them.  This is the only opportunity we have to refer to these matters and I repeat a question I asked last year: Why do we insist on broadcasting something to which people do not want to listen?  We insist on doing it.  The inquiry found that 39 per cent. of the Irish people listened to early morning news on Radio Eireann and 33 per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Between 33 per cent. and 35 per cent. listen to early morning music.  26 per cent. listen to the 9 o'clock news.  Then we go on to the signpost and close down to which nine per cent. listen; 60 per cent. listen to Hospitals Requests at 1 o'clock and 66 per cent. to the News and Topical Talk.  Then 63 per cent. listen to the 1.45 p.m. Hospitals Requests and at 3.25 p.m. 2 per cent. to Soccer.  At 5.20, 2 per cent. listen to Amhran na bPáisti; one per cent to An Nuacht at 6 p.m. and 8 per cent. to Announcements. Forty-one per cent. listen to the News at 6.30 p.m.  There is another programme here to which nobody seems to listen&mdash;Round Table and World Affairs&mdash;2 and 3 per cent.; Listen and Learn 4 per cent.; Farmers' Forum, 12 per cent.; An Nuacht again, 4 per cent.; 10 o'clock News 41 per cent. and the Hospitals' Trust programme 43 per cent.  Deputies will be glad to hear that 11 per cent. listen to &ldquo;Today in the Dáil.&rdquo;  One per cent. listen to the Late Sports Results and 12 per cent. do not listen to Radio Éireann at all.  The likes and dislikes for the types of programmes are interesting.  For light music there were 112 likes and 62 dislikes; morning music, 39 likes and one dislike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, housewives' choice.  You could do worse than that. There were 306 for and 30 against Irish dance music.  For opera there were 49 for and 81 against and 45 in favour of classical music and 317 not in favour.  There were 19 who liked symphony concerts and 170 who did not&mdash;we are not very strong in culture there.  It is interesting to see the choices when people switch to other stations.  The percentage of people who listened to An Nuaíocht and who listened to the B.B.C. Home Service the same day was 18, and 47 per cent. listened to the B.B.C. Light Programme; 56 per cent listened to Radio Luxembourg.  Deputy Dillon said today that people listened to Radio <Col N="1653" /> Luxembourg mainly to hear &ldquo;Elvis the Pelvis.&rdquo;  It looks as if the people who listen to An Nuaíocht have a catholic taste.  I would draw the attention of Radio Éireann to their own publication.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke says that all our programmes should be based on our national culture, whatever that is, and on our national language and that we should have more of such programmes. I draw the attention of the Minister to the people who listen to An Nuacht. Do they want these programmes? They evidently prefer to listen also, according to this table, to Radio Luxembourg.  I would agree that if it is possible, we should go privateering and increase the power both of Radio Éireann and of the television service, when we get it.</P>
      <P>In future, Radio Éireann will have to compete with television and judging from the forest of masts going up in Dublin, there will be a great many people going off the radio.  Therefore, the radio service will have to improve its programmes or beam its programmes to people who have had difficulty in getting them up to the present.  As far as my area is concerned, we often have difficulty in getting Radio Éireann.  I assure the Minister that I am a faithful listener to Radio Éireann and that is why I consider that I can talk about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should increase the power of the station.  It would bring us more revenue if we could beam it into Great Britain.  We could get more advertising revenue in that way and perhaps we would get so much of it that we could have a separate station.  We should also do it in view of the fact that nearly a million of our people are in Great Britain today.  Some of them write to me about the broadcasts of our Irish matches which, I suppose, are probably part of our Irish culture. They are not able to get these broadcasts on the sets they have.  When we are broadcasting hurling and football matches from our capital here, we should put something extra into the beam.  I am quite sure that if we did that, we would get an enormous listening audience across the water, again in view of the fact that there are <Col N="1654" /> nearly a million of our people in Great Britain.  They are worth considering.</P>
    <P>I would say that when we are having concerts of Irish music, they tend to be a bit repetitive and repetition is not welcomed.  Many people get tired of them and turn them off.  I drew the attention of the Minister to some of the commercial programmes that are run during the luncheon hour by various Irish firms.  They play some very good pieces of music when coming on; then they play some piece of light orchestral music; next they play some popular song or ballad; and then they play some more Irish music.  A programme of that kind is more attractive to our young people and it cultivates the taste of the young people for Irish music.</P>
    <P>I want to close with two matters.  I hope that when the television services come into operation, the people in the south, west and south-western areas will be able to get good and clear reception.  I want the Minister to assure the people of that.  I wish the television service every success because the whole House will agree with me that we do not want it to become another burden on the country like C.I.E.  I hope it will be able to pay its way.  I wish Mr. Andrews success. I think he is one of the outstanding people in television today but I do wish the Government had not put him into what I consider is a difficult position. I hope he will be able to bring as great success to Irish television as he has brought to the programmes in which he appears in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to remove a misconception about the effect of the Supplementary Estimate on the Budget.  Deputy Palmer apparently thought that the amount will have to be made up over and above what is in the Budget.  That is not so.  The Minister for Finance knew, before he settled on his Budget figures, that the expenditure would have to be met and he took account of it in the over-all figures.  I want to correct any misapprehension that may arise from Deputy Palmer's statement in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has again put on <Col N="1655" /> record his view and that of his Party that the choice of Chairman for this Authority is a departure in principle from former practice, that it is a lowering of standards and a declaration by legislation that there is no harm in it.  He has spoken in a dispassionate, objective and yet very firm fashion on this matter.  I do not hold the view that making this choice is a departure from principle or a lowering of standards.  Deputy Dillon admits, as do all members of the House and other people who take an interest in public appointments, that the degree of personal interest in a business undertaking must be taken into consideration and I have already indicated to the Oireachtas that the Government are still free to determine whether the business interests of any of the members of the Authority conflict with that membership.</P>
    <P>I have already told the House the situation in regard to the Chairman of this Authority, the reasons which prompted the Government to ask this Irishman to be Chairman of the Television Advisory Committee and why the Government decided that such a person, with the knowledge he has, should be the Chairman of the Television Authority.  I have already explained that the preliminary work in connection with the establishment of the television service is not yet completed. In my opening statement, I indicated how far my Department and I have gone in the provision of certain equipment for the new Authority.  The Authority will be immediately concerned with the provision of the studio buildings at Montrose and the radio link connecting the studios with the transmitters.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to cover that ground again in my reply on these Estimates. Suffice it to say that before the decision was taken to establish an independent Authority to operate sound and television, there was a good deal of public uneasiness as to what advice was available to the Government or to the Minister to arrive at the proper decisions in relation to the equipment necessary and the other incidentals associated with <Col N="1656" /> the establishment of such a service, which is an unpredictable service as far as we are concerned because we have no previous experience of operating a television service in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy Lynch, who is also a Front Bench member of Fine Gael, raised the question of increasing the power of the Athlone transmitter for sound broadcasting and of getting an extra medium or long wavelength following the lead of Luxembourg.  I should like to deal with that question in order to satisfy the public mind in regard to our commitments in this respect and, by making a clear statement here, to enable Deputies to make up their own minds as to whether we, as a country, are taking the proper course in these matters or not.</P>
    <P>I suggested to Deputy Dillon, while he was speaking, that he was asking me to run up the Jolly Roger, the pirate flag, and he did not seem to be very much annoyed at that suggestion. He thought we should follow the lead of Radio Luxembourg and go into commercial sound broadcasting internationally without taking into account our international commitments. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see Deputy Dillon hoisting the Jolly Roger but the question of increasing the power of Athlone is governed by a general obligation which Ireland has undertaken under the basic Convention of the International Telecommunications Union not to permit its radio stations to cause harmful interference to other authorised stations and, more specifically, by obligations undertaken by us under a European Regional Agreement of 1948 not to make changes in the wavelengths or the power of broadcasting stations included in the plan drawn up at that Conference without first seeking the agreement of the other signatories concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the extremely congested conditions on the long and medium wavebands in Europe, the prospects of getting agreement to any substantial increase in the power of Athlone are remote.  Certain efforts have been made informally but so far without success.  The Copenhagen Convention was not accepted unanimously.  There were a number of non-signatories, including Luxembourg, which had for years been operating a high-powered commercial station for which it could not get, and has not yet obtained, international authorisation.</P>
      <P>To suggest that Ireland should follow the lead of Luxembourg is tantamount to proposing that Ireland should abandon the rule of law and international agreement in a field in which there would be chaos but for observance of the international conventions and regulations, such as they are.  The Copenhagen Convention was not a very satisfactory instrument in a number of respects and some countries have infringed it but that is no reason why Ireland should do likewise.</P>
      <P>I hope that when the members of the House read that statement, they will apply their minds to its implications and come to a decision for themselves as to whether we as a State are taking the proper course in this matter or not. My view is that we are, and that we should not make any decisions which are not governed by the rule of law and our outside commitments as a nation.</P>

      <P>Reference was made by Deputy Palmer and other Deputies to the poor reception of Radio Éireann programmes in some parts of the country.  As I mentioned before, this is not an easy problem for which to find a solution.  In fact, inadequate coverage on the ordinary wavebands, that is, the long and medium wavebands, is a general European problem because of congestion on those bands and one of the most common solutions adopted has been to supplement the medium-wave transmissions by V.H.F. transmissions.  However, the problem is there and I am now handing it over to the Authority, with an expression of hope, on behalf of this House, that they will deal with it as soon as possible.  For my part, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I shall give the Authority all the help and advice that is available to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Palmer and I think Deputy Dillon and others asked me whether there is any prospect of the television service becoming self-supporting.  I dealt with this matter at some length in the course of the debates on the Broadcasting Authority Bill and I, therefore, propose to deal with it very briefly now.  I must preface my remarks by saying that in entering into such an experimental field, it is not wise to be dogmatic as nobody can be quite sure what will happen in a new service.  However, we have reason for some confidence that the service will not become a charge on the Exchequer. Some 15 of the 19 members of the Television Commission&mdash;many of whom were business people&mdash;expressed the definite view that the service could <Col N="1659" /> be made to pay its way within a few years.</P>
    <P>Secondly, private interests with considerable experience in this field were satisfied that they could make a profit without any assistance from licence revenue.  If they could do so, I do not see why a public authority, supported to a very substantial extent by licence revenue, cannot do likewise. Those are the broad reasons. I hope I shall not be asked to go into detail about programme and other costs which can be estimated only very tentatively at this stage, but there is no reason to believe that the Radio Éireann Authority will not be able to cover its costs within a reasonable time.  The Television Commission thought that that should be possible within three years, but I would certainly not like to commit myself to that or any other definite period.  Our belief is that there will be no final charge on the Exchequer in respect of the television service.  The moneys proposed for television are repayable advances only.  The non-repayable grants provided for in this Estimate are intended to help the sound broadcasting service for a limited transitional period.</P>
    <P>Another question raised here was in relation to the line definition.  Some Deputies seemed to doubt whether the correct decision is being taken or not.  I made a rather lengthy statement explaining our attitude on the question of line definition on the Second Reading of the Broadcasting Authority Bill&mdash;Vol. 180, No. 6, Columns 737-40 of the Official Debates.  I explained that no decision was taken to adopt the 405-line system generally throughout the country.  The only decision taken so far is that the Dublin station will commence to operate on the 405-line standard.  Even if we were to decide to adopt the 625-line standard later, it is generally agreed that the Dublin transmitter should transmit for a considerable number of years on the 405-line standard also.</P>
    <P>Certain provision is being made in the equipment ordered for the possibility of adopting the 625-line standard and <Col N="1660" /> we are, of course, keeping a close eye on what is going on on the other side of the Irish Channel.  I can assure the House that further decisions will be taken in the light of the best technical advice available and the circumstances obtaining at the time.</P>
    <P>The question of the Director General was mentioned also.  I have already pointed out that the appointment is not a matter for me but for the Authority.  As the Authority has not been appointed yet, no decision has been taken on that matter and I cannot even indicate to the House what procedure the Authority will adopt in the appointment of its Director General.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions were made in relation to the programmes on Radio Éireann and the programmes that will be put forth by the new Radio Éireann Authority in its sound broadcasting and television services.  The day-to-day programmes on the service are a matter for the Authority and for Radio Éireann as it is at the moment.  It has been the practice&mdash;and rightly so&mdash; that the Minister has not interfered in such matters for a long time.  The Broadcasting Authority Act has given legislative effect to that practice.  I shall certainly convey to the new Authority the expressions of opinion that were made here in regard to programmes and programme material.</P>
    <P>I have already explained the decision that we have taken in regard to censorship and any decision that may be taken in regard to the question of the banning of certain propaganda material, which has been referred to in the House, will have to be taken at a different level altogether.  It is not a matter in which I, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, will be directly concerned.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Government of the day, whatever personnel constitute it, will always be watchful so that the principles upon which our democracy is founded will be preserved.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan made reference to Radio Éireann broadcasting.  Radio Éireann broadcasts at present five English and two Irish news bulletins <Col N="1661" /> daily.  I am sure the new Authority will wish to review the position.  With regard to the sound news service, it would be inappropriate for me, I think, to suggest any changes in the current arrangements at this intermediate stage of development.</P>
    <P>I think I have no further questions to answer.  I have already dealt at length during the course of the passage of the Bill through the House with a variety of questions with which Deputies were rightly concerned.  I gave long and lengthy explanations of the decisions taken by the Government in regard to both sound broadcasting and the television service, but now we have arrived at a stage where, as I stated in my opening remarks on the introduction of this Estimate, the wireless broadcasting, as a Government service, is coming to an end and a new Authority, Radio Éireann, will, in accordance with the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, be established. I propose, as I have already indicated, to make an Order fixing 1st June as the establishment day.  The Government will then immediately appoint the persons named as the members of the new Authority.</P>
    <P>I should like now to avail of this opportunity to put on record my personal tribute to the members of An Comhairle Radio Éireann for the services rendered by them.  I should like also to pay a special tribute to the former Director of that service. I had very happy associations with him.  In my personal opinion, he is a man of very high principle.  I do not know whether I am deviating from normal practice in making reference to an individual who served in that capacity, but I feel that tribute is owed to the former Director of Radio Éireann.  In that tribute, too, I include all the members of Radio Éireann staff who have given loyal and faithful service to Radio Éireann over the years in which they were employed by that body.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I should like to mention one matter.  At present, reception from U.T.V. is practically devoid of <Col N="1662" /> any interference.  The same is not true with regard to other sources.  Will the Minister ensure that the new station will be strong enough to provide reception as free as it is possible to make it from any interference?</P>

    <P>I Meastacháin 1959/60 rinneadh soláthar do na seirbhísí a bhí faoi riaradh na Roinne Tionscail agus Tráchtála i sé cinn de Vótaí (Uimhreacha 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 agus 66).  Tar éis roinnt áirithe de na seirbhísí sin a aistriú go dtí an Roinn Iompair agus Cumhachta, b'éigean an leagan amach a athrú, agus sa bhliain reatha déantar an soláthar le haghaidh na seirbhísí atá fágtha faoin Roinn Tionscail agus Tráchtála in aon Mheastachán amháin&mdash;Uimhir 47, Tionscal agus Tráchtáil.  Mar áis comparáide tá ráiteas curtha isteach ar leathanach 231 leis an Meastachán le haghaidh Tionscal agus Tráchtáil agus léirítear sa ráiteas sin na Fo-Mhírchinn do 1960/61 agus, na Vótai agus na Fo-Mhírchinn chomhréireacha do 1959/60.</P>

Is ionann sin agus £12,737 i gcomparáid leis an tsuim a deonaíodh anuraidh.  Ach ar an 22ú lá de Mhárta, 1960, nuair a bhí Leabhar na Meastachán foilsithe agus curtha timpeall deonaíodh suim bhreise £404,000 le Mheastachán Forlíontach, ionas go raibh £2,862,263 sa tsuim iomlán a deonaíodh le haghaidh 1959/60.  Sa Mheastachán Forlíontach rinneadh £300,000 a sholáthar do Ghabháltais Chruach na hÉireann (níl aon soláthar don tseirbhís sin i 1960/ 61) agus £104,000 d'Oibreacha Innealtóireachta Dhún Dealgan.

    <P>I have circulated a translation of the figures I have just given in Irish which, broadly speaking, are a comparison between the expenditure on the Vote for Industry and Commerce this year and last, due regard being had to the transfer of sections which are now administered by the Department of Transport and Power.  Therefore, it is not my intention to give these figures to the House again in English, but to proceed with the rest of my opening statement.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report that industrial production has shown a marked recovery.  For the year 1959, the provisional index of the volume of production (to base 1953=100) of manufacturing industries was 112.1 compared with 104.4 in 1958.  For all industries and services (including building, etc.) covered by the Census of Industrial Production, the provisional volume index was 106.9 for 1959, as compared with 98.7 for 1958.</P>
    <P>The average number of persons engaged in manufacturing industries is provisionally estimated at 146,100 <Col N="1665" /> in 1959 compared with 142,400 in 1958.</P>
    <P>There has been a further reduction in the total unemployment figures as compared with recent years.  At the end of April, 1960, the number on the live register was 58,880 compared with 67,120 at the end of April, 1959.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1960, 86 firms came to notice as having commenced production or as having extended their range of production. Industrial proposals before the Department and the Industrial Development Authority numbered some 180 on 31st March, 1960.</P>
    <P>During the year, An Foras Tionscal approved grants amounting to £1,054,830 for projects located in the undeveloped areas, bringing the total grants approved for such projects to £3,023,412.  Of this amount, grants totalling £1,835,310 were paid to 31st March, 1960, leaving outstanding commitments of £1,188,102.  The total capital investment involved in the approved projects amounts to about £7.25 million and it is expected that employment will be given to about 5,500 persons.</P>
    <P>Fifty-two projects assisted by An Foras Tionscal are in production in the undeveloped areas and, in addition, there are eighteen other projects for which assistance has been promised and which are in varying stages of development.  Among the projects which have recently gone into production and those recently approved but not yet in production are a substantial number which are related mainly to export trade.</P>
    <P>The reduction of £275,000 in the Estimates provision for the current year should not be interpreted as an indication that the tempo of industrial development in the undeveloped areas is slowing down.  Last year, owing to the exceptionally fine weather, conditions for building work were very good and it was possible to make better progress than was expected on certain projects, with the result that payments actually made in the year were higher than was originally estimated and a Supplementary Estimate of £275,000 was necessary.  The Estimate <Col N="1666" /> provision for this year is the same as that originally provided last year.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Grants Act which became law in August, 1959, made certain changes in the grant arrangements for projects outside the undeveloped areas and transferred responsibility for such grants from the Industrial Development Authority to An Foras Tionscal.  Since August, grants amounting to £783,000 involving a total capital expenditure of £3.25 million have been approved for ten projects.  Practically all these projects are related to exports and they should form a worth-while contribution to the export potential.  In addition, there are 12 projects which were assisted under the Industrial Grants Act, 1956. These represent a total capital investment of £2,000,000.  It is estimated that these 22 projects will provide employment for 3,200 persons.</P>
    <P>I need refer only briefly to the Petroleum and other Minerals Development Act, 1960, which was enacted recently.  Ambassador Irish Oil Limited have now been granted a licence under the Act which, when certain other requirements are fulfilled, will enable them to explore for petroleum over the whole State.</P>
    <P>The affairs of St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd., Avoca, were discussed some months ago when approval was given to the raising of a further State guaranteed loan.  The Company continues to employ about 500 workers.</P>
    <P>Exploration work for copper at Allihies, Co. Cork, has been encouraging but the mine has not yet been brought to the production stage.</P>
    <P>The first stage of the Technical Assistance project of coal exploration in the Leinster coalfield has been carried out satisfactorily and has achieved its primary purpose of obtaining exact information about the thickness of certain coal seams.  The second stage of the Leinster coalfield project and the exploration of the Connacht coalfield are now under way. This scheme is financed by an E.C.A. grant from Counterpart Funds.  It was undertaken in the hope that it would reveal new deposits of coal and enable our home production to be increased <Col N="1667" /> substantially.  It is too early to say whether these hopes will be realised.</P>
    <P>A scheme of Technical Assistance grants for private exploration of minerals in accordance with the White Paper <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was initiated last November. Grants of up to one-half of the cost may be given where there are likely to be commercially workable deposits of minerals in an area and their development is desirable in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The Government have approved development plans of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd., which will increase the output and efficiency of the mills and extend its range of products; and have decided that the project should be wholly financed by share capital to be subscribed by the Minister for Finance. The estimated cost of the developments is of the order of £3½ millions and the legislation necessary to enable the company to proceed with their plans for the expansion and development of the industry is in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>It was not possible to enact the legislation before 31st March and as the company by that date had to make payments of £300,000 in respect of initial instalments to suppliers of new plant and in respect of some other items a supplementary estimate for £300,000 was passed on 22nd March, 1960, to enable payments to be made to the company in respect of shares to be taken up by the Minister for Finance.  Contract documents for the supply of the plant were signed on 14th April, 1960.</P>
    <P>Legislation was enacted during the year 1959 to provide for the revival of the grass meal project in the Bangor Erris area.  The new company&mdash;Min Fhéir (1959) Teoranta&mdash;with share capital of £200,000 to be subscribed by the Minister for Finance, has been incorporated and preliminary contracts have been signed for the acquisition of the necessary acreage of land near Geesala, a total of 1,939 acres.</P>
    <P>The past year was marked by a general round of wage increases&mdash;the seventh in the series since the end of <Col N="1668" /> the war.  The round of wage increases gave rise to a number of industrial disputes and it is satisfying to note that workers and employers continued to recognise the value of the Labour Court for the settlement of those disputes in which private negotiation failed to find a solution. The success of the court is reflected in the fact that the wage adjustments were completed with the minimum of industrial strife.</P>
    <P>Each year, the Labour Court makes a report to the Government and the report is laid on the Table of the House for the information of Deputies. The court has not yet presented its report for 1959, but I might, perhaps, anticipate the report by making a comment on what has become known as the seventh round of wage increases.</P>
    <P>The most noteworthy feature of the recent wage increases was the fact that for the first time since the war the increases were not related to the consumer price index&mdash;which had in fact remained steady for the first half of 1959 and had fallen three points by mid-August&mdash;but were aimed, it was stated, at securing an improvement in the standard of living of the workers.  Whether the relatively stable position of the cost of living can now be maintained is somewhat doubtful, having regard to the effect of the wage increases on production costs.</P>
    <P>There has, it is true, been an improvement in the level of production, coupled with a certain limited expansion in the national income, and it was reasonable to expect that the workers would want to share in these improvements.  It is, however, illusory to think that these increases can be completely absorbed by the economy without any effect on industrial costs and prices.  The possible effect of a rise in the prices of our goods on the level of our exports and on the balance of payments situation is a matter for some concern.</P>
    <P>If we are to protect ourselves against the adverse results of an increase in the prices of our goods and services, it is essential that we should intensify the drive for increased productivity. This problem of productivity has already been the subject <Col N="1669" /> of quite a lot of discussion, and I think it is now generally accepted by both employers and workers that a more efficient use of our resources could bring benefit to all sections of the community&mdash;through a greater supply of goods at lower prices, through higher real earnings, and through improvement in living standards and working conditions.  The problems arising in connection with measures to increase productivity are, as I see them, mainly twofold&mdash;technical and human.</P>
    <P>So far as technical problems are concerned, I am sure that Irish managers recognise the advantages to be obtained by making use of the most up-to-date information and advice available both here and abroad and I have every confidence in their ability to take advantage of the most modern techniques.  In appropriate cases, my Department is prepared to make grants out of Technical Assistance funds towards the cost of engaging consultants or experts to advise industrial firms on problems of reorganisation, work study, and so on, with a view to increasing productive efficiency.</P>
    <P>The human problems of productivity are, I think, much more complex and they present a very real challenge to both management and labour.  One of the principal difficulties is the apprehension which may arise on the part of workers that the introduction of new machines and improved techniques may threaten the security of their jobs.  These fears are in many cases quite understandable, particularly where the worker is not adequately informed about the aims and intentions of the management.</P>
    <P>The introduction of new machines and new techniques will nearly always entail some changes in the organisation of the firm and in the pattern of work.  While it may be possible, by careful planning, to avoid redundancy, the redistribution of jobs and the changes in traditional working methods are upsetting to workers and may meet with some resistance.  Progressive management recognises that the way to overcome these problems is to ensure that the representatives <Col N="1670" /> of the workers are fully informed in advance of the purpose of the reorganisation and that they are given an opportunity of voicing their fears and apprehensions.  A factor which would naturally influence the workers in their attitude towards such changes would be, of course, the extent to which they could expect to share in the benefits of any increased output.</P>
    <P>Problems of this kind are not, of course, peculiar to this country.  Indeed, they are probably the most pressing problems now engaging the attention of industrial experts in the international field.  This country, through its association with the European Productivity Agency and the International Labour Organisation, is providing the means whereby both management and labour can keep in touch with the most up-to-date thinking in these matters.  The Irish National Productivity Committee, which is specially concerned with these problems, will no doubt continue to act as a centralising and co-ordinating agency and I am sure that their own studies will be of great assistance and guidance to Irish employers and workers in finding solutions to the many practical problems that arise in connection with measures to attain increased productivity.</P>
    <P>A practical and very commendable example of this was the seminar on &ldquo;port productivity&rdquo; which was recently held in Greystones under the auspices of the Committee, and which it is hoped will prove a considerable help towards arriving at a satisfactory settlement of the problems which have held up the introduction of more productive methods of working at Dublin port.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper, <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, the Technical Assistance arrangements, under which grants are made out of State funds towards the cost of schemes designed to improve industrial efficiency, are being continued.  The estimate&mdash;Subhead P&mdash;contains an appropriate provision.</P>
    <P>Reports received indicate that industrial firms which have availed themselves of expert advice in overhauling their productive organisation have in <Col N="1671" /> general found the results highly satisfactory. Grants towards the cost of such schemes are made on the basis of one-third of the cost.</P>
    <P>Enough time has now elapsed for the effects of Government policy on economic expansion, as outlined in the White Paper, to begin to be felt. Various measures designed to encourage and aid private enterprise to develop and expand production have been enacted.  The considerable increase in the volume of production of manufacturing industries during the year, and a 40% increase in exports of manufactured goods over the 1958 figure, provide heartening evidence that our industries are responding to the challenge of our times.  It is to be hoped that they will redouble their efforts and that the expansion which is now under way will generate the confidence from which will spring further and bigger extensions in the volume and range of production.</P>
    <P>Our future economic prosperity depends in very large measure on the extent to which we can expand and develop export production.  Indeed, the needs of our economic situation demand that every firm here, large or small, should seek export outlets for its products.  All firms should strive towards achieving the highest possible level of efficiency so as to compete successfully in markets abroad.  It is heartening to record that a significant number of our industries are exporting their products on an increasing scale. The example of those progressive firms should provide a stimulus to many other concerns that have not so far seriously investigated the export possibilities in their sphere of activity. The reward is there to be won but it requires energy and effort.</P>
    <P>In the British market, our goods have special advantages, the continuance of which is assured under the Trade Agreement signed on 13th April last.  These advantages derive from the free entry which the Trade Agreements guarantee for the vast bulk of our exports to Britain.</P>
    <P>This right of free entry to Britain will be gradually acquired over the <Col N="1672" /> next ten years by Brtain's partners in E.F.T.A., or in any wider European trade group that may emerge from the various discussions which have been proceeding in Europe over the past few years.  Irish manufacturers are therefore put on notice that the advantage which they have over their European competitors in the British market will be progressively reduced and will be entirely removed by 1970 at the latest.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why we should be intimidated by the prospect of greater competition in the British market.  The record of the success in that market of a number of our exporters in the face of strong internal competition gives every ground for confidence in the ability of our industries generally to face the challenge of the future.</P>
    <P>The situation demands that our manufacturers should lose no time in developing exports to Britain.  Valuable facilities are available to them; they can call on the services of Córas Tráchtála, they have the advantage of proximity to the market, close commercial, banking and the many other associations which go to make up the special trade relationship affirmed in the recent Agreement.  I trust that these favourable conditions will be availed of in good time.  The potentialities of the British market for our industrial goods and processed foodstuffs are enormous.  Our exports of these goods to Britain have been rising, but Deputies will have seen a recent statement by the General Manager of Córas Tráchtála that we have hardly begun to scratch the surface of that market.</P>
    <P>There are indications that associations representative of manufacturers and exporters are fully alive to the situation.  There are encouraging trends in the export statistics.  I am confident that Irish industry will make the effort necessary to build up exports to Britain while the favourable conditions exist.  Success in the British market will give them the training, the experience and economic strength to develop the potentialities of other markets as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1673" /> Deputies are, no doubt, already aware of the efforts which have been made through the Industrial Development Authority to secure foreign industrial investment in this country. The Authority have pursued their campaign to achieve this purpose by visits to Continental countries and the U.S.A., by the appointment of representatives in Europe and the U.S.A. by the publication and distribution of attractive brochures and through advertising campaigns.  I am happy to say that their efforts have been increasingly successful.</P>
    <P>During 1959 some 13 factories in which there was foreign participation commenced production and about 20 other factories are either in course of construction or planned.  These factories are located in various parts of the country and, in many cases, they will not only provide much-needed local employment but will assist in our balance of international payments position through exports.  Indeed a notable feature of recent development has been the extent to which new factories are primarily oriented to export markets.</P>
    <P>The achievement in 1959 was better than in 1958 and there is at present every indication that the results in 1960 will outstrip those of 1959.  The recent announcement of two major projects for Galway, one for the manufacture of oil heaters by a large French company and the second for mechanical handling equipment promoted by a German concern are particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>The Authority, through their representative in the United States, have continued the campaign directed to American industrialists.  This campaign has resulted in the setting up of seven factories by American interests here while a further four factories are under construction.  Discussions are proceeding with some 40 other American concerns and the prospects of establishing further industries as a result of these discussions are promising. The announcement a few day ago of a major project in the electronics field for Shannon Free Airport by an important American concern will, it is <Col N="1674" /> hoped, increase the interest of other large American corporations in the country as a whole.  An advertising campaign conducted in a selected number of United States newspapers and periodicals continued during the year and a programme of advertising for the coming year has also been arranged.</P>
    <P>The Authority appointed a travelling European representative during the past year and while he has visited other countries, his efforts have mainly been directed to Germany whose industrialists are showing a keen interest in this country as a base for industrial expansion.  An advertising campaign in the German Press links general advertising with local advertising to coincide with the representative's visit to the various cities in Germany.</P>
    <P>There are strong indications of growing interest in other European countries and in Great Britain in industrial possibilities in Ireland.  In order to take full advantage of this situation the appointment of two additional travelling representatives, one for Great Britain and a second to share the work of the present representative in Europe, is being considered.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company who have a particular interest in attracting suitable industries to Shannon, the Authority set up an information Centre in Birmingham, for about ten days early this month.  The Centre was opened by the Irish Ambassador in the presence of local businessmen and representatives of the Press.  The inquiries received were such that it was decided to retain the representative of the Authority in Birmingham for a further period.  The growing interest of British industrialists in the possibilities of expansion in this country is evidenced by the publication of a special supplement on this country by an influential British financial newspaper.</P>
    <P>The results so far achieved in attracting foreign investment have been very satisfactory but what is most heartening is the evidence of an upward trend which seems likely to continue for <Col N="1675" /> some time to come.  It would seem that the sustained and widespread publicity abroad is bearing fruit in increasing measure.  Deputies may be interested to know that investment in Irish factories has flowed from a very wide variety of countries, including Great Britain, Germany, the U.S.A., Canada, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, Italy, and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are already aware, I have arranged for the widespread issue through the post of a series of leaflets urging the public to &ldquo;Buy Irish.&rdquo;  The first of these was issued to approximately 600,000 addresses in the course of the week commencing on 30th November, 1959.</P>
    <P>I realise how little might be achieved by an occasional official exhortation of this sort, if it were not supported by the various bodies and organisations that are in a position to influence public opinion.  The Government can give the necessary encourgement and stress the importance of this matter from the national point of view, but the success of their efforts depends on the co-operation of all the citizens. For this reason, I am glad to be able to say that many voluntary organisations, the Press, business associations, firms and individuals throughout the country have expressed their warm support for the idea behind the campaign.</P>
    <P>Another leaflet is now being issued, and I hope and trust that all organisations, all business interests, all leaders of public opinion and all citizens will play their part in making a practical and effective contribution to the success of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; drive.  I take this opportunity of expressing my deep appreciation of the support already given by the public press and by numerous organisations and public bodies throughout the whole country.</P>
    <P>As a result of negotiations which took place during 1959 with the British and Commonwealth life insurance offices, and agreement was reached under which these offices undertook to increase substantially the proportion of their funds attributable <Col N="1676" /> to Irish business which is invested in this country.  It is intended that they should achieve collectively, over a period of 10 years, a total investment of 66? per cent. of the funds they hold to cover their liabilities to Irish policyholders. This will mean a doubling of the present total investment and is estimated to secure new investment of the order of £2 million a year.</P>
    <P>Exports in 1959 came to £130.7 million which was remarkably little short of the 1958 figure, considering the reduction in exports of cattle, butter and bacon.  Substantial increases in exports of beef, ores and metals, machinery and electrical goods, vehicles, textiles, clothing and footwear, petroleum products, leather and other items combined to counteract the very considerable reductions I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The increase in the adverse trade balance on visible items over that of 1958 was brought about almost entirely by an increase in imports, the decline in total exports being relatively small, as I have said.  The consequences of the bad harvest of 1958 continued to make imports of abnormal quantities of grain necessary and increased imports of machinery, petroleum, cocoa and other commodities were also contributing factors in the increase in total imports.</P>
    <P>Questions have been asked from time to time about sugar and in particular about the situation arising from the limitation of beet contracts by Comhluch Siúicre Éireann Teo.  Broadly, the position is that we can now produce more sugar than we need and the question of securing a profitable outlet for an exportable surplus arises. The matter is engaging my attention and when I am in a position to make a statement in regard to it I shall do so. Meanwhile, the House may be assured that all appropriate means will be used to secure as good a market as possible for Irish sugar and for goods in which it is used as an ingredient.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála has now been given statutory permanence and provision is made for a further extension of the Board's activities in accordance with the Government's policy of intensifying <Col N="1677" /> export promotion activity.  The work of the organisation was discussed by the Dáil in July last when the Export Promotion Bill was under consideration. In addition to the activities which I mentioned during that debate, the subhead in this year's Estimate includes provision for Technical Assistance Grants to exporters for export market research, design for export, and packaging for export.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas recently enacted the Apprenticeship Act, 1959, the ultimate object of which is to raise the level of skill of Irish workers.  This Act provided for the establishment of the new central apprenticeship authority&mdash;An Cheard Chomhairle&mdash;comprising representatives of employers, workers and educational interests, under a chairman who is also the Director of Apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely necessary for me to stress how important it is for our young workers that they should have every opportunity of attaining a high degree of proficiency in their selected trades.  It is only by attaining such proficiency, that they will be able to contribute adequately to our economic expansion and to command a sufficient level of income to enable them to live and work in Ireland with a reasonable standard of comfort.</P>
    <P>It is equally important for the nation that our workers should be well trained.  The continued expansion of our economy is dependent to a great extent on our ability to increase our exports.  The quality of our products, and the manner in which they are offered for sale are important factors in finding export markets and we will not be able to compete with other countries in this field unless our workers are at least as proficient as theirs.</P>
    <P>The legislation under which An Chomhairle was established was considered at some length, before its enactment, by a committee representing employers and workers.  It also had the support of all Parties in the Oireachtas.  While it would be unwise to expect any immediate or spectacular results, I am hopeful that the cooperative attitude shown by all concerned <Col N="1678" /> towards this new legislation and towards the establishment of An Chomhairle will enable that body to make a significant contribution to the national welfare.</P>
    <P>Legislation to amend the Industrial Research and Standards Acts is at present being prepared.  It will, among other things, provide for an increase in the statutory maximum grant to the Institute to meet increased costs arising from the provision of three new laboratories which are nearing completion, and the opportunity is being taken to provide for the revision of certain features of the organisation of the Institute.</P>
    <P>The new legislation which was enacted at the end of 1959 in relation to restrictive trade practices is designed to aid the Fair Trade Commission in their investigation of such practices and will, it is hoped, assist greatly in the elimination of those practices which are found to be harmful to the public interest.  Deputies have had ample opportunity to discuss the various aspects of this legislation during its passage through the House and it is not necessary for me to devote any more time to the matter to-day.</P>
    <P>The coming year should be one of significant progress for the tourist industry.  In Ireland, as in other European countries, shortage of hotel accommodation has threatened to become the chief barrier to the development of tourist traffic and, in recognition of that fact, the Government decided at the beginning of this year to introduce certain additional incentives for the extension and improvement of hotel accommodation.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of grants for the improvement, as distinct from the expansion, of existing hotels has been brought into operation by Bord Fáilte Éireann, under which grants amounting to 20 per cent. of the total cost will be available for such works as the installation of hot and cold water, central heating, adaptation of existing bedrooms as bed/bath units, provision of additional bathroom and toilet accommodation, and the carrying out of structural alterations.</P>
    <P>In addition to these new grants, provision <Col N="1679" /> has been made in this year's Finance Bill for an annual depreciation allowance of 10 per cent. in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction of new hotel buildings and the extension of existing buildings.  The new allowance will operate from the commencement of the present financial year and will apply to expenditure incurred on or after the 1st January, 1960.</P>
    <P>The initial reaction of the industry has been such that there is every reason to hope that the new incentives will achieve the desired effect and that within the next two or three years there will be a substantial addition to the volume of top grade accommodation as well as a considerable improvement in the standard of accommodation in our hotels generally.  These developments should enable us to increase our share of the growing tourist market.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants for development of major tourist resorts is now under way and considerable progress is expected to be made during the coming twelve months.  A sum of £85,000 is being provided for the purpose in this period.  As there will, naturally, be a great deal of preliminary consultation and planning to be carried out by the local interests concerned, peak expenditure under the scheme will not be reached for another year or so.  The grants, which are administered by Bord Fáilte, relate to works forming part of a co-ordinated plan of development substantially financed by a local development group or local authority.</P>
    <P>In the field of company law revision, following on the report of the Company Law Reform Committee, substantial progress has been made with the examination of the Committee's recommendations and of the other points which arise for decision in this field. I am not yet in a position to say when it will be possible for me to introduce amending legislation, but the preparation of a Bill is being pressed forward as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>A departmental review of the law of copyright, which is contained in the <Col N="1680" /> Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Acts 1927 and 1958, has been proceeding over the past year. Observations on the matter have been received from a number of organised bodies and have been considered. Consultation with other Departments concerned is now proceeding so that the final proposals can be considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>Amendments to the laws relating to patents and trade marks, contained in the same Acts, are also required to meet certain changes in the international convention on these matters to which the country is a party, and also to keep in line with the international trend in these subjects.  I hope to make arrangements soon for this work to be put in hands so that the necessary amendments to the law may be determined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>The increase in industrial production and income last year is welcome.  It is, however, much lower and slower than the average European increase and it occurred in favourable economic circumstances.  It must also be considered in the light of the numbers employed and it is significant that despite the reduction in the number on the unemployment register, according to the statistics published just prior to the Budget, there are 51,000 fewer people employed now than were employed three years ago.  In the course of his Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance expressed the view that although the number of unemployed had shown a reduction, emigration was probably higher in 1959 than in 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is satisfactory that an improvement in industrial production and exports occurred last year, what we are anxious to find out is the position which will arise when the new trading arrangements come into operation, starting with the first reduction in tariffs in July, 1960.  As I understand it, it is proposed to have a further reduction in December, 1961.  Has any estimate been made of the probable effect on our industries and the <Col N="1681" /> possible consequences on employment as well as the risks that will attend our exports?  Do the proposed tariff reductions in any way affect the preferential terms we enjoy under Commonwealth preference and under the Trade Agreements with Britain?  As I understand it, we shall now have to compete on the basis of a tariff reduction with other countries exporting to Britain and, as the Minister remarked in the course of his speech, there is every prospect that this will mean keener competition.  Although on many occasions we have successfully surmounted competition up to the present in getting exports into the British market, industrialists will now have to meet competition from a wider field.  Industrialists here have had a difficult task when account is taken of the relatively small home market. They must depend to a considerable extent on the export trade.</P>
    <P>Is it expected that the proposed reduction in tariffs will be a real reduction in all cases for those countries in which it operates?  We have had experience in the past of implementing trade liberalisation measures in name as well as in fact. The same cannot be said of some of the other member countries of the O.E.E.C., who, while they accepted liberalisation in principle, failed to implement it in practice, by using discriminatory administrative and other devices to circumvent the decisions of the O.E.E.C. to which they had agreed. We should ensure that nothing like that will be allowed to occur without proper punitive measures being adopted.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say at this stage what is the Government view as to the future trading arrangements in Europe?  What is our policy on these matters?  Is it a fact that at present the discussions are suspended?  Can the Minister say if the Government are taking any decision on what attitude to adopt with regard to the problem of the Six and the Seven?  Do we intend to remain as one of the Five on the fringe of these decisions or do the Government take the view which was expressed some time ago by the French Foreign Minister, M. Couve de Murville, that the problem of the Six <Col N="1682" /> and Seven has lost some of its urgency?</P>
    <P>Economic problems are influenced to a great extent by political considerations and so must be viewed from a political, as well as a commercial angle.  Have the Government any views on what occurred at the recent Commonwealth Conference concerning this question?  What progress has been made with the proposed remodelling of the O.E.E.C.?  Do we agree with the proposed idea of a wider trading group embracing the existing members of the O.E.E.C. and including the United States and Canada, as well as other European countries which are prepared to join?</P>
    <P>It is indeed satisfactory that the proposals which were enshrined in the tax reliefs granted in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1956, have had such a beneficial and satisfactory effect on exports. We have always taken the view that no matter how insistent the exhortations, the urgings or the warnings may be, or how effective Ministerial influence on these matters may seem to be, when compared with practical inducements, they are of very little value.  It was in recognition of that fact that the tax reliefs granted under the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1956, were introduced.  We, as a Government, recognised that some practical stimulus should be provided which would encourage exports.  Exports have shown that industrialists were either attracted by the possibility of increased profits, or compelled by reason of competition, to improve their methods or techniques and, in the last analysis, the most effective incentive was the prospect of greater gain and a bigger profit.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, human and natural to expect that the attractions which were enshrined in those tax reliefs, undoubtedly, had and are having a beneficial effect.  I am glad the improvement and extension of these tax reliefs are being carried on by the Government.  The increase in exports is, to a very considerable extent, due to the improved facilities provided in that measure.  The fact that industrialists get tax remissions in respect of exports is, undoubtedly, an incentive which encourages people to seek new <Col N="1683" /> markets in the knowledge that the risks and the effort that work entails will bear fruit.  If they succeed in securing these markets and greater business, and widening their trading arrangements, then the tax reliefs which flow will redound to the benefit of the manufacturer or the exporter.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, satisfactory to note that the incentives which were started at that time have been continued and improved.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have recognised the value of our trade with Britain.  It has been the traditional policy of this Party to recognise the value of that market as our biggest market and that whatever political differences may exist between the two countries should not in any way prevent the potentialities of that market being developed to the full.  The recent trade agreement amending the earlier agreements continues that preferential situation.  Trade now between the two countries amounts to over £200,000,000 per annum.  That is a very considerable volume of trade and it undoubtedly benefits both countries to a very great extent.  It is, therefore, important that we should not allow anything to prevent the full development of that trade and of the potential within it.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the Minister's reference to sugar because that is a matter which affects the export trade.  One export which is of considerable value and which has grown and is growing each year is the export of chocolate and chocolate crumb.  I mention that, recognising that the present position in so far as the manufacturers are concerned is not entirely satisfactory.  I know the Minister and his predecessors have endeavoured to have that matter remedied but the fact that success has not yet been achieved is no reason why further efforts should not be made towards getting commodities with a sugar content freed from the levy which they have to bear in Britain.  It is, I know, a problem which has been the subject of discussions between the Department of Industry and Commerce <Col N="1684" /> and the Board of Trade in Britain over a number of years.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly unfair and contrary to the terms of our Trade Agreement to have a levy of that sort imposed on commodities with a sugar content exported to Britain.  The chocolate crumb industry is most valuable from every angle.  We provide a commodity of the highest quality from materials almost entirely produced here.  The milk is drawn from many parts of the country.  The influence of the industry is not confined, therefore, to a particular area or locality.</P>
    <P>We pay tribute to the value of the dispersal of industry to employment. While the production of milk, in that sense, is not commonly regarded as an industry, the end product in respect of chocolate and chocolate crumb has the advantage that the producers are spread over many parts of the country and the benefits flow to farmers and workers throughout different areas. I should like, therefore, to urge the importance of pressing for the removal of this levy on commodities with the sugar base.</P>
    <P>The manufacturers have shown most commendable enterprise and initiative in securing a market for this commodity. Its quality is second to none. The fact that they have built up an export trade in Britain and elsewhere, but particularly in Britain where they compete on less than favourable terms, is a tribute to their ingenuity and to the spirit which characterises their work and efforts.</P>
    <P>The development of the tourist industry has attracted interest in this country and elsewhere.  I urge the Minister and his Department to encourage through Bord Fáilte or any other organisation an increase in the growth of conferences during the off-season. For quite some time now, this country has become notable as a centre for conferences many of which are held in tourist areas.  Many are held when tourists normally do not visit the country.  While, of necessity, some are held during the summer and holiday season a number are held <Col N="1685" /> during the off-season or at the commencement or the end of the normal tourist season.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to exaggerate the effect of a large conference.  If a conference is held in Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Bray, Killarney, or some other tourist resort, the fact that a large number of delegates congregate&mdash;in some cases as many as a thousand attend a conference&mdash;means business not only to the hotels and guest houses but indirectly to shopkeepers and traders in the locality.</P>
    <P>Over and above the immediate benefits from a conference there is always the likelihood, in fact the certainty, that somebody who comes here on a business trip or as a delegate&mdash; or a group of delegates to a conference or gathering&mdash;will at a later stage re-visit our country as a tourist.  If the needs of people who attend these conferences are satisfied in respect of accommodation and catering, we send away a satisfied customer.  If such a person came here specifically on a business undertaking, limited in the period of time he could spend here, probably limited in the amount of money he could spend here, whether the stay was long or short if he was impressed by the standard of services provided, by the friendliness of the welcome, by the efficiency with which undertakings are carried on here, then, when he returns to his country, he will act as an unofficial ambassador or agent for further visits.</P>
    <P>The tourist trade is very valuable from many angles.  Over a great number of years we have sought different methods of developing it&mdash; some successful and some not so successful.  It is often a matter of speculation whether the money spent on publicity, promotion, and so on, is bringing a commensurate return.  It is not always possible to measure in strictly monetary terms the actual return in respect of these promotional activities.  On the other hand, when conferences are held no effort should be spared to make them a success. In so far as the country generally is concerned, the advantage of endeavouring to have the conference held during the off-season means that we <Col N="1686" /> extend, maybe in a particular place, maybe in a number of places at the same time, the actual tourist season.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister give some facts about the grants in respect of hotel accommodation and also in respect of resort development for tourist areas.  It is generally recognised that the grants in respect of accommodation are appreciated and that many hoteliers and guest house owners have availed of them and provided increased and more up-to-date accommodation.  It has always struck me that one of the deterrents to a far greater expansion and improvement in hotel accommodation is the fear of revaluation.</P>
    <P>No matter what direct grants or what reliefs may be given in respect of the provision of better bedroom accommodation or other facilities, the fact that a hotel is liable to be revalued has a deterring effect.  It has had a deterring effect on shopkeepers and traders in respect of improving their premises.  While this may not strictly be a matter for the Minister's Department, it is, in respect of grants under his Department, appropriate to it for the reason that some consideration should be given, in consultation between the Department of Industry and Commerce, Bord Fáilte and the Valuation Office, to cases in which revaluation occurs.  If a person wants merely to modernise a place or to carry out minor repairs or improvements, he should not be deterred by fear of a possible revaluation. I suggest that that should be the subject of discussion between the Department and Bord Fáilte, probably in collaboration with the Valuation Office.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the past year is the rise, in recent months particularly, in the cost of living.  I note the Minister's remarks in connection with wage increases.  While wage increases over the past year&mdash;the seventh round &mdash;have embraced a very wide range of employees or workers, they are of little value if followed immediately by a rise in prices.  Price stability should be the aim of employers, employees and the Department.</P>
    <P>It is significant that for the past <Col N="1687" /> three years&mdash;this is the third year running&mdash;there has been a fall in the import price level.  Despite that fall, the cost of living, after being stable for a period, has again shown signs of increasing particularly, as I say, in respect of articles which are regarded as being within the cost of living index, or the consumer price index, and more especially the essentials of life.  I am not one of those who ever had great faith in the effectiveness of price control.  In the long run, supply and demand and the play of economic factors will determine the price level, but it is extraordinary that for the third year running there has been a fall in the import price level and that we have had such a substantial increase in the price of essential commodities, particularly bread and butter.</P>
    <P>The fact that wage increases have been granted has undoubtedly had an effect elsewhere.  In many cases the same sections who have been obliged to pay more for bread and butter have also had to pay more for bus fares and, in some cases, more for health charges.  Surely it is in the national interest that there should be an overall policy to deal with this problem of wage increases and price increases in certain commodities.  Some effort should be made to ensure that, in so far as the consumers generally are concerned, prices and wage changes should only take effect where it is proved that there is a definite case for a justifiable increase in salaries and wages, or the price of particular commodities.</P>
    <P>I believe that we have here the peculiar circumstance that despite a fall in the import price level we have to some extent a domestic price inflation, certainly in respect of these essential commodities.  The fact that that situation has developed is a contributing factor in continuing some of the problems that exist here.  It will undoubtedly react, to a considerable extent, on the prospects of industrial price levels and on the prospect of securing a footing on export markets. One of the effects of this has been that for many people it is harder to live. <Col N="1688" /> While many sections have secured wage and salary increases, for others prices have increased without any conmensurate increase in their emoluments.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the announcement regarding the proposed Shannon Estuary scheme.  I am anxious to know is this a different scheme to that proposed to the Minister's predecessor. As I understood it, some time ago the previous Minister was not enthusiastic about, if he did not actually reject, a proposal made to him in this regard. Quite recently an announcement was made that a new company had acquired a great deal of property at the Shannon Estuary and that a proposal had been made which would be developed over a period.  I should like to hear details of that scheme from the Minister and what the proposals envisage compared with the scheme discussed with his predecessor some time ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to ask the Minister a few questions.  He told us in the course of his speech that a licence had been issued to the company which was permitted to explore the possibility of oil deposits in this country and he indicated that, subject to the completion of some other formalities, the way would be clear for the commencement of the work. Can the Minister give us any indication at this stage as to when the company is likely to start operations; whether it is likely to start in a particular area in the first instance or whether it is going to carry on simultaneous geophysical operations in different parts of the country?  I should also like to know whether it is the company to which the prospecting licence has been given which will do the work of prospecting or whether there are any proposals whereby the work will be done by some other company which so far has not appeared in the picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to our mineral development here and indicated that the affairs of the St. Patrick Copper Mining Company had been discussed in the Dáil some time ago. That is true but I should like the Minister to say what, in his view, are the <Col N="1689" /> prospects of the continued profitable activities of the company in Avoca. The market price for copper is now above the level at which they indicated, in the first instance, about 1955 or 1956, that they believed they could make the winning of copper in Avoca an economic proposition.  Is that view still held?</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that certain mining activities were still being carried on in Allihies but so far the activities there have not been put on a commercial basis.  Would the Minister indicate whether any decision is likely to be taken in the immediate future not merely in regard to the mining prospects for minerals in Allihies but to bring development to the stage where the minerals will be made marketable and a company formed for the purpose of winning copper for export to foreign markets? I should further like to know if there are any other mining groups operating in other parts of the country and if so where.  Is there any evidence generally that new groups are anxious to get a licence to prospect for minerals in different parts of the country in view of the new facilities available to mining companies from the standpoint of special tax concessions?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to industrial production.  He said he was glad to be able to report that industrial production had shown a marked recovery in 1959, as compared with 1958.  That is true, there has been an improvement in 1959 as compared with 1958.  While I welcome any and every improvement in industrial production, as Deputies on all sides must, nevertheless I want to repeat that I think quite a relatively small percentage increase in industrial production appears to have some mesmerising effect upon us and we seem to think that a small percentage increase is something about which we are entitled to be elated for a long period.  It should operate only in such a way as to encourage us to recognise the vast distance we still have to travel to bring industrial production to a level that will afford increased employment and an improved standard of living.</P>
    <P>While we talk about 1959 showing <Col N="1690" /> an improvement over 1958, let us have the sober reflection that if you take the figures published in the Grey Book issued by the Central Statistics Office, you find that the index number as to the volume of production in 1959 is stated to be 106.9 but if you look at the figure for 1955, you find that it is 107.8.  In 1954, it was 105.  If you take 1959 and say that it is your last recorded achievement, you find that the figure for all industries and services is 106.9 but in 1955, it was 107.8. It is true that there was a drop in production in the meantime, but if you stand on 1959 and look back over the vista of the previous five years, you find that, in fact, for all industries and services, our production in 1959 was less than it was five years ago.</P>
    <P>While we can rejoice that the 1959 figures are above those for 1958, it must be a constant reminder to us that we are far from being out of the wood so long as the rate of progress shows that our volume of production is less than it was five years ago.  I do not want to attribute responsibility to anybody for that or to blame anybody for it.  We are all grievously affected by terrific happenings outside this country over which we have very little control but that is very little consolation to any of us.  What we have to do is harness the whole endeavours of the nation to a realisation of the enormous amount of work that has yet to be done if we are to pull ourselves up from what we are today, probably the least developed country in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>When we go to the Common Market, we cannot stand the pace they set. When we go to the European Free Trade Association, we find that these people are well ahead of us not only from the standpoint of volume of production but also from the standpoint of tempo of production.  We are bracketed with the undeveloped five which have to be constantly championed by these commercial giants because we have not reached the stage of industrial manhood and we must seek their pity and sympathy in order to help us to develop ourselves.  We have to try to grow out of that position as quickly as we can.  It is not a <Col N="1691" /> position which arouses any great envy nor is it likely to get us much sympathy from countries in whose outlook and make-up sympathy is a very tiny ingredient indeed.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for a Minister, a Party or a Government, or even for a people, to say that our production is up over last year.  What we have to do is to tell our people how much more it must go up if we are to maintain the standard of living of today, much less to secure the substantial improvement which is evident in other countries in the free world in consequence of their improved methods of production and expansion in their industrial output.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the portion of the Minister's speech in which he makes reference to the possibility of increasing our exports to Great Britain.  I agree with every word he said.  Here we have beside us a country with a population of nearly 55,000,000 people, with the lowest rate of unemployment in Europe, speaking the same language as ourselves, with a common banking system operating between the two countries, with commercial practices and methods understood in both countries, a country in which we are welcome and yet our greatest difficulty has been to get into that market which is less than 60 miles distant from our shores.</P>
    <P>We have a right under the Trade Agreement of 1938 and the other trade agreements which followed it to send practically all our industrial goods into Great Britain free of duty, with no levy and no duty.  No other country in the world enjoys in relation to a neighbour the size of Great Britain the enormous industrial advantages which we enjoy of having the right to export our industrial products free of duty into such a valuable market.  We are the greatest industrial mugs in the world if we do not realise that what we should be doing today is not looking to the far ends of the world for exports of a non-economically remunerative character, with doubtful prospects of payment for the goods, but gearing up our whole machinery here for the purpose of sending goods into <Col N="1692" /> the British market.  There is an abundance of money there; we are welcome there; we can get into it duty free; and it is no distance from us. There is nothing to prevent our exporting into that market, if we have the necessary energy, initiative and determination to get into it.</P>
    <P>Our costs of production are probably less than those in Britain.  We have an abundance of intelligent labour which is easy to train; we have tax concessions in the fact that we have no income tax on profits made in the export market; and we have the right to sell in the British market in competition with British producers if we only get out and try to secure that market.</P>
    <P>While we have in this country very many excellent industrialists, people who are restless in their search for new markets, people who are anxious to push the sale of their goods wherever they can and many of whom have created substantial exports to the British and other markets, there is still a substantial number of people who feel that they are all right on the home market, who are quite satisfied with their present volume of production and who allow inertia and laziness to cloud their minds when it comes to expanding their production for sale in the export market.  It must be the task not only of the Government but of all Parties, public men and institutions concerned with extending the entire economy, never to cease reiterating that it is vital for the development of our economic life that we should retain our place in Europe as a developed nation, that we should expand our economy to such an extent that any and every opportunity of finding export markets for our products will be availed of.</P>
    <P>In respect of tariffed industries, particularly, I do not think it is unreasonable for the Government and the people to say: &ldquo;You got a tariff for the purpose of helping you against foreign competition, particularly of an unreasonable kind.  You have enjoyed that for a period of years.  Your infancy is over; your adolescence has passed by and you have grown to industrial manhood.  We now expect <Col N="1693" /> you to show us in a concrete way what you propose to do if you have not already started to find an export market for your products.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole country will, I am sure, support a demand of that kind, that these people who have got substantial tariffs should be trustees for the nation of our ability to survive and it is not therefore unreasonable as part of that trusteeship to expect them to endeavour to sell their goods on a competitive market instead of being satisfied to shelter behind high tariffs and sell their goods in the easiest market in the world, the home market, where they are protected from the wintry blasts of external competition.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, when replying to this debate, will emphasise in a more definite way than he did by the delicate and elegant language of his opening speech, that the country expects industrialists to try to rise to the occasion, not merely in the national interest but in the interest of their survival.  I have said in this House on many occasions during the past few years that the growth of the Common Market plus the Free Trade Area held out a menacing challenge to this country.  I did not say and I do not believe that the challenge is a mortal one from our point of view but it could be a mortal challenge.  We can do either of two things in regard to that challenge; we can either go down before it in sheer laziness and ineptitude or we can do some re-thinking and try to plan how best we can ward off the most dangerous barbs which are likely to come from an economically integrated Europe flanked by a Free Trade Area or what may be even worse still, the effects of two rival trading groups in Europe, of mammoth proportions compared with us, which may again prove as big a menace to us as the original concept of a common market.</P>
    <P>I am wondering what the Government has in mind about these two trading groups.  I appreciate the difficulty in coming to a decision, particularly in a changing situation and especially when you cannot come to that decision on your own, where <Col N="1694" /> you must have close regard to what is done by Britain in view of our interchange of trade and our industrial relations with her.  It is quite clear there is no value to us in going into the Common Market.  Nobody has ever attempted to say that association with the Common Market and with these relative industrial giants who comprise it will be beneficial. Nobody can say either that there is any advantage offering from the association with the European Free Trade Association, otherwise known as the Outer Seven, because they buy virtually nothing from us of an industrial character.  If we were in the Outer Seven and reduced our tariffs by ten per cent. per annum, which I think is the percentage envisaged, by 1970 we would be in a group which would be entitled to send all its products into this country and sell them without the slightest impediment from the point of view of protective tariffs.</P>
    <P>I wonder what anybody, for example in the paper-manufacturing trade, would think of the prospects of being able to stand up against Swedish paper exports to this country in a situation in which there were no tariffs against Swedish paper imports.  Many of our other industries would go to the wall because of sheer inability, as they stand now, to face competition of that kind.</P>
    <P>We still have some time in which to plan and the very fact that some of our industrialists can get a foothold in the British market and even find markets overseas is evidence that we require a technique, a spirit of adventure and a determination to succeed if we are to establish ourselves satisfactorily and in a rewarding way in these export markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister is entitled to remind industrialists, not those with initiative and enterprise but those who are doing nothing to find an export market of the necessity for finding markets for their exports and that that is an obligation on them in view of the protection which the nation as an institution and the public as consumers have bestowed on those industries since they first came into operation.</P>
    <P>I want to come back and ask the <Col N="1695" /> Minister if he can tell us what is the latest Government reasoning or outlook on our position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the European Free Trade Area or <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Common Market.  The Free Trade Area has its first tariff reduction next July and the Common Market has its second tariff reduction next July, unless the reduction is postponed to a later date.  In the meantime we are outside undecided and our next door neighbour is a member of one of these groups.</P>
    <P>While we have excellent opportunities for our exports to the British market, because there are no tariffs on our industrial exports, we have to remember that ten years hence every country associated with Britain in the Free Trade Area will also be entitled to send their goods into the British market with no tariff against those goods.  Therefore, by 1970, in respect of our exports to Britain, we shall be in precisely the same position as all the members in the Outer Seven so far as the British market is concerned, on the assumption&mdash;and I think it is a reasonable one&mdash;that all the members of the Outer Seven will lower their tariffs by 10 per cent each year.</P>
    <P>The year 1970 seems to be a crucial one for us.  We have ten years in which to face up to the challenge which 1970 will not only throw out but which will arise, perhaps, to a less painful extent, in all the years between now and 1970.  The Minister will render a very valuable public service&mdash;indeed, this whole House will render a very valuable public service &mdash;if his voice is raised, if necessary, in a rather alarming way, to show the necessity for our people availing of the time which is still there to equip themselves not merely to make competitive exports to the British and other markets but to build up in these other countries that personal friendship, that commercial understanding and that knowledge of one another which is so necessary if trade relations are to be preserved.  Very frequently they are preserved between one firm and another merely by the personal contacts and good fellowship which <Col N="1696" /> exist between the exporter and the importer.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister refer to the extent to which foreign investment is likely to be available here.  I remember in 1955, when I made a speech in Germany pointing out the advantages to German industrialists and others of coming into the Irish market and producing goods here for export, there was an unholy cry raised by a substantial number of people who are now converted to the idea of having foreign capital and technical know-how invested in this country.</P>

      <P>Everybody now believes that it is desirable to have foreign investment here.  Every country in the world is on the rampage to try to get foreign investment.  Everybody wants foreign investment, as a means by which other people can put their money into your industries to develop your industries, to provide employment for your people which you are unable to do yourself and to give you wealth by establishing in your country wealth-producing processes and wealth-producing machinery.  There were some green-eyed people in 1955 who thought that was national apostacy.  Now the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;I am glad to congratulate him&mdash;says it is a highly desirable thing to do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole idea was to get people to establish industries down there.  I told the Industrial Development Authority to go to Sweden first and then Belgium, Holland, Italy, America and any place where they could find industrialists who would establish industries here.  I believe it is better for an Irishman to be working in a factory here financed by foreign investment than working in a factory in a country with an outlook dissimilar in many respects from the one it is desirable to maintain for him.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed now that foreign investment is something which is highly desirable.  In 1955, it was rank apostacy. Now we are all converted to the idea that it is really what we want to get.  There are outside industrialists with plenty of money and technical know-how and with the resources which will enable them to export to the foreign markets.  That, we now believe, is the method by which we can best expand our economy and develop our industries.  Every one of the countries in the Common Market and the European Free Trade Association has done that and nobody did it with more perfection than the Dutch people themselves.  We are now engaged in trying to induce the Dutch to benefit substantially by that enlightened outlook. We are now engaged in advising them to come over and share with us some of the technical resources they have in abundance, hoping to offer them the advantages of being able to trade from Ireland with countries with which we have exceptionally favourable trading relations and we provide substantial benefits and bounties for those who produce and export.  I hope we shall continue that policy.  I think it is a sound intelligent policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great difficulties here&mdash; the Minister knows this as well as I do; the I.D.A. knows it as well and so does Foras Tionscal&mdash;frequently has been not the getting of the money to establish an industry but the getting of reliable people who know how to run the industry and how to engage in the <Col N="1698" /> industrial processes.  So long as we can get the technical know-how from anywhere to produce here, not in competition with our Irish industrialists, goods which are not produced here and to find foreign markets for these goods it cannot but pay substantial dividends for the benefit of the whole nation.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is the present position in respect of the export of certain textiles to Britain.  The position is that where the article undergoes a certain degree of processing here, say 50 per cent., it can be permitted to be exported free of duty into Britain.  Where the article contains a synthetic element, then its export into Britain free of duty is not permitted.  I think that has been carried to absurd extremes.</P>
    <P>I came across a case of people who were exporting ladies' shoes to England. The shoes were excellent.  The firm in question had a substantial order for them.  To embellish the shoes, they put on a little bow on the front.  The bow was made of man-made fibre and, although the shoes were free of duty, the little bow was dutiable.  Because the little bow, which was not worth twopence, was dutiable, the pair of shoes, costing nearly £2, was dutiable.  That operates as well, I understand, even where a man-made fibre is used for no other purpose than sewing or where it represents an insignificant fragment of the end product.  I have no doubt that representations on this matter have been made to the British Board of Trade.  I should like to inquire from the Minister what is the latest position in that respect?  Is there any indication that there will be an early and satisfactory conclusion to whatever negotiations are under way at the moment?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a fall in unemployment this year as compared with last year.  There, again, I think we are inclined to be mesmerised by figures and to take consolation out of something which, on closer examination, is found to be a source of disconsolation rather than consolation.  There is no doubt in the world that emigration last year was heavier than in <Col N="1699" /> previous years.  I have no doubt, as a result of the letters which have reached me and as a result of what I hear about other constituencies, that there was a very considerable volume of emigration in 1959.  I do not think there can be any doubt about it. Deputies who refuse to confirm it, in their own experience, must be living in the clouds.</P>
    <P>I shall come back again to the Grey Book, which is neither my production nor my Bible.  In Table 16, on page 27, this book shows the unemployment position down through the years.  Table 16 gives the estimated number of persons at work in the main branches of non-agricultural economic activity in the years 1951 to 1959.  Whatever flaws there may be over a period of a decade, they must be as common to one year as to another.  In 1959, the total at work in non-agricultural economic activity was 692,000.  In 1955, it was 726,000.  If you take the Grey Book as your Bible, you find that there were 726,000 engaged in non-agricultural economic activity in 1955 and the number had fallen to 692,000 in 1959.  If we take the number at work, we can see at once that the fall in unemployment to which the Minister referred is not due to the fact that more people are working; these figures are a refutation of that statement.  The fall, therefore, can be due to one cause only&mdash;mass emigration.</P>
    <P>I saw in the papers the other day where the Bishop of Cork, the Minister's constituency, was appalled at the exodus not of individuals but of whole families from his diocese.  He referred to areas with which he is familiar, to parishes in which he knows the population, and he gave particulars of the fall in population in these parishes and of the number of houses where the key was turned in the door and the entire family had gone.  He confessed himself as startled with the situation created by this mass exodus from that one area alone.  That diocese has, of course, no monopoly as far as its contribution to the export of human beings from this country is concerned. Every other constituency can tell the <Col N="1700" /> same tale.  While looking at the position with one eye, one can, perhaps, find consolation because of a statistical drop in the number of unemployed but when one comes to find out where they have gone, one finds that they are not employed here.</P>

      <P>The Grey Book published by the Taoiseach's Department says they are not employed in Ireland. The mistake we are making is in imagining that those who leave the labour exchange go into jobs here. Too many of them have gone to jobs in Britain.  Too many of them have emigrated to the Western Hemisphere. We have to ask ourselves now: what is the national policy in relation to this matter?  Shall we go on trying to get jobs for our people in order to keep them here?  I understood that was the old Sinn Féin policy, the policy of continuing the concept of Ireland as a motherland.  Or shall we sit back and give up the struggle? Shall we admit we have been beaten in the struggle over the past 40 years? Shall we give it up now?  Does anybody suggest that, instead of trying to provide more work, we should settle down now to a concept of Ireland with a population of less than 2,500,000 people, and no unemployment because there will always be a certainty of sufficient jobs for a small population; there are always jobs to be done, jobs which can neither be suppressed nor ignored.  What is the Government's policy?  Is it to keep our people in jobs in Ireland?  Is it to rest satisfied with the continued emigration of our people, hoping apparently to reach a stage in which so many will have gone that there will be enough jobs for the survivors, and perhaps a better standard of living as well?  I merely ask on this Estimate of the Minister responsible for the principal activities in the economic field what is the Government's policy in this respect?  What concept have they?  Are they satisfied with continued emigration and a resultant fall in unemployment at home, confident, as they must be, that these people have got jobs not in Ireland, but in <Col N="1701" /> Britain and elsewhere throughout the world?</P>
      <P>I should like to indicate my approval of one aspect of the Minister's speech. The Minister referred to increased production. He is perfectly right in saying that we shall get increased production only by an enlightened management, on the one hand, and by an understanding on the part of the workers of what increased production means, on the other.  One thing you must do, so far as the workers are concerned: you must demonstrate to them that increased production will not mean that they will be idle all the sooner.  They must be shown that increased production will not mean idleness and the labour exchange. They must have it demonstrated to them that increased production is not merely of value to the employer but also of benefit to the nation, to the worker, and to the consumer.</P>
      <P>The sooner we can get all sections to recognise the vital necessity for collaboration in the field of increased industrial production, because it means a bigger and better slice of the cake for all, the sooner we shall approach the fundamental solution to this problem. Again, this is something which has to be said every day in the week. It will fall on stony ground in many instances, but it is the only dependable way in which we can get an intelligent approach to the problem of increased production, which, properly devised, will make not only for increased wealth but for a better standard of living for the workers and a better life for the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 24th November last, the Council of the European Economic Community decided that Member States of the Community would be free to extend, on a provisional basis and for an indeterminate period, to contracting parties to the GATT, and to other States benefiting from the most-favoured-nation clause, the tariff reductions on industrial products which they will grant to each other on the 1st July, 1960, provided that these reductions do not bring the duties below the common external tariff.  As a country receiving most-favoured-nation treatment from the individual States of the Community, Ireland could expect to benefit from any extension to third countries of the tariff reductions in question.  However, the decision taken by the Governments of the Community last week regarding the acceleration proposals also bore on this matter and placed emphasis on the reciprocity aspect, but I have not sufficient information available at the moment to enable me to evaluate the full significance of this decision as it affects the arrangements envisaged last November.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of Ireland's adherence to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Deputy will recall that, in the course of the Adjournment Debate on the 26th April, I indicated that the Government were considering whether our interests would not be served by joining the GATT.  This question is still under examination.  I may add that we are represented by observers at the annual session of the GATT, which opened in Geneva this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall repeat it.  The Taoiseach has stated in the course of his reply that Ireland would have the benefit of the most-favoured-nation clause for anything that the six nation Economic Community have to offer, whereas it is also extended to GATT.  Does that most-favoured-nation clause give us the same benefits as the GATT nations or not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that the Council of the European Economic Community decided in November last that the reductions which were due to be made in their internal tariffs on the 1st July could be extended by these six countries to other countries including members of the GATT and countries which enjoy most-favoured-nation rights with them. As a country which has most-favoured-nation rights with these countries we could, therefore, expect to benefit by these tariff reductions on the basis of that decision taken last November.  As I pointed out, however, another decision was taken by the Council of the Economic Community last week to accelerate the rate of their tariff reductions. That decision appears to imply that the extension of the benefits of these accelerated reductions to other countries will depend to some extent on these countries being willing to give reciprocal benefits to Common Market exports.</P>

Do I understand that no steps have been taken to examine what might have been an inaccuracy in the enumeration carried out in 1956, and that there is no intention of carrying out any kind of similar examination next year with a view to getting a clearer picture of the information that it was intended to get in 1956?</P>

A grant under section 10 of the Act may be made only to a person who is not a farmer, as so defined.  Where a person has income from a farm and from another source, it is a matter for the housing authority to decide whether the person's source of livelihood is derived mainly from the pursuit of agriculture, that is to say, whether he is a farmer for the purposes of the Act.  If they decide that he is, the application falls to be dealt with under section 9 and the valuation of the applicant's holding becomes the sole relevant consideration.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering this Estimate and the motion to refer back, I think one is entitled to comment on the Minister's introductory statement that it is not a very exciting document, but at least it has the quality of moderation.  I see that the Taoiseach has recently been on the rampage in the country and emulating Mr. Khrushchev in Paris, he discarded his text recently in the town of Kilkenny and worked himself into a furious passion about the failure of Parties, other than <Col N="1712" /> Fianna Fáil, to have confidence in the future of the country.  The fundamental difference between Parties in this House and the Fianna Fáil Party is that Fianna Fáil have confidence in their own future and do not very much care about the future of the country. The other Parties in this House have no confidence in Fianna Fáil, past, present or future, but believe that if we could get rid of them and get a decent Government into their place, all rational people could legitimately entertain high hopes for the future of this country and the people living in it.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister who has to introduce his Estimate here to-day and forbear from making any reference to his predecessor's undertakings, given in Clery's Restaurant as recently as 1956 and on foot of which the Minister is sitting where he is.  The Minister's predecessor is now Taoiseach and head of the Government and the basis on which he sought the suffrages of our people was that he undertook to supply 100,000 new jobs as a result of a plan which he assured them he had worked out, which he had published as a special supplement to the Fianna Fáil kept newspaper and which he announced was not designed to provide 100,000 jobs in one year but he was so sure of his plan that he was prepared to tell the people that the jobs would become available at the rate of 20,000 jobs per annum over a five-year period.</P>
      <P>He has now been three years in office with an absolute majority in this House secured very largely on foot of that promise&mdash;that promise and the promise that he would not abolish the food subsidies.  On these two undertakings, he got a clear majority in this House and the Minister in his statement today, speaking on industrial employment, on page 6, has it to tell that there are 3,700 more people engaged in industrial employment in 1959 than there were in 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the measure of his own claim but anyone who has had occasion to refer to the Grey Book on economic statistics published in connection with the Budget is only too <Col N="1713" /> well aware that, despite the precaution taken of dividing into two tables the employment figures which used in the past to appear in one Table&mdash;they appear under Table 6 and Table 16 in <i>Economic Statistics</i> issued prior to the Budget of 1960&mdash;will realise that in the third year of their period of office, there are 51,000 fewer people working in the country than there were on the day he made that promise in Clery's Restaurant.  He is 110,000 wrong in his undertakings to our people because, instead of creating 60,000 new jobs, there are, in fact, 51,000 fewer people working.</P>
    <P>We are told today, and Deputy Norton has already commented upon it, that if the Minister cannot demonstrate that there are more people working, he can at least claim that there are fewer people registered as unemployed. I am sure he can.  There are seven adjoining houses on one road outside the town of Ballaghaderreen closed, the families having gone to England.  Is there a townland west of the Shannon or west of Cork city in the south or is there a single townland in rural Ireland where there has not been one house closed in the past few years?  That is a phenomenon we never had in this country before.  We always have had emigration&mdash;I admit that&mdash;but I have never seen whole families go before.  Nobody need take my word for it.  Every independent testimony that has been uttered in public in regard to this matter in recent times recalls that outstanding fact, that whole families are moving out of rural Ireland at the present time. Naturally, the sons and daughters are no longer appearing on the register of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I never really understood from Fianna Fáil that their remedy for unemployment was to ship the people out of the country.  These were the methods of Cromwell and Queen Elizabeth. They shifted them off to Heaven; we are shifting them to Great Britain.  I have no doubt that, in the days of Queen Elizabeth, when Spenser wrote of Munster that there was scarcely a human creature to be seen, she could have boasted that there were no unemployed to be seen in the whole of <Col N="1714" /> Munster.  Neither Spenser nor the present Government would be likely to add that Queen Elizabeth sent them to Heaven and the present Government sent them to the United States and Great Britain.  It is surely not the solution of the unemployment problem that Fianna Fáil campaigned for.</P>
    <P>When we were in office, we never made these sweeping undertakings to resolve the problem of unemployment and of employment overnight.  The great mistake the inter-Party Governments made was that they did too much and said too little.  That is a charge that will never be brought against Fianna Fáil because they say plenty but do sweet damn all.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting reflection that after the first three years of inter-Party Government, the census of 1951 was taken and that was the first census since the Famine in which the population of Ireland went up.  It has been going down ever since.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, if Deputies will look back to the year 1955-56, they will find the level of employment of persons at work in the main branches of non-agricultural economic activity&mdash;Table 16 of <i>Economic Statistics</i> published for the Budget of 1960. In 1955, there were 726,000 people employed in those categories of employment, which was the highest figure attained, so far as I know, for a very long time, higher certainly than in any year since 1951 and much higher than in 1956, 1957, 1958 or 1959.  If they look at Table 7, they will find the number of males engaged in farm work on 1st June in agriculture, forestry and fishing, which covers substantially the rest of the economy.  In 1954, the figure was 460,000 and since that year, there has been a steady decline down to the figure of 420,000 at which it stands at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce should accept the distasteful task which, I admit, is set him of reconciling his leader's undertakings of 1956 with the performance of his Government up to to-day.  On the facts, I think a <i>prima facie</i> case of fraud is made out and it behoves the <Col N="1715" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce to rebut that, if he is able.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the two promises they made.  One was the 100,000 jobs. Everybody knows the contemptible nature of that fraud and the cruel and iniquitous kind of fraud it was because it was an appeal, remember, to the wives of unemployed men to go out and vote for Fianna Fáil so that Mr. Lemass and his colleagues could get jobs for their husbands.  We have 51,000 fewer husbands working to-day than when he gave that undertaking but, at the same time, I want to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce does he realise, when he hears the story from Monaghan, Mayo and his own native county of Cork of the disappearing population of small farmers, how far his policy of abolishing food subsidies and increasing the cost of living is responsible for that emigration?</P>
    <P>We heard in the course of the Budget debate of the steady decline in the income of the agricultural community. Mark you, when you read that for the year 1958-59 there has been a heavy decline in agricultural income, many people forget that it is superimposed on a very substantial decline in agricultural income in 1958. But while that decline was proceeding, the increase in the cost of living which was precipitated by the present Government's repudiation of the election undertaking not to remove the food subsidies, hit the small farmers of this country just as much as it hit anybody else but far from giving any extra remuneration to help them to carry that burden, agricultural prices went down and I think there was a complacent view held in the Fianna Fáil Government that if that happened the only result would be that the farmers would tighten their belts and accept a lower standard of living because the Dublin-Cork mentality maintained that was the only thing they could do.</P>
    <P>Mark you, for years that was substantially true; the small farmers accepted the situation philosophically; they did tighten their belts for lower <Col N="1716" /> standards of living and stuck it out but we have crossed the rubicon.  We have gone a little too far and we have initiated this astonishing new phenomenon of small farmers moving out, lock, stock and barrel.  This is a trend, which we may discover too late, will be extremely difficult to correct. I do not want to pursue that question on this Estimate because I think it will arise in greater detail on the Estimate for Agriculture but I want to emphasise that there is a combination of circumstances contributing to the exodus from rural Ireland and that for part of that combination of circumstances the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible because he has forced up the cost of living in the hope that the small farmer would accept it quietly and without any corresponding assistance.  That belief is quite unfounded and we are reaping the harvest of that deplorable decision at present.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if the members of the Fianna Fáil Government ever ask themselves why their predecessors spent so much blood, sweat and tears in trying to keep down the cost of living.  Did they think we did that for fun?  We did it because we believed that if you want to maintain the economic fabric of the country you must have regard to the wage-earning community, to the self-sufficient farm family and to the farmer who employs labour.  The only way to do that is to try to hold the cost of living at a certain level and, on the one hand, by trade agreements and negotiation, to get as remunerative a market as you can for agricultural output, and on the other, to see that wage rates are kept reasonably in step with any increase in the cost of living that you cannot avert and, at the same time, by the stimulation of investment of foreign capital in the country, expand opportunities of employment.</P>
    <P>The most irresponsible thing ever done in the history of this country, following the arrival of the Fianna Fáil Government in office, was the reversal by them, largely out of spite, of that whole economic policy without the remotest conception of what <Col N="1717" /> they were to put in its place.  It had, of course, the immense attraction that if you had a complacent majority in this House the Minister for Finance could then get his hands on £9 million in revenue by the abolition of food subsidies.  That enabled him to cut a bit of a dash, but he never thought of the consequences that were to ensue. We have the consequences in the £3½ million extra which civil servants and public servants will cost this year on top of the increases of last year and we have the consequences in the seventh round of wage increases&mdash;the just and inevitable consequences. While you can compensate the Civil Service, including the Army, the Garda and the teachers, and the organised trade unionists, who is going to compensate the sheet anchor of the whole economy, the family farmer? Nobody thought of him, and we are now in grave danger of his moving out.</P>
    <P>What astonishes me is that although the Minister had the evidence before his eyes of the dramatic collapse of agricultural exports, to which I shall refer in a moment, it never dawned on him that if you drive a 20-acre farmer into emigration and you talk of providing 20 more jobs in a provincial centre, the seven farmers that leave the countryside have left after them between 100 and 150 acres of land every perch of which will be set in conacre.  The output of every acre of that land will drop by 50 per cent. this year and, in four years, the output of that land will be down to 10 per cent. of its true potential.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows enough about rural Ireland to realise that conacre land rapidly becomes rushes over which a few thin store beasts graze. That agricultural output will disappear. That extraordinary circle of diminishing output has been established with our principal natural resources being less and less profitably used.  And then we are all expected to go into ecstasies of excitement because somebody is bringing in parts of a Japanese sewing machine, screwing them together and exporting them to Hong Kong.  We shipped £1 million of those sewing <Col N="1718" /> machines which were assembled here, some to Hong Kong, some to Ceylon and some to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I do not know what employment that provides and I have no objection to the assembly being done here, if that is a profitable operation for our people, but I think it is clear madness to associate in our minds exports of £1 million of sewing machines with exports of £1 million of agricultural produce because one involves the import of £900,000 or more parts for the sewing machines whereas the other involves the importation of nothing at all as the raw materials and the finished products are derived from our own soil, and, if not so derived, the soil will not produce anything at all. Every £1 worth of increased agricultural output will go almost entirely into the export market.</P>
    <P>People forget that there are certain fundamental economic facts, and one of them is that we are the best fed people in the world.  By and large, we cannot consume any more agricultural produce than we are at present consuming.  It might be suggested that some of that produce might be better distributed over the population, but we are eating more and better than any other community in the world.  If we increase the output of the agricultural land of Ireland, 90 per cent. of that increase will go straight into the export market in our present situation. I cannot see how any rational Government&mdash;and from that category, I exclude Fianna Fáil&mdash;can go into ecstasies of joy at Kilkenny, because we have added £1,000,000 worth of sewing machines to our exports, at a time when these are the real figures of the exports from the land.</P>
    <P>In 1957, we exported cattle, beef, veal, tinned beef, mutton and lamb&mdash; and I ask the House to note that these are not only exports, but agricultural exports, many of which have been processed and which employed much labour in Ireland.  The export of those commodities has fallen from £55.3 million to £44.3 million.  That is £11,000,000.  More labour was employed in one month processing those commodities, the export of <Col N="1719" /> which has fallen by £11,000,000, than was employed in 12 months in connection with sewing machines.  The Taoiseach says we have lost faith in the future of the country because we dare to inquire if the sewing machines are a substitute for the cattle, beef, veal, tinned beef, mutton and lamb that did not go out last year?</P>
    <P>More than half the value of bacon and ham represents employment and the processing in Ireland of products, every ounce of which is produced from the soil of Ireland because the bulk of our pigs are now fed, as a result of the policy of the inter-Party Government, on skim-milk and homegrown barley.  In 1956, we exported £2,000,000 worth of bacon and ham; in 1957, we exported £4.3 million worth; in 1958, we exported £8.1 million worth; and in 1959, we exported £5.5 million worth.  Our exports of bacon and ham have gone down by £2.6 million in the past 12 months. The Taoiseach out-Khrushchev-ed Khrushchev in his indignation at Kilkenny because anyone dares to doubt that it is a desirable thing to replace £2.6 million worth of exports of bacon and ham by £1,000,000 worth of Japanese sewing machines.</P>
    <P>In 1956, we exported £200,000 worth of butter; in 1957, our exports of butter went to £4½ million; in 1958, we had a very wet year and our exports of butter did not further expand, but dropped to £4,000,000; but in 1959, our exports of butter had virtually disappeared: they were down to £500,000.  The Taoiseach says: &ldquo;What the hell&mdash;we exported £1,000,000 worth of Japanese sewing machines.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am much obliged to to the Minister for his courtesy.  I dealt with cattle, beef, veal, tinned beef, mutton and lamb; then I dealt with bacon and ham; and I am now on butter.  I am saying that our exports of butter, between 1958 and 1959, dropped by £3½ million&mdash;and the Minister asks me is he to blame for the fine weather?  No; but I do not know what that has to do with the collapse of our exports of butter. However, I shall concede to the Minister that I do not want to mislead him. The Minister may say that owing to the very fine weather in 1958-59, the milk supply of the cattle declined, resulting in a lesser output of butter, and that means that if we had fine weather, if we had milder or more moist weather, we might have had more butter.  Time will tell.  I think what is going wrong is that the land is going out of production.  I think the small farmer is finding with creamery milk at 1/4d. a gallon, with the price of calves falling and the cost of living increasing, it is not possible for him to survive and he is throwing his hat at it.</P>
      <P>I know a man in Banada who, within the last month, brought out his two cows and four dry stock and sold them, I thought, most improvidently, at ridiculous prices, shut up his house and went off.  People are driven into that course by a kind of despairing feeling that there is no prospect in trying to carry on, on a relatively small holding, and they may as well cut the painter and go and get work.  That is what causes me concern.  It is quite true that people have gone through bad times before but there was always the prospect that things would come right again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is knocking the heart out of <Col N="1721" /> the agricultural industry in this country is that all their costs are rising and there is no prospect of a corresponding adjustment in their income.  The large farmer is accustomed to taking a loss one year and having the prospect of substantial earnings in the following three or four years to compensate him and he can face that kind of thing. The small farmer, if things go on as they have been going on for a long time, is likely to throw his hat at it. That is bad enough, and we are entitled to feel deeply for the problems of the individual small farmers, but, from the point of view with which the Minister is concerned, the economic end, it is not only the small farmer and his family for whom it is a tragedy but it is a tragedy for the nation because 10, 15 or 20 acres will go substantially out of production.</P>
    <P>When that happens it is reflected in the money earned from the export of cattle, beef, veal, tinned beef, mutton, lamb, bacon, ham and butter.  The insanity of Fianna Fáil is that they are prepared to view that with relative calm and, indeed, indifference, because, they say, industrial exports are going up.  That is where they are mad and that is where, with all due respect to the Taoiseach, I say he is mad.  It is no answer to these inescapable facts for him to go to Kilkenny and dance the can-can, because everyone cannot join with him in declaring that the future, under existing policies, is bright.</P>
    <P>I cannot forbear from telling a story.  There is much wisdom to be learned from the stories of mythology and history.  There is a story which is told of a Chinese Emperor who was a very vain man.  He liked to be able to say he was the best-dressed man in the world and he was prepared to sustain that thesis against all contradiction.  He got two sycophantic rascals who determined to trade upon his folly.  They said to him: &ldquo;We shall make you a suit of clothes so beautiful that only the elect will be able to see it.  It will be more wonderful than any suit made before.&rdquo; The Emperor replied: &ldquo;That is what I want.&rdquo;  They stripped the poor man naked and proceeded to go through <Col N="1722" /> all the motions of sewing all around him.  &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you are dressed in the finest raiment the human eye has ever seen, but only the elect can see it.  The <i>hoi polloi</i> cannot see these clothes.&rdquo;  The Emperor felt he ought to parade before his people or else it would be suggested he was not of imperial blood.  He said he would parade in his new clothes and he did so&mdash;just like Fianna Fáil in Kilkenny.  All the people looked at the Emperor and said: &ldquo;What a beautiful man.  What beautiful clothes.&rdquo;  However, there was one unsophisticated child there who said: &ldquo;He has not a suit on&rdquo;&mdash; and so it proved to be.  The crowds turned their backs in respect to public decency and the Emperor ran like a redshank to his palace and tried to find the tailors who had deceived him, but, of course, they were gone.  The poor Emperor discovered that the Nemesis of vanity is discovery, even to the point of nakedness.</P>
    <P>The crowd assembled in Kilkenny all came there for a purpose.  They came to back their favourite in seeking the Fianna Fáil candidacy in the by-election of Carlow-Kilkenny.  They are all faithful followers of the Taoiseach or they were until their particular candidate last Sunday was chosen.  They were all prepared to testify to the beauty of his raiment. The faithful supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party are advised by &ldquo;Pravda&rdquo;, every week-day morning, week-day evening and every Sunday morning, that so exclusive is the raiment in which the Taoiseach is attired that only the eyes of the elect can see it.</P>
    <P>Now the Taoiseach joins the chorus and says: &ldquo;Anybody who says I am not the most beautifully-dressed statesman in Europe is a saboteur to his country.  He does not believe in Ireland any more.&rdquo;  That is not a fact. The only thing we do not believe in is the clothes he has not got on.  We are trying to tell him in the name of public decency, if he is prepared to listen, that now is the time to cover his nakedness with some rag of commonsense.  If he continues swaggering up and down Kilkenny or Carlow in magician's clothes, sewn on Japanese sewing-machines, <Col N="1723" /> he will wake up too late to discover that pedestrian commodities like beef, veal, bacon, ham, mutton and lamb, which are beneath the notice of so exalted a person as the Chinese Emperor, are the common material out of which simple people like Senator Brennan and myself get our daily bread.</P>

      <P>It is important to place these facts on record.  It is important that the Taoiseach should wake up in time.  He is the Leader of a large Party.  It is very important that they should know the truth.  Many people would say to me: &ldquo;You are wasting your time trying to teach them.&rdquo;  But we are not.  There is abundant evidence that we have taught them almost all they know.

      <P>The Minister does not remember what went on in this House 25 years ago.  We taught his Party good sense in that matter.  However, it would be a very minor achievement if the fruits of our instruction amounted to no more than that.  I <Col N="1724" /> remember a time when, if anyone in this House advocated that we should go out and get industrialists from anywhere who were prepared to invest their money in this country to provide our people with decent employment in their own country, he would be denounced in this House as a traitor. I was frequently so denounced for making that proposal.</P>
      <P>This House passed a Control of Manufactures Act designed to prevent foreign capital from coming into this country.  Remember, that was the purpose of the Control of Manufactures Act.  This House was told that there was a tumultuous mob of foreign investors clamouring to get in and that the only way to hold the doors against them was by legislation of this House to prevent them from coming in&mdash;and we did it with great success.</P>
      <P>I remember one of the biggest asbestos manufacturers in the world asking leave to come into this country without tariff, protection or anything else, to establish a factory here for the manufacture of asbestos rainwater goods.  We threw him out.  We told him there was a Control of Manufactures Act and that if he did not comply with the terms of that Act he would not be let in.  His factory was established in Northern Ireland.  Now the wheel has come full circle.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce says we do him an injustice in making the allegation against him and that the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1953, is evidence that they had been converted much earlier than it appeared. I say it is proof that they were still unconverted.  That Act provided certain facilities for foreign capital to come into this country provided it went west of the Shannon.  The Act laid down: &ldquo;All the encouragements we are prepared to offer to external capital are confined strictly to external capital which is prepared to go west of the Shannon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is only in very recent days that this Government have wakened up to the fact that it is worth looking for foreign investment wherever we can get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> I often think that public memory is terribly short.  Sometimes I am troubled by the short memory of some members of this House.  Do they remember when the Industrial Development Authority was set up by Mr. Morrissey, then Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Do they remember the present Taoiseach, then Deputy Seán Lemass, declaring solemnly from the place where I am now standing that the whole concept was misconceived and he pledged himself, if he ever got back into office, to dismiss the members of the Industrial Development Authority?  Do they remember his saying that he would wind it up and throw them out?  Now the Industrial Development Authority is the keystone of the arch and in six months' time we shall be told it was the brain child of the present Taoiseach.  Mark you, &ldquo;Pravda&rdquo; will be saying that and if you were to ask the average decent backbencher of Fianna Fáil who established the Industrial Development Authority he would reply: &ldquo;Of course it was Deputy Seán Lemass.&rdquo;  Would you not?  Cross your heart and hope to die, did you not all believe that? Even Senators would believe it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I have a few old friends in the Seanad and I never like to leave them far out of my recollection.  What is astonishing is the way Fianna Fáil can get away with it. It is largely due to the three editions of &ldquo;Pravda&rdquo; of course.  They would believe anything they read in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier today, the visual impression on the simple-minded person is much stronger than the spoken word.  Undoubtedly for the simple-minded, the constant bombarding of their minds by &ldquo;Pravda&rdquo;, morning, evening and on Sundays, has its effect. But there is a positive menace when that kind of propaganda begins to do its work in Dáil Éireann because for good or ill, and I think for good, we are the ultimate arbiters of the economic policy of this community and if Parliament itself can be led by the nose into the errors that Fianna Fáil have <Col N="1726" /> habitually perpetrated the country is in very real danger.  It is my confident belief that neither Parliament nor the country can permanently be so misled that gives me hope and confidence in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to say most categorically to this House, and through the House to the Taoiseach, that when he charges his political opponents in this House with having lost faith in the country he can take a running jump at himself. Nobody has lost faith in the future of this country, least of all the members of this Party, because they can look back with some pride on the fact that they and theirs played no small part in making it what it is today without any assistance from the Taoiseach or any of the Fianna Fáil supporters. But we have no confidence, no faith and no belief in the fundamental misrepresentations of the Fianna Fáil Party or the three &ldquo;Pravdas&rdquo;.  That kind of intensive propaganda makes no impression upon our minds except a growing contempt for the source from which it comes.  I want to repeat an inquiry that Deputy Norton mentioned.  We were told by the Taoiseach when he talked about the trade agreement with Britain that under that agreement we would secure unlimited entry, free of duty, for industrial products to the British market.  How does he reconcile that with the extraordinary situation in which the ready-made clothing industry is subjected to this fantastic tariff rate where any element of man-made fibres enters into the lining or the trimming of the whole garment?  I imagine there are certain difficulties to which the Minister may refer but I shall be glad to know from him if any progress is being made to get that matter adjusted.</P>
    <P>Here is a matter which I think is really significant and in my judgment is of urgent importance.  We have an immensely unfavourable trade balance with Germany and Germany is a country with which we have the friendliest possible relations.  We could sell in Germany tomorrow, if we were allowed to by the German Government, almost unlimited quantities of canned meat.  There is a strong vigorous demand for Irish canned meat in Germany but its import there is <Col N="1727" /> controlled by licence.  There is a set-up in Germany between the organised importing firms and certain sources of supply in Denmark, Holland and Belgium which virtually amounts to a cartel.  Theoretically, anybody is entitled to share in the frequent issue of licences by the German Government for the importation of canned meat but what happens, in effect, is that the procedure in Germany is that the well-established importers know when and how to apply for these licences and they get them all.  These boys are all tied up with the sources of supply on the Continent of Europe and although there are large potential importers in the retail trade, and indeed in the wholesale trade, in Germany ready, willing and anxious to buy Irish canned meat they will not be allowed to buy one tin.</P>
    <P>Now that is over and above the actual restrictions that may be contained in the trade agreement negotiated between ourselves and Germany. Anybody who knows anything about Continental trade is aware that more than half of the restrictions which are effectual in controlling that trade are administratively quite outside the terms of the trade treaties negotiated. You get a trade treaty which expresses the right to export certain commodities to certain countries but there is superimposed a confusion of administrative problems which even more rigorously restrict the import potential of a country like Germany for the goods you want to export.</P>
    <P>I think we should say to our friends in the German Government that we want to trade with them and that we would welcome an expansion of trade but that that trade is a two-way business; that if there exists a situation where they are importing a certain commodity from certain countries and that is a commodity that we are in a position to supply, and in a position to sell because we found customers inside Germany, who are prepared to buy it, we are not going to chew the rag indefinitely on the administrative and control problems which prevent that trade maturing&mdash; because we know by long experience <Col N="1728" /> if the German Government wants to permit administrative machinery to block our exports they can do it&mdash; but simply decide we are going to equate the volume of trade.  We can say, &ldquo;If you take £1,000,000 worth of goods, more or less, we will buy £1,000,000 worth from you.  If the out turn of our trade is £3,000,000 each way, that is grand.  If it turns out approximately £5,000,000 each way that is grand but, if it turns out £6,000,000 from Germany to Ireland and £1,000,000 from Ireland to Germany, we are going to bring the two volumes of trade into an approximate equality, but we would much sooner you would do it.  We have not got the slightest desire to cut down your exports to Ireland, but if you want to keep them at their present level you must do something in Germany to enable us to sell to you what will bring the trade into approximate equality.&rdquo;  I do not think that is an unreasonable stipulation to make upon them.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that they are entitled to say that the German market is a free market, and that if we can sell our goods in it, we are welcome.  The ball is then passed to us in so far as we have an order for 100,000 tins of canned meat, and we are told that we are unable to get a licence for the import of that meat into Federal Germany because of administrative difficulties. It is up to them to clean up that situation and let that meat in.  If we are told that they cannot do that, we can only say to them that we are sorry, but if they are not in a position to help us to get our exports in, the only alternative left to us is to reduce our imports from them and to transfer that order to some other market.</P>
    <P>The same applies to France.  We are entitled to say to the French that all we are asking is the same freedom to trade in France as France has in Ireland but that we do not intend to have the wool pulled over our eyes. We know there is nothing we can do to clear up an administrative tangle which is created for the purpose of restricting our exports to these countries, but we are forced to say to the Governments of France, Holland, Denmark or West <Col N="1729" /> Germany that if they allow these administrative tangles to survive and to frustrate our trade with them, we must take corresponding steps to ensure that we shall have unrestricted trade, always emphasising that we have no desire to engage in any restrictive practices at all towards bringing down their exports to us, providing that they will take effective steps to see that our exports to them are not restricted by administrative tangles.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Allihies copper deposits and said that exploratory work was being engaged in but that the mines were not yet in production. My information is that Allihies had the largest deposits of copper in the continent of Europe and one of the largest in the western hemisphere until the Rhodesian deposits were discovered. Why it should now be explored for copper, I do not know. Copper was worked profitably there up to the Twenties.</P>

The world price of copper had declined substantially but it ought to be possible to produce copper profitably at Allihies.  I like to recall in the context of copper mining the number of men who are working in Avoca.  I wonder what contribution that is making to the expansion of industrial employment in this country.  I think it is substantial.</P>

      <P>Indeed, they are not. The public may know that people are paid for not going to sea but they do not yet know that people are paid overtime in lieu of holidays from the laborious work of not going to sea.  I am prepared to defer further investigation at this stage if that deplorable feature of our transport facilities is in the process of solution through the goodwill of the trade union movement and the shipping industry.  It is right that we should remember that the Dublin docks are not the only ones faced with difficulties of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that the question of the user of carrier vans is also within the province of the Minister for Transport and Power but I do not think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should dissociate himself from all responsibility for it.  The user of these carrier vans would make a substantial contribution to the reduction of transport charges on many types of our <Col N="1731" /> agricultural output.  This is a problem the solution of which is worthy of continued negotiation and discussion with the trade union authorities who, in the last analysis, must give their cooperation if these problems are to be suitably settled.</P>
    <P>My main purpose in intervening in this debate to-day was to recall to the Minister what an unseemly burden he took upon himself when he undertook to vindicate the undertaking given by his predecessor, the Taoiseach, four years ago.  I want to repel at the earliest possible opportunity the observations made by the Taoiseach, speaking recently in Kilkenny, when he made against the opponents of Fianna Fáil the undesirable allegation that they had lost faith in their own country.  I thought it appropriate to avail of this occasion to repeat that what we have lost faith in is something which we never trusted, the Fianna Fáil Party. We still believe, as we have always believed, that given a sound policy for our trade and industry there can be found in Ireland for all our people not riches or luxury but a decent living, security, dignity and peace.  Fianna Fáil dislike a policy.  They strip the land of its population and point with pride to the fact that we have not got as many unemployed as we used to have.  We would remind the Government that Cromwell and Queen Elizabeth made the same boast.  They professed to send them to Hell; we like to think they sent them to Heaven. Now Fianna Fáil can do no more than dispatch them to the ancient enemy in Great Britain or the ill-requited friend in North America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce in his introductory speech here today attempted to give us a favourable and optimistic report as far as his Department is concerned. Apropos of the lecture we had from the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he spoke on the Budget, that is, his criticism of the criticism that comes from this side with regard to Government activities, while we should like to see a favourable report from Industry and Commerce and be optimistic about the future, we cannot <Col N="1732" /> be as optimistic as the Minister would want us to be nor do we consider the report of the activities of his Department as favourable as he seems to think it is.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House but merely to refer to matters mentioned by the Minister in his opening speech this morning.  It has been said, and repeated often enough, that the Taoiseach and former Minister for Industry and Commerce made certain promises in regard to employment. These, I think, it must be now agreed, have not been honoured and there is no use in the Minister pretending from figures he gave today that the promises that were given by the Taoiseach and by the Fianna Fáil Party have been carried out.</P>
      <P>I think it was the Taoiseach who referred to 1957 as the year of depression, 1958 as the year of recovery and 1959 as the year of progress.  Merely saying that the year 1957 was a year of depression, that 1958 was a year of recovery and that 1959 was a year of progress does not necessarily mean that we had either the recovery or the progress that Fianna Fáil promised. We have only to have regard to exports; we have only to have regard to the figures for employment which show that there has been only a relatively small advance in the three years during which the Fianna Fáil Party have been the Government of this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister in a very short paragraph&mdash;he did not expand upon it&mdash; merely said:</P>
      <P>The average number of persons engaged in manufacturing industry is provisionally estimated at 146,100 in 1959, compared with 142,400 in 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means that, compared with 1958, in 1959 we produced only 3,700 new jobs in that branch of employment and of course in the other branches of employment, employment has decreased to an alarming degree. With all the talk we have heard about the establishment of factories and about progress in other directions over which the Minister has jurisdiction an increase of 3,700 is not a spectacular <Col N="1733" /> advance in employment in one year. Especially do we consider it a very poor achievement in respect of the country at large when we remember that compared with 1958 we had, in 1959, 6,200 fewer employed in agriculture which means that we have a net decrease as far as employment figures are concerned.</P>
    <P>It has been said over and over again &mdash;and I do not want to go into it again in the same detail as the previous two speakers have&mdash;that the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, promised 100,000 new jobs over a period of five years.  I am convinced he said it but whether he said it or not does not make much difference now.  The fact is that he did not go near the target at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring this aspect of employment to the notice of the Minister and the Government.  This booklet, <i>Economic Statistics</i>, has given the country, and given us especially, very valuable information but I did note that when the Taoiseach spoke recently on the Budget he said we could not rely on these figures.  They are the only figures we have and therefore I propose to take them as reliable until they are refuted or changed in some way by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Industry and Commerce see anything peculiar in this?  I note here that the number employed outside agriculture in 1959 was 692,000.  Those engaged in manufacturing number 186,000.  That represents something like 26 per cent. of the working population outside agriculture. It seems extraordinary to me that under the heading of &ldquo;Public Administration, Defence, and Other Economic Activity&rdquo;, we have a total of 226,000.  Thirty per cent. of our people who are outside agriculture are engaged in &ldquo;Public Administration, Defence and Other Economic Activity&rdquo;, and in manufacturing we have 186,000 representing 27 per cent.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister or some member of the Government if they consider that to be unusual.  I should say that in respect of the numbers engaged in &ldquo;Public Administration and Defence,&rdquo; there <Col N="1734" /> are around 9,000.  That may not be a formidable number compared with the figures for the other categories but under the heading of &ldquo;Other Economic Activity&rdquo; we have approximately 25 per cent., or 177,000 out of a total of 692,000, engaged in the business of mining, quarrying, turf production, construction, public administration, and so on.  Is that not lopsided?  Can we afford to have so many people who could be regarded as being nonproductive? It would be interesting if the Minister would give us his opinion from the information he has, as to whether or not we have too many middlemen, a situation which militates against production and which certainly militates against the possibility of stabilising or reducing the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Apropos of that, I should like to turn again to another Table in this booklet, <i>Economic Statistics.</i>  I think the Minister referred to this matter in his speech under the heading of the Labour Court.  One would get a certain impression from the Taoiseach and from the Minister for Finance in their recent speeches on the Budget debate.  Whilst the Minister has not said so directly, let the Minister not say that I accused him of this in this debate when he is replying.  These three gave me the impression they considered that in some way or another the last increase given to the workers of this country was unjustified.  The Minister did not say that today.  The Taoiseach did not say it in specific terms and neither did the Minister for Finance, but the three of them have harped on it in their last three speeches.  They said, in fact, of these increases that we cannot but expect that there will be an increase in the cost of living.  Would the Minister look at page 24 at Table 10 in this little booklet?  If he has not a copy, I shall give him the figures.  Table 10 refers to the national income.  According to this Table, under the heading of nonagricultural domestic income for wages, salaries and pensions for the year 1958, we see a figure of £234,000,000, which increased by £9,000,000 to £243,000,000 for the year 1959.</P>
    <P>That, one could say, represents the <Col N="1735" /> increase in wages, and to a smaller extent, in pensions, that occurred between 1958 and 1959.  One might regard £9,000,000 as a formidable amount but it does also represent, I think, an increase of 4 per cent., but let us look on the other hand to the heading &ldquo;Other Income&rdquo; and we find that &ldquo;Other Income&rdquo; was listed in 1958 as £95,000,000.  It rose by £10,000,000 to £105,000,000 in 1959.</P>
    <P>I do not think, therefore, anybody could say that the workers of this country, the salary earners or the pensioners got any more or even got a fair share of the general increase in national income that occurred between 1958 and 1959.  The increase under &ldquo;Other Income&rdquo; was approximately 10 per cent.  I think that in the case of wages, salaries and pensions, it was something like 4 per cent.  It was less than 4 per cent., as a matter of fact.  I think the impression should not go abroad, nor should the people believe, that the workers got any more than their due in the last round of wage increases, when you consider the over-all increase in the national income and especially when you consider the increase under the heading &ldquo;Other Income&rdquo;, which includes profits, fees, bonuses and all that sort of business which was mainly in respect of manufacturers, industrialists and big business generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister at page 11, when speaking on wage increases and the Labour Court generally, said:</P>
    <P>The most noteworthy feature of the recent wage increases was the fact that for the first time since the war the increases were not related to the consumer price index (which had, in fact, remained steady for the first half of 1959 and had fallen three points by mid-August) but were aimed, it was stated, at securing an improvement in the standard of living of the workers.</P>
    <P>What the Minister says in relation to the consumer price index is probably right but it should also be borne in mind, especially by a colleague of the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1736" />&mdash;the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash; that the cost of food in the past three years, under this Government, increased by 12 per cent.  There are many items in the consumer price index with which a great many people are not at all concerned.  Many of the lower paid workers are not concerned with many items now included in the consumer price index.  I think a note could be added to that, that, while the price of food increased by 12 per cent. in the past three years, in a similar period under the inter-Party Government, that is, from 1954 to 1957, the cost of food increased by only 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is in relation to what the Minister went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whether the relatively stable position of the cost of living can now be maintained is somewhat doubtful having regard to the effect of the wage increases on production costs. There has, it is true, been an improvement in the level of production coupled with a certain limited expansion in the national income, and it was reasonable to expect that the workers would want to share in these improvements.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister in respect of that statement if this Government have abandoned all idea of any control on the cost of living by Government action?  I remember what was described as the sixth round of wage increases, when there was an agreement that the increase would not be more than 10/- per week.  There was a clause in that agreement to the effect that there would not be any substantial increase in the prices of commodities as a result of that 10/- wage agreement.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows, in fact, that there was.  Everybody knows, in fact, that many manufacturers and many people engaged in trade and business, to offset an increase of 10/- per week, added, perhaps, 12/-, 15/- or £1 per week to various commodities, on the pretence that they were merely trying to compensate themselves for an increase in wages.  I suppose there is not the same case for the strict control as there was, <Col N="1737" /> say, during the Emergency period and especially during the war period, but I believe that there is still scope for some sort of price control because there are unscrupulous people in this country who will extract the last penny they can from the consumer.  I have said already that there are many unscrupulous manufacturers who overcompensate themselves to the extent of 50 per cent. and 100 per cent. on the pretext of compensating themselves for an increase in wages.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;Industrial Activities,&rdquo; the Minister says:</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1960, 86 firms came to notice as having commenced production or as having extended their range of production.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister if he can&mdash;I could not glean it from this&mdash;to say approximately where these new projects or existing businesses extending their range of production are located. In another paragraph, the Minister said that 52 projects assisted by An Foras Tionscal are in production in the undeveloped areas.  It would be interesting to know what response there has been to such Acts as the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, and what encouragement was given to people to go across to the west.  It would be interesting to discover how, in fact, it has worked out, and whether the bulk of the industries have gone generally west of the Shannon.  I have given my views on the Undeveloped Areas Act and the grants given under that Act time after time here.  I do not propose to repeat them in this debate because I do not think I should be strictly in order if I did.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Shannon Free Airport.  I do not remember any official statement from anybody on this matter.  Indeed, I do not know whether this is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned&mdash;indeed, as far as a great number of us are concerned&mdash;this whole <Col N="1738" /> project is very vague and I, for one, would like to have more details about it, and certainly more details as to the prospect of more industrial production and more employment there.</P>
      <P>The Minister devoted part of his speech to a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, which was initiated by him and which is operated by his Department.  In every speech I have ever made on Industry and Commerce I have always advocated a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. I am glad the Minister has initiated such a campaign.  I think it has reached most parts of the country. It has certainly reached the eastern coast.  I notice from his speech that some of these pamphlets were sent out as far back as 30th November, 1959.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Having said that much and welcomed the idea in general, I want to ask the Minister now does he not agree that the effort is a rather puny one?  Would the Minister not agree that the pamphlet is unworthy of all the trouble that some person or persons&mdash;persons, I should imagine&mdash; took to have it printed, folded, put into envelopes, sealed, posted, and carried by postmen all over the place?  The pamphlet is about six inches by two and a half inches.  It carries the minimum of information. The Minister could have used many more convincing arguments as to why people should &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;.  As it is, there are not many good arguments in the pamphlet.  I do not think it will be the success it could be.  Certainly one aspect is not stressed except, perhaps, in a very vague, loose and brief way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no effort to point out to the man in Wexford, for example, that when he buys Irish-made boots or shoes in Wexford town, where there is no boot or shoe factory, he is helping to keep someone in Kilkenny, Drogheda, Dublin, Castleblaney, or wherever boots or shoes are made, in employment.  In the same way, the farmers could be told that when they buy Irish-made agricultural machinery they are keeping Wexford men in employment.  A <Col N="1739" /> similar approach could be made in respect of any product manufactured in Cork, or any part of Ireland, to demonstrate in a simple, homely fashion&mdash;but in a direct fashion at the same time&mdash;to the workers that, so long as they &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; they do a service to themselves and to their fellowmen in other parts of the country.  That is not done at the moment or, if it is done, it is done in a very skimpy fashion.</P>
    <P>The intention seems to be to make the pamphlets attractive.  I agree they should be attractive.  This pamphlet has, I think, six pictures in it.  It certainly has three&mdash;a farmer, a businessman and a clerical worker.  I do not intend to introduce a note of acrimony but so much could be done for Irish industry and Irish workers that this sort of production merely annoys me.  A more elaborate pamphlet could have been produced in such a way as would make it interesting to the simplest person in the country. If the Minister intends to pursue this idea&mdash;it is one with which I entirely agree&mdash;he should get some of the officials of his Department to make sure that the reasons for buying Irish will be abundantly clear to every person no matter how high or how humble he may be.</P>
    <P>The Minister left tourism to the last. I trust there is no significance in that. As we all appreciate, the tourist industry is second only to agriculture from the point of view of value.  We can applaud the efforts of the Minister in trying to encourage tourists and encourage the people here to make the country suitable for the reception of tourists.  I am, I suppose, naturally prejudiced in favour of my own part of the country, but I have a certain amount of reason as well.</P>
    <P>In the pamphlets, documents and booklets produced by An Bord Fáilte and other tourist bodies, the emphasis seems to be on the beauty of Killarney, the colouring in Connemara, and the Hills of Donegal.  The idea seems to be to encourage tourists to go to Donegal, Connemara and Killarney. There are very few words devoted to encouraging tourists to <Col N="1740" /> come to Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford, Kilkenny, Louth and Kildare.  I suggest it would pay dividends if we advertised the attractions of Wexford, Louth, Kilkenny, Waterford, and the Eastern and Midland counties generally. You will not find many of the ordinary working-class British tourists in Killarney, Connemara or Donegal. So long as they get to Ireland, they are fairly well satisfied.  Having paid their fares from England to Rosslare, Dún Laoghaire, or elsewhere, it is as much as they can do to stay in the particular area.  Very few can afford to travel three, four and five times the distance to Donegal, Connemara, Killarney, or other places west of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>No one wants to deny these areas their fair share of tourists.  The fact is they get many more of the wealthy American, British and Continental tourists, mainly because they are directed to these areas by An Bord Fáilte.  I do not want to enter into any argument as to the merits of Killarney, Connemara and Donegal versus the East.  The ordinary British tourist comes to Bray, Arklow, Dublin, and other parts of the East coast.  Well and good, if they can afford to go to Killarney and Donegal, these places get quite enough publicity.  The pamphlets which are circulated in Great Britain should, I hold, give an equal volume of advertisement to the resorts nearer home.  The majority of British tourists would be satisfied if they got to the east coast of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Introducing a Supplementary Estimate earlier this year the Minister said that the entire amount of the sum originally allocated for the development of seaside resorts had not been expended.  I trust that this year suitable arrangements will be made to ensure all that money is spent.  I think the Minister said in his speech that it would be spent.  We do not lack natural amenities in our seaside resorts but we lack such artificial attractions as promenades, bandstands and so on which foreign tourists expect.</P>
    <P>The money we spend on tourism is money well spent.  I believe there is still a vast potential so far as tourism here is concerned, but it should be <Col N="1741" /> exploited as quickly as possible.  I have not got the actual sum provided for tourism this year, but I think the effort could be described only as a modest one.  Compared to other industries, the agricultural industry is a vast one, but we spend a tremendous amount of money on it.  This year, I think, we are spending something like £21,000,000 or £27,000,000 on it, while we are spending something like £1,250,000 on tourism.  I do not suggest we should spend the same amount on both but we should be prepared to spend much more on the development of tourism.  The aim is not, as many people think, to provide enjoyment for foreign tourists.  That is merely incidental.  Our main object is to give people employment and provide an income for the people who produce goods and services.  If we can do that, as I say, everything we spend on tourism will be money well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has followed the same line as the Minister for Finance in expressing the view that everything in the country appears to be good.  He was most complacent in his speech.  He spoke about an increase of 4,000 in the numbers employed in manufacturing industries.  We are pleased to see that, just as we are pleased to see the increased export of manufactured goods from this country. A man would be a poor Irishman if he was not pleased at these developments. But I do not think there is much room for the Minister's complacency. He says that the unemployment figure has been reduced from 67,000 in April, 1958, to 58,000 in April this year.  We would all agree that that was satisfactory if the Minister had been able to say that those people had been put into either manufacturing industry or some other occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, pointed out that there are 51,000 fewer employed in this country since the Government took office three years ago.  He got that figure from statistics provided by the Taoiseach's own office.  The Minister for Finance, replying to the Budget Debate, said there were 24,000 fewer employed.  Whichever figure is the <Col N="1742" /> correct one, there is no cause for complacency. Because the unemployment register has been reduced by 20,000 in the past three years the ordinary person might think that 20,000 had gone into employment.  Instead, the Minister for Finance admitted that there were 24,000 fewer at work in this country. So long as that continues there is no room for complacency on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance or any member of the Government.  Saying that the revenue is buoyant is not much good for those people forced to leave the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that 52 projects had been assisted in the undeveloped areas.  I am glad to see that.  There are, however, other areas needing employment besides the undeveloped areas.  In my own town of Kilkenny the situation is not at all good at present.  I know that the Minister has been as helpful as he can.  It is not very pleasant to have one industry practically closed down and to have the workers in another under notice or employed only from week to week.</P>

      <P>I agree that the Minister has been at pains to try to help out, but the fact remains that that is the position.  I do not find fault with the Minister going to public functions and telling the people that any sound industrial proposition will get aid from the Government.  Such statements lead many people wishing to start small industries into aproaching the Government for aid.  But what do they find when they go to the Government?  The answer they get is: &ldquo;We cannot give you a grant because your industry is not of considerable national importance.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and other members of the Government should tell the people how they can get these grants and not merely state that any sound proposition <Col N="1743" /> will get a grant from the Government. It is a great disillusionment when these people discover they have no hope whatever of getting a grant. In fact, if there is another industry of that type in the country already, a new industry or an extension of an existing industry has no hope of getting a grant.  These people do not know the position until they apply and are told by An Foras Tionscal that they do not come into the eligible category. This is a great face-saver for An Foras Tionscal.  I have known people in Kilkenny who had an industry which lacked capital and had almost gone out of production.  Because of the promise of the present Government they applied for a grant to get capital for the provision of raw material and credit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to direct public attention to what I consider to be a shocking display of callousness and an appalling lack of appreciation by the Government last Monday in serving, on at least seven long-serving and loyal civil servants, seven-day notices terminating their employment. On the information given to me, some of these civil servants have service in this Department extending over 20 years.  One has as many as 29 years' service; one has 26; one has 19; and the balance have an average length of service of 11 to 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Monday, there was served on them a notice which told them that in accordance with the terms of their employment &ldquo;they were hereby given <Col N="1744" /> one week's notice of termination of engagement as and from 17th May, 1960.&rdquo;  They were further informed that: &ldquo;Your services are not required after the 23rd day of May, 1960.  You are entitled,&rdquo; said the notice, &ldquo;to so many days leave and you should proceed to take this leave during the period of notice and be in attendance on your last day of service.&rdquo;  We can paraphrase that by saying: &ldquo;After 29 years, you can have a &lsquo;bazz-off&rsquo; now, but be back on 23rd May to get a kick in the pants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an appalling state of affairs and I wonder if the Minister has properly considered the reaction it will have throughout the whole Civil Service, where there are at least 10,500 so-called temporary civil servants with over five years' service.  It means that no consideration whatsoever has been given to these people who have given the best years of their lives to the State, merely because they do not comply with some technical requirement regarding establishment.  The ages of these seven unfortunates range from 56 years to around the early sixties.  These are men who are at a stage in their lives when it is next to impossible for them to get alternative employment.  The least service any of them has given is 11 years, the longest 29 years, and at the end of all that, these men, who have served the State on one side of the hatch of an employment exchange, are being asked to spend the rest of their days on the other side of the hatch, joining the queue of 14,000 unemployed who queue there every week, week in and week out, to report and collect at the employment exchange.</P>
    <P>This is a disgraceful action on the part of the State and it is a shocking example to all employers.  It is as much as saying to them longevity of service and loyalty of service are of no consequence whatever.  We are entitled to ask why this is being done.  It certainly is no answer to say that there are fewer people registering at employment exchanges now than there were a few years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that there are 51,000 fewer jobs available.  The people have gone abroad, so, needless to say, there are fewer presenting themselves at employment exchanges, but, in the shorter period of 11 years' service which some of these people have, we have had 30,000 fewer employed.  The need for the services of these people was there then and the need is still there.  One has the suspicion that this is the thin end of the wedge which the Government are using under their so-called scheme of reorganisation of the Civil Service, under which adult males are to be sacrificed for young girls just out of school, who will spend a few years working until they are collected and brought into the bonds of holy matrimony.  In other words, the fathers of households are being penalised in order that the Government may get cheap labour.</P>
      <P>I should have preferred to have got all the answers of the Government to all facets of this disgraceful action on their part before launching my attack upon them, but the rules of the House required four days' notice from the earliest date possible on which a Parliamentary reply could be given. That would bring it up to next Tuesday and that is why I pressed that this matter might be heard to-day, in the hope, which I trust is not a forlorn one, that the Minister might see his way to withdraw these notices and allow the matter to be further considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not without significance that the Temporary Clerks (Employment Exchanges) Association, of which these people are members, has made an application under the conciliation and arbitration scheme, and their application is supported by all the staff side in the Department of Social Welfare and, I understand, throughout the whole of the Civil Service, for a confined competition for establishment of clerks in employment exchanges, to be held before July, 1960, and that this competition be confined to clerks who have a minimum service of ten years' duration.  Why the indecent haste to dismiss these long-serving loyal civil servants before their reasonable <Col N="1746" /> application is considered at conciliation and arbitration level?  It seems to be an effort to dismiss them before justice can be done to them.</P>
    <P>It is time that we as a nation considered our obligations to people who have given long service in the reasonable expectation that they will not be dismissed on a seven days' notice when they come to the late fifties or early sixties.  The problem of the over-staffing of the Civil Service of course is a very real one and we in Fine Gael are very conscious of it.  We are as anxious as the Government that the over-staffing should be reduced and that the efficiency of the service should be increased, but it is a cardinal principle, from which Fine Gael will not depart, that the reorganisation must be brought about through the normal wastage by reason of retirements and deaths.</P>
    <P>We believe that it is morally wrong to take people into the Government service for long periods of ten, 20&mdash; aye, and 30 years&mdash;and then dismiss them when it is next to impossible for them to obtain alternative employment. If there is redundancy and if there is need to get rid of superfluous staff, the first people to go should be the young people who still have a chance of finding alternative employment, who are still acceptable in different fields of employment.  A civil servant who has been working in an employment exchange for 20 years on a particular type of work and who is between 55 and 60 years of age will find it next to impossible to get alternative employment.  That is why the action of the Parliamentary Secretary is to be so very strongly deplored.</P>
    <P>I understand, but I have no definite information on the matter, that these notices have been served on more than the seven to whom I have already referred, that is, five in the Werburgh Street employment exchange and two in Gardiner Street.  My latest information, which only came to me a very short while ago, is that similar notices have been served on a number of persons in the headquarters staff of the Department of Social Welfare.  I am also informed that there is one <Col N="1747" /> widow with three dependent children involved in this matter.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Department which carries the title &ldquo;Social Welfare&rdquo; should have regard to social welfare and to the principles of social welfare laid down in the Constitution.  Instead, we find that the very Department which is supposed to promote social welfare is the Department which is acting in this unchristian and most unjust manner.</P>
    <P>In his speech on the Budget this year the Minister for Finance spoke about the reorganisation of the Civil Service and he mentioned that under the reorganisation of the Civil Service it was proposed to reduce the number of clerical officers and to replace them by persons of a more junior status, but he said that these material changes can be made only gradually.  It seems to me that that pious expression on his part was so much empty verbiage when we see, within a few weeks of that statement being made, something that is not gradual but which is very definite and very peremptory being done.  We see a number of long-serving members of the Civil Service being dismissed although, so far as I know, no complaint whatsoever has been made about the manner in which they have carried out their duties.</P>
    <P>I understand that the duties that these people perform will still have to be done.  In a question which I tabled for next Tuesday I want to know in what manner the work formerly done by these people will be done in future. Is it to be done by machines or is it to be done by cheaper female labour? It is most undesirable, if that is the attitude of the Government, and I am certainly exceedingly anxious to know what the answer of the Parliamentary Secretary will be to these charges which I have made against the Government.</P>
    <P>I make these charges out of a sense of duty, which arises from a reasonable interpretation of the facts.  If there is some reason to justify this action it would want to be a very, very strong reason indeed to justify the giving of seven days' peremptory notice to people who have served the <Col N="1748" /> State in such a loyal and efficient manner over so many years.</P>
    <P>There is, in relation to this matter, a very vital issue at stake, namely, where is it all going to end?  This is being done suddenly and apparently without just reason and all the unestablished civil servants, even outside this Department, can apparently now expect the same treatment.  Longevity of service, apparently, is not to be valued at all.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difference that exists between established and unestablished civil servants but it is very, very wrong that the State should allow people to remain in constant employment for such a long period as 25 to 30 years and then turn around and say that, in accordance with the terms of their employment, they must go.  If the State retains people for such a long period, these people have a reasonable right to expect that they will be continued in their jobs until the end of their days unless they are unsatisfactory in the manner in which they carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>I have confined my remarks to the duties which these individuals have performed in the Department of Social Welfare and to the longevity of service they have given in the Department of Social Welfare because I believe that that is the vital matter in relation to this whole affair.  But, it is of some significance that a majority of these men gave loyal and patriotic service to this State in another field. Several of them are proud bearers of medals for the part they played in the fight for Irish freedom and the majority of them had service in the National Army.  It is unfortunate that the Government, who are forever crying out to private industry to give an opportunity for employment to ex-Servicemen, should act in such a callous manner and should dismiss these ex-Servicemen because, apparently, the State feels that it can do without them or that if somebody must go, they should be the first to go.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, very earnestly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to have this matter reconsidered fully and to have these notices withdrawn before next Monday in order that the <Col N="1749" /> men affected by them may have the opportunity, if conciliation and arbitration machinery is extended to them, of entering for a confined examination, the passing of which would justify their establishment.  That is one consideration.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, Sir.  I am just about to conclude.

      <P>We are not dealing with established or unestablished civil servants.  We are dealing with temporary clerks in the employment of the Department of Social Welfare.  We are not the only Department who employ temporary clerks.  Temporary employees of all kinds, when they enter into employment, know the terms and conditions under which they enter. If Deputy Ryan were dealing with the whole problem of the temporary clerks in the Department of Social Welfare, there might be something to say for his case, although it would be a weak one.</P>
      <P>Temporary clerks have been employed, for years before the Department of Social Welfare was set up, dealing with social services.  They have been employed all over the State. The number we employed last year was 76 and we let 45 of them go. Many of them had Tan medals.  Many of them had National Army service and many of them were 20 years in temporary employment in our service from Tralee to Donegal.  Those in Dublin were lucky.  In the last couple of years they did not have to go in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy over-painted the picture when he said they were in continuous employment in Dublin.  Of the seven <Col N="1750" /> mentioned, four had broken service. They got a week's notice and they made the case to us that they should let their case go to conciliation and arbitration and we have given them a week's extension without any pressure from anybody.  In the case of the two women involved, we immediately got busy in the other Departments and we placed them.</P>

      <P>I did not catch what the Deputy said.  I have indicated that we are trying to place the other men.  I want to get down to this question of their employment.  When I came into office there were certain regulations made by my predecessor.  I allowed the system to remain whereby:</P>
      <P>Temporary clerks appointed since 31st March, 1954, should be discharged in the order of seniority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I did not interfere with that.  Then I added:</P>
      <P>In the case of temporary clerks appointed before 31st March, 1954, in all cases domestic circumstances should be the deciding factor.</P>
      <P>Where domestic circumstances are equal, preference should be given to old I.R.A. men holding Service Medals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where domestic circumstances are equal and there is no old I.R.A. man on the panel, preference should be given to those with <Col N="1751" /> Army service during the Emergency, 1939 to 1945.</P>
    <P>When I was Parliamentary Secretary before, I was in touch with these men.  There was, I think, a confined examination for which 400 sat and I pressed the Minister for Finance to take them on in cadres of 10.  When there was a change of Government and another Minister came in, he finished the taking on of the successful candidates and since I came back I have been in direct contact with these men.  I have impressed on them the advisability of getting in touch with the proper authorities in order that they might sit for a confined examination.  I do not want to be hard on these men. I am in a privileged position here but I want to say, with all due regard to charity, I think they made fools of themselves and made a mess of things. The information that Deputy Ryan has is that there would be a confined examination by some date in June or July.  Who made that proposal? Was it the Government, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Social Welfare?  It was not; that is the proposal they made themselves.  I am not in authority to do it and neither is the Minister for Social Welfare. The Government must take all the circumstances into account.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan spoke about 10,500 temporary civil servants.  I suppose he means postmen and several other employees up and down the country. They are in a different position altogether.  I got very little notice of this Question.  I was rung up at the office around 4 o'clock and told that it would be on but I could get cadres of people in similar temporary employment over years.  Deputy Ryan should bear in mind that if these men have to <Col N="1752" /> go, if one of them has to go, the door is open for him to come back in September or October when the register goes up again.  That has been the picture for years all over rural Ireland&mdash;in Limerick, Tralee, Cork and elsewhere, in every exchange you can think of.</P>
    <P>Dublin, as I say, has been lucky. It is no pleasure for me to sanction notice to them to go.  The regulations are there and were made before ever I came into the Department.  When the register falls&mdash;I think it is for every 100 on the register that we employ a temporary clerk&mdash;we do everything possible to keep them employed. We bring up from the country writing assistants and clerical officers and do everything to provide occupation for them.  In doing that we have a problem, and the day ultimately comes when, in order to be fair to the people who put up the money, we must take action.  While it has been the order of things that the temporary clerks go in the country, it has come to Dublin's turn now.  We have acceded to the request, as I said, to let this matter hang fire for a week and in the meantime we are doing everything possible to get work for these people.</P>

      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 24th May, 1960.</P>
