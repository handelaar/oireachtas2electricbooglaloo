      <P>asked the Minister for Health in respect of each financial year since 1929 what leases were made under the State Lands (Workhouses) Act, 1930; and for what period in respect of each lease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of leases granted under the State Lands (Workhouses) Act, 1930 is considerable and a statement which would include all leases granted during a period of over thirty years would be exceedingly long.</P>
      <P>I have, therefore, had extracted, in respect of the period since the establishment of a separate Department of Health, particulars of all leases granted by the appropriate Minister and these are incorporated in a tabular statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the official report.</P>
      <P>Particulars of all these leases have already, as required by the Statute, been furnished to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will observe that in all but a small minority of cases, the lease was for a period of 99 years.</P>
      <P>I should mention that ministerial functions under the State Lands (Workhouses) Act, 1930, which, prior to the establishment of the Department of Health, were exercised by the then Minister for Local Government and Public Health, remained with the Minister for Local Government until their transfer to the Minister for Health with effect from 27th September, 1949.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports by Public Analysts on the meat content of sausages or the names and number of the brands, or on other foods, examined by them in pursuance of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts are not furnished to my Department, but when an article is found on analysis to be non-genuine, whether by <Col N="1611" /> reason of adulteration, contamination or inferior quality, a certificate to that effect is furnished by the Public Analyst to the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the enforcement of the Acts is a matter for local authorities and that they are empowered to take proceedings under the Acts in respect of any sample of food certified by the Public Analyst for their area to be non-genuine, whether or not a statutory standard for that particular class of food has been prescribed.  It is a matter for the Court to decide in each case whether an offence under the Acts has been committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether with regard to his statement in the Dáil on the 25th February, 1960 that it would be quite impossible for any person to determine what is the nutritive content of any particular sausage the findings of the National Nutrition Surveys are rendered inaccurate or are invalidated by such a limitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My statement was with reference to the question put to me by Deputy Cosgrave regarding the meat content of sausages.  Different kinds of meat and different cuts of the same meat vary in their nutritive value and there is no known method of determining the proportions of pork or beef and other meats in a sausage nor is it possible to distinguish the particular cuts of meat used therein.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, possible to estimate the amount of protein, carbohydrate, fat, etc., in sausages, and reports of investigations, such as the National Nutrition Survey, are based on the amounts of the various nutrients (protein, carbohydrate, fat, etc.) as ascertained after representative sampling so that any deviation in a particular case from the average is of no significance and in no way renders inaccurate or invalidates the findings.</P>

      <P>In my reply on 8th May, 1958, to a similar question by the Deputy I gave the number of schools as returned by local health authorities which had had school health examinations, and the corresponding percentages of all schools, as 2,077 or 43 per cent. in 1955, 2,406 or 49 per cent. in 1956, and 1,931 or 39 per cent. in 1957. Returns subsequently received from those authorities corrected those earlier figures.  The correct number of schools which had such examinations, and the relevant percentages, are 2,138 or 44 per cent. in 1955, 2,464 or 51 per cent. in 1956 and 2,051 or 42 per cent. in 1957.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether in view of the recent increase in strontium 90, as an index of growing atmospheric pollution from nuclear explosive fall-out, registered in the bones of British children he is in a position to state whether a similar increase has been registered in the bones of growing children in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The report, dated January, 1960, of the Research Group of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority indicates that the Strontium Units in bones show a rise in all but the &ldquo;over 20 year&rdquo; age group between the latter part of 1958 and the first half of 1959.  The report points out, however, that a straightforward comparison of the two sets of results may give a false impression of the steepness of this rise because, apparently by reason of sampling defects, the increase during 1958 was under-weighted while that between the latter part of 1958 and early 1959 was over-weighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures of strontium 90 in children's bones have not been compiled for this country.  As I indicated in reply to similar questions asked by the Deputy <Col N="1613" /> in April and May last year, figures of this nature for Ireland can, however, be taken to be similar to those for Britain, so that it could be assumed that any increase which might occur in the strontium units in Britain would probably also be found in this country. I would add, however, that a scheme for having some tests made with a view to measuring the strontium content here is under consideration and I hope to issue a statement shortly in this matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will place in the Library the full text of the speech in which he is reported to have said in relation to his dispute with the medical profession that he must act in the interests of the public for, if control of the situation was handed over to the medical profession, the public would become so much butcher's meat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity which the Deputy's question gives me to put the phrase to which it refers in the correct context in which it was used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towards the end of a Press conference which I held on the 12th March last, a query was put to me which seemed to imply that I had dealt harshly with the former County Surgeon attached to the Mallow County Hospital, whom I had removed from office in May, 1959.  Rebutting the suggestion I recalled that I had been compelled to take this action following the inquiry into the death of a young farm labourer, with a wife and two children, who had been sent from a District Hospital to the County Hospital, then at Fermoy, to be examined and, if necessary, operated on by the County Surgeon there.  I pointed out that the terms and conditions on which the County Surgeon in question was appointed to his post obliged him first of all to attend all surgical cases in the hospital and see that they received such surgical treatment and advice and assistance as may be necessary, and secondly to perform all such surgical operations as may be proper to be <Col N="1614" /> performed by him in the hospital.  I also mentioned, incidentally, that for this duty he received a salary of £1,517 per annum, was entitled to use four of the hospital beds for the accommodation of his private patients and could engage in consultative practice. I then went on to say that the unfortunate young man concerned was not seen or examined by the County Surgeon. Instead he was examined by the House Surgeon, a young man who at that time had only about eight or nine months' surgical experience since he qualified as a doctor and who, as the result showed, was not sufficiently experienced to undertake a major surgical operation unaided or without proper supervision.  The young House Surgeon reported by telephone the result of his examination to the County Surgeon, who was at his residence nearly twenty miles away.  Despite the inexperience of the House Surgeon at the time, the County Surgeon directed him to commence an operation on the patient at 8.15 p.m.  He did not himself leave his home to come to the hospital until he had been specially sent for because of a complication which had developed in the course of the operation, arriving at 9.45 p.m.  It was then too late to save the unfortunate young patient who, having been over 4 hours on the operating table, was removed therefrom in a dying condition and died very shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>In reply to some further questions on this matter, I explained that the Minister for Health is charged by statute with the duty of protecting the interests of all persons who avail of services under the Health Acts.  Some suggestion having been made that perhaps the Mallow issue could be settled by a compromise on my part, I went on to state that if the Irish Medical Association, by the imposition of a boycott, were allowed to bring about a situation in which a Minister for Health would be inhibited from carrying out the duties and obligations imposed on him by law, the public would be deprived of protection against the neglect of a medical practitioner who might be tempted to put his own convenience before his duty to the public. Any compromise on this issue, I added, would be tantamount to permitting <Col N="1615" /> a patient to be regarded as so much butcher's meat.</P>
    <P>The phrase was used only in the narrow context of the Mallow episode and of the action of the Irish Medical Association in seeking, by the use of the boycott weapon, to protect the officer concerned in that episode.  It appears to be implied in the question that the phrase had application to the general body of doctors.  I take this opportunity of saying that any such inference is quite unjustifiable.  On the contrary, I have good reason to have the highest opinion of the humanity, integrity and devotion to their patients of the members of the profession in general.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, there could be no script of my replies to question; but I am arranging to place in the Library a copy of my short opening statement at the Conference.</P>

      <P>The association has been in existence for many years.  It is not incorporated. It does not hold a negotiating licence under the Trade Union Act, 1941 but it is an excepted body for the purposes of Section 6 of that Act by reason of an Order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on 25th January, 1960.

      <P>Could the Minister say, in relation to negotiations conducted by this body prior to 25th January, 1960, whether this Association or body was entitled, in his view, to carry on such negotiations, in view of the fact that the Minister has already expressed his opinion to me that a similar association was <Col N="1617" /> not entitled to conduct such negotiations without being recognised under the Acts?</P>

It may have happened that, for mutual convenience, the County Managers may have met and discussed certain questions with people employed in the health services and Local Government health services, and I have a general knowledge that such discussions have taken place.  If the County Managers' Association, having become aware of the fact that it was necessary to be an excepted body under the Trade Union Act of 1941, sought such recognition, I do not see any reason why I should be called upon to pass censure upon those responsible because they were prepared to obey the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty in interpreting the Deputy's question, which seems to imply that an adequate medical service is not available in any hospital unless there is a doctor present and on duty at all times in the hospital.</P>
      <P>The medical practitioner staff of a county hospital normally consists of a county surgeon who lives in a residence in the hospital grounds where one is provided or, where one is not provided, convenient to the hospital, a county physician who also resides convenient to the hospital, an anaesthetist who may be resident or non-resident, and more junior medical staff who normally reside in quarters within the curtilage of the hospital.  Such staff, as appropriate, is available at all times for the treatment of casualty and emergency cases.</P>

    <P>When a general inquiry was made from local authorities regarding numbers of resident junior medical staff employed on recent dates, it was <Col N="1619" /> ascertained that there was no such staff in five of the county hospitals; but in all such cases other arrangements had been made to deal with emergency cases.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he failed to understand the implication in my question.  I do not know whether it is necessary to discuss implications. The question was directed to ascertaining a fact which I think should be available to the Minister, namely, in how many county hospitals is there a resident doctor at all times available.  I should like the Minister to answer that question if he can.</P>

One has, first of all, to grasp what the Deputy had in mind in putting down the question and therefore my reference to the implication. I pointed out to him that in any cases where there is no resident staff, in the absolute sense of the word, provision is made to have medical attention readily available, when necessary.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the 1953 Act, in addition to providing for services for persons who were not previously entitled to such services, provided a revised statutory basis for services previously provided for under other legislative codes.

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware from replies to recent questions in regard to the matter of the re-investigations of assessments of means of unemployment assistance applicants, the means of such persons must be reviewed when any change of circumstances occur, e.g., acquirement of property, marriage, change of address.  The means of self-employed persons must be re-examined periodically. Apart from the other reasons mentioned, means must be re-investigated where they have not been reviewed for a number of years.  There have been no increases in means assessments where the circumstances have remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may, however, have in mind the steps which were taken in September, 1958, to apply up-to-date values in the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes where such are derived from the occupation of land.  As I have stated in previous replies, the assessment of means for unemployment assistance, where such were derived from the occupation of land was, prior to September, 1958, based on values for stock, crops, etc., adopted in 1940, but since then up-to-date values, as are used for old age pension purposes, have been applied to the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to reorganise the collection services from <Col N="1641" /> letter boxes in Waterford city.  At present a collection, which does not connect with the night mail despatches, is made at 8.30 p.m. from nearly all the City's letter boxes.  With a few exceptions, the number of items collected per box on this service is very small and the total falls far short of justifying the expense involved.  It is proposed, therefore, to limit the late clearances to a selected number of boxes at key points in the city, in the manner that obtains in Dublin and in other provincial cities and large towns. This minor restriction will be more than counter-balanced by a general improvement in the times of collection for the day and night mail despatches, including the substitution of 7.15 p.m. for 6.15 p.m. as the latest time for night-mail posting at the Head Post Office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Our experience in Waterford&mdash;and I should like to ask the Minister if it will be repeated&mdash;is that whenever an inspector is sent down to review the postal services in Waterford the services are always restricted. Is the Minister aware that the last time a review was made the customs parcel post was taken out of Waterford?  Is the Minister further aware that in the outlying parts of Waterford if a letter is posted under what is described as &ldquo;the new review,&rdquo; say this evening, it may not be delivered in the city until the day after to-morrow?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to deal by question and answer with the points raised here by the Deputy.  This is a complex matter.  It needs a certain amount of study to go into the times of collection and delivery but a survey of three postal clearance areas in Waterford City was made the basis for a revised scheme and it has already been discussed with local Post Office Workers' Union.  It appeared to me from the information I have that a number of the clearances which already obtain from the post boxes in the city of Waterford was useless because the letters did not get any prior forwarding treatment; they had to wait until the next collection from the same boxes, and from the information <Col N="1642" /> available I am satisfied that the new arrangement will mean a better collection service and better forwarding services from the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The question deals with Waterford city and I am dealing only with Waterford city now.  The Deputy knows that there is at the moment a general reorganisation of the postal services all over the country and that it has been going on for some years.  If that reorganisation has not yet taken place in County Waterford it will be proceeded with.</P>

The anonymous author made no complaint to the clerk on duty at the time the incident is alleged to have occurred and it has not been possible to establish whether there was substance in the allegation.  The receptacle in question has a capacity of 10,000 letters. It is cleared on Sunday afternoon at 1.15 p.m. and 3 p.m. and it would be entirely exceptional for postings to reach or even approach 10,000 during that interval.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Before section 8 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  A member of the Authority who, on becoming a member, has any financial interest in any company or concern which has sought or seeks to make or with which the Authority has proposed or proposes to make any contract or financial arrangement shall, immediately on becoming a member, divest himself of such interest.</P>
    <P>(2)  A member of the Authority who has any financial interest in any company or concern which during his membership seeks to make with the Authority or with which <Col N="1645" /> the Authority proposes to make, any contract or financial arrangement, shall, immediately upon such seeking to make or proposing to make, either&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have moved this amendment because I think there is a basic weakness in Section 8 as it stands and this amendment would, I think, help to strengthen and improve the section.  The intention of the amendment is to try to preserve certain standards and practices concerning the financial transactions involved in straightforward operations, on the one hand, and, on the other, to try to deal with what I think might arise as a result of possibly divided loyalties on the part of members of the board should they have interests outside those of the primary function of the Authority, namely, the establishment of a television service.</P>
      <P>I have in mind the possibility that should the board include a member, or members, whose financial interests outside are associated with the advertising business, there is a very strong possibility that there would be the divided loyalty to which I refer and, consequently, the advertising side of the function of the television Authority might predominate.  The idea then, and I am sure it is the idea the Minister has in mind, of trying to give the best possible service to the public might become subordinate in importance to the other considerations of the member, or members, of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy with the Minister's dilemma because it is quite clear that, with the best will in the world, it will be very hard indeed to establish a worthwhile television service here.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman that the operative consideration will be the great disparity <Col N="1646" /> between the amount of money we can afford to spend and the amount spent on other services available to certain sections of our people.  Examining the services available to me and knowing the appallingly low level and the triviality of the vast majority of the programmes, it seems to me that if we apply the test and find that that is the best that can be done with £1,800 per hour, then the Minister's job is an unenviable one when he seeks to provide a good service under a limitation of £600 for the &ldquo;live&rdquo; and £200 for the &ldquo;canned&rdquo; programme.</P>
    <P>I can see that the Minister has a very difficult problem indeed with his limited finances.  In order to provide a first-class service, he is driven into being very careful in relation to the considerations I have mentioned&mdash;this very important question of public accountability on the part of State corporations in relation to financial transactions, that these corporations should be amenable to some form of scrutiny here, some form of public scrutiny, or that they be so circumscribed by legislative proposals as to make it practically impossible for them to misuse the funds the Minister places at their disposal.  At one and the same time, he has that responsibility on the one hand, and he is also faced with the responsibility of finding the best possible executives and administrators to form the personnel of this board.</P>
    <P>In Section 8, as it stands, it seems to me he has decided to throw overboard the necessity for ensuring by legislation, as far as we possibly can, that the board will be operated in such manner as will guarantee, to the extent to which it is possible to guarantee, that there shall not be any public scandal of any kind.  I want to make it quite clear that I am not a bit interested in the particular individual who, I understand, may possibly become chairman of the Authority.  My only concern is with the principle involved. It is quite obvious that when we have an artiste of such outstanding qualities as the Minister mentioned here, the Minister cannot be blamed for seeking to put such a person in control of the Authority.  It may be debatable as to whether or not such a fine artiste <Col N="1647" /> would necessarily be a very good administrator.  That is not the issue before us at the moment, but it is one of the considerations the Minister has to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister is justified in taking the risk inherent in the very weakness of Section 8 as it stands and permitting members of the Authority to have financial interests outside those of the single interests of running the television Authority.  It is stated in the section that the individual &ldquo;shall disclose to the Authority the fact of the interest and the nature thereof, and shall take no part in any deliberation or decision of the Authority relating to the contract, and the disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the Authority.&rdquo;  I do not think that device is sufficient.  I do not think that will protect the public from the possibility of some form of evasion of the very high standards required in these State corporations which are handling public funds.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in the matter arises from the fact that you may have nine people absolutely above suspicion; the people the Minister will try to get will naturally be people of that calibre.  At the same time, as was said here recently in relation to another matter, not only must justice be done but it must appear to be done.  There is, then, the possibility that where there is this dual interest, the public will inevitably, perhaps erroneously, accuse a member, or members, of the Authority of promoting personal financial interests at the expense of the public interest, when, in fact, that may not be the case at all.</P>
    <P>Consequently, it seems to me that in allowing this loophole, the Minister is exposing the Authority to avoidable risk of misrepresentation. He would be wise, in the interests of the individual members and in the interests of the Authority as a whole, to accept some amendment such as I have suggested here.  There is always the difficulty, where an individual has outside interests and where those interests are closely concerned with the proposed objectives of the television <Col N="1648" /> Authority, that there will be a deliberate attempt to promote those interests within the Authority, using the special position held within the Authority for that purpose.  Alternatively, an individual member of the Authority may quite legitimately believe that the interests he is promoting are genuinely the best ones from the public point of view, and there may, in fact, be no evil intent at all, but from the point of view of the public, it will be very difficult to explain that there is no evil intent, no evasion of the very serious responsibilities of individuals who find themselves on these State boards and corporations.</P>
    <P>The other consideration is that there may be one, two or three individuals, in a group of eight or nine, who have an outside interest and when that outside interest comes up for consideration by the Board in the form of a contract for building, foundation work, the erection of buildings, the supply of equipment, or later on the production of talent for the various programmes which will be necessary, a tremendous amount of patronage will be in the hands of those people.  Where there is a conflict of interests, where members of the board have outside associations which will arise from time to time before the board, and where it will appear that they favour one individual, or that two individuals have been favoured by the board, all the members of the board will be smeared with that suggestion, or included in the suggestion&mdash;quite wrongly possibly&mdash;that they were a party to some favouritism because one of their colleagues on the board happened to have a particular outside interest and won the contract.  In the interests of the board, it would be wiser if steps were taken by legislation to avoid the likelihood of such a contingency arising at all.</P>
    <P>The other consideration is, of course, that in this question of television, we have taken an unusual way out of our problems in many ways.  It could be said it was the Minister's only way out.  We are faced with the possibility that the advertising interests may attempt to take over as much time as <Col N="1649" /> they can to ensure the sale of their goods and use particular kinds of programmes to attract a mass audience. It is regrettable that it has appeared in most of the findings in recent times that mass audiences are attracted intellectually to the lowest common denominator output of the existing television networks.  No doubt, the advertising people are well aware of that and we shall be under very great pressure here, and the Minister and the Government will be under great pressure, to try to prevent the television advertising interests from dominating the tone or the type of programme, or the quality of programme, broadcast by the television Authority. As the Minister knows well domination by these interests in America has provided one of the biggest scandals of the century.  There was dishonesty, faking, bribery and corruption of all kinds, and because these interests were given a free hand, they virtually destroyed the whole belief in that form of advertising in the United States by their activities.</P>
    <P>I have not seen Ulster television service, but I understood that it would be a fairly well controlled Authority. Recently, advertising interests on that service have tended to sponsor or promote an intellectually moronic and generally meretricious level of programme production.  I do not see any way by which we can escape that. The only way by which we can avoid it is by ensuring that there is no possibility of the advertising interests dominating our television Authority. The best way to ensure that is to see that anybody who has such an outside association will not be allowed to become a member of the Authority.</P>
    <P>I would be in favour of having all the men on the board full time.  That would be a big sacrifice possibly for some of them.  On the question of the proposed chairman, I would practically let that individual name his own figure if necessary&mdash;within reason of course, and within the resources of the State&mdash; to make it possible for him to take on that very responsible job on behalf of the State.  The Board would be in much the same position as Cabinet <Col N="1650" /> Ministers, who have to make similar sacrifices from time to time.  Many members of the Cabinet do make such sacrifices.  To that extent, we could protect them, by giving them reasonable remuneration.  We would be justified in doing so because in that way they would be allowed to be completely independent in making their decisions, and so far as it is humanly possible they would appear to be making decisions on the merits without any bias in favour or against any individual.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that the advertising interests will pay for the television service and that the costs of the advertisements will pay for the service.  I do not accept that point at all.  I think it is quite fallacious because the advertisements are paid for indirectly by the public.  That is admitted in the Report of the Commission. It is conceded that the public will pay for the service in one way or another, whether initially by the £2,000,000 advanced by the Minister, or by the running costs which will ultimately be paid by everybody in the State in the commodities which they will buy as a result of the advertisements they will see on the television service.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the Minister suggested that my point that the people who cannot afford the service will have to pay for it was not valid.  I think it is a valid point and I do not accept Senator O'Brien's answer, that these advertisements promote competition, and in that way reduce prices, so that the poorer people benefit.  Since there is no competition, there is no reduction in prices and consequently these people do not benefit.</P>
    <P>However, that is beside the point. The main consideration is that public money is being spent directly by the Minister and indirectly in the form of advertisements.  We pay one way or the other.  We are shareholders in this corporation and we have the right to lay down the standards on which it will be operated.  The most important consideration, it seems to me, is the fact that this is a public company established by the Dáil.  It <Col N="1651" /> is not an individual Minister, a particular political Party or a particular Government who will be affected if there is any scandal or if undesirable suggestions are made about the television Authority.  It will be a State company and the ethical standards and practices of that company will be a very important consideration.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister seriously to consider accepting the amendment that Section 8 be amended to ensure that the individual must divest himself of any outside interest before accepting membership of the Authority.</P>

      <P>The amendment standing in the name of Deputy Palmer which I now move is simpler than the amendment proposed by Deputy Browne and Deputy McQuillan and would really require further elaboration if it were to be put in the Bill, because in addition to the deletion proposed in paragraph (a) of Section 8, it would have to be changed slightly and instead of saying &ldquo;which the Authority proposes to make,&rdquo; it should read &ldquo;with which the Authority has any contact.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  One can get into unnecessary knots about this business.  The issue here involved is one of conflicting interests.  I can remember a time when if you were a member of the town council, the county council, the borough council or the rural district council, if you sold a stone of potatoes to the council you were automatically disqualified from membership.  There may have been some amendment of that since the County Management Act on the grounds that such contracts are now made by the county manager as an executive officer of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> It did not matter a hoot to public finances whether or not a member of the rural district council sold a stone of potatoes to the rural district council.  In those days a high standard was demanded.  The standard was that if you were a member of a public authority, you did not derive benefit or profit from a contract between yourself and that public authority. There was no restriction on a member of a rural district council making a present of a stone of potatoes to the rural district council.  If he was a benevolent person and wanted to bestow something on the rural district council, that act did not disqualify him.  What disqualified him was anything that might result in his deriving a profit from a transaction with a public body of which he was a member.</P>
    <P>It is a deplorable tendency not only in our society but in other democracies to slither away from that standard.  It was a good standard. It involves a certain amount of cost on people who undertake quasi-public responsibilities.  If you set your foot on the slippery slope of departing from that standard, it will be very hard to set a new standard.</P>
    <P>On page 25, paragraph 69 of the Report of the Television Commission, we read:</P>
    <P>The Commission considers that the Authority should take the form of a Board composed of a maximum of nine (9) members which should be given corporate status.  The Commission recommends that the operating organisation should be permitted to be represented by having one member on the Authority, and for this purpose to make a nomination to the Government for appointment, if approved, and, subject thereto, that a member of the Authority should have no such financial or other interests as would be likely to affect prejudicially the discharge of his functions as a member of the Authority and should not be a member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Let us face facts.  I am not concerned with the identity of any individual it is proposed to appoint to this <Col N="1653" /> body.  There are nine persons on the Authority.  They ask for tenders for, say, the supply of material to constitute canned programmes to fill in the periods when live programmes are not available.  Three tenders come before them, two from firms who have no connection with the personnel of the Authority.  The third tender is from a firm which is partly or wholly owned by a member of the Authority.</P>
    <P>If I were one of the nine members of an Authority and found it to be part of my duty to tell a colleague on that Authority either that he was trying to get an unjust price for what he was offering, or that what he was offering compared with what was being offered from other sources, was manifestly inferior, I should find my assignment extremely difficult.  That is one problem.  The second problem is this.  Suppose I held myself out to be an authority on television and radio matters and, on foot of that reputation, I was chosen for appointment to this Authority.  Suppose I then tendered for material for the Authority and quoted a price, how could I, having seen what was offered by my rivals, inform the Board that in my opinion the two rival contractors offered superior material at a more competitive price than I did?  If that were true, it would strongly be suggested that my qualifications for being a member of the Authority were highly suspect and that somebody had evaluated me much more highly than they ought to have done.</P>
    <P>Is it not true that every time the contract is considered by the Authority, the member of the Authority who is himself a would-be contractor must pass judgment on his own quality in determining whether his tender is to be accepted or rejected?  The more I think about this the more astonished I become.  Even as short as ten years ago would anybody have come into Dáil Éireann and proposed that a member of an Authority of this kind should have the right to contract with himself to earn a profit out of public money provided he informed all and sundry that that was his intention before he did it?</P>
    <P>If such a proposal had been made <Col N="1654" /> in this House 25 years ago it would have been laughed out before it was fully formulated.  I assume that the basis of this proposal is that it is impossible to constitute an Authority in this country to administer television and radio services without including certain persons who are actively engaged in the commercial side of the business.  Surely that is an absolute misconception?  We must be able to find nine people in the whole of Ireland who are qualified to constitute an Authority to control radio and television without one of them being actively engaged commercially in the business.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister comes to the conclusion that there is one person he so urgently desires to have on the Authority that he thinks it worth his while to qualify him, surely it would be preferable to employ him as a whole-time servant of the Authority and give him such remuneration as would make it expedient for him to sever his connection with his mercantile interests rather than to declare that he can remain a member of the Authority and derive a profit from contracts made with the Authority, providing only that he discloses to the Authority the fact and nature of his interests and that he shall not take part in the actual deliberation as to whether the contract is to be awarded to his firm or not.</P>
    <P>As I say, I think it is a great mistake to get too involved about this.  I think the issue is perfectly simple.  It is the traditional question of a conflict of interests.  I do not think that special legislation of this House is involved or that we can set too high a standard in that regard. I would direct the attention of the House to the fact that it is within the memory of most of us that the humblest member of the smallest rural district council in Ireland was absolutely prohibited from doing what it is proposed to permit a member of this Authority to do and if he attempted to do it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are no rural district councils now.  They are all abolished.  In the days of the old county councils, no member could derive anything from contracts with the council or body of which he was a member.  It may be that since that Managerial Act was introduced a new rule obtains on the grounds that the county manager is now the executive who does the work and that, therefore, a member of the local authority is not directly concerned.  I am talking about the old days when the contracts were awarded by resolution of the authority.  Then the humblest member of the smallest rural district council was prohibited from doing what we propose by statute to authorise a member of this Authority to do.  There was a great multiplicity of these bodies and it was very difficult to find the personnel to man them.  The interesting thing is that in those distant days many of these small bodies were constituted of relatively poor men, in many cases very poor men to whom the sacrifice of the right to trade with the local authority, to supply vegetables to the workhouse, milk to the hospital and eggs to the county home was a substantial sacrifice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be borne in mind that the members of the Ascendancy who manned the Grand Juries seldom found themselves in this dilemma.  By the nature of their social standards and wealth they did not normally transact business with the local authorities.  After the 1898 Local Government Act was passed, we asked the kind of people to whom these modest transactions meant a great deal voluntarily to forgo them in order to help to take over these local authorities and become members of them.  That is a standard more appropriate to public employment than the standards it is proposed to set up under Section 8 of this Bill.  I ask the House to believe that we still can find in Ireland nine people, men or women, who are prepared to undertake important work of this character as members of the television Authority who either have no existing interest or who, if they have such, are prepared to give it up in order to observe the standards <Col N="1656" /> of conduct more in consonance with our traditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred in terms of contemptuous censure to the standards obtaining in the United States of America.  I suppose he was referring to Payola or Radiola but, perhaps, he would also remember that the general rule there is that anybody who enters the public service and as a result of his mercantile or professional occupation discovers a conflict of interest, must not only disclose it but surrender it, divest himself of the conflicting interest. They certainly maintain very high standards there.  There is no doubt that in any country of 170,000,000 there is ample scope for corruption but the American people have this saving quality.  They are a bit too prone in this discreet age to accuse themselves in public.  I should hope that their friends would praise them for what is, perhaps, an excess of frankness in that regard.</P>
    <P>I imagine that similar things happen in other countries in other parts of the world but it is a capital offence to refer to them.  Therefore, we do not hear about them.  What I should like to see are standards maintained here at least as high as the standards which the people of the United States aim to maintain.  I am very conscious of the fact that we are just as imperfect as our American cousins.  We may fall short of our ideals, as they no doubt frequently do, but it is a source of satisfaction to realise that in this country at least we are able to refer to such in public.  We may leave ourselves open to the accusation that we are more corrupt than our more discreet neighbours in the world but we would prefer to have our failings known than to surrender our freedom and the right to denounce abuses in public.  It is of course true that we shall not have any abuses, if we set our standards so low that what we used to call abuses are now to be called statutory rights.</P>
    <P>It is because I want to maintain some standards which we would all agree to be abuses that I ask the Minister to reconsider Section 8 and at least require in 1960 members of the television <Col N="1657" /> Authority to accept the same self-denying ordinance which the humblest member of a rural district council cheerfully accepted in 1898.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to preface my remarks by saying that what I say now has no reference to anybody living or dead.  I have no personal axe to grind in this matter.  My remarks are not intended to apply to any particular person. In general, I approve of the structure of this Bill.  I think the public interest is being safeguarded.  I think the general structure is satisfactory. The members of the television Authority within a wide range of authority have the responsibility for the conduct and financing of our future television service.</P>
      <P>In Section 8, there is a very serious lapse from what were formerly regarded as essential standards of public and private rectitude.  Section 8 is a blot on the entire Bill.  I know of no other legislation which carries a clause like Section 8 and I doubt if any other such legislation exists.  If it does, it did not have my support. I doubt the wisdom of this approach, even from the point of view of utilising what may be considered indispensable service for the operation of a television system.</P>
      <P>Let us see what will happen under this Bill.  There may be seven members, or there may be nine members, as the case may be.  Inevitably, if people are thrown together, or come on to a board, for four or five years, even assuming they were unknown to one another before going on the board, they will nevertheless be aware of all their various commercial associations. I can visualise this board consisting of, let us say, nine members and every one of the nine will know the kind of activities in which the other members are engaged.  Inevitably, if you throw nine people together on a board, it certainly will produce a very warm personal friendship and camaraderie between them.  Thus you may have the position in which the board, having invited tenders, receive tenders which include one from a person who is a member of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that if that person <Col N="1658" /> is a member of the Board, he should disclose his interest in the contract at once and not participate in the discussion. Does anyone really believe that that, of itself, really ensures that there will be a rigidly scrupulous approach to the consideration of the contract?  Is it not inevitable that the member who has the interest will have friends on the board?  Is it not expecting too much to imagine that the mere fact that one member leaves the council chamber or the board room will automatically black out the friendships he has made with other members?  Are we to assume that in every case these warm personal friendships, these high personal regards, these memories of earlier parties, of dinners, of luncheons, of happy atmospheres on racecourses and elsewhere, will also disappear and that members will consider the estimates on the basis of never having seen one another before?</P>
    <P>It may all happen but we are living in 1960, and reading the newspapers day in day out, of this country and other countries throughout the world, has convinced me there is always a grave danger of a degradation of what we have a right to expect in such circumstances&mdash;a high and inalienable standard of rectitude.  Is it not the position that a member who withdraws from a board room when a tender in which he has an interest is being considered will still leave behind him a memory of himself and an affection for himself which might show up in the view that &ldquo;Jack Black who has just left, really provides the best kind of service&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>This may not be a tender in which quantities are involved, in which somebody is giving certain quantities for a certain sum, and others are offering more&mdash;in which case perhaps it would be easy enough to see where you are getting the value&mdash;but a tender may be submitted in which two or three people are interested in providing a particular service, an intangible thing, in which case it is not unreasonable to imagine that certain members of the board may say, if a service is involved, &ldquo;I believe such and such a group <Col N="1659" /> provide the best service.&rdquo;  There is nothing definable about it; nothing you can test; nothing tangible; nothing you can weigh; nothing you can measure.  It is just an inward feeling from what he has heard from people in a better position to judge, that a particular body can provide a better service than another.  That may well be advanced in justification of giving to a member of a board, or his firm or some of his associates, a contract which could not have been accepted if there were a wide disparity of price in respect of the supply, let us say, of coal or oil or electricity for the operation of the television service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has lapsed in respect of this Section 8.  I do not think it is the kind of section to command public approval.  I think there would be public concern that in a small body of seven or nine&mdash;and I think a quorum is about three&mdash;you may find the situation in which a small group of people, because of the self-interest of others, may have the determination of a contract in the absence of a number of colleagues, absence because of the fact that they have an interest in the submission of tenders.  As I said at the outset, I have no particular personal axe to grind, no grudge against anyone, but I do think it is essential to give the public the feeling that there is no possibility of any person who is a member of the television Authority being able to use his position, or his friendship with other people there, as a means of getting a contract for his company or a contract in which he has a beneficial interest.</P>
    <P>Something else may arise.  It may be discovered when the board has been appointed that all these people could say with their hands on their hearts: &ldquo;We have no interest in any contract likely to come to the board.&rdquo;  That may be so, but some firms might say: &ldquo;It would be very good for us if we managed to get Mr. Jack Black, or Mr. Tom White, who is on the television Authority, to join our company in some capacity or other because you know he is a member of the Authority. It is true that under Section 8 he will have to disclose his interest in our company, <Col N="1660" /> but after all, it is a small board and if we had Jack Black on this board of seven or nine as a kind of public relations officer, it might not do us any harm, particularly as the prospects of doing business with the Authority may be pretty bright and fairly widespread.&rdquo; That is a possibility that cannot be overlooked.</P>
    <P>As I say, I think the Minister ought to realise that this is a substantial step down from what has come to be regarded as an essential and inalienable standard of rectitude in matters of this kind.  The Minister should undertake to amend the section &mdash; whether this amendment is the best way to do that or not is another matter&mdash;not to prevent the certainty of abuses because nobody can say there will be abuses, but the possibility of abuses and the probability that the public may say that it is possible to be a member of the board and at the same time, remain a member of the board if your contract has been accepted.</P>
    <P>Once the member concerned absents himself from the board, the contract can, in fact, be accepted, but you have got 3,000,000 people in a nation which has more than a dozen suspicious citizens who are willing to say: &ldquo;Was that not a queer thing that happened the other day?  Did you see that so-and-so got a contract for the television service and he is in so-and-so's and a member of the board?  He must be a pal of the Minister's or related to so-and-so and that is how the whole thing was done.&rdquo; He will convince a few other credulous people who have never read the Bill and who know nothing about Section 8, and who even if they read Section 8 would know nothing about it, and who will say that the whole thing is a wangle.  It is a most delightful way of describing a situation in Ireland, particularly when you are short of evidence to justify your allegation.  I would urge the Minister strongly to think on this matter again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been suggested, this section is open to a lot of wangling. I have been up against wangles all my life, so I am an authority on the subject.  Many people have tried to wangle me out of membership of <Col N="1661" /> the city council, out of membership of the Dáil and even out of existence. I know the extent to which people will go to wangle.  Therefore, I believe, there are certain dangers in this section, unless the Minister provides more safeguards than those in the section to ensure that the matter is not simply left to people's consciences.  In many ways, people have no consciences. Certainly it has been my experience in politics that politicians have no consciences.</P>
      <P>All the financial interests of the members of this Authority should be disclosed, not just the fact that they have an interest in somebody looking for a contract.  All their financial interests should be known beforehand. In fact, it should even be known whether they were members of a political Party or had been members of a political Party.  It is easy for a person to disclose that he had an interest.  That does not stop him wangling beforehand and fixing everything so that when the contract is almost accepted he may say: &ldquo;I have an interest in this but the job has all been prepared.&rdquo;  The wangle could have been prepared beforehand, and that lets him out.</P>
      <P>I believe there will be many attempts to lobby people on this Authority. Many people will be interested in business matters; artistes will be interested in achieving success and politicians will be interested in getting their faces before the public.  I imagine that this body will be subjected relentlessly to a tremendous amount of lobbying.  Therefore, everything should be known about those people and every form of check should be provided. Perhaps Deputy Browne's amendment, or some similar one, would be the best way of achieving this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out, these people will be strangers to one another at the beginning, but we know that people become as thick as thieves after a while when they get to know one another and particularly when they get to drink with one another. They then begin to confide in one another and fix things.  That has always been done.  It was a well-known fact in regard to many local <Col N="1662" /> bodies that while persons looking for contracts or employment were statutorily obliged to apply and send in fees, the contract was made or the employment given beforehand.  I am not saying it is done now, but it was done when certain boards had the authority to make contracts and give employment. I know it was done.  It goes to show that when people get to know one another, they may make a bit of a deal.  The public should be protected against conduct of that kind.</P>
    <P>I have been reading a history of New York recently, dealing particularly with Tammany Hall.  It was common for men brought before the Bench by various groups to have a bit of a powwow in a back room before there was any trial and get things nicely fixed.  That was because of certain associations between the judges and certain groups at one time or another. Men are weak and susceptible to influences. Because men are weak, every form of check should be made. As I said, I have been subjected to wangles all my life and I have survived them, thank God.  As I said on a previous occasion, I do not trust anybody; neither should the public nor this House trust anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want very strongly to support the amendment of Deputy Palmer.  I want to do so on the principle that is involved.  The fact that one particular person has of necessity been identified with this principle, and has identified himself with the principle in a certain newspaper, is incidental to the view that I expressed.  I want, first of all, to thank the Minister for his courtesy in sending me, as he promised on the Second Reading, a list of the sections which he said were similar and had been inserted in previous Acts: the Turf Development Act, Section 12; the Sea Fisheries Act, paragraph 6 of the First Schedule, which is not the same as this section, although the Minister says it is almost precisely the same; the Gaeltacht Industries Act, 1957; the Exports Promotion Act, 1959; the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, Section 10; the Transport Act, 1950, Section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> While I am grateful to the Minister for his courtesy in giving me that information, I only wish it were correct.  I do not expect the Minister himself to be an interpreter of public statutes, but it is the Minister who accepts responsibility for information of the sort given.  The information in respect of the Electricity Supply Act is so untrue as to be a complete and absolute distortion of the facts. Section 10 of that Act is more or less in the same words as this section. About the difference in words I make no comment, because I do not think the difference in drafting is of any consequence.  But the vital thing&mdash;the thing which the Minister omitted to disclose to me but which I knew from the fact of having other outside interests&mdash;is that Section 11 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, completely restricts the membership of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 of the Electricity Supply Act is in exact comparison to what should appear in relation to this Board.  Subsection (1) of Section 11 of that Act, which was not mentioned at all by the Minister in the letter he caused to be sent to me, states:</P>
      <P>Every person appointed to be a member of the Board shall within three months after his appointment absolutely sell and dispose of all shares in any electrical undertaking which he shall at the time of his appointment own or be interested in for his own benefit, and if any shares in any electrical undertaking shall come to or vest in a member of the Board by will or succession for his own benefit, he shall within three months after the same shall have so come to or vested in him, absolutely sell and dispose of the same or his interest therein.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>A member of the Board shall not, while he holds that office, purchase, take, or become interested in for his own benefit any shares in any electrical undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> Subsection (3) states, and this is the important subsection:</P>
    <P>Any member of the Board who shall retain, purchase, take or become or remain interested in any shares in any electrical undertaking in contravention of this section shall be disqualified for and be deemed to have vacated his office as such member.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) reads:</P>
    <P>In this section the expression &ldquo;shares in any electrical undertaking&rdquo; means and includes any stock, shares, debentures, debenture stock, bonds, or other securities of any company engaged in the generation, distribution, or supply of electricity&mdash;</P>
    <P>and here is the important part:</P>
    <P>&mdash;or the manufacture of or wholesale or retail dealing in electrical apparatus and includes any share or interest in any unincorporated undertaking similarly engaged.</P>
    <P>The framers of that Act took most special care in relation to the Electricity Supply Board that the people dealing day in and day out with the Board would not be in the position of sitting in judgment upon themselves, in the position of being able to allocate contracts to themselves, but in this section the Minister has seen fit to change the whole basis, for a State company, of the manner in which contracts are to be regulated and carried through.</P>
    <P>To put it very mildly, I think that the Minister misled me, or attempted to mislead me, perhaps inadvertently, by not referring to Section 11 when he disclosed these sections in the letter to which I have referred.  What is proposed here?  As I say, I am not interested in the persons concerned.  I am interested purely in a principle and it so happens that the Minister has, in advance of the Act, in advance of the statute in this case, indicated whom he intends to appoint.  In the ordinary way, if the Minister had not done that, we would discuss this section completely in the abstract, without any knowledge of any particular person, but if a particular person's name is inevitably, by implication or otherwise, <Col N="1665" /> brought into the discussion on Section 8 and the amendments to Section 8, it is not the people who condemn Section 8 who bring in his name.  It is the Minister who indicated in advance that he is the person who is to be appointed.</P>
    <P>What has happened?  The Minister has indicated that he intends to appoint as the Chairman of this Authority&mdash; and for all we know other members of it because I do not know that he is the only one&mdash;a person whose entire business is connected with television, whose entire financial business is connected with the making and the selling of programmes, whose entire business has been acting as an agent &mdash;I suppose &ldquo;agent&rdquo; would be the correct word &mdash; who produces programmes and sells them, and who buys programmes already made and then resells them.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything about his technical competence where programmes are concerned.  I offer no criticism on that whatever.  I offer no criticism whatever of him personally.  I like his technical programmes and I always watch one of them on Sunday nights, but that is not the point.  The point is that here is a person whose whole business is the making of programmes, who admits himself in a newspaper interview, that he has been buying the rights for Ireland of programmes made throughout the world, for the purpose of being able to resell these programmes to the Authority when it is set up and when it is in operation. How on earth can any Minister or any Government stand over that as a principle proper to public life?</P>
    <P>I am not making any aspersions whatever on the principles of the individual concerned or on the motives which actuated him.  I am sure some of the motives which actuate him are motives to ensure we shall have good television programmes here, but that is not the point.  The point is that he is the person who is to be Chairman of the Authority one minute, and in another moment the person who will be asking the Authority for authority to fix a rate of commission appropriate to him, to pay him and his concern for the <Col N="1666" /> programme material the Authority is to use.</P>
    <P>A man cannot serve two masters and the Minister in Section 8 is asking the House to accept that he can.  I can understand in relation to other aspects of other State-sponsored bodies there being occasional, incidental, detailed, trifling ways in which a member of a Board might be involved in some contract with the concern itself.  Take Coras Iompair Éireann, for example.  All of us occasionally travel on a train and to go on a train is to enter into a contract.  We buy tickets and it would be nonsense to say that a member of Coras Iompair Éireann could not buy a ticket and travel on a train.  There would have to be some clause of some sort to ensure that the director will be able to buy a ticket&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be occasions on which a member of the Board of Coras Iompair Éireann would employ C.I.E. to entrain his cattle or to bring them by lorry to or from a fair.  There would be occasions perhaps&mdash;if we had the system operated in other countries of people moving house when they move office&mdash;of his wanting C.I.E. to move his furniture whenever he was changing his abode.  In relation to trivial, incidental matters of that sort, everybody would understand that it was proper for him as a member of the Board to have that work done by contract with the Board, at fixed prices which are available to everybody else, but what would one say if a Minister came to this House and told us he proposed to appoint as Chairman of C.I.E. the chairman of a firm of furniture removers or the chairman of one of the firms regularly in day to day competition with C.I.E.? Would one not think it an extraordinary thing for a Minister to do? That is precisely what the Minister is asking us to accept in this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand in relation to export promotion that it would be occasionally desirable for a firm, of which a member was also a <Col N="1667" /> member of Coras Tráchtála Teoranta, to hold a promotional exhibition in London or New York, and that it would be desirable to make an agreement with the firm of which that member of the Board was also a Director to put up money or to put up goods for display and sale at that exhibition.  It would be proper to permit that type of trifling and incidental contact and contract as between a member of the Board of Coras Tráchtála and a member of an outside firm, but I do not think anybody would suggest that it would be proper for a company to be able virtually to monopolise the services of Coras Tráchtála and at the same time, to have on Coras Tráchtála a person who was also a director of the company concerned.</P>
    <P>The whole matter in relation to this is being taken completely away from the realm of a trifling incidental contract by the manner in which the Minister himself has indicated that a person, whose sole business this is, is to be made, in his case, a member of an Authority.</P>
    <P>We are not dependent merely on hearsay or on conjecture as to the type of contract to be made between the television Authority on the one hand and a body of which the Chairman is also a member&mdash;he may be chairman of it, for all I know, but certainly a member, the most influential member &mdash;because, very straightforwardly, the person concerned has given an interview to the newspapers and has said that what he has been doing is securing options on the Irish rights of both British and American television programmes.</P>
    <P>Surely it is possible to get personnel for this Authority who will not be in the position of having already gone out and secured options of this sort and who will then sell these options to the Authority of which they will be members?  When that situation has been publicised, as it has been publicised in the Press and elsewhere, how on earth will anybody believe that this is all clear and above-board?  I am not saying that it will not be, but supposing <Col N="1668" /> somebody offers a programme and the programme is turned down in favour of a programme that has been bought by the chairman's organisation and resold by the chairman's organisation to the television Authority, even if the chairman's programme is 100 per cent. better, the person who is turned down will feel that he did not get a fair crack or a fair deal.  Is that the way in which this new national service should be started?</P>
    <P>I want to urge the Minister as strongly as I can, if he does not accept the amendment in the form of words in which it is now before us, at least to make it clear now that he will follow the pattern that was set up in 1927, by adding to this a section to ensure that those who are engaged in the business of broadcasting&mdash;meaning thereby to cover sound and visual &mdash;cannot continue in that business while they are members of the Authority, just as, in 1927, those who were engaged in the business of electricity could no longer remain engaged in that business while they were members of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne pressed on me the necessity to accept the amendment.  If I accepted the amendment tabled by Deputy Dr. Browne or the amendment standing in the name of Deputy Palmer, I would, in fact, be restricting the choice of the Government as to the people they think should be members of the new Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, of course, as Deputy Sweetman has said, that the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, contained Section 11.  The matter was fully discussed in the Seanad, and it must have been a matter of general knowledge to Deputies that I made reference in the Seanad to the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, and quoted Section 10 as a section similar to Section 8 of this Bill, and that there was then a further discussion of Section 11 of the 1927 Act. When I sent Deputy Sweetman the names of the Acts and the sections that were, as I said, precisely in the same form as Section 8, I did so on the <Col N="1669" /> understanding that Deputy Sweetman must have known that Section 11 was contained in the 1927 Act.</P>
    <P>It is a long time since 1927.  The Electricity Supply Act, 1927, was the first Act by which the State established a public authority, a semi-State body, to perform a public function of this nature.  By that Act, they established the Electricity Supply Board. Stemming from that there have been established a number of semi-State bodies charged with the responsibility of certain national work and the provisions contained in Section 11 of the 1927 Act have already been departed from in the other Acts.  In the case of the Transport Act, 1950, the Export Promotion Act, 1959, the Gaeltacht Industries Act, 1957, the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952 and the Turf Development Act, 1946, those provisions have been dropped.</P>
    <P>In my view, the designers and originators of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927 were concerned with the establishment of the first semi-State authority in a new State and they wanted to make absolutely certain that a certain standard would be maintained. The State has had experience of the operations of this first semi-State body in practice.  We have had an outstanding example of what can be done by semi-State organisations in national development and we have had set for ourselves a very high standard in public service by the members of all the semi-State authorities. No matter what we may think of them as individuals or how we may differ from the Government who appointed people to such authorities, we have not had up to now any public scandal in relation to public contracts or public business executed by our semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Dillon said, that early in the century, for many years before that and for some time after the State was founded a member of a rural district council or other local authority could not have a contract with the authority of which he was a member.  However, we are not quite so innocent as not to realise that there were ways and means of <Col N="1670" /> getting over that disability.  It was well known that there were many people serving on local authorities who had, in fact, contracts with the local authority, and at the present time a person can divest himself of his interests while retaining a beneficial interest in contracts with an authority of which he may be a member.</P>

      <P>It is a fact, but we must approach this matter as rational beings and we must have a certain trust in the people who make the appointments to any body or board, the Government in this case.  We must also trust, to a very large extent, the integrity of the people appointed to maintain the standard the Minister and the Government of the day expect from the television Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to deal with the amendments before me and with Section 8 when the status of a particular person is involved.  It is true I said in answer to Deputy Sweetman last week that a certain person would be invited to act as chairman of this Authority.  I could not give any other answer to Deputy Sweetman when he put the question to me because in the public notice which we published at the time the advisory committee was established, it was made perfectly plain that the members of that advisory committee would be invited to become members of the statutory body when it was established under the Act.  I have here the announcement made on my behalf by the Government Information Bureau, in October, 1959.  It was publicly stated at the time that this person would be asked to accept membership of the Authority.  When the Government came to discuss the establishment of this broadcasting Authority and the setting up of a television service, the question arose of supplementing the advice available to the <Col N="1671" /> Government and to me in this new and complex situation.</P>
    <P>There was at that time, and there has been since, a good deal of discussion as to what type of technical equipment should be purchased by the Government for the new television service, what design our studios should take and what planning should be done in advance in relation to the establishment of this service. As a result of this consideration, the Government decided to establish this advisory committee to advise and assist them in arranging for the supply of the equipment which will be required for the television transmitter station which is to serve the Dublin area, for temporary Dublin studios and for the link between the station and the studios in co-operation with the Commissioners of Public Works, for the provision of the buildings for the transmitter station which is to serve the Dublin area and the buildings for the temporary Dublin studios, and to have the acquisition of land which will be required for the studios and for any necessary approach roads to television transmitter stations outside the Dublin area put in hand immediately by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>In considering the personnel of this committee, the Government regarded the appointment of this person, if he accepted the invitation to be a member, as very desirable in view of his association with the television service in England and his international reputation as a television personality.  The work of this committee is not yet completed and when the new Authority is established on the passage of this Bill into law, the Authority will be concerned with the provision of the new studios at Montrose, the erection of the Dublin transmitter and other matters which I have mentioned.  The actual broadcasting of television programmes is not likely to commence for some time to come and in the meantime the Authority will largely be concerned with matters on which the Television Committee have given advice.</P>
    <P>When this gentleman was first interviewed by the Taoiseach and myself, he made it quite plain to us that his <Col N="1672" /> business interests might conceivably interfere with his continued membership of the Authority.  We pointed out that in that event, he would resign from the Authority and that we should not be disappointed if he had to take that step.  It was quite clear to the three of us that the Government were also free to make that decision. Before the actual broadcasting of programmes commences, it may be necessary to have another look at this question and to have further discussion with this gentleman, an exemplary young Irishman of good character and fine ability who thought it his patriotic duty to place at the disposal of the Government the knowledge and experience he undoubtedly had gained by virtue of his active association with television and in the presentation of programmes.</P>
    <P>If his public statement is read closely&mdash;and I encouraged him to make that statement&mdash;it will be found that what I have said now is contained therein, that he was glad to accept the invitation to initiate an Irish television service.  If we could discuss the principle involved in the amendment and in the section as distinct from any individual, it would be so much better.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the function of the Government is to make sure that each member of the Authority has not a business interest or a contract interest in the Authority.  It depends then on the degree of that interest, to what extent the individual concerned is committed in his own business arrangements, and what are the prospects of his business having any contractual obligations to the Authority.  If we were to restrict ourselves completely to the elimination of interests, we would be depriving ourselves of the opportunity of placing on the Authority people who, by their business experience, their knowledge and education, would be very useful members of the Authority.</P>
    <P>It is admitted by Deputies who have spoken that it is almost impossible to find people among the public who will be suitable as members of the Authority and who will not have some very small interest in the Authority <Col N="1673" /> or its business.  We had Deputy Sweetman going to the extreme of pointing out the small interest the ordinary person can have in a transport or other organisation.  Even the holders of wireless or television licences could be said to have an interest in the Authority.  It would be ridiculous to take the matter so far and it would be also ridiculous to prevent suitable people from being members of the Authority because they have some interest.  If they were employees of a firm buying advertising time from the Authority, we should not, if they are otherwise eligible and suitable as members of the Authority, deprive the Government of the opportunity of appointing them because of that small interest.</P>
    <P>I think Section 8 as it stands is precisely the same as the sections in the other Acts I have named, the Turf Development Act, the Sea Fisheries Act, the Gaeltacht Industries Act and the Export Promotion Act.  It is a standard section and I am advised that it adequately covers the problem we have on hands, a problem which faces any Government establishing a semi-State body: it is one of the inherent problems.  The Government must make up their minds and satisfy themselves that they will appoint the proper persons on the Authority, persons who will maintain the standard of public dealing to which we are accustomed in semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why the Opposition, either Deputy Dr. Browne or the Fine Gael Party, wish to amend this section. If the Government make a mistake and if they do not appoint the proper persons on the Authority, that is the Government's responsibility and they can be held to it by the public and by this House.  It would be foolish unduly to restrict the Government in their choice by the amendments put forward here.</P>
    <P>We could have a different type of Authority.  We could decide, for instance, if we wished not to take any member of the general public, any of the business community or other classes of people that make up the Irish nation.  We could appoint a small authority of civil servants to <Col N="1674" /> make absolutely certain that there would be no business interest and no contracting interests represented on the board.  But I do not think we could get from such a board what we desire in this Authority.  We are dealing with a service which will make a very deep impression on our people: it will be seen and heard in every home where it is found possible to have a television receiver.  It will be in the chimney corner, as it were, and on the Authority we need people from every walk of life, if we can get them.  We need people who represent broad interests within the country and people who can apply their minds in a business way to the affairs of this Authority.</P>
    <P>So far as small contracts are concerned, the Director General and his staff will deal with them.  The matter may never come in a formal way before the Authority, which will deal with policy matters and will lay down broadly how contracts are to be dealt with by the staff.  There will be generalisations in regard to charges for time and so on.  It is only where you have a long-term contract and one of outstanding value that it would be dealt with immediately by the Authority itself.  Therefore, this situation which has been suggested of a member of the Authority walking out every time a contract is being decided would not arise.  There will not be so many big contracts to be dealt with by the Authority.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I have answered all the points put to me on this section but I think the section, as drafted, is sufficient security and that it is not a contravention of any principle laid down in any previous act.  It is, of course, true that we have departed from the Electricity Supply Act of 1927.  It has already been departed from and nobody regards any of the authorities which exist under any of the other Acts as being any worse in regard to contracts or public service or maintenance of public standards than the authority appointed in 1927 as the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>The boards I have named, or some of them, handle very much more valuable <Col N="1675" /> contracts than any envisaged by us as likely to be made by the television Authority and they operate under almost precisely the same section as this Section 8.  We have not yet, as I said earlier, experienced any scandal in public life in that regard and I hope and trust that we shall not have any such scandal in this regard in the future.  The writing-in of restrictive clauses in Acts of Parliament will not prevent scandal if our people permit of such acts being perpetrated upon them and do not take public action.  There is nothing one can do if the standards of our people are lowered and there is no medium so capable of lowering the general standards of our people than the propagation of unsuitable material through the television medium.  I feel, therefore, that we must obtain on the Authority people of the highest integrity.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who brought individuals into this debate.  Earlier on, in the discussion on this Bill, I said that I thought the Government had handled this whole business, or, at any rate, most of it before the present Minister became responsible, in a most unfortunate manner.  They set up a Commission to make a report on a certain basis.  The Commission duly reported on the assumption that the various undertakings which had come before them would provide a service without involving a charge on the Exchequer.  After that Commission had reported on that basis, the Government changed their minds. Somewhere about the same point they changed the Minister.  Still later they established a temporary <i>ad hoc</i> advisory committee.  I can sympathise with and, in fact, understand the Minister's problem in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a highly technical matter. This is a new service which necessarily <Col N="1676" /> involves getting the views and opinions of people who have had experience in similar services elsewhere.  In so far as this country is concerned, there were very few people in that category and, having looked at the position, they decided to establish an advisory committee, consisting of business people and one person who had practical experience of organising television programmes.</P>
    <P>Leaving all that aside for the moment, I believe that we should endeavour to frame this legislation in such a way that there will be no possibility of any conflict of interest. Even a breadth of suspicion could do considerable harm.  We have had examples elsewhere recently of what can happen.  Considerable publicity was given to programmes on television services in other countries and to the manner in which certain programmes were decided on and arranged.  That publicity undoubtedly shook public confidence in the administration of these schemes.  I believe we should, in so far as we can, by inscribing in legislation the necessary prohibitions, ensure that nothing of the kind can happen here.</P>
    <P>In this service, we are dealing with something which is new, something which will be established with public money, and which will provide a medium of entertainment which will have widespread repercussions.  The fact that certain other Acts have clauses similar to Section 10 does not answer the case here.  In none of the other Acts, not even in the case of the Electricity Supply Act, is there an absolute monopoly.  Under this section, this new board will have an absolute monopoly of the service provided.  It is conceivable that a conflict of interest could arise on a particular programme.  Conflict of interest could arise where alternative programmes will have been refused or declined and no other promoter or undertaker will be in a position to compete at any time with that particular programme, or service, while that contract is in existence.</P>
    <P>The prohibition in Section 11 of the Act of 1927 was undoubtedly a wise one.  I have often thought, and I have <Col N="1677" /> expressed this view before, that one of the unsatisfactory features of legislation dealing with semi-State bodies is that they do not follow, with perhaps certain exceptions for particular reasons, a similar pattern.  Different conditions, different terms of appointment, different requirements are laid down in different Acts.  To a considerable extent, the provisions follow the same pattern, but, for no really known reason and, very often, for no really valid reason, they depart from the pattern in certain respects. Undoubtedly legislation will have to vary in so far as the objects of the particular undertaking are concerned; but, so far as the term of office of the directors and the interest which they may or may not have are concerned, there are variations in conditions.</P>
    <P>It is significant, however, that in the report of the Television Authority in Chapter 5, paragraph 69&mdash;remember, this Authority reported just 12 months ago&mdash;it is stated, on the assumption that the body appointed would be an organisation operating under licence, &ldquo;that a member of the board should have no such financial or other interest as would be likely to affect prejudically the discharge of his functions as a member of the Authority.&rdquo; It is significant that that body, reporting 12 months ago, should have made that reservation in its Report.</P>
    <P>Recently we have had an opportunity of reading the very strong criticism of certain programmes, on the ground that the material was unsuitable. It is of the utmost importance in the public interest, therefore, that this body should be so regulated as to leave no room for any suggestion, even of a breath of suspicion of any sort.  So far as my experience goes, I should like to say that the programme identified with the person concerned is one of the best programmes on B.B.C. television.  It is a desirable programme in every way and one which could not be criticised from any angle.  Generally, it is an entertaining and an interesting programme, but that is not the point. It is unfortunate, as I say, that this cannot be considered without referring, either directly or indirectly, to the person concerned.</P>
    <P>A later section of the Bill, Section <Col N="1678" /> 16, which defines generally the functions of the Authority says:</P>
    <P>...the Authority shall have the following powers:</P>
    <P>(c)  to originate programmes and procure programmes from any source;</P>
    <P>(d)  to make contracts, agreements and arrangements incidental or conducive to the objects of the Authority;</P>
    <P>Is it not inconceivable that if this Authority, more especially if the person concerned is the Chairman, should consider contracts or the arrangement of programmes, or the securing from any source of a programme and if a conflict of interests arises, it would be satisfied by the person concerned leaving the meeting and taking no part in the deliberations and the decision of the Authority and that the disclosure should be recorded in the minutes?  I think in this case the requirements laid down in Section 11&mdash;I need not read it again&mdash;of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, are more appropriate, more especially when we take into account the fact that the Television Commission recommended, at Paragraph 69, that a member of the Authority should have no such special financial or other interest as would be likely to affect prejudicially the discharge of this functions.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, quite possible for a person to divest himself of one interest while retaining another, but as this is a service of an entirely new kind in which the body appointed will have absolute monopoly of both sound broadcasting and the television service, in those circumstances, it is not comparable with any other State body which has been set up here.  It is a fact that the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna have a monopoly, but in both of those cases, people have an alternative source.  There is no alternative source here or no alternative service comparable with this.</P>
    <P>I accept, as the Minister has said, that the person concerned has said that if there is any conflict of interests, he will resign, but I suggest to the Minister that this way is not the <Col N="1679" /> prudent course to prevent that situation arising.  Before a conflict of interest arises, there should be a prohibition in the Act in order that the public will be satisfied that <i>ab initio</i> this matter has been established on the basis that there is no conflict of interests and in the knowledge that the Government have taken steps to ensure that the public interest is entirely safeguarded.</P>
    <P>It is much better in these matters to avoid a problem rather than to try to deal with it when it arises.  We have an opportunity to avoid getting into a situation which may cause very considerable difficulty and may, indeed, affect public opinion and reaction to sound broadcasting and the television service.  It is better in these cases more especially when we are on notice, as we undoubtedly are, that a conflict of interests could conceivably arise, to avoid it initially rather than deal with the situation if it should develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be any essential difference between any of us as to the fundamental standards to be maintained here.  As the Minister has pointed out, it is a question of finding the best and most appropriate way of attaining that standard.  I rise for two purposes. I rise, first, merely to balance what Deputy Sweetman has said about the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  What he said and what the Minister said about that Act is correct.  What Deputy Dillon said about the local authorities in the old days is also correct, but, as the Minister pointed out, it was a very poor insurance for the spirit of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, I should like to point out, for the record, that the principle of interested parties on a board disclosing their interest, and the principle tacitly accepted that in certain cases that would be a necessity, is by no means a new one.  In the Companies Act, for instance, you will find that it has always been provided&mdash;the 1908 Act was the product of a fairly long history&mdash;that directors in public companies may have contracts with <Col N="1680" /> companies in their capacity as directors of other companies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>What type of companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Public companies. I think it arises in two ways To give a specific reference, the 1908 Companies Act provides&mdash;and this is important&mdash;that a director shall be disqualified if he is concerned or participates in profits of any contracts with the company but then it goes on to make a proviso, which will be found in Schedule A.  The proviso is in paragraph 77 of Schedule A.&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided, however, that no director shall vacate his office by reason of his being a member of any company which has entered into contracts with or done any work for the company of which he is a director: but a director shall not vote in respect of any such contract or work, and if he does so vote his vote shall not be counted.</P>
      <P>In articles of association, you will often find provision&mdash;something like what is in the Act&mdash;explicitly enabling a director to have an interest, if he discloses it and does not vote.  That is the point.  The 1927 Act was probably very explicit.  As the Minister has pointed out, it brought in a standard and a rigour which so far as I know has not been exceeded since and which exceeded anything that was explicitly there before.</P>
      <P>A comparable Act&mdash;and this is rather interesting&mdash;is the Transport Act, 1950.  I shall quote from this Act because it was not passed by a Fianna Fáil Government.  This Act was passed by a Government of which Deputy Norton, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dillon were members and in which Deputy Cosgrave was a Parliamentary Secretary.  In Section 7 of that Act, there are elaborate provisions governing the Board and in relation to the members of the Board.  Paragraph (c), subsection (6) of Section 7 reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall be the duty of a member of the Board who is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in any contract made or proposed <Col N="1681" /> to be made by the Board to disclose the nature of his interest at a meeting of the Board, and the disclosure shall be forthwith recorded in the minutes of the Board, and the member who is so interested shall not take part in any deliberation or decision of the Board with respect to that contract.</P>
    <P>I have intervened merely to point out that this type of provision is much more ordinary than the type of provision in the 1927 Act and that, therefore, in so far as the form and general content of the provision are concerned, there does not seem to me here any very great departure from what is in other Acts.  I say all that with a full appreciation of the principle of integrity which inspires the movers of the amendment in this case.  I do not think the Minister or anybody on this bench will be in any way behind Deputy Dr. Browne or Deputy Palmer in wanting to enforce that principle.</P>
    <P>This Bill seems to be pretty well in line with the precedents and even with the precedent of the 1950 Act which I quoted.  I think we all agree that transport and communications are of comparable public importance with television.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the kernel of this discussion in a sense.  I wonder if this discussion would have been so marked or if the point would have been so controversial, if a particular person had not been named in advance, if there were not any particular personal circumstances affecting the discussion of this section.  In that regard, no further answer can be made than what the Minister has made.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has a point when he says that it is the spirit and the actual controls in the system that will count more in the long run than mere statutory provisions.  There is an old saying that the law can be an ass and that sometimes a technicality can be made to work in precisely the wrong way when judged from the standpoint of the intention originally behind the enactment.  On the other hand, the sanctions that secure integrity in public appointments and <Col N="1682" /> a high standard of public morality are those which spring, as the Minister said, in the first instance, from this House; thereafter, the integrity of the Government of the day and then, perhaps, not less the integrity of the personnel appointed to the authorities in question.</P>
    <P>In regard to the latter point, the Government's position is simply that there happens to be, uniquely&mdash;perhaps it is unfortunate that that is so&mdash;one person who could, so to speak, step into the gap for the nation.  It was not a question of stepping into the gap for the Government but for the nation.</P>
    <P>It seems to me we could balance up this discussion at least by considering the case for retaining this section and for standing to the precedents and the principle that, above all, in the last analysis, it is this House and the Government and the standard of the appointees that will ensure that the public welfare is looked after adequately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister called in evidence the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927.  He told the House that Section 10 was the precedent on which he rested for Section 8 of this Bill.  I do not care to charge him with being disingenuous.  How he could refer the House to Section 10 as the valid basis for Section 8 of the television Bill, without advertising to Section 11 which goes on to provide the very thing we seek by our amendment to secure, I cannot understand.  You cannot read Section 10 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, without Section 11 and Section 11 expressly provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person appointed to be a member of the Board shall within three months after his appointment absolutely sell and dispose of all shares in any electrical undertaking which he shall, at the time of his appointment, own or be interested in for his own benefit, and if any shares in any electrical undertaking shall come to or vest in a member of the Board by will or succession for his own benefit, he shall within three months after the same shall <Col N="1683" /> have so come to or vested in him, absolutely sell and dispose of the same or his interest therein.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot doubt that the Minister had his attention directed to that section when looking at Section 10.</P>

I should like to comment on the observations by Deputy de Valera and to say to him that it is fantastic to suggest that the personality of Mr. Eamonn Andrews is involved here.  I have never seen Mr. Eamonn Andrews; I have never met Mr. Andrews.  I do not know anything about Mr. Eamonn Andrews except that he appears to be a well-known and reputable member of the entertainment profession largely associated with television and radio.  His personality, so far as I am concerned, does not enter into this matter.  I am concerned with a very simple issue and that is the conflict of interests.  I am concerned to ensure that we shall not by our legislation lower the standards ordinarily governing conduct in the public eye in this country.  That is all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera pleaded for a rational approach to this question.  When you are creating a transport monopoly and seeking for a board to administer it on behalf of the State, naturally you look for people familiar with the trade and commerce of the country.  Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You actually got a man to represent the livestock industry on the grounds that so much livestock was carried on the railway.  The rail freight charges and the accommodation entered so deeply into the success or failure of the livestock industry of this country that if you wanted a man who knew the livestock industry intimately you would want to get a man engaged in the trade.  His value vanished if you said: &ldquo;But you must get out of the livestock trade.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the Deputy fully understands, the livestock industry is a dynamic thing.  It is constantly changing. Sometimes it is fat stock.  Sometimes it is store stock.  It may be sheep or pigs.  One of the essentials was to get somebody who was familiar with the changing pattern of trade and commerce in the country.  I think there was a miller on the board.  There was a technical transport man on the board.  There was an engineer on the board but you had to get certain persons, if they were to be any use, who knew the industry from the point of view of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there was a representative on the board who knew the business from the point of view of the trade unions.  In fact, it was a composite <Col N="1685" /> board.  It was designed to run the trade on behalf of the country with an intimate knowledge of the kind of trades it was serving bearing in mind it was a transport monopoly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we not the evidence of our own eyes?  In America and Great Britain the people who operate and administer television are not engaged in the trade.  They do not supply canned television programmes or components to the stations over which they preside.  If you are presiding over a commercial station, which is your own property, the ordinary rules of business apply.  The difficulty here is that we are creating a State monopoly.</P>
      <P>What rather upsets me is that I note a tendency on the part of certain of our colleagues here to take up the position that if you make it all right by statute anything goes.  I do not think that anything goes even if we passed a Bill to say it does.  It is to dissuade Dáil Éireann from attempting by legislation to lower ethical standards that these amendments are put down.  I appreciate that there is a difference between what is appropriate in ordinary commercial practice and what is appropriate in an organisation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy de Valera that <Col N="1686" /> you may find a situation which is probably represented by the transport situation in which you could not get a public board in which this standard could be maintained because, if you did, it must of its nature be an ineffective board in order to face that fact. There was much to be said for not nationalising transport for that very reason.  The trouble was that if we did not do it at the time, the transport system would have broken down.  You had to do the best you could but because you were forced by circumstances into accepting the situation in respect of the transport service is no reason why we should set it as a desirable standard in every case.</P>
    <P>I think the parallel with section 7 of the Electricity Supply Board Act is very much closer because there a person who has an interest in electrical goods, the kind of things that the E.S.B. might ordinarily be expected to undertake themselves, is told to get rid of them.  If adventitiously they come to him after appointment he must, within three months, divest himself of them.  I think I can distinguish rationally between the situation in which the E.S.B. Act was designed, the situation for which this Television Bill is designed and the situation which had to be surmounted in connection with Coras Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>I think it right to remind the House that the Act of 1950 was not the first Act we passed regarding the transport law.  We tried every device human ingenuity could evolve in a succession of efforts to turn the transport monopoly into a self-supporting institution.  My memory goes back further than that of Deputy Haughey. I can remember the happy days when the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Taoiseach, was introducing Bills into this House.  He was legislating to turn the transport system of this country into a gold mine.  A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since these golden anticipations were confounded by the event.  By the time we reached 1950, we would have put pink elephants on the board if we thought they could serve the purpose.  We were more <Col N="1687" /> successful in 1950 than the present Taoiseach was in 1936.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is a fair parallel to be drawn between these two cases nor do I think that the 1950 precedent is relevant to our present situation.  I am quite sure you do not want someone involved in the trade to be on the television Authority. I think it is certainly possible to get nine people, men or women, who would have no connection with the trade at all and who would be eminently suitable to operate an Authority of this kind.  I could imagine the Authority, consisting of nine detached and impartial persons, getting expert advice from any number of people involved in the trade.  There is nothing to restrict their discretion in getting expert advice from any source they think expedient.  That is within their discretion. All this amendment seeks to provide is that they themselves will in respect of the Authority be as Caesar's wife&mdash;above suspicion.  I cannot help feeling that most of the Deputies on the other side of the House fundamentally agree with us. I always welcome an opportunity of giving a demonstration in this House of the noble process of reason prevailing. This is a vindication of a very valuable principle and we should vindicate its usefulness by honest debate in this sovereign Legislature of Ireland.</P>

I may have misrepresented a section by saying that under this Schedule of the Companies Act a man could be a director of two companies.  No.  I note that the word used is &ldquo;member&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to deal with that point.  I think Deputy de Valera was under the misapprehension, as I was, in referring to it as a <Col N="1688" /> State company.  Consequently I was about to say that Deputy de Valera made two important points; one is valid and the other invalid.  On the second point, in regard to the 1950 Transport Act and the fact that the principle about which we are talking here was violated, I think we have established that.  I think he should concede it as I concede it.  Inasmuch as I had responsibility in the formulation of that Act at the time, I accept it.  I think it was bad at that time to have done that.</P>
      <P>If the principle we are making here is that we must have the State company above reproach, I do not think one can make exceptions on foot of the arguments advanced by Deputy Dillon&mdash;the necessity for having an expert on livestock as a member of the board.  If that is so, all the arguments put by the Minister apropos the proposed chairman are equally valid, that the proposed chairman is an expert in a particular field and justifies his place on the board.  May I say in regard to that that I think the 1927 Act was a fine piece of legislation, not only in its end product but in its respect for the principle we are discussing?</P>
      <P>All of us recognise that one of the tributes the Minister has paid to the principle is in the admission that there has been no breath of scandal associated with the activities of this company as long as it has been operating. That, to a considerable extent, can, it is true, be attributed to the personnel but as well as anything else, it is due to the principle under which they have operated.  For that reason I am particularly concerned to try to retain it in this piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much the question of a personality being introduced.  We are, as Deputy de Valera suggested, discussing this whole section in a situation in which an individual is interwoven with a principle.  That is most undesirable and it is a great pity that it should happen.  As far as I am concerned the individual is a magnificent artist; there is no question about that at all.  It seems to me that the only worthwhile programmes on the B.B.C. are those produced by him, even those he operates for the <Col N="1689" /> children's service.  He is an outstanding personality.  At the same time it is unfortunate that the name has become involved in this discussion.</P>
    <P>The trouble then arises that when one is criticising the service one tends to appear to be criticising an individual, which I certainly do not wish to do.  The Minister is establishing a rather dangerous line, I suggest, in saying that this man happens to be a first class artist and so should be the chairman.  He over-simplifies the problem. Everyone could concede that, if at the same time we had not to admit that he is also a business man, financially associated with this particular medium which we are discussing.  We are not then solely concerned with his talents and qualifications as an artist. We are concerned with his business interests from now on and the principle here would seem to be that we are taking a particular service, television, and the suggestion is that because this man is a magnificent artist we shall put him in charge and close our eyes to the fact that he has at the same time financial and business interests in the same industry.</P>
    <P>I think that if we took that line we would veer dangerously towards the vocational conception of Government. For instance, Mr. Paddy Lynch is a first class administrator and obviously Are Lingus is very safe in his hands. But if we had decided to appoint Mr. Lynch to Aer Lingus because of his record, for instance, with B.O.A.C., if he had one, and three or four other private air companies in other countries, and asked him, because of his experience, to take over the running of a new company, Aer Lingus, and said at the same time: &ldquo;You may, as well as running Aer Lingus, keep your interests in B.O.A.C., S.A.S., Pan American Airways and any other interests you happen to have; because you are an expert we need you so badly we shall take you even under those conditions&rdquo;, it seems to me that that would a most undesirable thing. We could apply the same case to Mr. Todd Andrews who is a magnificent administrator in control of C.I.E.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>However, he is a magnificent administrator.  We shall discuss that another time as I have an interest in his most recent closing down proposal, with which I strongly disagree.  He has a great record as an administrator.  In C.I.E. he has obviously taken over a very difficult job but it would be unthinkable that at the same time he should be allowed, <i>pari passu</i> with his present job, to run other private transport concerns.  The same applies to Lieutenant-General Costello, another magnificent administrator. It would be unthinkable that as well as running Comhlucht Siúicre he should be allowed to have an interest in Tate and Lyle, or whatever sugar companies there are.  I do not think we would be completely happy about that.</P>
      <P>We are in the position that we are now discussing a piece of legislation put before us to facilitate an individual. I think we must all accept that now.  If the 1950 Transport Act had been put forward to me in the Cabinet as a piece of legislation designed to facilitate the appointment of a person because he had a knowledge of transport and at the same time had similar business interests, I think I would have fought the Bill at the time.  I cannot recollect whether I did or did not oppose it then.  I think it is a precedent which should not be allowed to be established that we accept the expert with a vested interest, a business or financial interest, in his particular expertise or profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course we have the position of the Minister for Health at the moment who is presented with a problem by the Irish Medical Association who assure him they are the experts in their field and they have a vested interest. Surely it would be unthinkable at the same time to let them run the Department of Health.  The same applies to the National Farmers' Association and the Department of Agriculture or the case of the I.N.T.O. running the Department of Education.  There are various other proposals of that nature which I think the Minister would <Col N="1691" /> readily repudiate in those instances and reject.  It is precisely the same underlying principle here.  I think it is a humiliating position for any Government.  The Minister has said we should not restrict the Government. It is not we who have restricted the Government.  It is a particular individual who appears to have restricted the Government and he has given us to understand that we can have his undoubted talents but at a particular price.  I think it would be a pity if the Government allowed itself to be put into a position where it must accept certain terms from an individual, however talented.</P>

    <Title>Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1960&mdash;Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain allegations were made in connection with the publication of one of the Orders to be confirmed under this Bill during the Second Reading and the Committee Stage.  The principal allegation made was that under the arrangements whereby import licences for the cloth in question are issued against orders placed for Irish-made cloth, the insistence by the sole Irish manufacturing company that orders should be placed only with one agent put that agent in a monopoly position in that all orders had to be channelled through him.  I have since made inquiries of the manufacturing company and the company concerned have informed my Department that, in fact, there is no obligation on any trader to place orders through their agents.  They are quite willing to accept orders direct and quite a number of orders are placed with the company direct by traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in fact, as a result of personal inquiry from one of the oldest and biggest Cork traders, in that connection ascertained that that Cork trader places orders direct with the manufacturing <Col N="1692" /> company.  There have, of course, been instances when the firm refused to accept orders direct where they were not satisfied with the credit standing of the traders concerned, but the same criterion of creditworthiness is applied by the firm to all orders, whether received direct or through the agent.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps at this stage explain for the benefit of the House the system which operates whereby duty-free import licences are issued, particularly in the textile trade.  Where there is an import duty in operation in relation to a particular textile and in the event that the manufacturing output of that textile does not meet fully the home market or where it is desirable to make available a sufficient variety to the home trader, duty free import licences are issued on a certain ratio.</P>
    <P>Let us take, for example, a ratio of one to five.  That example does not apply to any specific case.  If a trader proves to the Department that he has, in fact, ordered one yard of a particular cloth from a home manufacturer, he is entitled to a duty-free licence to import five yards of foreign cloth.  Lest there should be any misunderstanding, I should like to stress that while orders may be passed through the company's agent for Irish cloths, import licences are issued only against confirmation of orders issued by the company direct to the traders concerned.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that the existence of the agent involved an additional and unnecessarily large item of cost for traders buying cloth.  The position is that the company's factory is located in a provincial town and if it had not an agent in Dublin, where the bulk of the market for its product is located, it would have to maintain its own separate sales organisation in Dublin.  It is not a fact, as was suggested during the debate, that the arrangements whereby import facilities are related to orders placed with the Irish firm render a selling organisation unnecessary.  This part of the textile trade, more than some of the sectors in that trade, is <Col N="1693" /> one in which design, fashion trends, etc., are of importance and a proper sales organisation, including travellers, is of importance to the customers. The view expressed that a sales organisation is not required is certainly one which would not be endorsed by the customers of the firm.</P>
    <P>Complaints have, in fact, been made by traders in the textile business from time to time that a shortcoming of certain industrialists is that they rely too much on protection as a means of selling their goods and do not provide adequate service in this respect for their customers.  In the present instance the company concerned gave careful consideration to the question of how best to provide the necessary sales service for their customers.  For a period they operated their own sales office in Dublin, but later decided that the most economic method of providing the necessary sales service was to appoint a sole representative in Dublin who had previous experience of the trade concerned and who would provide the necessary accommodation, office staff, travellers, etc.</P>
    <P>The reason one agent, rather than a number of agents, was appointed is again a matter of cost.  A number of agents would have led to duplication of effort and expenditure with consequential higher prices for the firm's product.  It is quite a normal feature in the textile business to operate on a sole agency basis.  The company have indicated that they are quite satisfied that the remuneration which the agent receives for his services, which include the provision of office accommodation, office staff and travellers, is moderate having regard to the nature of the services provided and that it is the least costly way in which these services could be obtained.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, I think it is clear that there is no basis for the allegation made that the selling arrangements of the firm have created a monopoly.  It is a matter for regret that those allegations should have been made, as the only effect has been <Col N="1694" /> to create difficulty for the Irish firm which is at present in a state of development and which is giving substantial employment in a provincial area. I might add that the particular cloth that the Deputies had in mind is one in respect of which the import duty was put on in 1958 and it was confirmed in the last imposition of Duties Act, not in the present Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister has the most brazen neck of anybody I have heard.  He comes in here and says it is a pity the allegation was made. This allegation was made by the most discreet method possible, and it was the Minister's incompetence which was responsible&mdash;if there is anything to be responsible about.  When this matter came up on the Second Reading, I did not mention names.  I could have mentioned names.  I could have mentioned other names as well as the names of factories and the names of persons.  I did not choose to deal with it on the matter of personalities.  I chose to deal with it on the matter of principle.  As soon as the Second Reading finished, I gave the Minister the name.  For a week he did nothing.  For a week he took no steps whatsoever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Instead, he chose to come into this House on the Committee Stage without having got the information that it was his duty, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to get.  If he had not been able to get it at the time, it was his duty not to ask that the Committee Stage of the Bill be ordered for that day.  Having incompetently failed to acquaint himself sufficiently of the facts to advise the House, during the course of the debate he proceeded to say exactly the opposite of what he has said to-day. During the debate last week he said there was only one agent and that it was necessary to buy through him. Now he comes in here and reverses what he said last week.</P>

      <P>Regardless of whether the Minister did or did not, it was his duty to have himself adequately and properly informed before he put this Bill down for Committee Stage.  He neglected to fulfil his duty.  He has now come in and made a statement on certain facts which I shall have an opportunity of verifying between now and to-morrow. I do not quarrel with him on that, but I do quarrel with him on his brazen audacity in not getting informed for the Committee Stage.  It is a disrespect, not to me, but to the House that he failed to get that information and then complains that other people were forced by lack of candour, lack of information, to endeavour to extract information in public that should be extracted in another way.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not know how lucky he was that in dealing with people in Opposition who knew certain facts, as Deputy Dillon and I knew them, we kept our arguments on principle, to a much greater extent than Fianna Fáil, had they been on this side of the House, would have done.

As far as the allegations made against this firm are concerned, I hope he will accept now that they have been adequately answered.

      <P>There appears to be some misunderstanding on the issue joined.  I understood the Minister to say last week that it was so, that there was an exclusive agency for the sale of the cloth and it was through that agent that the cloth had to be bought. The Minister says to-day that anybody who wants to buy the cloth can buy it direct from the factory.  I have not got the Official Report before me but I have no doubt, if the Minister says he <Col N="1697" /> said that last week, he believes he said it.  However, I should like the opportunity of checking the proceedings because I certainly believed that position did not exist, and that persons who had to buy this domestic cloth in order to qualify for a duty-free licence, were required to buy it through a named agent, and I thought that introduced an impropriety in consideration of the regulations made by the Minister under the Imposition of Duties Act.  I think it would be better, from every point of view, if we could postpone the Fifth Stage until to-morrow, when I believe, without protracted debate or unseemly delay, the Minister will be facilitated to dispose of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The only complaint made from here is this: if there was a sole agent through whom all orders had to pass, we regard that as an abuse.  If the firm said: &ldquo;We have only one agent and if you want to order through an agent, you must order through him, but, if you prefer to order direct, you are quite free to do so&rdquo;, then I do not think any serious abuse existed.  My information is that that option at one time did not exist. I have no doubt it exists now because the publicity has produced the desired result.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister is concealing something from us; I am suggesting that it is possible that something is being concealed from the Minister.  I believe an abuse did exist. I believe that if this discussion has served to terminate that abuse, a useful purpose has been served and I think we have a reasonable guarantee that if this abuse has had to be terminated as a result of this discussion in Dáil Éireann, its like will not be attempted by anybody else.  But, I suggest to the Minister that he should keep his eyes peeled and inquire from some other of his friends in the trade &mdash;in the trade&mdash;and he may find that the reassurance he has received&mdash;no doubt in good faith&mdash;from his own advisers may not be as exhaustive as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely difficult for the Minister's Department to uncover abuses of this kind because whose interest is it, if they are in the trade and looking for a licence from the trade, to come forward and make a complaint of this character?  Very often, they have only to buy one yard of domestic cloth in order to qualify for imports of five yards.  It is very often that for general peace and comfort, they suffer in silence rather than kick up a row and it may be difficult for the Minister in his official capacity to get the kind of information he requires; it may be doubly difficult for his technical advisers to get it.  I suggest to him that he make further and better inquiries in the trade and he may find that abuse which is now no longer operating did operate at one <Col N="1700" /> stage and will see to it that it will not be allowed to operate in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>But there are two types of fabrics concerned.  In the one case only the firm which sells its output through an agent makes the one type and in the case of the other type of fabric all three make it.</P>
      <P>The Official Report is as follows:</P>
      <P>Mr. Sweetman: But there is one type which the agent-firm alone makes?</P>
      <P>Mr. J. Lynch: That is right.  I have just said that.</P>
      <P>Then we go on to column 1221:</P>
      <P>Mr. J. Lynch: ...I am accepting entirely&mdash;it has been confirmed by my own inquiries&mdash;that the complaint made by Deputy Sweetman last week was true,...</P>
      <P>Then the Minister really has the nerve to come in and read us a sermon.  I do not mind the Minister finding that he was wrong and that I was wrong. That is quite within the bounds of possibility.  But, I am damned if I will accept a sermon from the Minister when he has all the resources of his Department available to make certain that he is right and we in Opposition necessarily have to depend on such rather tenuous inquiries as, inevitably, in Opposition, one is able to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may also suggest to the Minister <Col N="1701" /> that I think he will remember that I asked him when I saw him after the Second Reading to let me know if persons who wanted to buy the fabric I mentioned to him could buy it from anyone except from one named agent.  The people who approached me would be very glad to know of the names.  Might I suggest that if, before coming in and sermonising us, the Minister had examined his own conscience to see if he had got done what he was asked to do discreetly before the order for Committee Stage, it would have been a great deal wiser?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Agreement concluded between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United States of America by Exchange of Notes at Dublin on the 24th March, 1960, concerning the acquisition of certain nuclear research and training equipment and materials, a copy of which Agreement was laid on the Table of Dáil Éireann on the 25th March, 1960.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, an Agreement for cooperation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United States of America concerning the peaceful uses of atomic energy was signed at Washington on 16th March, 1956, and entered into force on 9th July, 1958. The text of the Agreement was laid on the table of the House (Pr. 3686).</P>
      <P>This Agreement was made as a result of proposals emanating from the Government of the United States which assumed that the Irish Government would wish to pursue, in common with other Governments, an atomic research and development programme of its own, having for its object the peaceful and humanitarian uses of atomic energy, and would therefore for this purpose desire to obtain assistance from the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Animated by the spirit of that Agreement, the United States Government some time ago intimated to the Irish Government that they were preparing a programme to assist friendly governments to procure atomic energy equipment, other than reactors, for peaceful purposes and would be prepared to consider a request from the <Col N="1703" /> Government of Ireland for financial assistance in obtaining such equipment. This generous offer was gladly accepted, and following consultations with the University Colleges, a formal request listing our requirements was addressed to the United States Government. As a result, the Agreement which is the subject of this motion was concluded by Exchange of Notes at Dublin on 24th March, 1960.</P>
    <P>Under the American programme, the assistance offered is available for a specified integrated and largely self-sufficient assortment of equipment termed &ldquo;package laboratory&rdquo; intended for use in nuclear training and research and to supplement existing nuclear research and training.</P>
    <P>It is a principal condition of the grant that the Irish Government should undertake to meet the expenses of transporting the equipment from the U.S.A. to the recipient laboratory, to insure the equipment while in transit, to instal and operate the equipment in the recipient laboratories, to indemnify the U.S. Government against all liabilities that might arise in the course of its operation, and to provide the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission with copies of all technical publications deriving from the use of the equipment.</P>
    <P>The four University Colleges were consulted as to their needs in the matter and, in response, University College, Dublin; Trinity College, Dublin, and University College, Cork, have applied for equipment valued at approximately £13,000, £24,000 and £70,000, respectively, to meet a variety of graduate and under-graduate requirements of training and research in agriculture, physics, chemistry, medicine, engineering, biology and biochemistry.</P>
    <P>The Colleges have agreed to meet the expenses of installing and operating the equipment, and of its insurance, so that the U.S. Government and all who may be concerned will be fully indemnified against any loss or damage arising from its use.  They have also agreed to supply the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission with copies of all technical publications deriving from its use.  Thus the only <Col N="1704" /> financial commitment directly involved for the Government is the cost of transport and insurance while in transit. It is estimated that this may amount to about £5,000.  The Government propose that this amount be met out of the Grant Counterpart Reserve Fund.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to obtain the approval of Dáil Éireann for the implementation of the Agreement, and I am sure that Deputies will agree that it is desirable that the three Colleges mentioned should be enabled to acquire this equipment.  There is no need to underline the importance in this atomic age of training and research in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Those countries that can do so are today exploring the uses of atomic energy to see how this energy can be used for the material progress and well-being of their peoples.  It is essential that our students should not be denied the possibility of familiarising themselves with practical developments in this field.</P>
    <P>We have, as the Dáil is aware, some very eminent scientists who have distinguished themselves in the realm of nuclear physics, including Professor E.T.S. Walton, who, with Sir John Cockroft, obtained the Nobel Prize for their achievement in being the first to split the atom by artificial means.  It is of the highest national importance to provide the requisite training facilities for our young scientists who will, one day, when the peaceful uses of atomic energy are much more widespread than they are at present, be called upon to apply this knowledge to agriculture, industry, science and medicine.</P>
    <P>The very generous offer of the American Government which is embodied in the Agreement before the House enables us to take a big step now in preparing ourselves for the future.  The Government are deeply appreciative of the friendly sentiments that inspired the American authorities in making this offer.  I am sure that I am expressing the sentiments of all members of the Dáil when I say that we are deeply grateful to the American Government for their generosity and <Col N="1705" /> trust that the results of this Agreement will be mutually beneficial to our two peoples.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House wish to support this motion and to join with the Minister in expressing our gratitude to the Government of the United States for their generosity in this regard.  As the Minister has pointed out, the result of the action of the American Government is that our Universities will get equipment and materials to the value of over £100,000 which will enable students and research workers to work on nuclear energy and its development.</P>
      <P>This is not the time or the place to discuss the future of nuclear energy, but there can be no doubt that it is important for us to keep abreast of the developments in that field.  We are very fortunate in the people we have working in this field whose experience and knowledge can be of practical assistance to us, and with this generous grant which is to be made available to us now, that experience and knowledge can be applied in a practical way.  For the reasons which are so obvious to us all, this Agreement must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Although this is not the time to discuss the future of nuclear energy, it would be advisable if the Government did, in the near future, make known what their long-term proposals are in this regard.  The energy requirements of this country are not, perhaps, under the Minister's auspices but on this motion it is desirable that the Government should express their views on the future development of nuclear energy and as to how this development is to take place.  I am sure the House will welcome this generous grant, a grant which will bring benefit to our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We should appreciate the magnitude of this grant in its value to the nation and to our Universities.  Very recently, we were discussing the question of the technical equipment of our Universities incidental to the debate on University College, Dublin, and the fact that one of the big problems for a modern University was, first, to train graduates <Col N="1706" /> to be graduates in the subjects the Minister quoted, and secondly, to train graduates in post-graduate research. The magnitude of that task is formidable for a country such as ours.  On the question of equipment alone, there is the double problem of its cost, its availability and location and for coming to our aid in this matter, I think we can join with the Minister in expressing our appreciation of the generosity of the American people as once again manifested here.</P>
      <P>This is not merely a question of nuclear energy.  There is a certain danger because of the reference to nuclear energy and to nuclear physics generally that a person outside will get the idea that this is a question of big reactors and of immediately going into the advanced realms of nuclear research and nuclear power production. I do not think that is directly at issue; I do not think there is anything more remote for us.  There are people who will say&mdash;and, perhaps, with a certain amount of justification&mdash;that we cannot compete with big organised research undertakings in regard to nuclear power development.  Therefore, I think it is only right to point out that much of this equipment that will now be available has other uses.  It is essential equipment for the training of a graduate in general physics, but in its research potentialities, it has a much wider range of usefulness than mere power production or anything narrowly associated with the development of nuclear energy.  In fact, it is hard to visualise a limitation on the lines of research which can benefit from the equipment which it is proposed to acquire under this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This equipment can be applied to research in practically any of the aspects mentioned by the Minister. In particular, for instance, it can be applied&mdash;some of the instrumentation and perhaps the facilities it entails, isotopes and so on&mdash;in biology.  There is a very wide field covered by this arrangement and one which it is essential should be provided for in our Universities.  The Minister mentioned one very distinguished physicist; in the biological line, we have in this country also, a scientist of international <Col N="1707" /> renown, Professor E. J. Conway.</P>
    <P>At first sight, one would think that biochemistry and such subjects are far away from the nuclear field and some might be found who would say that biochemistry in agriculture is much nearer our requirements than nuclear energy.  We should, therefore, advert to the fact that the equipment that will now become available to our University Colleges will not only help them generally to fulfil their function as training schools for specialists in all the lines the Minister has mentioned, but will also make equipment and methods available to our research schools on the widest possible basis, from which this country is bound to reap substantial benefit in the future. But even if we were not to look forward to benefits from research, the mere fact that this arrangement is something that will enable us to maintain our University standards, both in the training of undergraduates and post-graduate training of graduates in research, gives it an importance that cannot be over-emphasised and it is right, therefore, that it should not go without the warmest commendation from this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I should like to support the Minister's motion.  Our specialists will now have such equipment to carry out any further research they feel is necessary and also for the training of students and the furtherance of nuclear energy projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of nuclear energy is becoming clearer each year.  It is quite true that as a small country we must take rather a back seat at present, but as time goes on it will become necessary, when this great boon to mankind, nuclear energy, is turned to peaceful pursuits and concentrated on increased production in the industrial and agricultural field, to have our students educated to handle the problems that will arise. It is with pleasure that we realise that through the generosity of the United States Government the opportunity of taking this project a step further has now been given to <Col N="1708" /> us and I join with the Minister in expressing our appreciation of this generous American action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the various Deputies who spoke in support of this motion.  I knew that they would join with me in welcoming this magnificent gift from the American Government.  I should like to emphasise what Deputy de Valera said &mdash;that this equipment is not meant for power production.  The equipment will be used for general nuclear research and training for peaceful purposes. Atomic energy, while disastrous when used in connection with weapons of war, is one of the best tools man has ever possessed.  It is some time since I read a list of the uses of atomic energy, and the processes in which it may be used, such as producing radio isotopes and material of that kind.  Already, it has been found effective in solving certain agricultural problems in regard to fertilisers.  There are also many uses for it in medicine and in general physics and, in biochemistry, its uses are almost unlimited.</P>
      <P>Again, I should like to express thanks for the manner in which this motion has been received and to say that I hope the scientists in our Universities teaching our students will make good use of the resources now put at their disposal and that the result of their work and research will redound not only to the benefit of our own people but also to the benefit, in some way, of the American people.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(1)  A member of the Authority who, on becoming a member, has any financial interest in any company or concern which has sought or seeks to make or with which the Authority has proposed or proposes to make any contract or financial arrangement shall, immediately on becoming a member, divest himself of such interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point, when the debate adjourned, that it seems somehow wrong that the Government should be beholden to any individual, no matter how talented or gifted, for the success of this service. It seems wrong that on his participation in this organisation should depend the success, or otherwise, of the undertaking. It would appear as if the Government is handing over a great deal of its powers.  As the Minister has said, this is a service which will make a very deep impression from the point of view of entertainment and education.  It is rather unwise then that the Government should be so completely dependent on this individual and I do not think they should feel they are dependent to that degree.</P>
      <P>In passing, may I say that I think it is very wrong that in two successive weeks here we should be discussing very important propositions without any power of altering decisions taken? One was the Supplementary Estimate for a sum of £7,000,000 for the building of a new University, and now we have this proposition in which a sum of £2,000,000 is involved.  As Deputy Carty has said, we come in here and find ourselves presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  It is very wrong that this Assembly should be deprived of the right of counter decision after discussion and debate here.  In these two instances that I have cited, decisions were taken in advance of discussion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the individual concerned has given an assurance that he will not allow his business interests to interfere and he would resign should there be any danger of that.  The Minister then went on to say that the Government could take a decision.  In fairness to the proposed Chairman, I do not think there are any circumstances in which the Government could legally insist on the Chairman resigning because one cannot have gradations of responsibility to the Authority and gradations of responsibility to one's business interests.  A person has <Col N="1712" /> either no responsibility or he has some responsibility.  The Government has made no attempt to define the borderline between the Chairman's personal and private responsibilities and his public responsibilities.  The Minister is under an illusion if he thinks the Government could legally go to the Chairman at any time and say to him: &ldquo;You are allowing your private and personal responsibilities to interfere with your responsibility to the Government.&rdquo; The Minister, therefore, cannot depend on that way out of his dilemma.</P>
    <P>We might get a Chairman who was very authoritarian and who might infringe on the bounds of propriety in exercising his dual capacity as a businessman with access to decisions relating to questions of contracts coming before the Authority.  Even though the Minister has two precedents in relation to electricity and transport, there is no doubt at all but that the more desirable precedent is the 1927 one in relation to electricity.  Just because the Government departed from that in 1950, the Minister should not feel justified in doing so now in 1960.  I do not think the Minister has made a good enough case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 was not, as I have already pointed out, put into this Bill to meet the case of any particular individual.  It is of general application to each member of the Authority.  Writing in further restrictive clauses will not ensure a better Authority or a higher standard.  I do not think there is any departure in principle in this section as compared with similar sections in other Acts. Practice and usage are more effective in obtaining high standards than anything that can be written into legislation. The 1927 Act was the first Act under which a public authority was set up to undertake a public service. At that time, the State was young, speaking from a purely parliamentary point of view.  Speaking from the point of view of having a Parliament in which legislation could be passed, the country was very young.  As Deputies have said, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since the time of which we are speaking, 1927, and <Col N="1713" /> this country is growing up.  We are becoming more mature in our attitude towards Parliament, towards public authorities and towards public administration.  Our country stands high in that regard.</P>
      <P>I cannot see anything in Section 8 which would interfere in any way with the statutory progress this country is making in that regard.  I think the amendments would not improve the position one iota and I hope the sponsors of the amendments will see fit to have them withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not yield to the appalling temptation the Minister has put before me to compare 1927 with 1960.  It would be somewhat extraneous to our discussion, but it is a very great temptation, after hearing those few remarks from the Minister.</P>
      <P>Let us be quite clear about this section.  I want to make it clear again that it was the Government, in their wisdom, who decided that we had to discuss this section in the context that it was known that a particular individual would be Chairman of the Authority.  Let me say again that I do not know him at all, except in so far as I see him on a screen.  I have nothing but respect for what I see, but it does not seem to be at all relevant, at all necessary, or even at all desirable, that an actor or a producer should be the administrative chief of the television Authority.</P>
      <P>In fact, in relation to such an Authority as this or any similar body, the less technical the man you have as Chairman, the better.  The difficulty about a technical man is that he is not able to see the wood for the trees.  The difficulty about a person who is so wrapped up in one aspect of a certain job is that he cannot see the broad lines of general policy.  If there is one quality necessary for the chairman of any board, it is that he should be able to see the broad lines of general policy which the board should follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There might be, and in fact I think there is, a case for ascertaining that the chairman of any board is not a technician.  The board of any authority such as this, of any statutory company, <Col N="1714" /> or any State board, is able to get, and must be made able to get, the best technical advice available, and it is on the application of that technical advice on the administration of the service as a whole that the selection should be made, rather than on technical qualifications as such.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that when one says that the person concerned is not the best person to be Chairman, one necessarily means it in that sense, and not in the sense of any personal reflection on the person concerned as a producer or as an actor.  To be quite fair, I think the Minister understands that that is the case being made, and that it has no relation to a personality, as such.</P>
    <P>The Minister based part of his defence on the fact that the Electricity Supply Act was the first Act to set up a public authority in the country.  That is true.  It is perfectly true, but how many amendments have there been to the original Electricity Supply Act? We have had them down through the years.  I have not counted them, but there have been a good many.  Probably if we were to go through them, we would find, quite apart from mere Finance Acts affecting electricity, that there have been at least six amending Acts in relation to the main powers of the original Electricity Supply Board. If it were a mistake to include that provision in 1927, as the Minister now suggests, it would have been amended long since.  I do not think any Minister of any Government would dare to come in here and delete Section 11 of that Act because he would know that its deletion would be resented by all sections and all parts of the House. The fact that it has stood unamended completely disproves the argument the Minister has made.</P>
    <P>We have not perhaps adverted, either, as much as we should to paragraph 69 of the Majority Report which makes it clear that the Commission did not wish the members of the Authority to have financial contact with the Authority as such.  In paragraph 69, we read: &ldquo;...should have no such financial or other interest as would be likely to affect prejudicially....&rdquo; The Report then went on to say that a member of the <Col N="1715" /> Oireachtas should not be a member of the Authority.  My view is that a member of the Oireachtas probably should not be a member of the Authority, but I think that it was very impertinent of the Commission to say so.  This House should be the place to decide that, and nobody else.</P>
    <P>Is it not peculiar that the Minister has chosen to take the disqualification of membership of this House out of the Commission's Report, and has disregarded the other recommendation that persons should not have the interests to which I have referred?  It seems, shall I say, rather strange that he has adopted one part of the recommendation and rejected the other.</P>
    <P>The fundamental basis in relation to this matter is that it is impossible &mdash;and I use the word deliberately&mdash; for a person whose full ordinary business is broadcasting, to have contractual relationships with the Authority and to preserve outside the Authority the air, the atmosphere, of impartiality which is so vital to the success of this Authority.  I think the Minister will come this distance with me, that it is essential, not merely that this Authority should be successful, but that it should enjoy the confidence of the people.  I do not think it is possible for a board, the members of which, day in and day out, make contracts with the Authority itself, to enjoy that confidence.</P>
    <P>I am not making any suggestion that the contracts will be arranged on an improper basis.  I am suggesting that the public will inevitably believe that they are on an improper basis even though they may be on the most proper basis under the sun.  It is inevitable that anybody whose programme is turned down in favour of a programme put up by the company of which the Chairman is also a director will feel and say that he was turned down because the Chairman had more influence with the Director-General.  That is a most unfair handicap to give this Authority when it starts.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be very wise indeed to think twice on this matter <Col N="1716" /> and to ensure that the Authority is not put under that heavy penalty at the beginning of its work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In a Bill of this kind which is introduced to set up a State or semi-State body, as far as I can remember the inevitable practice has been that the legislation determines the personnel of the board.  It seems that in this case it is the personnel of the board to be appointed who are determining the legislation that is brought before the House and that the Minister hopes will finally be enacted.</P>
      <P>I support the idea embodied in Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment and I would be prepared to support Deputy Palmer's amendment.  I do not want to go over the ground that has been covered here this evening about the undesirability of having people on the board who have a vested interest in the business generally.  I sympathise with the Minister in what he is trying to do.  I know he has to put up certain arguments in justification of Section 8 and against the amendments.</P>
      <P>The Minister wants to get a certain man on this Television Authority and wants him to be Chairman.  I want to see that man connected with Irish Television, as well.  Apart from his ability as a performer on television, apart from his ability generally as far as television is concerned, I think everybody regards him as a very good Irishman.  It is undesirable that the Chairman of a board of this kind should have any contractual interest or any other business interest in Irish Television.  However, if the Minister wants this man&mdash;I think all of us agree that he should have some connection with Irish television&mdash; could he not be employed in some other capacity?  Could he not be employed as an adviser&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We should not create a precedent which will be quoted by this Minister in a few months' time and by that Minister in two years' time and by Ministers of other Governments for the next 50 or 100 years.  It is a very undesirable practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister ought to consider the idea not of having this particular man <Col N="1718" /> as Chairman of the Television Authority but of employing him in some other capacity, say, in an advisory or consultative capacity.  Being the man he is, I am sure he will be prepared to participate in that way in the establishment of Irish television.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 38, to delete &ldquo;contributory&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My sole purpose in putting down this amendment is to restore to the Authority, and indeed to the Minister himself, a discretionary power of which the Bill, as drafted, deprives him. Under Section 15, provision is made for the establishment of a superannuation scheme &ldquo;for the granting of pensions, gratuities and other allowances on retirement to or in respect of such officers or servants of the Authority as it may think fit.&rdquo;  In other words, the Bill requires the Authority <Col N="1722" /> to submit for approval a contributory scheme.  I am informed by experts in these matters that when a superannuation scheme comes to be drafted, in certain conditions, a contributory scheme is the best and in others, a non-contributory scheme; but that is a matter on which expert advice is available and might with advantage be taken by this Authority.</P>
    <P>There is provision in subsection (4) of the same section that no scheme can be put into operation until it has been submitted to the Minister and has been approved by the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  I suggest that if the Minister and the Minister for Finance, having heard the merits of the case argued before them, come to the conclusion that the contributory scheme is the right one, they can require that to be enforced.  But I do not think they ought to close their minds at this stage on this question and it is purely for the purpose of leaving them that discretion that I move the deletion of the word &ldquo;contributory&rdquo; from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in this Bill that any superannuation scheme submitted by the Authority should be on a contributory basis is a carefully considered one.  The superannuation schemes adopted by most existing semi-State bodies are contributory and it is desirable on general grounds that that should be so.  But in the present case there is liable to be a certain amount of movement of staff, particularly programme staff, to and from other organisations with contributory schemes, and any person who leaves the service of the Authority without a pension or gratuity will normally have his contributions repaid to him.  No repayment of that kind would be possible under a non-contributory scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week, I informed the House that I had hoped for an agreed contributory scheme.  Since then, I am glad to say that agreement has been reached, through the Civil Service conciliation machinery, with the staffs concerned for the provision of a contributory pension scheme for existing Radio Éireann staffs.  The discussions which led to the agreement have been <Col N="1723" /> rather protracted.  In view of the delay which has occurred, I think I should take the responsibility of prescribing the provisions of the scheme which will be applicable to the existing officers. For that purpose, I have tabled an amendment to subsection (4) of this section.  Retrospective applications will arise out of the delay to which I have referred and will provide against hardship in certain cases.  Pensionable civil servants who transfer from the existing Radio Éireann service to the service of the Authority will carry their pension entitlement with them.  As these officers will constitute a minority of the staff concerned, it is better to deal with them specially rather than have both contributory and non-contributory classes in the one organisation.  I trust that, in the light of this information, the Deputy will agree to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is misunderstanding my amendment.  I think he regards my amendment as directed to the merits of a contributory or a non-contributory scheme.  It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>But we have a scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know; I do not want to argue that with the Minister.  All I am trying to do is to put into the Minister's hands the full discretion to determine, not only now but always, whether the scheme shall be contributory or non-contributory.  I do not profess to be capable of arguing the merits of one system or the other. However, long experience has taught me this.  You bring in a Bill here and you tie your hands to a contributory scheme.  In 15 or 20 years' time, you would gladly substitute for that a non-contributory scheme, but you find to do that you would have to bring in amending legislation and it does not get done. Whereas, if there is no mandatory duty on the Minister to insist on a contributory scheme, he has a wide discretion to adopt any scheme which in the circumstances is most acceptable in the situation obtaining for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To tell the truth, it is not a matter <Col N="1724" /> of vital importance one way or the other, but, mark you, I think it is a useful thing to give the Minister occasionally some gambits he can afford to give away to show that the process of debate and discussion in this House has some value.  Nothing more harmless by way of amendment could conceivably be put upon the Order Paper of this House than this amendment.  It is designed solely to give the Minister greater flexibility and I would recommend, as a mighty indication of the Minister's growth in stature as a Minister of the Irish Republic, that he should rise up and tell his advisers: &ldquo;To hell with your brief.  I am going to accept this amendment.&rdquo; If he did it once, it would be like a draught of oxygen to him, making him strong as a giant drenched in wine; but to reject this amendment is to reject commonsense, reason and everything else.  The only conceivable effect of this amendment is to leave the Minister with the fullest power to do what he intends to do.  Why on earth he will not accept it is a mystery to me.</P>

The image on a television screen is built up by a great many lines and, when we talk of 405 lines, that means that the picture is sent out by 405 lines within a certain ambit.  What that ambit is, I do not know.  The next line standard is 625 lines and that means that there are half as many lines again in the picture transmitted by it and, therefore, presumably the picture is a little clearer.  On this issue, let me be quite clear that I agree entirely and completely with the decision the Minister has made in choosing the 405 line standard rather than the 625 standard, for the reasons he has given.  However, he said something the other day which I did not understand and I want to elicit from him what he meant.</P>
      <P>There is a third system and I think the arguments we have in favour of the 405 line standard are probably equally good, technically, against this third system but I should like to be informed of that.  It is the French system of 819 lines and I have heard it said&mdash;but I should like the Minister to give me the benefit of the technical advice he got&mdash;that one can get 819 transmissions on a 405 receiving set, but that 625 transmissions cannot be received on such a set.  I do not know whether that is correct or not but it seems to me that, if one can get 819 transmissions on a 405 receiving set, then because there are more lines, one could get a clearer picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am not a technician and I know nothing about the technicalities of this.  I suppose the Minister himself does not know much about them and has to rely on the advice he gets, but if my advice is correct, I do not understand why the Minister, on Second Reading, said we did not consider the 819 line system at all.  I should like him to explain why it was not considered. The 625 line system is in use in parts of Europe that are further away from <Col N="1727" /> us than France, where the 819 line system is operated, and apart from Great Britain, France is the most contiguous television broadcasting country to us.  I do not understand why we did not consider the French line transmission though we did consider that of Belgium, Germany, and Italy, which are farther away from us. To me, that does not seem to make sense.  As I say, I agree entirely with the Minister in his decision to choose the 405 line standard instead of the 625 line standard but I do not understand why the 819 line transmission system was not considered.</P>

      <P>Any more than Deputy Sweetman, I am not a technician and I do not pretend to be one.  This question of a line system is very perplexing, though very interesting when one comes to study the matter with a completely fresh mind. One can make due allowance for people outside the House&mdash;I am not referring to Deputy Sweetman&mdash;who give advice freely in the newspapers and elsewhere on the line system to be adopted, and that was one of the reasons which prompted the Government to set up the advisory committee, so that there would be no mistake made in the type of equipment we would purchase for our station.</P>
      <P>I am given to understand that it is very doubtful that one can receive 819 transmissions on a 405 line receiver, and the principal objection to the 819 line system is that it requires nearly double the frequency space of a 405 line standard system. Furthermore, at the international convention in Copenhagen in 1952, we accepted the 405 line standard.  We thereby committed ourselves to 405 line transmissions and to adopt any other line standard now would mean a great deal of interference with our neighbours, and would also add to the expense of establishing a television service.  I went into this matter very fully, I think, on Second Reading.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me put it quite clearly to him that the information available in relation to that Convention was available to me when I was in office but I do not think that is the full story at all.  The interpretation of these conventions is now a very tricky matter of international law.  The usage that has grown up on those interpretations are matters that must also be considered, and the interpretation that we here genuinely and honestly believed in immediately after the Copenhagen Convention, is not necessarily the correct interpretation at the present time. I do not think it matters very much in relation to this issue now but, as the Minister has mentioned that convention, I want to go on record for the future as saying that I do not accept the indications that he has given as to what those conventions meant and I do not think the viewpoint that he has given, quite <i>bona fide</i>, is the correct viewpoint, and, if it became necessary to consider at a later stage the functions of the Television Authority and the manner in which they should operate, I would ask the Minister to have, very carefully indeed, a new look taken at what <Col N="1729" /> has heretofore been the accepted interpretation of the conventions&mdash; Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Buenos Aires.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (5) and substitute the following subsections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) (a) In acting pursuant to this section, the Authority shall have regard to the special position of Irish advertisers and may fix <Col N="1730" /> reduced charges and preferential conditions for advertisements from them which are Irish advertisements.</P>
    <P>(b)  For the purposes of the foregoing paragraph, each of the following advertisers shall be an Irish advertiser:</P>
    <P>(i)  an advertiser who advertises articles, being articles with respect to which he satisfies the Authority that they are made, produced or manufactured wholly or substantially within the State,</P>
    <P>(ii)  an advertiser who advertises services, provided that he satisfies the Authority either that the services are provided wholly or substantially within the State or that his sole or principal place of business as a person providing those services is situate within the State,</P>
    <P>(iii)  an advertiser who advertises activities other than services, being activities with respect to which he satisfies the Authority that they are conducted wholly or substantially within the State,</P>
    <P>and an advertisement by reference to which an advertiser is an Irish advertiser shall be an Irish advertisement.</P>
    <P>(6)  Charges and conditions referred to in subsection (1) or subsection (5) of this section may be fixed subject to variations benefiting advertisers who use the Irish language in their advertisements.</P>
    <P>(7)  A power under this section to fix charges and conditions shall be construed as including a power to cancel or vary any charges or conditions fixed under such power and, where charges or conditions are cancelled, to fix other charges or conditions in lieu of those cancelled.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Seanad I gave an undertaking that I would reconsider the section and bring in an amendment to deal with the points raised there by certain Senators.  As it stands, the subsection empowers the Authority specifically to <Col N="1731" /> grant preferential conditions and reduced charges to Irish advertisers and, in addition, to vary such preferences and reductions to benefit such of those advertisers as use the Irish language in their advertisements.  On reconsideration, I feel there is a need to define what is meant by an Irish advertiser and I have come to the conclusion also that the preference for the use of the Irish language should be available to any advertiser and the proposed amendment provides accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were discussing the cost of television on the motion for the Money Resolution the other day, we discussed at some length the comparative cost which is referred to in paragraph 35 of the majority report of the Commission, on the one hand and, on the other hand, the cost as set out in paragraph 23 of the minority report.  I think I somewhat misled the House the other day in that respect.  I was comparing a cost of £600 per hour with a cost of £1,800 per hour, £600 per hour being the cost in relation to the Irish programme; £1,800 per hour&mdash;£1,730 is the exact figure&mdash;being the cost of the B.B.C. programme.  Of course, the comparison, under the Minister's proposals is not anything like as favourable to us as that would be. The cost is £600 per hour for a live programme, £100 per hour for an old canner.  The majority report of the Commission visualises 25 per cent. &ldquo;live&rdquo;.  Take four hours transmission. We shall not take 30 hours per week, because that might create more difficult mathematical sums.  For every four hours transmission, according to paragraph 35 of the majority report of the Commission, one hour will be &ldquo;live&rdquo; and three hours will be canned.  The cost of one hour &ldquo;live&rdquo; is £600 and the cost of three hours canned is £100 apiece, namely, £300.  That makes the cost £225 per hour on an average over the four hours.  We are asked by the Minister to believe that a programme costing that amount of money would be able to compete satisfactorily with a B.B.C. programme which cost, in 1957-58, £1,730 per hour.  We may take it, I am pretty sure, that the figure of £1,730 in 1957-58 is probably very nearly £2,000 now but certainly £1,800, which is the figure I used the other day.  I cannot understand how the Minister thinks he will be able, with a programme costing £225 an hour, to compete with a programme costing £1,800 an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, there will be some programmes that will have a special Irish flavour that we will look at regardless <Col N="1733" /> of their cost.  If a particular football match or if Punchestown Races were being televised and Deputies were kept in the House, as they will be this year by the Budget, Deputies interested could go up and have a look at the television programme.  Apart from items of special interest to Irish viewers I do not know how you will get the average viewing public in Ireland or, to be strictly accurate, in the northern half of the country, which can get reception steadily, day in and day out, both from the B.B.C. and the commercial service to look at the Irish programme.  If you do not get them to look at the Irish programme there seems to be very little chance of getting commercial advertisers to advertise and without the commercial advertisers you will not be able to have any programme at all.  The figures show that the basis upon which the Minister is proceed-is fallacious and contrary to all the arguments we have heard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, in arriving at his conclusions, does not take into consideration the fact that large, wealthy organisations such as the one he has mentioned are charged far more for filmed and tele-recorded programmes than small organisations such as ours will be.  In arriving at a figure per hour for that kind of programme, that fact must be taken into consideration.  That kind of programme material, as far as my advisers and I understand, is freely available at the prices which I have quoted.  Therefore, it follows that the television service here can put forth a programme of a high standard in tele-recorded and filmed material at a reasonable cost.  We will not need to pay as much for that material as the B.B.C. pays for it.  We are also forgetting that a large part of this country is not yet receiving a television service and that a large part of the country will receive our own television service solely when it is operating all over the country.  I feel that the costs per hour I have indicated to the House are the costs at which we shall be in a position to operate our television service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be obvious to the Minister that we are in an age in which the technical possibilities of television and the range of television are being increased almost day by day. The Minister would be very foolish to bank on the fact that, even by the time the Authority is ready to start, the range of television programmes will not have exceeded the present range. It will almost certainly be possible in a very short time to receive television, be it Irish or foreign, at a range at least double what the present range is. I am not a technician but I understand the technicians have to be able to overcome only the difficulty that television waves do not travel in and out following the contour of the earth in the same way as sound radio travels in order to make reception virtually unlimited in distance.  It will be limited always, of course, by the strength of the transmitting signal. However, it is quite illusory for the Minister to base his computation on the fact that large areas in the country will be able to get only our service; indeed, it is also rather offensive for him to say they must take it and that, therefore, it does not matter what you give them.  That is not the right attitude.</P>

      <P>I am not banking on that as an argument at all.  I am banking on the knowledge that we can purchase programme material at a much lower cost than the B.B.C. can purchase their programmes.  They are sold on the basis of the number of viewers. There are 10,000,000 receiving sets in England; we shall not have so many &mdash;120,000.  On that basis tele-recorded and filmed programmes are sold and purchased by broadcasting authorities throughout the world.  We can purchase our programme material at a much lower cost than the B.B.C.  I indicated already that we should approach this problem of costs and expenses with caution and therefore, we must wait and see how this television service proceeds before we can come to a final decision on the number of live programmes that can be used as against the number of tele-recorded and filmed programmes that the Authority can use and still maintain a sound financial position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7.</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), line 52, to delete &ldquo;, subject to the consent of the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is moved in an attempt to remedy what appears to be a major defect in the section.  The section authorises the Minister for the time being &ldquo;to direct the Authority in writing to allocate broadcasting time for any announcements by or on behalf <Col N="1736" /> of any Minister of State in connection with the functions of that Minister of State, and the Authority shall comply with the direction.&rdquo;  That is a power which we view with considerable apprehension but when the section goes on to say in subsection (3):</P>
    <P>The authority may, subject to the consent of the Minister, announce that a direction has been given under this section.</P>
    <P>our anxiety is greatly exacerbated and I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that the section, as at present drafted, may fairly be described as reeking with fraud.  There is no conceivable reason why, if the Minister decided to direct the Authority to allocate broadcasting time for an announcement by or on behalf of the Minister or any other Minister, that the Authority should not have the right to say that they were making the broadcast by the direction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is highly unlikely that this situation should ever arise but it is possible that on some future occasion the Minister might in an arbitrary way use the powers of this section to compel the Authority to publish material which the Authority considered it unnecessary or inappropriate to broadcast, and in that event the Authority ought to have the right to say it is being done by direction of the Minister.  It should have that right because if it does not have it, the fact that the Authority appears to broadcast the material vountarily gives the material broadcast an implied meaning to which it is not entitled.  In short, the Minister may direct the Authority to broadcast what, in the Authority's opinion, is nothing other than pure propaganda but the Minister is getting that power under the section.</P>
    <P>All we ask is that if, on some future occasion some Minister sought to abuse this power by compelling the Authority to broadcast what in the Authority's judgment was no more than propaganda, the Authority would have the right to say: &ldquo;This material is being broadcast by direction of the Minister,&rdquo; naming the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as the true source of the material broadcast.  That puts the <Col N="1737" /> public on notice that they are listening to something other than factual and detached news reporting.  It puts the public on notice that the material to which they are listening, or at which they are looking, has been prescribed for them by a member of the Executive for the time being, but if the Authority is forbidden&mdash;as they can be under subsection (3) of this section&mdash;to fix the public with notice that the material is being broadcast or televised by direction of the Minister, the public may be misled and are being denied information which, in our judgment, they are clearly entitled to.  Therefore, we have moved this amendment to delete the words &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister&rdquo; and the subsection would then read:</P>
    <P>The Authority may announce that a direction has been given under this section.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be a moderate and reasonable proposal and one which I would urge the Minister to accept.</P>

      <P>The intention of the subsection is to ensure that when a direction has been given to the Authority, particularly a direction to refrain from broadcasting a particular programme item, the Authority may not announce that it has received such direction, if, by doing so, it would be likely to defeat the purpose of the direction.  That is the reason why it is in.  The Government will not lightly interfere, of course, with the programming of the Authority, but if, for instance, at a time of tension, they feel the necessity to direct the Authority to refrain from broadcasting some programme which would add to the tension, it will not help if the Authority announces it is doing so in accordance with a Government direction.</P>

      <P>They have, after 25 years.  We have no experience in this matter.  I shall be quite frank with the House and with the Leader of the Opposition on these matters.  The fact is that we are dealing with a new Authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right for Deputy Dillon to intervene like that, but we are dealing with a new form of broadcasting so far as our country is concerned and we feel this authority should be retained in the Act for some time at least.  This measure will be looked at again in five years' time and whoever is here can apply his mind to the particular question, if he wishes to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise the form of his observations? This is the kind of thing that Arthur Balfour used to say, that you cannot trust &ldquo;the dirty Irish&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is.  He used always to argue that, of course, for the highly-civilised residents of Great Britain, these more liberal institutions were permissible but that for &ldquo;the dirty Irish&rdquo; they must have more effective and stricter power to keep them under control.  The Minister himself says that this power, having existed in Britain for many years, has been struck out of the legislation there as being unnecessary or not even permissible, and after it has been removed from the corresponding legislation in Britain, we propose to insert it in our Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to come half-way to meet the Minister.  He says that if the Minister prohibits the broadcasting of <Col N="1739" /> something, he wants to deter the Authority from announcing that fact. Very well: we shall give him that.  All we ask is that if the Minister directs the Authority in writing to allocate time for any announcements by or on behalf of any Minister of State in connection with the functions of that Minister in that event, and only in that event, the Authority shall have the power to say they are broadcasting the material by direction of the Minister. Will the Minister consider for Report an amendment of that restricted application, leaving subsection (1) of the section unaffected?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Deputy should deal with this as he has done.  He referred to our desire to retain this power here as if we would not trust our own people.  That is not so.  The Government are ultimately responsible for the broadcasts by this Authority and the Government must, therefore, retain some power by which they can in time of tension, stress or strain veto the right of the Authority to broadcast.  In so far as the B.B.C. is concerned, they were restricted for 25 years.  Commissions of Inquiry considered this question in Britain.  The last commission&mdash;I am open to correction here&mdash;were thinking of making a recommendation that this power should be maintained.  The provision was withdrawn so far as the B.B.C. was concerned.  It has not been so far as ITV is concerned.  I shall consider the recommendation made by the Leader of the Principal Opposition Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We understand that.  We shall also consider the method of drafting an amendment to meet the situation.</P>
      <P>May I advert now to one aspect to which the Minister did not advert?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> If the situation is that the Authority are not entitled to say as of right&mdash; forget for the moment about subsection (1); I shall meet the Minister completely on subsection (1) and his power of veto&mdash;that they were directed to publish certain material and they are subsequently criticised publicly for such publication, if the Minister agrees to this they will have no recourse open except for the Authority, as a whole, to resign and the Minister will then have on his hands the crisis which, I am sure, he would wish to avoid.  The situation, on the other hand, will be quite simple if the Minister agrees to the amended suggestion now made by Deputy Dillon and which he has promised to consider.  In the event of acceptance of that suggestion the Authority will not have that necessity forced upon them.  If there is criticism they will be able to say that the material was published by direction of the Minister for So-and-So. Responsibility will then be transferred to the responsible Minister.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to tell whether any particular matter had been published by the direction of a Minister without putting down 13 separate questions to each individual Minister because it is &ldquo;any Minister of State&rdquo;.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs might answer for all, but &ldquo;any Minister of State&rdquo; can get the material over, so to speak.  I do not think that would be desirable.  I think the Minister would meet his own difficulty if he agreed to some amendment.</P>
    <P>I accept at once that there is a difficulty in the case he made against publication of the veto because publication of the veto would be just as bad as publication of the material. Up to this there has been sweet reasonableness on this side of the House; there has not been the same reasonableness on the other side of the House.  We hope there will now be a change and the Minister will agree to ensure, in relation to this subsection (2), that where the Authority are forced to publish something they can say they are publishing <Col N="1741" /> the material in question because they are so forced.</P>

      <P>Are the powers taken there following exactly the precedents in relation to normal acquisition, such as the precedents included, for example, in the 1919 Act for the assessment of compensation? The Act is referred to at the end of page 15.  Is the general procedure under that Act to be followed in relation to compulsory acquisition here?  The reason I ask is because I do not quite understand the difference between clause 3 (1) at the end of page 15 and clause 3 (2) at the top of page 16.  In my innocence, I always understood that you either worked under the 1919 Act or under the 1845 Act. It seems to me now that, because of this clause, you can proceed under both.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This measure is intended to curb and reduce the incidence of a disease which not only causes suffering, but also, because of the damage which it does, may lead to grave disorders and prolonged ill-health. The disease in question is dental caries.  It is one of the most prevalent and widespread disabling diseases in the world.  And it is not restricted to any specific age, sex or economic status.  Wheresoever dental surveys have been made, almost everyone has been found to have been affected by it.  The extent to which it is prevalent among our people, and particularly our children, is appalling. Indeed it has been said that it has probably made more inroads among us than among any other people with a similar high standard of living.  It is a disease for which so far no effective and complete cure has been found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scientific investigation into the incidence of dental caries in this country began when my colleague, Deputy Dr. Ryan, then Minister for Health, requested the Medical Research Council of Ireland to undertake a survey &ldquo;to ascertain whether there were significant differences in dental condition amongst school children living in <Col N="1744" /> different areas of the country and whether such differences, if they existed, could be related to differences in the dietary intake of the children&rdquo;. The survey carried out in the latter part of 1952, was based on the Irish National Nutrition Survey which, following discussions that the then Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who happened to be myself, had initiated with the Medical Research Council in 1944, was eventually begun in 1946.</P>
    <P>Incidentally the Report of the Nutrition Survey showed that the average daily calorie intake of our people was 3,105 for the years 1946-48, which was not only the highest in Western Europe but was practically on a par with the average daily intake of the people of the U.S.A.  So far as the average standard of nutrition is concerned, our community continues to hold that high place to-day.  The information obtained by the Nutrition Survey formed the essential basis of the survey into dental conditions, in relation to dietary habits.  For, as the Report on the Dental Caries Survey points out, the Reports on the Nutrition Survery &ldquo;gave a comprehensive picture of dietary habits in this country, and revealed differences in the levels of food intake between the various areas investigated&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The results of the Dental Caries Survey were rather surprising in some respects.  First of all it revealed that it was not possible to associate the incidence of dental decay with the intake of certain foods in the different areas as ascertained by the National Nutrition Survey; and it also showed that the incidence of this decay among children was not significantly different as between one area and another. What it did confirm, beyond doubt, was the correctness of the opinion, held by all those who were competent to speak on the matter, that in this part of Ireland the incidence of dental caries among school children is very high; and that little is done&mdash;and, I would interpolate, in our present situation, with our present methods and resources in money and personnel, little can be done&mdash;to prevent the <Col N="1745" /> disease or arrest its progress among them.</P>
    <P>We are not, I would assure the House, at all unique among communities in that respect.  For instance, Professor P.J. Walsh, Director of the University of Otago Dental School and member of the Medical Research Council of New Zealand, giving evidence on this matter before a Commission of Inquiry in New Zealand, said at paragraph 51:</P>
    <P>New Zealand teeth are decaying faster than the dental profession, even with the aid of the school dental nurses, can cope with them. At the present time we simply cannot recruit and train enough persons to deal with this one disease.</P>
    <P>In substantiation of this view Dr. J. L. Warren, Professor of Conservative Dentistry in the same University made this telling statement at paragraph 52:</P>
    <P>The present system of controlling dental caries in New Zealand is the placement of fillings in teeth as they decay.  This system is wasteful. Firstly, in the absence of good hygiene or good diet, and they are both commonly absent, fillings do not in fact control the incidence of dental caries.  The destruction of the teeth is progressive and complete despite fillings.  Second, only 60 per cent. of the children and adolescents whose teeth are filled at the State's expense continue with treatment when the State relinquishes its responsibility, that is, after the 16th birthday.</P>
    <P>In making our Dental Survey, the experts who conducted it concerned themselves with children in three age-groups. These groups were: (i) children aged between five and six years; (ii) children between the ages of seven and eight; and (iii) children who were between twelve and thirteen years old.  In all, the teeth of some 2,000 in these age groups were examined in the Dublin County Borough and in various other towns and rural areas, more or less typical of each of the four provinces.  A special examination was made of the teeth of children in the Congested Districts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1746" /> It will be seen that the survey was widespread and was, of course, carried out with meticulous care.  Here is what it disclosed, and at this stage I would emphasise that I am concerned to give a broad picture of the conclusions to be drawn from the Survey.  I shall not give statistics to the last decimal or to interpret them with the refinement of a statistician.</P>
    <P>I shall begin with the children whose ages were between five and six years. In their case, and it will be recognised that they were little removed from babyhood, the number of decayed or missing teeth represented 35.7 per cent. of the total number of teeth which they had developed in their teething age. Based on the average for the whole group, the probabilities were that if the teeth of any child in it were examined, it would be likely that he would have had no more than two-thirds of his deciduous, or first teeth, in good and sound condition, a very large part, almost all in fact of the remaining one-third would be decayed, and a relatively very small portion would be altogether missing.</P>
    <P>In the samples of children who were two years older and were between seven and eight years of age, the survey disclosed that, of the number of first teeth which they ought to have had, only 53 per cent. were sound; and of the balance 41 per cent. were decayed and almost 6 per cent. were missing. In the case of the permanent teeth which these children had developed, approximately 25 per cent. were already decayed or missing&mdash;even at that tender age.</P>
    <P>In the case of children whose ages lay between twelve and thirteen some, as might have been expected, still had a few of their first teeth; but of those which might still have remained with them, less than 55 per cent. were there and sound; the rest were decayed or missing.  As for the permanent teeth which they had developed, over 25 per cent. had already been attacked by decay or were missing. Significantly, even in the case of children in this oldest class, whose permanent teeth, once lost, would never be renewed, relatively few had <Col N="1747" /> received conservative treatment and had teeth which had been filled.</P>
    <P>This is the position among the children of the State, as it was exposed to us by the survey.  What the position is among our adolescent and in our adult population I  must leave to your imagination, for we have no comparable research to guide us in respect of them.  But the following extract from page 18 of the Report of the New Zealand Commission on the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies is surely significant:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The incidence of dental decay in males (aged 17 to 23 years) who are performing their compulsory military training has been studied in surveys conducted under the direction of Colonel Fuller.  He has a unique opportunity for observing the effects of previous treatment, and the results of the first survey are given in Table 5.  More recent results of combined clinical and X-ray examinations showed that about 99 per cent. of the recruits had experienced dental decay and that on the average a recruit had 22 decayed, missing, and filled teeth.  Of these 5 were missing, 6 had been filled, and 11 were decayed and needed filling or extraction. The number of untreated teeth in these totals must be regarded as a particularly unfortunate fact.  The mouths of seven to ten per cent. of these recruits were in such a state that it would have been necessary to extract all the remaining teeth before the men would have been fit for service overseas.  In one group of 597 recruits 18 per cent. were already wearing some form of denture and 11 per cent. required the fitting of some form of denture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the light of this experience, I feel that it is not unlikely that among our adolescents and adults the ravages of dental decay are even more deplorable and more widespread than among our children.</P>
    <P>This, in brief outline is the problem <Col N="1748" /> with which I, as Minister for Health, am bound by the responsibilities of my office to deal.  The task is not made easier by the fact that dental caries is so common that the vast majority of people look upon it as a commonplace disease, a disease that attacks everyone and from which everyone must suffer as a matter of course.  In its carly stages, when only a few teeth are attacked by it, what its ultimate consequences may be are seldom fully realised&mdash;certainly not by the child and adolescent on whom it makes its first onslaught.  Very many such, infortunately, are careful to conceal the suffering which it inflicts upon them, preferring to grin and bear it rather than submit themselves to remedical treatment.  And yet, however common and commonplace it may be, dental caries, when one considers its nature and characteristic consequences, is a horrible affliction.  The disease is erosive in its operations, so that it eats into and rots away essential bodily structures.  The New Zealand Commission of Inquiry, describing its ravages, tells us that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dental decay is the invasion and destruction of teeth by microorganisms. Since the infection may spread to the tooth socket and jaw bones, to the soft tissues of the face and neck, and even further afield, dental decay is the cause of other kinds of ill health in certain cases.</P>
    <P>If other disease were to produce the same effects, if on the same wide scale it were to attack and erode our bones, or our limbs, or any bodily tissue, as dental caries does our teeth, would we not strive to make ourselves immune from it, and would we not use all the knowledge that intensive scientific research has made available to us to do so?  Of course we would.  To make the children of the nation in great part immune from the disease, to increase their resistance to it, not only in childhood but in adolescence, and perhaps even in adult life, is the aim of this Bill.  I suggest that on humanitarian grounds alone what is proposed by it should be tried.  If fluoridation is as effective here as it has been elsewhere, our children will be much less prone to <Col N="1749" /> toothache and all its torments; and adolescents and adults will benefit too, even though not to the same marked degree.</P>
    <P>There is another good reason why everything possible should be done to lessen the incidence of dental caries among us.  Apart from the pain and suffering which it involves, the disease is well-known to be the cause, or, if not the sole cause, a contributory cause of illnesses and physical disorders which in many cases result in prolonged and disabling ill-health.  Dental decay, therefore, is not only a virulent source of suffering and mental strain; it is often the root cause of economic hardship and financial loss.</P>
    <P>The problem then arises as to how the disease is to be dealt with.  When we come to consider that question, the first fact we must grasp is that, to the extent to which it has progressed in any individual who has shed all his deciduous or first teeth, dental caries is incurable.  By the skill of the dentist the decay which the disease causes may be arrested, its ravages may be repaired; but the process of decay can never be reversed and a tooth extracted is gone for ever.  Since, therefore, there is no radical cure for dental caries, we must act firmly on the principle that prevention is better than cure.</P>
    <P>When, however, we come to consider individual or personal prophylactic measures, we are immediately up against the difficulty that they all call for qualities of perseverance and discipline in a high degree, certainly to a degree that is seldom found among those who suffer the first onset of dental decay, and is hardly less rare among their elders.  We may instruct our children in the principles of oral hygiene; we may admonish them to brush their teeth regularly; to live wholesomely, abstaining from sweets and jams and confections and all the things that childern love; but all this, from a child's point of view, is a counsel of perfection, a counsel which ninety-nine children out of a hundred will not heed.</P>
    <P>In the evidence which he gave to the New Zealand Commission, Dr. B.J. Bibby, the Director of the Division of <Col N="1750" /> Dental Hygiene in the New Zealand Department of Health had this to say on that point:</P>
    <P>I am sure it is widely known that dental decay can be reduced by attention to oral hygiene and less frequent consumption of carbohydrate and sugary foods, but against this knowledge are set the accepted social customs and the dietary habits of the nation&mdash;difficult to change even over a long-term period.</P>
    <P>The young child in the home may be taught to observe all the tenets of good oral hygiene and his diet may be easily controlled, but once his social contacts and experience widen outside the home it is difficult for him to flout the social and dietary habits of his companions.</P>
    <P>And if some children do what they are bidden and follow our injunctions meticulously and docilely, what have we secured?  Not a widespread measure of natural protection against the disease, not an increased degree of natural resistance to it for the generality of children, just a diminished risk in the case of the relatively few individuals who exercise continuously this strong discipline over themselves.</P>
    <P>Prophylaxis on this limited scale will not yield any significant success in combating the disease.  To be even partially effective to any significant extent, the prophylactic measures must provide the children with a high degree of built-in immunity, an immunity which is built-in into their teeth from their earliest years, something which is acquired by them whether or not they follow a strict régime in diet and oral hygiene.  Over the past forty years research into the problem of finding a prophylactic against dental caries has been intensively pursued in many countries.  All the results indicate that, if piped public water supplies are available to a community, it is possible and easily practicable to build up in young children a high degree of immunity from it.  This can be done here, as it has been done elsewhere, to a considerable degree by a relatively slight <Col N="1751" /> adjustment in the fluoride content of our drinking waters.</P>
    <P>Fluoride as a trace element occurs naturally, not only in drinking waters but in the majority of foods, in vegetables, meats, cereals, fruit, fish and, notably, in tea.  It is a normal constituent of bones and teeth.  Clearly then unless ingested in excessive quantities it is not deleterious to health.  Indeed no diet adequate for maintaining normal health is wholly free from the mineral.  On the other hand, painstaking investigations, pursued over forty years, do indicate that, where standards of living are high, a deficiency, an infinitesimal deficiency, of it in the water used for drinking is associated with a heavy incidence of dental caries.  I am not saying that a fluoride-deficiency is the cause of this condition, but it would appear that an adequate intake of fluoride has a strongly inhibiting effect on its development.  Conversely, an inadequate intake heavily increases vulnerability to the disease; which would appear to explain its widespread prevalence among our people.</P>
    <P>In 1948, in the course of an investigation, sponsored by the Medical Research Council of Ireland and conducted by an eminent chemist, it was found that out of 42 of our drinking water sources examined, 32 had less fluoride than one part per ten millions. In none of the remaining 10 cases did the fluoride content exceed three parts per ten millions.  Even this maximum is considerably below what is regarded as the optimum fluoride content necessary for promoting resistance to dental decay. Against these findings we must place the fact that as the Report of the Medical Research Council of Ireland on its dental caries survey indicated, the incidence of dental caries in this country is probably amongst the highest in the world.</P>
    <P>There are many authorities, impeccable and unquestionable authorities, to support the conclusions that to enable the teeth of the growing generation to withstand the onset of dental caries, under modern civilised living conditions, a certain minute <Col N="1752" /> quantity, 1 p.p.m., of fluoride must be ingested by the children with the ordinary day to day intake of water; and that where the fluoride content of the natural water sources falls below this minimum it is most desirable, even one may say imperative, to increase this to the required degree. First among these authorities, I naturally place the Fluorine Consultative Council which my predecessor as Minister for Health, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, appointed in January, 1957. I would like at this point to record my appreciation of the concise and comprehensive study of the problem which this body carried out.  In May, 1958, the Council reported to me in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Having considered all the information available on the relationship between fluorine and dental decay, the Council is satisfied that an increased intake of fluorine will reduce the incidence of dental caries and that it is desirable to provide for such an increased intake. The Council is further satisfied that the increased intake of fluorine can best be provided by the fluoridation of public water supplies to the level of 1.0 part per million F.  In so recommending the Council is aware that not quite 50 per cent. of the community would thereby benefit at present even if all public piped water supplies in the country were fluoridated but the percentage will increase according as public piped water supplies are extended.</P>
    <P>In 1957 the World Health Organisation set up a committee of experts to study the question of water fluoridation.  In 1958 the Report of this Committee was published.  It opened with the following statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Water fluoridation as a public health measure to aid in the control of dental caries is receiving worldwide attention.  Many government officials, public health administrators and others have asked for guidance in the form of an authoritative report presenting the subject in a way which will serve as a useful guide when water fluoridation projects are considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> Having examined the problem in all its aspects the Report summarises the views of the Expert Committee in the following findings:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Dental caries is one of the most prevalent and widespread diseases.</P>
    <P>2.  There is no hope of controlling the disease by present treatment methods alone.</P>
    <P>3.  Among the numerous preventive methods, the fluoridation of drinking water supplies is the most promising.</P>
    <P>4.  The effectiveness, safety, and practicability of fluoridation as a caries-preventive measure has been established.</P>
    <P>5.  1 p.p.m. fluoride has been shown to give maximum benefits; first, by epidemiological studies where fluoride occurs naturally in the water, and secondly, where fluoride has been added at optimum concentrations through mechanical means.</P>
    <P>6.  Hundreds of controlled fluoridation programmes are now in operation in many countries.  Some have been in progress for the past 12 years, so that conclusions are based on experience.  No other public health procedure, during the initial stages of its application, has had such a background in time or extent.</P>
    <P>13.  Growth and development, somatic and psychic, are normal in children drinking water containing 1 part per million fluoride.</P>
    <P>17.  No other vehicles or techniques for the prophylactic application of fluorides can at present replace the fluoridation of drinking water as a public health measure. Where water fluoridation cannot be used, research into other vehicles and improved methods of local fluoride application should, however, be encouraged.</P>
    <P>In July, 1955, the British Minister of Health issued a statement entitled &ldquo;The Fluoridation of Water and the Prevention of Dental Decay.&rdquo;  After a <Col N="1754" /> reasoned examination of the matter the statement concludes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To summarise: the Government has every reason to believe that fluoridation is of great benefit in the preservation of the teeth of children, and ultimately also of adults, against dental decay and that it reduces dental decay in children by about 60 per cent.  There is no evidence that the consumption of water fluoridated to a level of about 1 part per million has any harmful effects on those who drink it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In November, 1956, the Government of New Zealand appointed a Commission &ldquo;to inquire into the desirabilty or otherwise of the fluoridation of public water supplies.&rdquo;  The Commission reported in July, 1957.  I have placed a copy of its Report in the Library and I would strongly recommend all members of the Oireachtas to study it.  I am sure that those who do will agree with me that it is a fully detailed account of a comprehensive and searching investigation into all aspects of the subject.  The Report in its 154 pages, supplemented by numerous appendices, and fully documented, examines with painstaking and objective care not only the merits of the proposal but every objection which has been raised against it. Following Part I, which is introductory, the Commission in Part II of the Report examines the problem of dental health and proceeds to declare:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We regard the following matters as established:</P>
    <P>(1)  Virtually every child born in New Zealand experiences dental decay and in consequence an unduly high proportion of the population over the age of 21 years uses some form of denture.</P>
    <P>(2)  Sustained efforts over many years by both the Department of Health and the dental profession to introduce improved dietary habits have been ineffective.  At the present time there is no hope of any programme of dental health education achieving a significant beneficial effect.</P>
    <P>(3)  The filling of teeth is not a <Col N="1755" /> preventive measure but a means of treating decay.</P>
    <P>(4)  The problem of controlling the rate of dental decay by treatment is beyond the resources of the dental services in this country.</P>
    <P>(5)  The incidence of dental decay in New Zealand is so widespread and severe that it constitutes a major problem in public health and is a matter for grave concern.</P>
    <P>Those words might quite readily apply to the conditions in this country.</P>
    <P>In Part III the Commission having considered the effect of &ldquo;fluoride in relation to dental health&rdquo;, reports:</P>
    <P>We regard the following matters as established:</P>
    <P>(1)  Fluoride is a natural component of all teeth and by hardening their mineral structure it makes them more resistant to dissolution by acids.</P>
    <P>(3)  In New Zealand the fluoride content of potable waters is considerably below 1 part per million.</P>
    <P>&mdash;as it is in fact in this country.</P>
    <P>(4)  In areas where there is fluoride in drinking waters at optimum concentrations, whether naturally present or artificially added, the prevalence of dental decay in children is at least 50 per cent lower than in areas where the fluoride content is 0.2 parts per million or less.  In the higher fluoride areas about one-third of all children escape dental decay entirely and the beneficial effects continue into adult life.</P>
    <P>(5)  There is no evidence that the consumption of fluoridated water would do harm to the pulp of the teeth or to the tissues which surround and support them.</P>
    <P>(6)  The regular ingestion of a substantial excess of fluoride (more than 1.9 parts per million) in the drinking water may cause <Col N="1756" /> dental fluorosis.  This is only one type of mottled enamel.  Other enamel defects unrelated to fluoride are common.  Enamel defects can develop only during the years of childhood.</P>
    <P>(7)  When the drinking water contains 1 part per million fluoride, or slightly more, the incidence of dental fluorosis has no significance.</P>
    <P>(8) As the result of painstaking and thorough scientific observations conducted over a period of at least 40 years, there is a rational basis for the proposal to add fluoride to public water supplies in which this trace element may be deficient.</P>
    <P>The Commission in Part IV went on &ldquo;to consider whether there can be any possible objections to fluoridation on other grounds&rdquo;, and, after a careful analysis of the evidence and the authorities submitted to it for and against fluoridation, summarises its findings on &ldquo;the behaviour of fluoride in the human body&rdquo; as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In summary, our conclusions in regard to be toxicity of fluoride are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Fluoride is beneficial in proper doses and the optimum level in drinking water can be established with certainty.</P>
    <P>(2)  In common with all foods including pure water, it can become harmful in substantial overdoses.</P>
    <P>(3)  Acute or violent reaction could be produced only by such huge overdoses that the possibility becomes irrelevant in relation to the fluoridation of water.</P>
    <P>(4)  In the proposal to fluoridate water, there is no risk of chronic fluoride poisoning.</P>
    <P>(5)  The suggestion that fluoride is an enzyme poison has no relevance to fluoridated water.</P>
    <P>(6)  The implication contained in certain anti-fluoridation literature that fluoridation involves the use of a substance with properties <Col N="1757" /> similar to certain deadly organic compounds of fluorine, is absurd and entirely misleading.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From this the Commission in Part V proceeds to examine the complaint that fluoride is harmful to health.  As a result it reports:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After full consideration of all the evidence we are satisfied that fluoridated water does not cause or aggravate any of the following disorders:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Disorders of the brain and nervous system, disorders of the special senses, and disorders of the mind.</P>
    <P>(2)  Disorders of the heart and blood vessels.</P>
    <P>(3)  Disorders of the kidney and urinary tract.</P>
    <P>(4)  Cancer.</P>
    <P>(5)  Diabetes or disorders of the Thyroid gland.</P>
    <P>(6)  Disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and the liver.</P>
    <P>(7)  Disorders of pregnancy and labour or developmental defects in children.</P>
    <P>(8)  Disorders of bones, joint, and the bone marrow.</P>
    <P>(9)  Irritation of the eyes or irritation of mucous membranes.</P>
    <P>In part VI of the Report the Commission then analyses the case against fluoridation on medical grounds, and on that point gives its views as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We regard the following matters as established:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The process of fluoridation does not add a substance that is foreign to the water, but merely brings about a slight change in the concentration of the fluoride already present naturally in that water.</P>
    <P>(2)  No diet is devoid of fluoride and water is the normal vehicle for conveying this substance to the body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1758" /> (3)  Fluoride is a normal constituent of bones and teeth.</P>
    <P>(4)  Fluoride is a nutrient and is beneficial in proper amounts.  In common with many other foodstuffs it has adverse effects on the body when ingested in excess.</P>
    <P>(5)  In the proposal to fluoridate public water supplies there is no risk of excessive ingestion; there is no risk of chronic fluoride poisoning; and the possibility of acute poisoning can be disregarded entirely.  Suggestions to the contrary in some anti-fluoridation propaganda are misleading and absurd.</P>
    <P>(6)  No harmful effects on health will follow the fluoridation of water supplies whether in respect of the complaints specifically made before us or otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having examined several other aspects of the matter, in accordance with its terms of reference, the Commission, in Part XII of its Report, publishes certain Specific Findings.  These Findings are expressed in the form of query and answer; and I quote those which are immediately relevant, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Whether benefits to dental health may reasonably be expected in New Zealand from the addition of fluoride to public water supplies, having regard to the results of the fluoridation of water supplies in other countries:</P>
    <P>CONCLUSION: Yes.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whether any disadvantages may result from the addition of fluoride to waters naturally containing less than one part of fluoride per million:</P>
    <P>CONCLUSION: No.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whether there are any practicable methods of adjusting the daily intake of fluoride other than by addition to the water consumed.</P>
    <P>CONCLUSION:</P>
    <P>(i)  There is no practicable method of adjusting the intake of fluoride other than by addition of that substance to public water supplies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> (ii)  No alternative suggested would be effective as a public health measure.</P>
    <P>Finally the Commission (p. 154) sums up its findings in a General Conclusion as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Introduced in accordance with the principles outlined in paragraph 548 we are satisfied that widespread use should be made of the fluoridation process for the purpose of achieving an urgently needed improvement in the present serious state of dental health in New Zealand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago in a letter to the newspapers, opposing the fluoridation of public water supplies, a correspondent suggested that the Royal Medical Board of Sweden had condemned this procedure.  In view of the high authority which was thus flagrantly misrepresented, it is advisable to deal with that allegation now.</P>
    <P>The question with which the present Bill is concerned, caries prevention through fluoridation, may be said to have come under critical and scientific examination in Sweden in 1952.  In that year a committee of experts was appointed by the Royal Medical Board of Sweden to investigate the use of fluorides as a means of preventing dental decay.  On completion of the Committee's enquiries the Board submitted a report to the Government in February, 1955, declaring that the addition of fluorides to drinking water would be a measure of great potential value in the prevention of the widespread disease of dental caries.  In view, however, of the fact that the scientific advisers expressed some doubt as to the harmlessness of fluoride, even at the low concentration recommended, the Board considered it advisable to await the outcome of further research before recommending that fluoridation should be more generally used in combating dental caries.</P>
    <P>Following this cautious decision, the question was subsequently examined on two further occasions, and arising out of them, the Royal Medical Board on April 12, 1958, reported to the king of Sweden that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" />&ldquo;In the opinion of the board the inquiry carried out has shown that fluoridation of public water supplies does not involve any demonstrable health hazards even on prolonged consumption of the water.  Being convinced that fluoridation of drinking water is an effective means of preventing caries in children and young persons, the Board maintains that communities which desire to start fluoridation of their domestic water supplies should be authorised to do so under the necessary technical control.</P>
    <P>In this connection the Board wishes to point out that both the World Health Organisation and the American Medical Association recently, after special expert inquiries, have unreservedly recommended fluordiation of drinking water as an effective and safe means of preventing dental caries.</P>
    <P>The Board is fully aware of the fact that, in point of principle, objections may be raised against fluoridation of drinking water on the grounds that the citizens would be compelled to consume fluoridated water, and that a movement of opposition against fluoridation exists in the United States and to some extent in Sweeden as well.  The &ldquo;Interim Committee for Personal Integrity&rdquo; in Goteberg, for instance, has appealed to the Board for measures against fluoridation of drinking water.  The Board cannot find, however, that these objections carry sufficient weight to be allowed to obstruct an important public health measure.  The incidence of dental caries in Sweden, has reached such proportions that all available means for its combat have to be utilised.  Fluoridation of drinking water is one of the methods that should be employed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As a footnote to the foregoing, the following extract from a preceding page (13) of the Report is a conclusive comment on the suggestion that there are available to us other ways of compensating for the fluoride deficiency in our drinking waters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" />&ldquo;The committee consider&mdash;also unanimously&mdash;that at present they cannot recommend a generalized administration of prophylactic does of fluoride with vehicles other than water.  On prescription by a physician or a dentist fluoride as tablets may be given in individual cases.  Clinical experiments with administration of fluoride in flour, common salt or milk should not be started until further experience has been gained concerning the dosage and the effect of fluoride in these vehicles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Since it was in the United States that the suggestion was first made that the onset of dental caries could be inhibited, or at least considerably retarded by the addition of fluoride to drinking water, it is not surprising that fluoridation is in widespread use there. According to the latest figures available to me, more than 44 million people in the U.S.A.  now drink fluoridated water.  Seven million of these live in areas where, without any artificial addition, the water sources carry concentrations of the mineral of not less than 0.7 p.p.m.  But close on 37 million live in areas where the water is mechanically fluoridated, as is proposed in this Bill.  In fact about two-thirds of American cities with populations of 500,000 and upwards, together with one-third of those residing in towns within the population limits of 10,000 to 500,000, have fluoridated water.  This is not surprising, since a great number of responsible scientific bodies in that country have sponsored and recommended fluoridation.  Among such bodies are the American Medical Association, the American Dental Association, the National Research Council, the College of American Pathologists, and the Commission on Chronic Illness.</P>
    <P>The actual experience of the beneficial results of fluoridation in the United States, even when operated on such a vast scale in so many diverse communities, has led in due course to the employment of the process by responsible health authorities in many other countries.  Controlled fluoridation programmes are now in operation in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, <Col N="1762" /> Chile, Colombia, E1 Salvador, Federal Republic of Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Malaya, Netherlands, New Zealand, Panama Canal Zone, Sweden, Venezuela.  Approved plans for the first fluoridation projects in Norway and Switzerland are in the process of being implemented.  The Expert Committee of the World Health Organisation comments that this reflects &ldquo;the world-wide extent of endorsements by responsible health officials and their advisory councils.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be clear from all this that the overwhelming consensus of informed scientific, medical and dental opinion is convinced that the fluoridation of public water supplies, to the extent of one part in a million, would be from the point of view of public health a highly beneficial measure.  This is admitted even in a document submitted to me on behalf of the recently formed Pure Water Association&mdash;which the House may know opposes fluoridation. Incidentally <i>pure</i> water is not to be found anywhere in nature.  This document states: &ldquo;It would be idle to deny that good grounds exist for believing that the presence of fluorine in the diet tends, in some ways as yet unexplained, to render the teeth of young children resistant to decay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this universally admitted fact there are some who question the efficacy of fluoridation as a protective measure and argue against it; just as there are some individuals who even to-day would contend that the earth is flat.  From the medical, dental and scientific points of view all such opponents are non-suited.  They cannot adduce one tittle of substantial evidence to disprove the conclusions that, in a concentration which does not exceed 1 part per million of natural drinking water, fluoride tends to build up a great measure of resistance to dental caries in the majority of children and adolescents drinking such water and that ingested in this infinitesimal proportion it does not impair either the dental health or the general health of the community.  All the weight of experience, research and carefully controlled trials is to the contrary. There is only one ground on which, <Col N="1763" /> without reference to established facts, opponents of fluoridation can challenge the right of the community to safeguard itself against a diseased condition, which is not only widespread and very distressing, but is also a source of considerable economic loss to the community and of ill-health to individual citizens. The fluoridation of public water supplies constitutes, some of those who oppose it allege, a grievous infringement of the rights of the individual. If this allegation were well-founded that would be a grievous matter indeed.</P>
    <P>But does the fluoridation of public water supplies in fact violate individual rights?  It is highly germane to the argument to point out that the public water supplies do not belong to the individual; they belong to the community.  Such rights as the individual may possess or enjoy in them, arises from his membership of the community with which his lot is joined.  As an individual he has no right of veto over the decisions of the community, though of course he has the right to dissent from them.  Where these decisions are made for the common good by the appropriate authority, he must abide by them for so long as he may wish to enjoy the advantages which membership of the community gives to him.  Therefore, if there be good grounds for deciding that the public water supplies must contain a prescribed trace of a mineral nutrient which all experience tends to prove is essential for the greater protection of the general body of citizens against a particular dental disease and which is not harmful to health no individual is justified in opposing the prescription merely because he personally does not like it. He cannot expect to enjoy the advantages of the communal supply and at the same time retain the right to deny to the community the benefits of dental prophylaxis.</P>
    <P>Moreover the individual living in a community has his duty to all his fellows.  He cannot deny them the right to protect themselves against disease.  And where that disease is <Col N="1764" /> so widespread that it constitutes a grave menance to the general health of the community he must, in charity and as a matter of social obligation, at least acquiesce in the steps which the community takes to protect itself against it.  Provided always, of course, that nothing is asked of him which would violate his physical or psychic integrity by mutilating or destroying his members, or impairing his intellect or faculties, thus interfering with his personality in its particular and characteristic function.  The addition to public water supplies of an infinitesimal trace of fluoride to reinforce the fluoride which is already there, does none of these things, and, therefore, cannot be objected to on ethical grounds.  It is true that some who oppose fluoridation say that the process raises certain ethical considerations. But at no time have those who argue thus cited or quoted any authoritative objection based upon ethical principles.  If then those who are entitled to speak and act for the community and have a responsibility for its well-being, seeking the greatest protection of the dental health of children decide that public water supplies will be fluoridated to the optimum level, the decision cannot be regarded as a real infringement of the rights of the individual and should be accepted in the general interests of all.</P>
    <P>Some say they object to fluoridation because it is a measure of mass-medication. That is a striking phrase, and no doubt has been coined for its great propaganda value, but it has no relevance and no application in this context.  Flourine is not a medicine. A medicine is something which is used to cure a disease.  Fluorine salt will not cure dental decay; but if ingested in infinitesimal quantities as part of the day to day diet it will tend in a large measure to prevent its onset.  As the Report of the New Zealand Commission so cogently stresses, the plain fact is that fluoride is a nutrient which is beneficial in proper amounts. It is doubtful if a human being can live healthily without it.  Indeed it has been said that if anyone were so foolish as to try to do so he would be restricted to a diet of cabbage, <Col N="1765" /> beets and cauliflower, cooked in distilled water.  Here in Ireland it might not be necessary for him in some places to distil the water.  But leaving that aside, the diet does not appeal to me, nor I am sure to any one else, as nourishing, satisfying and appetising. Fluorine not being a medicine there can be no suggestion of mass-medication in the fluoridation of water, any more than there is mass-medication in the chlorination of water which is a common practice in this country.</P>
    <P>Finally it is nonsense to say that fluoride could be made as generally and conveniently available as a prophylactic through any other vehicle than water.  It is the unanimous opinion of all authorities who have fully considered the question that for effective and general prophylaxis there is in the present state of our knowledge no alternative to the fluoridation of the public water supply.  On that point let me recapitulate what the authorities have said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Expert Committee on Water Fluoridation appointed by the World Health Organisation stated:</P>
    <P>No other vehicles or techniques for the prophylactic application of fluoride can at present replace the fluoridation of drinking water as a public health measure.</P>
    <P>Our own Fluorine Consultative Council said:</P>
    <P>The Council is further satisfied that the increased intake of fluorine can best be provided by the fluoridation of public water supplies to the level of 1 part per million F.</P>
    <P>The New Zealand Commission of Inquiry on the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies reported:</P>
    <P>There is no practicable method of adjusting the intake of fluoride other than by addition of that substance to public water supplies.  No alternative suggested would be effective as a public health measure.</P>
    <P>In the Report of the Royal Swedish Medical Board it was stated:</P>
    <P>The committee consider&mdash;also unanimously&mdash;that at present they cannot recommend a generalised administration <Col N="1766" /> of prophylactic does of fluoride with vehicles other than water.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I trust that the House will see its way to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 lays a general duty on health authorities to arrange for fluoridation of public water supplies. Power is being taken to fix a time limit for the performance of this obligation in any particular case.  I do not envisage that this power will often require to be used as I am convinced that health authorities will be as appreciative as I am and as I trust the House will be of the benefits to be derived from this measure.</P>
    <P>The House will observe in particular that Section 2 imposes a statutory limit on the amount of fluorine which may be added to water.  This provides assurance that the limit of one part per million, which has authoritative backing as to its usefulness and efficacy, can never be exceeded without the authority of the Oireachtas being first obtained.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 3 is to designate which health authority is to fluoridate each water supply and in particular to deal with areas in which a public water supply serves the functional area of two or more such authorities.  The simple expedient of assigning the duty to one authority in such cases is adopted.  Section 5 provides for the apportionment of expenditure in such cases between the health authorities concerned.  The basis of apportionment will be the amount of water consumed.</P>
    <P>Sanitary authorities, as the House knows, are the bodies at present vested with the statutory responsibilities in regard to the actual supply of water to the public.  It is proposed, therefore, in Section 4 to make provision for the performance of the work by those bodies as agents for health authorities in relation to fluoridation.  This arrangement, it will be admitted, is the obvious one.  The section provides for the recoupment by the appropriate health authority to the sanitary <Col N="1767" /> authority of such expenses as the latter body may incur.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will enable the Minister for Health to require the making of estimates of the incidence of dental caries.  In this connection the House will recall that the Fluorine Consultative Council recommended that before any public water supply is fluoridated steps should be taken to assess the incidence of dental caries in children, and it is my intention to utilise this section, in so far as may be necessary for this purpose, having regard to available information.</P>
    <P>It is intended that half of the current expenditure of the health authorities under this Bill will be recouped to them from the Health Services Grant. To provide for this it will be necessary to recognise fluoridation as a health service for the purpose of the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947.  Under that Act as it stands, however, the recognition of a new health service can only be made effective from the beginning of a local financial year.  Thus, fluoridation could not be recognised for the purpose of the Health Services Grant until 1st April, 1961, at the earliest and any local expenditure on it before that date would fall entirely on the rates. To get over this difficulty, an amendment of the 1947 Act is proposed by Section 7 of the Bill whereby the recognition of fluoridation for the purposes of the Grant can be made effective at any time.</P>
    <P>Section 8 contains the usual provision for the laying of Regulations under the Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 9 deals with the short title and collective citation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I trust the House will see its way to give me the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem dealt with in the Bill is one which has, of course, engaged the attention of the Minister's Department for some years.  It is true to say, as appears from the Minister's very comprehensive and well documented review, that the problem of dental caries has engaged the attention of the public health authorities <Col N="1768" /> in many countries in the last decade or so.  It is without question that such a problem as it posed by that disease faces us in this country just as it faces other countries.  I do not think, therefore that there can be much disagreement with regard to the existence of the problem with which this Bill is intended to deal, but the question will arise whether the proposal in this Bill is the correct way of dealing with the problem which we agree exists.</P>
      <P>When I was Minister for Health, I followed an examination of this matter that had been initiated by my immediate predecessor and, in accordance with that examination and investigation, a council or body was set up to advise the Minister for Health on this question of fluoridation.  The Minister has made reference to the work of that body and to its report which has led to the present Bill.  I think that at the time that this body was set up it was certainly apparent to me, and, I think, to many other people, that this whole question of fluoridation was one in respect of which there were, to put it mildly, two conflicting views.  I do not know of any other proposal in relation to public health which, in recent years, has excited so much feeling on one side or the other and, therefore, it was very essential that this problem should be examined by an independent body for the purpose of giving to whoever might be the Minister for Health objective advice on the matter.  It is true, as the Minister has pointed out, that the body here has reported in favour of fluoridation and, acting on that report, the Minister has introduced this Bill.</P>
      <P>It appeared from the Minister's speech as if he adopts the position that this Bill is in accordance with the recommendation of the Fluorine Consultative Council.  I feel that it is not and I would rather suggest to the Minister that this Bill is not, and cannot be said to be, in accordance with the advice given to him by the Consultative Council.  In saying that, I am not questioning the recommendation of the Council with regard to fluoridation but I am calling in question the machinery proposed in this Bill for implementing the Consultative Council's recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> May I put it like this, Sir?  In this Bill&mdash;a short Bill&mdash;the effective Section is Section 2 and that section provides, in effect, that every health authority, when directed to do so by the Minister in accordance with his powers, shall arrange for the fluoridation of its water supply.  There is no question of the local authority having a contrary view or considering what its own views might be in relation to the matter.  Once the Minister directs it, in accordance with the powers under this Bill, it must carry out the direction.  There, and in that respect, the report of the Fluorine Consultative Council has been departed from and it is that particular mandatory provision in this Bill which we on this side of the House find to be objectionable.</P>
    <P>I must refer the House to the recommendations given to the Minister in the Report of the Fluorine Council. This is the part of the Report dealing with the recommendations to the Minister. Having put forward the desirability of the fluoridation of the water supply throughout the country, they recommended as follows in paragraph 41:</P>
    <P>The Council is in doubt as to whether local authorities have the necessary statutory authority to add fluoride to public water supplies.  It recommends the introduction of any legislation which may be necessary to enable local authorities to discharge this function.</P>
    <P>I think the consultative council was very wise in that recommendation, very wise in recommending to the Minister the desirability of providing, through Parliament, the power for local authorities to fluoridate their water supply, if they so desire.  In that recommendation, what was envisaged by the Consultative Council was enabling legislation.  They felt&mdash; and I have little doubt they considered this matter very carefully&mdash;that in relation to a matter of this kind, it was very important that each local authority, concerned with its own local views, local sensibilities and sensitivities, should themselves decide whether to adopt fluoridation, and if they so decide this House should give <Col N="1770" /> them the statutory and enabling power to do so.</P>
    <P>That recommendation has not been followed by the Minister in the Bill which he proposes here.  If it is passed in its present form, irrespective of the view a health authority may come to, once they are directed to fluoridate their water supply, they are bound to do so.  May I also remind the Minister that this problem, which we all agree to be common to this country and to others, has been examined here and elsewhere in the last decade.  This problem in relation to the position of local authorities has also been considered in the Report to which the Minister made reference, the Report on Fluoridation in New Zealand.  I note that in the New Zealand Report, which the Minister kindly made available in the Library, the following appears on page 151:</P>
    <P>G&mdash;<i>The Position of Local Authorities.</i></P>
    <P>It is our opinion that:</P>
    <P>(1) a decision to fluoridate public water supplies should be left to the communities concerned.</P>
    <P>It goes on to detail the way in which they suggest the local authorities, the communities concerned, should decide this matter and in New Zealand what they did was to pass legislation enabling local authorities, if they thought it right to do so, to introduce fluoridation into their public water supplies.</P>
    <P>I note also that in the examination of this problem in Sweden, to which the Minister made reference, the Royal Medical Board, reporting to the King of Sweden in 1958, put the position so far as local authorities were concerned as follows:</P>
    <P>The Board maintains that communities which desire to start fluoridation in their domestic water supplies should be authorised to do so under the necessary technical control.</P>
    <P>There again in Sweden they realised that all the State should do for local communities and local authorities was to give them the power in relation to their own water supplies to carry out <Col N="1771" /> fluoridation, if they thought it desirable to do so.  It is in those circumstances that we on this side of the House feel that it is wrong in relation to a matter which has led to such general and, at times, acrimonious controversy and discussion, that we should, by our legislation, depart from the action taken in other countries that have been in favour of fluoridation and adopt as machinery the mandatory machinery which the Minister proposes.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on this but so far as I have read anything on this problem of fluoridation, I entirely accept the general policy which the Minister has enunciated and I entirely accept the recommendations of the Consultative Council with regard to the general desirability of fluoridating water supplies.  However, I do feel we must accord to local authorities the liberty which our democracy has given to them, that is, freedom of action, that if they do not accept the recommendations enshrined in this Bill or the recommendations made by the Fluorine Council, it is a matter entirely for them.</P>
    <P>All that the State should do is to give the local authorities the lead, give them the power to act in accordance with the advice the Minister <Col N="1772" /> has given to the House.  If they prefer not to do so, it should be a matter entirely for them.  The Minister has referred to the phrases used frequently by the Pure Water Association and the other bodies concerned in this question of fluoridation. He has referred to the charge which was made that it is a case of mass medication.  The Minister has dealt with that and it is not necessary for me to repeat what he has said. However, I suggest to him that that charge, if there is any validity at all in it, certainly can be applied where the machinery proposed is the mandatory fluoridation of the public water supply from Cork to Donegal, irrespective of what the local sentiments and susceptibilities may be.</P>
    <P>That appears to me to be the wrong way to set about solving the problem and it is bound to give to people who hold the other view the strong feeling that irrespective of the rights and wrongs of it, they are being forced to accept the fluoridation of water.  Therefore, we are of opinion that the Minister should reconsider the machinery he has adopted here.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 6th April, 1960.</P>
