      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the present economic distress in the Six County area, he considers it appropriate to make an approach to the head of the Six County Government with a view to creating a greater economic unity in the whole country, and so further the way to a politically and economically united Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have repeatedly expressed the view that, irrespective of political considerations, the co-ordination of economic policies and the growth of practical co-operation in dealing with economic and trade problems would result in substantial benefit to the people of both areas.  While I should welcome an opportunity of a discussion of possibilities for co-operation, I do not think that circumstances are at present favourable to an approach such as that suggested in the Question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will inaugurate some means of assessing the numbers of emigrants leaving this country annually and for the first time so that there would be available at all times current precise statistics, which would obviate the controversy persistently obtaining in regard to emigration figures.</P>

      <P>Accurate statistics of net emigration are available <Col N="677" /> for intercensal periods.  It has already been announced that a Census of Population will be taken in 1961. The information collected at this Census will enable accurate figures of net emigration to be compiled for the period 1956-61.</P>
      <P>As has been indicated in replies to other questions on emigration, it has not been found possible to devise means other than the imposition of rigid frontier controls or the taking of an annual census of population to obtain reliable estimates of annual emigration. On the grounds both of expense and of the inconvenience which would be caused to the general public it is not proposed to adopt either expedient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that it would be in the best national interests to have information of this kind available at any time to us?  The intercensal periods are long.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not think that it is desirable to devise such a system of determining the number of emigrants leaving this country annually in view of the fact that, while we do not know the number of people who are leaving the country annually, we do know the number of cattle that leave annually?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some figures which show what the trend of emigration is.  They are not reliable figures.  They may enable comparison to be made with one period and another and, in so far as there are such figures, they show that though the volume of emigration is still very considerable it is decidedly less than it was in 1956-57.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>Comprehensive information is not available concerning the total number of new jobs created in any period.  With regard, however, to new industrial undertakings and extensions of existing undertakings, having a capital investment of not less than £10,000, which came to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as having <Col N="679" /> commenced production in the period 1st January, 1957, to 30th September, 1960, the estimated amount of initial employment is 6,600 workers and the estimated potential is 9,600 workers.</P>
      <P>The quarterly estimates of persons engaged in industries producing transportable goods indicate that by June, 1960, there was a net increase of 8,800 in employment over the June, 1957, level, 8,700 of the increase being in manufacturing industries.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach what was the net increase or decrease in the number of persons in employment in (a) non-agricultural industry, (b) agriculture, (c) forestry and (d) fishing in each of the years 1957, 1958 and 1959 up to the most recent date for which figures are available, and the net total increase or decrease in each year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.  Particulars of the total number of persons who have left agriculture, forestry and fishing are not available.  Estimates are, however, available of the number of persons at work in this sector of economic <Col N="680" /> activity.  The estimates for 1957, 1958 and 1959, which relate to early April of each year, show a net decrease of 12,000, 4,000 and 9,000 respectively below the level of the preceding year.  These figures are to be compared with an average rate of decline of 10,000 during the previous five-year period.  Separate estimates for agriculture, forestry and fishing are not available.</P>
      <P>The corresponding estimates of the number of persons at work in all non-agricultural economic activity in 1957 and 1958 were 15,000 and 11,000 respectively below the level of the preceding year, while the 1959 figure was the same as that for 1958.</P>
      <P>Comparable figures for 1960 are not yet available for either the agricultural or the non-agricultural sectors but more recent data are available for some sections of the latter.  The most recent figures for employment in transportable goods industries, relating to June, 1960, show an increase of over 3,100 above the 1959 level. The number of persons employed by railway companies in March, 1960, was 1,100 lower than in March, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the rate at which persons left agricultural employment between 1957-58 has nearly doubled, is it not a fact that the drift from the land which was relatively moderate has now become wholesale evacuation?  Secondly, in view of the fact that the net total number of new jobs needed at the moment is anything between 40,000 and 60,000, is it not clear that the present apparent position of prosperity is a purely book-keeping prosperity made by better administrative methods and better use of machinery at the expense of men and the population?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether any examination has been made of the teeth of all adolescents in Ireland; if so, when; and, if not, what was the basis on which he stated that ninety-nine per cent. of Irish adolescents are afflicted with dental caries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, the answer is &ldquo;no.&rdquo;   On the occasion on which I made the statement, I reminded the House of the results of the dental caries survey conducted towards the end of 1952 under the aegis of the Medical Research Council.  A representative sample of the child population in the age groups 5 to 6 years, 7 to 8 years and 12 to 13 years was then dentally examined and the result showed, not surprisingly, a worsening position as regards dental caries with increasing age and in the age group 12 to 13 only 0.9 per cent. had complete dentitions free from caries.  Incidentally, no less than 68.2% of the children in this age group, then coming into their teens, had 5 or more diseased, missing or filled permanent teeth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These same children are now 8 years older and they form part of the age <Col N="682" /> groups 13 to 14 years, 15 to 16 years and 20 to 21 years.  Since dental caries is a disease which cannot be cured, the effect of dental caries on the teeth of these young people would certainly be no less pronounced now than it was eight years ago; indeed the inescapable inference from the results of the survey is that it would be worse.  In the light of the evidence that 98.6 per cent. of the 7 to 8 age group and 99.1 per cent. of the 12 to 13 age group examined eight years ago had been afflicted with dental caries, it is beyond doubt that 99 per cent. of our adolescents have suffered or are suffering from this disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the correct lesson to be drawn from those figures is that a proper dental service, properly staffed and equipped, is needed, and not the present cheap stunt of the Fluoridation Bill which the Minister has before the House?</P>

      <P>The cheap fuel scheme came into operation in November, 1942.  The scheme was initiated during the period of acute fuel shortage occasioned by the Emergency in order to assist necessitous families to obtain a regular supply of native fuel, and in particular turf, in areas then classified as non-turf areas, where there were special difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies.  Though not strictly non-turf areas, Limerick was brought in at the instance of the Muintir na Tíre Fuel Committee, Limerick, which was given a subvention of £600, and Dungarvan because it had originally been classified as being in a non-turf area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only records available to me of purchases of property by non-nationals are those kept in connection with the higher rate of stamp duty imposed in 1947 on certain conveyances and transfers to them.  This higher rate of duty did not at any time apply to purchases by non-national persons or companies who had been resident in the State for three years before the 15th October, 1947.  On the passing of the Finance Act, 1956, the higher rate ceased to apply to purchases by non-nationals of property for private residential purposes, provided the property did not include land exceeding five acres in extent.  It also ceased to apply where the property was being acquired by the non-national exclusively for the purpose of an industry other than agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> Records have been kept of all cases in which the higher rate of stamp duty was paid and for the three years for which the Deputy has asked for information the numbers of transactions were as follows:&mdash;10 for the year ended 5th April, 1958, 7 for the year ended 5th April, 1959 and 8 for the year ended 5th April, 1960.  For the reasons I have mentioned, however, these figures must not be taken as representing all purchases by non-nationals during the periods in question.</P>

      <P>It is my great pleasure to invite you as Minister for External Affairs of Ireland to receive the Mace and Sword on behalf of the City of Galway, at a ceremony to be held in New York or Washington, D.C., towards the end of October next. It is our information that you will be in New York at that time, attending sessions of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The letter addressed to the Mayor of Galway contains the following:</P>
      <P>The presentation, it is hoped, will take place in New York or Washington later this month.  For your information, His Excellency, Frank Aiken, T.D., Minister for External Affairs of Ireland, has graciously accepted our invitation to accept the Mace and Sword on behalf of the people of Ireland and Galway in particular.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As already announced, arrangements have been made with the millers to take up 300,000 tons of wheat of the 1960 native crop.  If some proportion of this 300,000 tons is unfit for milling it will be exchanged for a like quantity of imported wheat, without any price adjustment.  Accordingly, whatever the outcome of the 1960 harvest, the proportion of higher-priced wheat in the grist will not be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that when the amount of Irish wheat in the grist was increased from 70 per cent. to 80 per cent. from the 5th September, it was agreed to increase the price of both household and other flour because of the increased amount of Irish wheat in the grist?  Now that that has changed, is it not only fair that there should be a reduction in the price of flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy in reply to a Supplementary Question last week, and I repeat it now, that 300,000 tons of wheat which the millers are obliged to take from the Irish farmers under the agreement between the Department of Agriculture and themselves will have to be taken and if there is, in that quantity of wheat, a proportion of unmillable wheat, the millers will be able to exchange that quantity for a corresponding quantity of imported wheat without any price adjustment.  The farmers will, therefore, be getting the full price for their 300,000 tons irrespective of whether it is millable or unmillable. I do not know if the Deputy suggests that the price to the farmers should be depressed.</P>

In April, 1953, that system was changed and a fixed sum per sack was paid by way of subsidy.

      <P>The members of the House have, no doubt, already heard the tragic news which has reached us today from the Congo. Despite the efforts of the Minister for Defence to ascertain the full facts, the information available is not yet complete. It appears, however, that a patrol of eleven members of A Company, 33rd Battalion, of the Irish contingent to the United Nations Force operating from Niemba was attacked yesterday. It has been reported that some bodies were seen at the scene of the attack. One member of the patrol escaped with injuries and is believed to be in hospital.  Strong forces have now been despatched to recover the bodies and to locate the missing members of the patrol.  Aircraft are being used in the search which is also being assisted by the Ethiopian battalion located in the area.</P>
      <P>The relatives of the missing members of the patrol are being informed, and every effort is being made to get further particulars with the least possible delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that every member of Dáil Éireann is profoundly grieved by this event.  The men who have died have bravely given their lives in a most <Col N="735" /> noble cause&mdash;the maintenance of peace.  I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to their relatives an expression of the deep sympathy of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a Schedule to the 1959 Act which was very elaborate. This Bill takes over that Schedule and says that those under the previous Act will get the higher rate of six per cent. now&mdash;those that did not leave before 1955 are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand it.  The clause says that nobody gets an increase now who gets any allowance or payment not being a scheduled pension.  What is an allowance or pension that is not a scheduled pension?  It says that any person who has a pension who is referred to in Section 7 of this Act does not get an increase.  There is a third category, persons specified in the Schedule to the Act of 1959.  Then we go on to say that there is no increase in gratuities. I thought that gratuities always had reference to the pay at the date of retirement.  If that is so, does not the effect of this section debar any such increase from being operative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It excludes those other than people paid in the Schedule which was taken over by this Bill from 1959.  That lays down that there is a certain increase for those who retired since 1948 and this section says that apart from those nobody else gets it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I still do not understand it.  It seems to me that this section cuts out people&mdash;that it says certain people cannot get an increase. Why?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that any person getting a gratuity will not have it enhanced by any provision of this Bill.  That is clear to the ordinary Deputy.  There is segregrated under this complex paragraph (b), apparently, some small restricted body of pensioners who must have been present to the mind of the Minister's advisers when they were drafting this section and they wished to segregate them for some reason as persons who are not going to benefit under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister must have had the experience that all of us have had from time to time, in office or in Opposition, that when you do segregate some category of persons like that, almost invariably you are approached with hard cases and it then emerges that maybe out of the whole army of pensioned public servants you have excluded perhaps 35 or 40 people from a benefit that everybody else pensioned from the service enjoys and that for some highly complicated abstruse principle enshrined in the Department of Finance regulations. It would be a great ease to Deputies to know, if it is now ascertainable, what is this restricted group of persons which paragraph (b) is designed to segregate from benefit under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> I can understand the principle of paragraph (a).  If a pensioner in that category came to me I could understand saying to him; &ldquo;Well, yours was a final settlement in given circumstances under an international instrument. Nobody ever contemplated that there would be any variation of that.&rdquo; I can understand that the gratuity carried with it no implication that there was a residual claim in the grantee to get a subsequent surplus because we could not take any of the gratuity back.  But, I can find myself in very great difficulty, as I have found myself before, when small restricted groups of public servants come to me and say: &ldquo;Why are we left out?&rdquo;  I am bound to say that my experience has been down through the years in this House that these kinds of restricted groups get left out and that they then start endless, weary agitation which is ultimately given way to but always after half the original applicants are dead and gone.</P>
    <P>We have all had experience of the pre-1914 teachers.  That went on for years in this House and successive Minister for Finance could do nothing about it.  Ultimately something was done but by that time a great many of the most venerable amongst them were dead and gone and never got anything under it.  Then we had the pre-1950 teachers.  The same endless wrangle went on.  Ultimately we did something about it but, as I think the Minister will agree with me, anomalies arose there because a solution was so long delayed.</P>
    <P>What I object to in principle is the creation of small segregated groups who are excluded from a general benefit and what I am apprehensive of is that paragraph (b) of Section 11 may be creating such a group.  If it is, I should like to know what that group is so that we could, if necessary, argue with the Minister the desirability of letting them in to whatever benefit this Bill confers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the explanatory memorandum that he was good enough to circulate, as far as I <Col N="742" /> can understand, stops at Section 10? One of the reasons why I raised this matter was that I could not understand, when the Minister had gone to the trouble of circulating the memorandum in respect of the first ten sections, he did not add a paragraph in the memorandum about the section we are now discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We lay down in certain sections and in the Schedule certain groups that are entitled to increased pensions.  As I said, those are the regular civil servants who retired before 1948 and the regular civil servants who retired before 1955.  There are also local authority officials and there are employees of harbour boards and, as well as that, teachers, guards, etcetera. They are all provided for in the Bill.  Then we come along in this section and say that that is all, that nobody else is entitled to an increase in pension.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Dillon that I have not anybody in mind that I am trying to exclude.  Indeed, I do not know if that is even necessary but the draftsman evidently thinks it is.  The groups are all there who are to get their pensions increased but nobody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed for the purpose of putting this Bill into the character in which it was recommended by the Fluorine Consultative Council.  There was some discussion on this aspect of the matter on the Second Stage of the Bill.  The Consultative Council which was set up to examine this question made a report to the Minister and the introduction of this Bill is the result of that report and the result of the Minister's acceptance of the report of the Consultative Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in introducing the Bill gave a lengthy and detailed account of the considerations which weighed with him and I think he made it quite clear to the House that he was introducing this Bill because the Consultative Council had recommended that legislation should be introduced.  I and other Deputies on this side of the House disagreed that the Minister was, in fact, carrying out the recommendations of the Consultative Council and we pointed out to the Minister that in paragraph 41 of their report the <Col N="745" /> Council were recommending that enabling legislation should be introduced and not a Bill of a mandatory character such as this Bill is as it stands.  Paragraph 41 reads:</P>
    <P>The Council is in doubt as to whether local authorities have the necessary statutory authority to add fluoride to public water supplies.  It recommends the introduction of any legislation which may be necessary to enable local authorities to discharge this function.</P>
    <P>The amendments which are down in my name suggest that the Minister should carry out that recommendation of the Council and should make this Bill a permissive rather than a mandatory measure.  The Bill as it stands will, when it is passed by the Oireachtas and when the regulations which the Minister is required to make under it have been made, require local authorities to add fluorine to water whether they want to do it or not.  It will force this scheme down the necks of the local authorities and down the throats of the people who drink water supplied by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>We indicated to the Minister on the Second Reading of the Bill that because of the weightly considerations involved, because of the weight of the Fluorine Consultative Council's report, that we were prepared to accept the Bill, even though many of us on these benches, and I daresay on the Fianna Fáil benches as well, are not enamoured of the idea of tampering with water supplies for this purpose, if the Minister on his part would meet us by making the Bill permissive rather than mandatory.  It is to that end that these amendments have been put down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the principle to which these amendments seek to give effect was argued at length on the Second Reading of the Bill and I would suggest that we should accept the decision of the House on the Second Reading as covering these amendments.  However, if that is not acceded to I would like to say that in my view Deputy O'Higgins has misinterpreted the purport of paragraph 41 <Col N="746" /> of the Consultative Council's report, because what the Council does say is this:</P>
      <P>The Council is in doubt as to whether local authorities have the necessary statutory authority to add fluoride to public water supplies.</P>
      <P>That does not say that local authorities are to be given permission to do so if they so desire.  It merely says that, whether they want to do so or not, as the law stands at the moment they may not have the authority to do so.  They may not have the authority to instal the plant; they may not have the authority to expend money on the plant or to incur the expense of operating it.  That is the real significance of the first part of paragraph 41.</P>
      <P>The Council in its report logically goes on to recommend: &ldquo;the introduction of any legislation which may be necessary to enable local authorities to discharge this function.&rdquo;  This Bill gives effect to that recommendation because it does enable the local authorities to discharge that function when they are required by the Minister for Health to do so.</P>
      <P>Again, paragraph 41 is to be construed in conjunction with paragraph 38.  Paragraph 38 reads:</P>
      <P>Having considered all the information available to it on the relationship between fluorine and dental decay the Council is satisfied that an increased intake of fluorine will reduce the incidence of dental caries and that it is desirable to provide for such an increased intake.  The Council is further satisfied that the increased intake of fluorine can best be provided by the fluoridation of public water supplies to the level of 1.0 part per million F.  In so recommending the Council is aware that not quite 50% of the community would thereby benefit at present even if all public piped water supplies in the country were fluoridated but the percentage will increase according as public piped water supplies are extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a specific recommendation that the piped public water supplies should be fluoridated.  What would be <Col N="747" /> the use of making that recommendation to the Minister if he did not take steps to make it effective?  The Consultative Council which was appointed by my predecessor to advise him on this matter gave a great deal of thought and consideration to the information which was available to them from a great number of sources.  Having studied this, they came forward with that recommendation.</P>
    <P>Surely they did not assume that their recommendation would be rendered nugatory by the action of an association and of people who are opposed to the general principle of fluoridation, who would be able to go around every local authority with the sort of misrepresentation that we listened to last day from Deputy Ryan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These bodies ranged from the committee of experts which was set up by the World Health Organisation, to the body which was set up by the New Zealand Government and the Council which was set up by my predecessor.  These were all bodies competent to investigate the matter.  They heard evidence at great length.  They sat for months.  In many cases their inquiries extended over years and, as a result of the painstaking investigations which they carried out, they recommended that for the prevention of dental caries among the young the level of fluorine in piped water supplies should be brought up to that of one part per million parts of water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, that recommendation was based upon exhaustive investigations by competent people.  As a result of the study of the reports of such bodies and of the evidence which the Council themselves heard on the matter, they made this recommendation.  In making <Col N="748" /> it, surely they did not want to have this proposal, which they regarded as of great importance from the point of view of the general health of the community, to be made the shuttlecock at a half hour's meeting or even a whole night's meeting of a local authority, where the sort of arguments we listened to from Deputy Ryan on the Second Stage would be passed back and forward with no person really understanding, indeed with the majority of people not understanding, what all the bother was about?</P>
    <P>If we were to accept that interpretation of what the Council had in mind when they made this recommendation it would, I think, be a reflection upon the competency of the Council to investigate a matter of this sort because, on the grounds upon which this is sought to be left to the decision of every local authority in the country, we would not have appointed the Council at all.  The Minister for Health could have asked that every local authority would consider this matter at a particular meeting on a particular night and devote an hour, an hour and a half, or two hours to a study of the whole thing and that it would stand or fall by the decision then taken, having listened to people like Deputy Ryan who make these flamboyant, completely irresponsible speeches.</P>

      <P>As I said, it would be a reflection on the Council to leave a decision as to whether or not their recommendations were to be made effective to a short meeting at which, perhaps, there would be a mass of misrepresentation.  Members of a local authority are elected for quite a different purpose&mdash;I should not say &ldquo;for quite a different purpose&rdquo;, but on quite a different basis, as good citizens knowing how public affairs should be run and administered but, in the mass, knowing very little about abstruse scientific problems.  This is a highly scientific and complicated problem and the proposal now before the House is that, in effect, we should declare that this Fluorine Consultative Council did not know what they were <Col N="749" /> talking about and, though they made this recommendation, that the final word must rest with the county council or health authority acting for its own particular area.</P>
      <P>Let us see what qualifications the Consultative Council had to advise the Government and the Minister on this. The members of the Council consisted of the City Engineer of Dublin, the Assistant Chief Engineering Adviser of the Department of Local Government, the Lecturer in Dental Surgery of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the Deputy City Medical Officer of Health for Dublin, a principal officer from the Department of Health, Dr. J.A. Drum, research chemist, who has conducted investigations into fluorine in water supplies in Ireland under the auspices of the Medical Research Council; the Professor of Dental Surgery, University College, Dublin; Mr. M.G. Durcan, member of the Pharmaceutical Society who happened to be a member of Ballina Urban District Council; the Lecturer in Dental Pathology, University College, Cork; the Lecturer in Dental Surgery in Trinity College, Dublin; the chairman of the Westmeath County Council, the Senior Geologist, Geological Survey Office of the Department of Industry and Commerce; the Dental Adviser of the Department of Health, the Waterford City Medical Officer, the Dublin Assistant City and County Manager, the Superintending Senior Research Officer, Veterinary Research Laboratory of the Department of Agriculture, a senior medical inspector of the Department of Health, and an officer of the Department of Health appointed as secretary to the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people, at least, came to their work fortified with prior knowledge of what had been done elsewhere, knowledge of the problem that had to be dealt with and, of course, with the professional qualifications to consider it.  As a matter of fact some of them, as I have mentioned, were members of local authorities&mdash;the chairman of Westmeath County Council and a member of Ballina Urban Council who, I assume, were put on the Council because they would be able to represent <Col N="750" /> to its professional members the difficulties which might have to be overcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of the Council was that piped water supplies should be fluoridated and, with the exception of that small minority of persons who had administrative experience or who had experience as members of local authorities, the great majority of the Council appointed by my predecessor had professional qualifications enabling them to investigate this matter and come to a conclusion on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They were excellent appointments.  We are agreed on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And the recommendations were equally excellent.  I gather we are agreed on that.  The only question remaining is whether these excellent recommendations of theirs are to be made effective or whether the whole thing is to be thrown into the melting pot and disposed of at a meeting of voluntary servants of the public who represent the people in their area but who are not chosen to determine and decide upon an issue of this sort.  It is a question of whether we are going to allow this recommendation, which all of us who studied this matter know is of great importance from the point of view of the dental health and, aye, the general health of the community, whether we are going to leave that recommendation to the mercy of a decision, perhaps a snap decision, by a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that is merely a way of getting out of our responsibilities.  This Council was set up by the Minister for Health to consider a problem vital to the health of the community.  They having reported, if the Minister feels he is bound to accept their recommendation to fluoridate the piped public water supplies, then, in my opinion, he is bound to come here and ask the Oireachtas to give to him the authority to make that recommendation effective. It will not be made effective if we ourselves decide that the Bill will be <Col N="751" /> permissive and not mandatory upon the local authority.  For that reason I would ask the House to reject these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know who are these ignorant councillors to which the Minister refers. Do Deputy Séan Brady, Deputy Phil Brady and Deputy P.J. Burke suddenly become endowed with all sorts of knowledge because they happen to sit here instead of sitting in the local authority to which they were also elected?  I see sitting behind the Minister six or seven members of local authorities.  Is the Minister going to call these men, on whose assistance he is relying now to make this Bill mandatory, is he going to call them a lot of ignoramuses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who are not capable of discussing this or taking a decision if they consider it at local authority or health authority level?  We have Deputy Phil Brady, Deputy Brennan from Wicklow, Deputy P.J. Burke, Deputy Gogan, Deputy Healy and Deputy Davern, all members of local authorities.  Are these men not capable of coming to a decision at their own local authorities? Are they not capable of hearing the arguments for and against fluoridation of water in their local authorities and making up their minds about it?  Are they not capable, as members of local authorities presumably in touch with those they represent, of ascertaining the views and feelings of the people they represent; and with those views and feelings are they not capable of coming to a decision on what the Minister describes as a highly complicated question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These men are not ignoramuses.  I would hate to witness the scene at a Fianna Fáil meeting if the Minister for Health came along and made the kind of speech he has made here about members of local authorities.  We have had another coming in to listen since the Minister sat down, so he should not make that kind of speech again. Deputy Loughman's particular local <Col N="752" /> authority was one of the local authorities that considered this question and decided to recommend to the Minister that he should not proceed with this Bill.  The local authorities are well able to consider this matter, under stand the pros and cons of the argument and give their recommendations to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deny the Minister any debating point he thinks he may have arising out of the Report of the Consultative Council.  We disagree as to the meaning of the recemmendations in paragraph 41 of the Report.  I do not mind whether the Minister is right or I am right.  I say that the Council asked the Minister to bring in enabling legislation; the Minister says they did not, that they asked him to bring in mandatory legislation.  I do not mind who is right.  I think, quite apart from the particular wording or phrasing of any recommendation in the Consultative Council's Report, there are very weighty arguments which were put to the Minister across the floor of this House as to why he should not bring in a mandatory measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that every competent authority who considered this matter decided in favour of fluoridation. I do not believe that is so.  I think the Minister is making altogether too sweeping a statement when he says that.  Surely it is known to the Minister&mdash;at least it should be known to him since the discussion on the Second Reading here&mdash;that there is a very definite controversy in practically every country in the world in which this question was considered.  There are those who argue for it and those who argue against it.  There is a difference of opinion among the medical authorities. The experts differ as to the value of a scheme of fluoridation of water, on the one hand, and the harmful effects which such a scheme might have, on the other.  There is no doubt at all, despite a reference the Minister made on the Second Reading, that this whole thing is still at an experimental stage.  Some of the communities which accepted the idea some years ago have since rejected it.  They have had second thoughts on it.  There are valid arguments against it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> In that situation where there are at least valid arguments&mdash;and the Minister cannot deny the validity and force of the arguments against the fluoridation of water&mdash;in that situation surely it is not right that the Minister should come here and say to those who disagree with his views regarding the value of fluoridation: &ldquo;It does not matter whether you are right or wrong or how strongly you feel.  I am going to have my way.  I am going to get the Fianna Fáil Party to come into the division lobbies behind me and force this Bill on you whether you want it or not.&rdquo;  That is what the Minister is doing, in face of the certain knowledge&mdash;because he has that now&mdash;that there are a great number of people in this country who honestly fear the effect of the measure the Minister is proposing, who fear it from the point of view of their own health and the health of their children and those under their charge, who want to honour their obligations in the matter of the dental care of their children without interference or dictation from the Minister or any other Deputy in the Fianna Fáil benches. That is what is at issue here.  It does not matter what the precise wording of the Council's report is.  Those arguments exist and they are genuine arguments. Those fears exist and they are genuine fears.  The Minister is overriding that simply by bringing in a measure to compel local authorities to do this.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay discussion of this amendment but when the Minister says that every competent authority who has looked at that proposal favours it I think I am entitled to draw his attention to the fact that a body of people in America drawn from the medical and dental professions set up an independent board to evaluate the idea of adding fluorine to water in America and they published their findings.  At the time this document was published there were about 1,500 people connected with the medical and dental professions in America who subscribed to the statement and to the findings which were published by that Committee.</P>
    <P>I think it is worth while for the <Col N="754" /> House to know briefly what these people thought of the scheme for adding fluorine to the water.  I am quoting from the statement by the <i>ad hoc</i> medical-dental committee which was set up on the evaluation of fluoridation and which was published, I think, in February, 1957.  They said:</P>
    <P>We, the undersigned, are opposed to the fluoridation of public water supplies.  As members of the medical, dental and related public health professions, we are as concerned as anyone over the prevalence of teeth decay, and as anxious that it be prevented; but each of us, for some or all of the reasons set forth here and discussed more fully in the appended memorandum believes that fluoridation of public water supplies is not a proper means of attempting such prevention.</P>
    <P>1.  Positive proofs of the safety of fluoridation are required.  None has been offered.</P>
    <P>2.  The so-called therapeutic concentration of fluoride, arbitrarily established at 1 ppm, in drinking water, is in the toxic range.</P>
    <P>3.  Dental fluorosis, the first obvious symptom of chronic fluoride toxicity in children is an inevitable result of fluoridation.  The evidence reveals that large numbers of the population may be afflicted, and with varying degrees of damage.</P>
    <P>4.  The determination of whether damage resulting from dental fluorosis is &ldquo;objectionable&rdquo; is a matter for the person whose teeth are affected, and not for the arbitrary assertion of public officials.</P>
    <P>5.  The conceivable rôle of fluoride as an insidious factor in chronic disease has been evaded by the proponents. A substantial amount of evidence indicates such a possibility. Properly planned long term studies are required to determine the possible comprehensive association of fluoride with chronic disease.</P>
    <P>6.  Fluoridation imposes an extraordinary risk on certain individuals who by reasons of occupation, environmental circumstances, state of health, dietary habits, etc., are <Col N="755" /> already exposed to a relatively high intake of fluoride.</P>
    <P>7.  Fluoridation is compulsory mass medication without precedent. Mass therapy cannot ignore the possibility of &ldquo;mass&rdquo; side reactions.</P>
    <P>8.  The function of a public water supply is to provide pure, safe water for everybody, not to serve as a vehicle for drugs.</P>
    <P>9.  The rôle and efficiency of fluoride in dental caries reduction is a matter of active controversy; whatever the outcome, there are less hazardous and more efficient ways of obtaining such benefits as fluoride may offer than by putting it into the public water supply.</P>
    <P>I think every one of those points raised in that statement published in 1957 or 1958 is as valid today as it was then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And they were not valid then.  That is the answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We can examine that at as great a length as the Minister desires.  I believe that they were valid then and that they are valid now.  Quite apart from the nine points mentioned there, I believe there is another argument mentioned only incidentally in one of the points.  That is the ethical argument, that neither the Minister nor anyone else has the right to impose medication on people whether they want it or not.  That is what the Minister is doing if he forces this Bill through the House on a mandatory basis as he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a great deal of delay in introducing this Bill and I gave the Minister credit for delaying it because I assumed that he wanted to acquaint himself perfectly with the subject and evaluate the arguments, pro and con. The opening of the Second Reading discussion was prior to the local elections last June and I asked the Minister then: why not test the views of the people and find out by means of the local elections&mdash;or by referendum held in conjunction with the local elections&mdash;what the ordinary people who will be affected by this Bill think about it, whether they are prepared to <Col N="756" /> allow themselves to be made guinea pigs and have medicine forced down their throats, whether they want it or not?  If the Minister wants to act in that way he can do so, because he has the power and the numbers behind him to force this Bill through the Oireachtas, but I think he will find that, even from the political point of view, it is not wise for any Minister in this country to act in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to correct one statement made by Deputy O'Higgins.  I am not a member of any public body which passed a resolution concerning fluoridation of water.  The only public body of which I am a member is Clonmel Corporation.  I must confess that Tipperary Urban Council sent me a resolution asking me to vote against this matter and I wrote stating that I was going to support the measure and pointing out the reasons for doing so.  They had attacked it on the two or three grounds running through all the speeches, compulsory medication &mdash; compulsory poisoning, practically&mdash;of the people, no proper control of the quantity any person would take.</P>
      <P>I wrote to them expressing my views and since then I have heard nothing from the Urban District Council of Tipperary.  I am sure that if they were serious in the examination of the measure before condemning it they would have communicated with me again.  In fact, I had to point out to them that I felt the Tipperary Urban Council was not a competent body to express an opinion on this question.  I still believe that, as the Minister said, public bodies are not the proper people to decide whether or not this particular treatment should be given generally.  I told the members of Clonmel Corporation that I did not feel they were competent to judge in this particular matter and I could apply the same arguments to the members of Tipperary Urban Council for whom I have a great respect but I believe they were led away by strange stories they heard or read without giving any particular thought to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading I heard it said that this was compulsory medication. <Col N="757" /> There has been compulsory medication for quite a long time and I want to point out that I lived in the county Deputy Esmonde represents where there was tremendous opposition to compulsory vaccination which I regard as compulsory medication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps there is, but it is still the same thing.  I pointed out to Deputy Ryan on that occasion that we did put chlorine into the water for the purpose for purification and in fact I met people who wanted to use iodine instead of chlorine for other reasons.  We have been doing these things for the purpose of giving people natural drinking water free from very many impurities.  I queried Deputy Ryan on the question of pure water. I do not want to go into the matter from the scientific point of view; even distilled water to me is not entirely pure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pure water means something entirely different.  We regard pure drinking water as water which will not harm the individual.  I think the Minister is adopting a very wise course in view of the advice he has had from competent experts to save people from the damage and expense involved in dental caries.  Practically every child now suffers one way or another from his teeth.  If the present situation continues, the number requiring false teeth will keep increasing.  I hope the Minister will succeed in benefiting people by this slight addition of fluorine to public water supplies. Deputy Ryan called it rat poison.  It is sickening to have to listen to that kind of argument in a deliberative assembly.  No Deputy should seek to suggest that the Minister and the House want to give the people rat poison.  Surely there are other arguments which could be advanced if the Deputy wishes to resist the passage of this legislation.  From a logical angle, he could have dealt with the Bill as <Col N="758" /> one which seeks to benefit the people. I support the Bill one hundred per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to repeat to some extent the observations I made on the Second Reading. When I was Minister for Health I set up this Consultative Council.  As the Minister has said, it was a body composed of persons of knowledge and experience who would consider this vexed question of fluoridation very fully.  I have little doubt that the Council considered the various views advanced for and against.  With certain exceptions, certain reservations, the Council recommended fluoridation of public water supplies.  Personally, I would be impressed by their recommendation but I read the recommendation&mdash;this is something which just cannot be shrugged off as of no importance&mdash;as being in favour of the amendment now proposed.  I cannot find any other meaning in paragraph 41 other than that they were satisfied the proper course to adopt was to enable local authorities, which desired to do so, to fluoridate public water supplies. The Minister says that is not the meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have thought that we had reached a stage now in which these reports are common form.  There was a member of the Department acting as Secretary.  Presumably he was charged with the duty of writing the report. In paragraph 41, the report recommends the introduction of any legislation which may be necessary to enable local authorities to discharge this function of fluoridation.  That clearly implies that the Council, having considered the views on both sides, having had in mind the reservation of two of its members on ethical grounds, decided that it would recommend, while it favoured fluoridation, that local authorities should be entitled to fluoridate public water supplies, if they wished.  Had they wanted to go further and do what the Minister says they intended to do, then paragraph 41 would read: &ldquo;The Council recommends the introduction of legislation making it obligatory on local authorities to fluoridate their public water supply.&rdquo;  That would have been the recommendation had the Council had <Col N="759" /> it in mind that the proper course for the Government to adopt was to bring in legislation making it mandatory to fluoridate public water supplies.  The Council made no such recommendation.</P>
    <P>As the person who set up this Council, I would accept their recommendations in full.  Where we differ with the Minister is in the Minister's rejection of the recommendation made by the Council.  The Minister cannot blow hot and cold.  He has praised the personnel.  He has said they were a well-appointed body, well fitted to deal with this matter.  Nevertheless, on this pivotal point in their report, he turns the recommendation aside and seeks to do something the Council never had in mind; he seeks to bring in legislation making it mandatory on all local authorities to add fluorine to their water supplies.  This is dangerous ground and I urge on the Minister to take care where he is going.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to have a surfeit of bureaucracy.  I fear that is what we are getting here.  I fear the Minister is being told by his advisers: &ldquo;Do not bother about enabling legislation.  A neater and better way to do it is to make it a statutory obligation on local authorities to fluoridate&rdquo;.  Of course, that is neater.  Of course, it is simpler. The Minister can press a button and everybody must do what he is told. But the Minister is acting contrary to a body of public spirited citizens who also advised in this matter.</P>
    <P>This is an exercise in bureaucracy to which I do not subscribe.  It is wrong.  There are people who have strong feelings in this matter.  I think they are wrong.  I accept the recommendation here.  But these people have strong feelings and it is ordinary elementary justice that such views and feelings should not be disregarded.  If fluoridation is a good thing, we need not go further than enabling local authorities to fluoridate if they wish.</P>
    <P>Deputy Loughman referred to compulsion under certain other statutes. That is an entirely different thing. There are diseases which endanger society.  If smallpox broke out there <Col N="760" /> could be an enormous social problem involving the welfare of the community. Because of that it is the law that every person must subject himself to vaccination.  That is a different problem.  There is no analogy.  This is something new.  It is something about which people have strong feelings, so strong that the Government of which I was a member authorised me to have the matter examined by a body of experts.  That body recommended &mdash;<i>dubitante</i> in the case of two of its members&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would urge the Minister that the point of view we express here&mdash;it is the point of view expressed by the Council&mdash;is eminently reasonable and we should, therefore, go no further than giving power to local authorities to fluoridate public water supplies if they so wish.</P>

      <P>I want to deal first with the point raised by Deputy Michael O'Higgins that there was a strong ethical objection to the proposal contained in the recommendation of the consultative council.  My predecessor, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, to some extent faintly echoed that suggestion when he said that two members of the Council had signed the report doubtfully.  That does not happen to be true.  If the Deputy would look at their signatures he would see the reservations they have with regard to the details of paragraph 37 and if he then turns to paragraph 37 itself he will see what they had in mind.  The Council carefully considered the matter and carefully considered the advice sought and the report goes on to say:</P>
      <P>the Council is satisfied that there is no ethical objection to the fluoridation of water supplies within the margin of safety recommended in this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two lay men were not going to challenge the authoritative advice received.  Their objection was that <Col N="761" /> they were not bound by their terms of reference to consider that aspect of the matter.  They felt that in doing so they would be going outside their terms of reference.  If their objection was that in fact the practice would be unethical then they would not have signed the report.  They would have signed a minority report to the effect that it was unethical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The next point I would like to deal with has regard to what the Council had in mind when they made the recommendation contained in paragraph 41.  Let us read that recommendation again:</P>
      <P>The Council is in doubt as to whether local authorities have the necessary statutory authority to add fluorine to public water supplies.</P>
      <P>As I have said the doubt they had was as to whether it was within the power of local authorities, acting as sanitary authorities, to add fluorine.  Because this is a health measure, local authorities, acting as sanitary authorities, might not have the power to operate this health measure.  Remember that they are acting as agents of the Minister for Health and the whole point was whether they had the necessary statutory authority to carry out, as sanitary authorities and normally responsible to the Minister for Local Government, the directions of the Minister for Health.  That is the difficulty which the members of the Council had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to cast doubt on what the Minister is saying but we must appreciate that he is giving us his own view on what the Council had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  This is a question of the proper construction of the paragraph.  Having said that I go on and take the next sentence which says:</P>
      <P>the Council recommends the introduction of any legislation necessary to discharge this function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Michael O'Higgins and Deputy Tom O'Higgins have argued <Col N="762" /> that what the Council intended was that permissive legislation should be introduced to enable local authorities to fluoridate water if they so desired. In that connection the first thing we have to bear in mind is that this report was prepared by a body of men who numbered amongst them persons who have experience in drafting memoranda, minutes, and reports.  There were officers of my Department and officers of the Department of Local Government and other members of the Council who were equally alive to the fact that a recommendation should be carefully drafted.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks in support of the amendment Deputy Tom O'Higgins said that what the second sentence means was this:</P>
    <P>It recommends the introduction of any legislation which may be necessary to enable local authorities</P>
    <P>Then the Deputy interpolated:</P>
    <P>who desire to do so to discharge this function.</P>
    <P>I think that if the Council had intended that this question of whether to fluoridate or not to fluoridate should be left to the sole discretion of the local authority they would have written into the second sentence of paragraph 41 some phrase which would have made it quite clear that the statutory authority was merely to enable those local authorities who desire to do so to fluoridate the water supply.  But they did not write into that sentence the phrase:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those who desire to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They left it in a form from which it is quite clear that any legislation that might be passed should clear up all doubt as to whether the local authorities, acting as the sanitary authority, have power to act on the directions of the Minister for Health and fluoridate the water supply.  That was the sole purpose they had in mind when they made that recommendation.  I submit again, that if they had wanted to make this legislation permissive in the sense in which it had been argued from the other side of the House they would have made that quite clear in the phraseology they used in drafting paragraph 41.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> For that reason I would ask the Dáil to reject these amendments.  I do not want to go over all the ground we covered on the Second Reading of the Bill for that would waste the time of the House, but may I say that Deputy Michael O'Higgins, when he read a document which he said had the authority of 1,500 dentists and doctors in America, forgot that there are approximately 216,000 physicians and 96,000 dentists in that country who are represented by dental and other professional associations which have very strongly recommended that piped public supplies of water be fluoridated.</P>
    <P>Of course you will always get a minority of people opposed to any proposal that is put up; it is always easy to get minorities opposed to many things.  Nobody wants to override the rights of minorities, but when you have a minority opposing some public recommendation merely because they have strong objections, which in so far as certain individuals are concerned&mdash; and I do not want Deputy Ryan to misrepresent what I am about to say; he is quite capable of doing that&mdash;are founded wholly on prejudice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making myself very clear.  A minority has an objection here but I suggest their objection is not well founded.  Their personal feelings, their personal objections may be very strong, but the foundation upon which they base it seems to be very weak.  After all, the community also has a duty to itself and to the children of the community.  When, therefore, there is a process which, after most exhaustive investigation, has been recommended to us by the highest scientific authorities as being for the public good, surely we cannot deny the children of the community this protection against a disease which is rampant among us and which, apart from the suffering and inconvenience it causes is, by the unanimous opinion of the medical profession, a source of general ill-health and, consequently, of economic loss to the individual and the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> The net issue is; would we be justified, having regard to the strong recommendations we have received, in depriving our children of the protection which a fluoridated public water supply would give them, even in face of objections from certain individuals in the country?  Are we entitled to let the strong feelings of individuals, having regard to the fact that those feelings are not well-founded, override the good of the community as a whole?  I think we are not.  In a matter of this sort, the community must decide whether it is going to accept this protection.</P>

They do not send representatives to the local authorities to discuss and determine complicated questions of public health policy.  They have not been allowed to decide such questions in the past.  For instance, when the Government decided many years ago that a local authority medical service should be set up, and when the members of the local authorities very strongly objected to that service and, indeed, refused to appoint county medical officers of health, the Government of the day, of which some Deputies of the present Opposition were members, had no hesitation in compelling the local authorities to establish these posts and to make these appointments.

      <P>Perhaps I used the wrong word.  We did not, because a strange thing is that there were people of all Parties who took up a non-co-operative attitude on the matter and opposed the policy with regard to these services of the then Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am arguing now is that ill-informed opposition to health proposals is not unusual in the history of the development of medical services in this or any other State.  It has happened very often.  Therefore when you have an issue which can be easily and readily misrepresented it is wise to have it dealt with and decided by those who have the leisure to discuss it; who have opportunities for making themselves acquainted with all sides of the proposal and who can, I hope, deliberate upon it calmly.  That is why I was saying that however estimable the members of local authorities are, they have not the time to consider matters like this.  They are unpaid; they have no allowance for expensive studies; they have to take time off from their own business; they have very little leisure to devote to the study of such a very complex matter and, therefore <Col N="766" />&mdash;I say it again; I make no apology&mdash;they are not competent to discuss a matter of this sort in the detailed way in which it is discussed and examined by these expert committees established to consider the merits or demerits of proposals of this sort.  In every case where there has been an authoritative official body set up to consider the problem of fluoridation they have without exception recommended that it be carried out.</P>
    <P>I referred on the last occasion to the recommendations of the committee of experts.  I have referred today to the findings of our own Consultative Council.  There is the New Zealand Report on the matter.  I have here a note.  I just happen to have it.  It is in the <i>Netherlands News</i> of last August.  Most Deputies, I am sure, receive this bulletin and I will quote from it.  There is a paragraph in it headed &ldquo;Fluoride Fight against Dental Decay&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Netherlands Minister for Social Affairs and Public Health has announced that a decree is shortly to be published in the State's interest authorising the addition of fluoride to drinking water to fight dental decay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to answer the Minister if he will allow me.  He has asked me a fair question.  The reason I gave the quotation was simply that the Minister had said in effect that there was no-one of any competence opposed to the idea of fluoridation.  I quoted that to show that the Minister's statement was, as I said, too sweeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh.  Well, I still say there is no-one of comparable competence to those who have been selected by the various Governments to investigate and advise upon this matter. So, we will put it this way, that Deputy O'Higgins has quoted 1,500 people of lesser competence and I have quoted the opinions of the most competent persons in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, I was going on to quote from the Report of the United Kingdom <Col N="768" /> Mission on The Fluoridation of Domestic Water Supplies in North America.  Here is what they have said:</P>
    <P>Epidemiological studies in America have demonstrated beyond doubt that among children and adults who have been born and brought up in areas where the drinking water contains fluoride at the level of one part per 1,000,000 or more there is much less dental caries than in areas where the water is free from fluoride.  Compared with areas where the drinking water contains little or no fluoride&mdash;</P>
    <P>as is the case, unfortunately, with us&mdash;</P>
    <P>there is about 60 per cent. less dental caries among children aged 12 to 14 years and about six times as many children have permanent teeth which are free from caries (18 to 29 per cent. compared to about 4 per cent.)  A few studies among adults both in England and the United States show that the effect of fluoride persists up to about 40 years of age.</P>
    <P>They go on then to recommend in general that they should adopt fluoridation in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The same way with the Report of the Royal Medical Board of Sweden.  The overwhelming mass of highly expert professional opinion is in favour of this measure and the only question now that is between us, apparently, is as to whether we should give effect to what I believe to be the real purport of paragraph 41 of the recommendations of the Consultative Council and confer upon the local authorities the necessary statutory power to add fluoride to the public water supplies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To listen to the Minister one would think that at long last we had a panacea, that we had the cure for the common cold, for headache, for stomach pains, wind, and dirty tongues.  We do not dispute that fluoridation will improve the teeth of children, but it will not prevent dental decay.  It will delay it and it is all wrong that this House should be asked to sit in judgment on a matter such as this.  The truth is that the Minister <Col N="769" /> does not want the House to criticise him at all.  He does not want any debate here.  He wants us to accept his opinion and the opinion of some people who are in favour of fluoridation without allowing us to examine the results of valid tests conducted by expert people which show the dangerous toxic effects which fluoridation has on people.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister has said it is quite clear there are two points of view on this matter.  Therefore we of Fine Gael say it is not right that one man, or a Government or a Party supporting a Government should say to the Irish people; &ldquo;You are going to take this poisonous substance in the water whether you want it or not&rdquo;, and that is precisely what the Minister is doing.</P>
      <P>It amounts to this: a number of persons who were appointed on a council have read a number of reviews on this matter of dental decay and fluoridation and the Minister says: &ldquo;I am going to present to the Irish people a bottle of medicine containing sodium fluoride and they can drink it in any quantity they like.  One person can drink ten gallons and another can drink an egg cup full of it.  This will cure dental caries and it will have precisely the same effect whether you drink ten gallons of it or an egg cup full.&rdquo;  That to my mind is medical lunacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imagine a doctor coming into a house and without examining the people there leaving a bottle of medicine and saying: &ldquo;You can drink that in any way you like.  Little Johnny can swallow the whole lot and mammy can drink the dregs and you will be free from stomach pain ever after.&rdquo; If that be possible, I cannot understand why so many expert people throughout the length and breadth of the world have had second thoughts on this matter and conducted tests over several years past which indicate that there are dangers in relation to the use of fluoridated water supplies. It is not true to say that one part per million is safe, because some animals have been treated with one part per million and they have died <Col N="770" /> sooner than expected, and others developed ailments which were not developed in similar animals which were not consuming fluoridated water supplies. No matter what the Minister may like to accuse me of, it is clear that some expert opinion is very much against it.</P>
    <P>In referring to my speech on the Second Stage the Minister used such phrases as &ldquo;a jumble of irrelevancies and reckless rhetoric.&rdquo;  He said that my speech was demagogic and stupid. I was accused of trading upon ignorance and conscience.  I was supposed to have recited a farrago of nonsense. These are not the kind of remarks which ought to come from some person who is asking the Irish people to consider a serious medical question, and I do not intend to compete with the Minister on that level.  He did say earlier that this question could not be discussed at any lower level.  I can only take it he was referring to his own level of conducting a debate.  This matter is far too serious for that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has deliberately and unfairly referred to the report of a Committee of the World Health Organisation as evidence that the World Health Organisation supported his theories.  It is clearly printed on the front of this report, available through the Minister's generosity in our own Library, that the views in it are not necessarily representative of the decisions or the stated policy of the World Health Organisation.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that is all&mdash;some rude word which I will not repeat.  Either it means what it says or it does not.  I am quite sure that a body like the World Health Organisation would not print that statement unless it meant what it said. The Minister has tried to bowl us over by quoting to us the eminent men who sat on the Consultative Council.  They are all eminent men in their own field. I do not accept their prescriptions for myself or for my children or for any Irish man, woman or child whom they have not medically examined.  That is the basis of my objection.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> It may be said that it is only one in 100,000 who may react unfavourably, who may be allergic to sodium fluoride.  I think the number of people who react to penicillin or acromycin, other dangerous toxic drugs, is also infinitesimally small but the fact is these drugs are not given to people except under examination and when a doctor is watching carefully all the time.  Here we are being asked to accept a poisonous substance without this minute medical care.  Admittedly it is a very small and insignificant amount that is being put into the water supply but one of the aspects of this which should give us food for thought is that as we get older our capacity to excrete the poisonous substance from our system declines and after a period of 40 or 50 years a person may have a considerable and dangerous amount of sodium fluoride in his system.</P>

      <P>That may be so but I have a fundamental objection to poison being given to myself and my children by people who have not examined us and do know what effect it will have on us.  It is not true for the <Col N="772" /> Minister to say that a minority are trying to prevent a benefit being conferred on the public.  I do not care a hoot how many people take sodium chloride.  If the Minister took a dessert spoonful of it many people would be glad but, if a desert spoonful is lethal, I should not be glad because the Minister has his uses.  However, I am dead against anybody compelling me and my children to take it.</P>
      <P>I think it is against the interests of all the young children in Ireland that we should pass a compulsory measure telling parents that their children should drink fluoridated water when there is a cheaper, reasonably efficient, alternative system available under which they can provide fluorine for their children in tablet form.  I believe that if we could spread the responsibility of thinking on this matter we should get somewhere and that is why I am in favour of the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be rather difficult to give it very briefly.  The Schedule to the Bill specifies the various matters that must be provided for in the superannuation schemes made in pursuance of Section 16 of the Bill. Those are, in fact, the standard provisions of the type common to superannuation schemes for members of State-sponsored Bodies.  They are so designed to be applicable to members appointed without any previous superannuation entitlement in respect of service with State or semi-State bodies.  They are also designed to <Col N="782" /> cover, in respect of the present Chairman of the Board, service in the Civil Service for the purposes of superannuation on retirement from the Board.  These are purely the standard procedures.  There is nothing exceptional in them.  They are in line with the superannuation arrangements made under the Superannuation Act, 1956.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no, there are some questions that I particularly want to have disposed of.  Questions were asked on the Second Reading in regard to the surplus generating capacity of the Board and the replies given do not seem to me to meet the points at all. It may be possible to get questions down in time to get information before the next Stage.  It will certainly be possible to get them down before the Fifth Stage.  The Minister could expedite matters by giving us replies to questions along the following lines: What is the installed capacity in each of the Board's stations?  What has been&mdash;so to speak&mdash;the greatest peak load, over the last three years say, which each of the stations had to face and what is the percentage of the potential of the station which has been absorbed at any time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Points were made here on the Second Reading which I understand were quite accurate&mdash;that the way in which the stations have been erected for some years past has been that wherever a peat or turf burning station has been erected there has also been supplied an equivalent generating capacity by means of other fuel.  In other words, we erect a station and we get 100 per cent.  stand-by capacity.  I do not understand how the Minister can say, or how the Chairman of the Board can assure him, that we had no reserve capacity and therefore had to build stations.  I understand that the general engineering view is that the stations already erected would provide for all our needs for another decade. If that is so, I see no need to indulge in further expenditure on stations.  It would appear to me that there is great loss involved if the heavy capital expenditure entailed in these stations is undertaken when only two-thirds or three-quarters of that capacity is needed in any year.  The expenditure <Col N="784" /> made would not be remunerated. Surely that is information that the Minister can give.</P>
    <P>The only question that I should personally like to raise at a later stage&mdash; on the Fifth Stage&mdash;is whether it is appropriate to proceed with rural electrification to any great extent. Information has reached me that in certain parts of the West of Ireland where stations have been provided at considerable cost, the use made of electricity is that the people switch on the light provided when they are going into the nearest shop to buy bottled gas for heating and cooking.  That indicates that their view is that electricity, even at the subsidised rate, is not sufficiently cheap for them.  They have other means.  If that is happening in many areas, it seems to me that we could just as well arrange to provide bottled gas which apparently could give a cheaper service than electricity which is heavily subsidised by urban consumers.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why we are asked to pass this Bill at all.  Surely it is, as the council says, that there are doubts about the legality of adding fluorine to piped water supplies? Surely if this was going to do all the good the Minister speaks of and none of the harm the people on the other side of the House speak of, there would be no need to come to this House to get permission to do it?  I understand local authorities at the moment have permission to spend money to provide pure water or, shall I say, safe water to consumers, but it now appears that the council has some doubts about the matter.  Or, is it that they have been looking further abroad than the Minister and that they find that in America some 60,000,000 people have rejected the fluoridation of water supplies?  I am not sure of the precise figure but it is in the region of the number of people who voted for either of the Presidential candidates yesterday in the American election.</P>

Earlier, he did not hesitate to hurl vulgar epithets at myself and other members on this side of the House in relation to what we said on the Second Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully agree but on these amendments I say it is apparent that it is felt by the council that the law might be broken by a local authority if it did this without the sanction of this House.  I also say that this House cannot override the Constitution.  Even if this House for the time being seems to permit a local authority to override the Constitution, there is another place in the land where the validity of this proposal can be challenged.  I would hope that the President would refer this Bill to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That scarcely arises on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises in this way: we are here to protect the rights of individuals and we have no power to give to any local body something which conflicts with the rights of individuals. We should certainly not compel someone else to do wrong.  It is bad enough to permit a body to do wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the amendment, no order should be imposed until a supply of pure <Col N="787" /> water is available.  That is No. 3. The Minister shall make a survey; I do not understand how the Constitution arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A supply of pure water must be available before the order is made mandatory on the local authority.  I do not see how a constitutional issue arises on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the constitutional issue is the very foundation of this.  I say that it would be wrong for a local authority to do this unless this Dáil and the Seanad give them that authority. Further, I say that we cannot compel someone to do something which is against the Constitution.  It is bad enough to permit them to do wrong, but it might, at least, be cheaper to assert one's rights against a local authority than it would be to assert them against the State.  On that account, there is something to be said for the amendment.  With respect, I think the amendment is a good deal more relevant than the provocative remarks of the Minister earlier on this section.</P>
      <P>It was said by a number of speakers that we were just as much in error as those who originally opposed the introduction of chlorine in water supplies and those who originally opposed pasteurisation.  I challenge the Minister, or anyone in this House, to quote to me any local authority, here or anywhere in the world, which voted out chlorination where it had been adopted, or pasteurisation.  There are literally thousands of communities which have voted out fluoridation of water supplies. What has happened in other countries is surely an argument why we should not compel our local authorities to do something which has been rejected elsewhere.  It would be infinitely preferable to let the responsibility lie on each local authority so that the people could exercise their judgment upon those responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that people will have an opportunity of testing the Government on this.  The Minister for Health is not so naive as to pretend that this <Col N="788" /> would be the only problem before the electorate.  Of course, it would not be and it would be far too bedevilled with other issues of equal importance for the people to exercise a clear judgment.  But that would not be the situation if only local authorities were involved.  That is why in America, Britain, New Zealand, Australia, and all these countries the Minister loves so much, the local authorities promptly got the order of the boot for daring to impose fluoridation upon unwilling people.  I would refer to some 76 communities in America which have rejected fluoridation, after having used it, and I trust that the Minister who tried to bowl us over with the degrees he cited will not suggest I am not being relevant.</P>
    <P>The following communities in America have rejected fluoridation, after having used it: Stevans Point, Wisconsin, population 16,564; having used fluoridated water supplies the people there voted by a two to one majority on 14th September, 1950, against fluoridation.  They voted it out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that not be relevant on the Second Stage and not on this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it is quite relevant.  I want to show that throughout the world local authorities have reported against fluoridation.  In relation to this particular section, it is wrong for us to try to compel local authorities to adopt it.  The amendment permits local authorities to exercise a choice now, not after having used fluoride.  That is the important point.</P>

      <P>I want to argue that if they were given permission, local authorities would not fluoridate public water supplies and I am, therefore, opposing any mandatory clause in this Bill.  I want to prove my argument by giving illustrations of local authorities <Col N="789" /> throughout the length and breadth of the world which have refused to avail of the permission when it was given to them.  Many authorities have been quoted on both sides.  If we are to have a fair assessment, each side must be entitled to quote its authorities.</P>
      <P>In Kennerick, Washington, the authority stopped using fluoridated water supplies in August, 1951, after operating it for one year.  In Mount Dora, the people voted by a three to one majority to stop fluoridation after it had been two years in operation. In Williamstown, Massachusetts, the people voted by a three to one majority to stop fluoridation after it had been two months in operation.  In Westby, Wisconsin, the city council voted unanimously to stop fluoridation three and half years after it was put into operation.  In La Crosse, Wisconsin, the city council by a unanimous vote, voted to stop fluoridation after it had been in operation for four months. There, the League of Women Voters petitioned for a referendum in the hope of starting fluoridation again; the people in the referendum voted to stop it by a majority of five to one.</P>
      <P>In Knoxville, Iowa, the people voted by a majority of 868 to 356 to stop fluoridation.  In Sheridan, Wyoming, the people decided by a three to one majority to stop fluoridation after it had been two years in operation. In Northampton, Massachusetts, the people voted to stop fluoridation on 11th March, 1953, after it had been two years in operation.  In Elroy, Wisconsin, the people voted to stop fluoridation in April, 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Fort Belknap, Montana, the people voted to stop fluoridation; I have not got the date.  I know the Minister wants to check all these figures.  In Newmartinsville, Western Virginia, the city council voted to stop fluoridation after it had been two weeks in operation.  In Akron, Ohio, the city council voted 9 to 4 to stop fluoridation after it had been two months in operation.  In Wakeeny, Kansas, fluoridation started on 14th January, 1954, and stopped on the 27th January, 1954, because the citizens complained.  It was thirteen days in operation.  In Tyler, Texas, the <Col N="790" /> people voted by a three to one majority to stop fluoridation after it had been two years in operation.  In Hudson, Massachusetts, the people voted to stop fluoridation on 3rd January, 1954.  It had started in 1952. In Delavan, Wisconsin, the people voted to stop fluoridation on 4th June, 1954, after it had only been six months in operation.</P>

If the Minister resents it, it is unfortunate for him but I think it is essential to let the people know that there are many people who have had experience of fluoridation and who have rejected it.  In Delavan, Wisconsin, the people voted to stop fluoridation on the 4th June, 1954 after it had been six months in operation.  In San Diego, California, the people voted to stop fluoridation by 46,000 to 41,000 in August 1954 after it had been in operation since 1952.  In Del Mar, California, which is under the San Diego water system, fluoridation was stopped in 1954 and in La Jolla, California, and in part of Coronado, California, which are also on the San Diego water system, it was also stopped in 1954.  In San Diequito and Santa Fe, California, the people voted to stop it in 1954.</P>
      <P>In Genesco, Illinois, the people voted to stop fluoridation by 988 votes to 422 on the 9th October, 1954 after it had been in operation since March 1954.  In Greensboro, North Carolina, fluoridation was stopped in February 1954 by 5,545 votes to 4,326 after it had been in operation since 1952.

The 14,600 community of Fulton, New York, voted unanimously to stop fluoridation in June, 1956, because, it was said at the City Council meeting, the meters were corroding.

      <P>The Minister, when speaking on this amendment, presumed <Col N="797" /> to reject the arguments advanced in favour of it by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins and Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.  I have already pointed out that the report of the World Health Organisation which the Minister quoted is not the decision of the organisation but merely of a specialist sub-committee which considered the matter.  We feel that the short period of time during which fluoridation has been in operation in other countries does not justify this House in compelling our local authorities to introduce public water supplies with fluorine in them.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said it is not a question of 15 years' experience of fluoridation of water supplies; I think he said it had gone back to three-quarters of a century.  In fact, a check of the list on page 61 of the Report quoted by the Minister says that 93 per cent. does not go back further than 1940.  No reference in this report which the Minister regards as being the be-all and end-all of the matter suggests that fluoridation has gone back further than 29 years.  The fact is that no local authority has added fluorine to a water supply for any longer period than 15 years.  We believe it is wrong for us in this country to pass in this House a mandatory measure binding all our people in relation to the limited experience of 15 years, when reputable experts have conducted tests on mice which indicate some really damaging general medical effects upon them.</P>
      <P>I have said earlier&mdash;if the Minister tries to suggest that I am saying otherwise, he will have to answer for it elsewhere&mdash;that I do not question for one moment the beneficial effects which a fluoridated water supply may have upon children's teeth but I assert that there are figures to prove that far from protecting the teeth into adult age, a fluoridated water supply means that once decay does set in, the tooth collapses altogether.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier on this Bill to the city of Saint David in Arizona where 50 per cent. of the people between the ages of 15 and 41 have no teeth left in their heads.</P>

      <P>I apologise to you, Sir, that again I followed the Minister in his ramblings.  The Minister has said that the reason he will not make this a permissive Bill is that he is afraid that those who are opposed to the fluoridation of water supplies will get at parochial councillors.  You have ruled against my second amendment on this Bill and on the merits of that, I am not going to enter a discussion at the moment, except to say that it is apparently on the ground that my amendment is opposed to the principle of the Bill.

      <P>That is why we of Fine Gael are so violently opposed to it.  It is a reflection upon a local authority if the Minister thinks that they will not be able to exercise their independent judgment in a matter of this kind.  If the Dublin Corporation or the Donegal County Council or the Galway Corporation or the Kerry County Council decide not to fluoridate <Col N="800" /> their water supply, what right has the Minister to say: &ldquo;You shall do it because I say so&rdquo;?  I think it is very wrong that he should do it, just as I think it would be wrong for a local authority to fluoridate the water supply so long as there is any group of people within the area who have not available to them supplies of water without fluorine in it.</P>
      <P>If the Minister were prepared to authorise local authorities to make dual supplies of water available, one with fluorine in it and the other without fluorine, there might be something to be said for the Bill.  If he were prepared to provide fluorine in tablet form to drop into water as it comes out of the tap, there would be something to be said for the Bill. Apparently he is not prepared to do that.</P>

I cannot understand why the Minister has an objection to a scheme under which the water would come pure into everybody's house and could then be fluoridated by dropping a tablet into it, if you wanted to do it.  It would, according to the statistics available, cost about one-fifth of the cost of fluoridating the water supplies in the manner in which the Minister wants to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to a matter of this kind in which we are going to take poison for 70 years, it is ridiculous for people to be taking umbrage because I take part of the year 1960 to discuss it.  I do not accept figures the Minister quoted last week.</P>
      <P>One of the effects of obliging a health authority under this Bill to fluoridate the water supply is to increase the rates.  A matter of that kind should be left to the discretion of the local council.  It is not a question of saving one section of the community expense.  Every occupant of a house, be it corporation-owned or privately-owned, and every owner of property, has to pay his share of the rates.  The Minister said that the figures for England indicated that the cost per head per year would be between 3½d. and 7½d. per year.  It cannot be disputed by members of the House that, generally speaking, communities in England are larger than they are here, so that we can expect that the costings here will be on a somewhat higher level than they are in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so because it might not be adopted, if it is permissive, and in that event, there would be no charge.  It is most important to decide whether or not we are going to permit local authorities of their own accord to adopt fluoridation or allow them no discretion in the matter.  On the figures quoted by the Minister and with some fifty per cent. of our people already getting public water supplies, it is fantastic for him to suggest that the approximate annual cost will work out at £30,000.  On the figures quoted by the Minister and taking a fair average between 3½d. and 7½d. per head, the cost on the rates in Dublin alone will be 6d. per annum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you for illustrating a perfectly simple matter to the Deputy.  The annual cost of providing a fluoridated water supply in Dublin will mean an increase of 6d. in the £ in the rates.  The Minister ought to be the last in the world to start estimating what it will cost.  Not so long ago, he estimated the additional cost of the health services would be 2/6d. in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Not 6d. in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that it takes the Deputy so long to come round to a point.  On the figures given by the Minister, there will be an increase of 6d. in the £ on the rates, just as it will cost, on the Minister's own figures, between 3½d. and 7½d. per head per person.  If the Deputy will multiply the number of heads in Dublin by a mean mark between 3½d. and 7½d. he will find my figures are correct.  I believe it will cost, within a very short period, at least treble the cost he mentioned in reply to my Question of 3rd November last.</P>
      <P>It is also interesting to discover that in other countries which have introduced compulsory fluoridation of water supplies, the price of sodium fluoride sored immediately fluoridation began.  Therefore, the figures quoted by the Minister, if based on the existing price of sodium fluoride in this country or in the neighbouring country, are open to some very serious doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing we accept the Minister's figures, should we compel local authorities to spend £30,000 per annum in the way the Minister wants it spent for the rather indifferent purpose of delaying the onset of dental caries for a couple of years?  If we were spending an extra £30,000 per <Col N="804" /> annum on increased publicity encouraging parents to attend to their children's teeth and encouraging them to practise proper dental hygiene, we would bring about a considerable decrease in the degree of dental caries in children's teeth.  If we were to devote that £30,000 to research work into the cause of dental caries, we might prevent dental caries altogether without introducing fluoride into the water supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put this point to you, Sir?  The point which Deputy Ryan is making is one which relates to the Second Reading, to the principle of the Bill and not to this point as to whether fluoridation will be compulsory or at the option and discretion of the local authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have complied with your request and I intend to do so. The point I am making is that the choice in these matters should rest with the local authority.  If the local authority decides to spend, say, £10,000 for the good of children's teeth, it should be left to that local authority to decide whether or not to do so by fluoridating the water supply or spending the £10,000 or, say, £2,000 in providing the fluorine in tablet form for those who will benefit by it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or in providing an apple a day for the children.  We have a glut of apples on the home market this year and I would much prefer to see the local authority deciding to spend the money on apples for the good of the children's teeth than in importing a poisonous substance from abroad for the purpose of putting it into the water supply to delay the onset of dental caries for a couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> This is a very important matter.  It is not a question of begrudging people any expenditure to provide them with good teeth, whether they are children or adults.  It is a matter of deciding what is the best way to spend the money and the Minister was rather abusive and critical of local authorities. He suggested earlier that their functions should be limited to the efficient carrying on of existing institutions. He suggested they had no right to initiate any new schemes of social improvement or anything of that kind. He said their duty was to see that existing institutions were run efficiently. Not for one moment do I accept his argument on that score but, supposing we do limit them to that alone, then the amendment is very proper to the Minister's line of thought because it seeks to impose that duty upon local authorities.  In effect it is saying to them that they have a right to elect how they will spend whatever money they collect from the rates.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wanted to make this Bill one for the good of children's health, there are different ways of doing it than the manner he proposes of making this thing mandatory on local authorities.  There are very many other arguments which can be discussed on later Stages of the Bill but we must, on this Stage, rebut the effect of figures quoted by the Minister earlier in the debate and in reply to a Parliamentary Question of mine to-day. He says that 99 per cent. of our children have dental caries.</P>

What the Minister is saying is that it must be done and that is what we, in Fine Gael, are opposing.  We say that it should be the responsibility of the local authorities and, if that were the case, we might find at the end of it that not one local authority would add fluorine to its public water supply.

It is to the credit of the Minister's predecessor that it was approached in that responsible way.  In the first instance, apparently every effort was made, continuing up to the present moment, to get an accurate appraisal of the situation in regard to this question.</P>
      <P>Secondly, a report was furnished by the Consultative Council.  I do not think Deputy Ryan has done any great service to his own Party.  What he has succeeded in doing is to create the impression that Fine Gael will accept no responsibility in a matter like this.  &ldquo;Pass it on&mdash;let somebody else decide it,&rdquo; is their attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Pass it on; evade responsibility; indulge in soap box <Col N="809" /> speeches here and elsewhere quoting figures and lists without any bit of authority behind them.  That kind of irresponsible treatment is then capped by statements in Dáil Éireann designed to disturb public confidence, saying that delaying this Bill would safeguard the health of the people.  There is a most serious matter involved in this and it should not be treated in that childlike&mdash;I am using a charitable word&mdash;way, because I can only characterise Deputy Ryan's treatment of this as very childish indeed.</P>
      <P>What is the actual position here?  As I say, the Minister's predecessor had this matter investigated as it should be investigated.  We have had a very responsible committee of experts, the best people that could be found in the country, to examine the matter and they have reported upon it.  We have also other authorities.  I shall not quote a long list but I want to give my authorities.</P>
      <P>I have here the report of an expert committee on water fluoridation, the report of the first World Health Organisation.  Deputy Ryan tried to make a point out of the note on page one.  However, I note that the Authority authorised the publication of this report, and that is a responsible authority.  There is also the report of the United Kingdom mission on the fluoridation of domestic water supplies.  Here is another responsible document.  As I wish to keep within the rules of order, I shall not quote the recommendations in detail.  However, I would point out that the conclusions of this mission support the Minister in his stand here.  I have here also a document from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare on fluoridation and a statement by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare of America.  Perhaps I might be allowed to give a short quotation:</P>
      <P>Although controlled fluoridation has been proved over and over again to be an inexpensive and completely safe means of preventing 65 per cent. of dental decay, only one out of every four people in the country to-day has this protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on and this might be the answer to some of that long list&mdash;I am <Col N="810" /> sorry; I was giving the wrong quotation.</P>

      <P>The point I wanted to make is that a lot of the charges in the United States were due to the organisation of interests, in many cases completely irresponsible. Remember, there are a variety of reasons and Deputy Ryan has not attempted to sort these reasons.  There are always objections from people who do not like mass action and there may have been objections on grounds of costs.  Deputy Ryan mentioned the corrosion of valves or something like that.  Surely in any scientific investigation or discussion of a matter like that, such factors should be properly analysed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net point I want to make is that here you had the best experts that could be found and here you had the precedents set by other authorities who had the same responsibility in this matter, and on the evidence there <Col N="811" /> is every case for following these precedents.</P>
    <P>We come now to the compulsion or mandatory end of it which is the subject of this amendment.  Here we are up against something one is up against in all public health questions. Is Deputy Ryan aware that today a large number of water supplies are chlorinated?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to make this point.  Chlorine is a vicious poison and was one of the first poisons used in the first World War.  However, when used in small and proper quantities, it is a great help in public health and is a method of safeguarding the population from typhoid and all sorts of other diseases. The chlorination of water supplies has been going on for a long time and has done no damage.  In fact, it has been highly beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Deputy de Valera just deal with the point when he is at it?  Does he not see a distinction between purification and medication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right&mdash;I do.  The point I am answering here is this silly talk about poison in the water supply which we had from Deputy Ryan.  Chlorine is just as poisonous in big quantities.  I want to scotch that dangerous and disturbing suggestion of poisoning the population just because the element fluorine in some form or other can be poisonous in certain quantities. Chlorine, its brother element, can also be very poisonous but beneficial in proper quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having disposed of Deputy Ryan's irresponsible suggestion that there is danger in this, I hope the weight of authority will have effect and that we can come very fairly to what should be the subject of this amendment: <Col N="812" /> should the Minister make this compulsory or not?  I cannot help thinking of campaigns to have compulsory measures taken in the past.  One instance that jumps to mind is the case of vaccination for smallpox.  The success of smallpox vaccination is such that today it is a disease so rare as to cause a panic if there is any suggestion that there is a case of it here; but before vaccination was general, it was a very serious disease in this part of the world.  Before the formation of the State, when compulsory vaccination was introduced, these very same arguments would have come up.  Was it right to interfere with the liberty of the individual? There were many people who refused to have their children vaccinated. Many were prosecuted and went to gaol over it.  I want simply to ask Deputy O'Higgins this question.  In the light of our experience, was it right or wrong to have that measure in our public health law?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want me to answer that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was simply going to point out to the Deputy that smallpox is a communicable disease which can be passed from one person to another and therefore creates a social problem, if not dealt with. Dental caries is not a communicable disease.  One person cannot pass it to another.  Here you are dealing with individuals and you have not the same kind of social problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We can get into very fine points on this, but there is something more than communicable disease involved in public health.  I think it is the function of an enlightened health authority in modern time not only to safeguard the health both of the individual and the community but to do everything it can to raise the standard of good health in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking it on that basis, I must ask myself this question: if we provide a certain proportion of fluorine in water, will that help significantly to raise the <Col N="813" /> standard of dental health in the community?  That question must be answered.  As far as I can ascertain&mdash; and I must rely on the experts&mdash;the answer to that question is a rather definite &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.  I then ask: if I take this step to raise the average standard of dental health, are there any dangers or objections from a health point of view that would outweigh the advantage I hope to gain?  That is a most important question.  As far as I could gather from the experts&mdash;by experts, I do not mean bodies like those that have been mentioned who get together in America for obstructive reasons but responsible people charged with examining this problem and making reports on which action will be taken, like the reports that have been quoted here&mdash;the answer to the second question is that there is no danger likely to arise.</P>
    <P>One phrase in the report here says: &ldquo;The evidence of harmlessness is so strong as to be almost conclusive.&rdquo;  If that is the position, we have here an opportunity of raising the general standard of health of the people and, at the same time, not doing any damage.  I can understand the urging of the principle that if I want to have water without fluorine, I should have it.  That, in simple terms, would seem to be what Deputies on the other side who oppose this are saying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not put it the other way?  If I do not want to take fluorine, why should I be forced to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, but vaccination is something which you are forced to have.  We could apply the same argument to chlorine.  I could demand that I get water <i>au naturelle</i> without any drug irrespective of typhoid and so on, but if I press that argument too far, I should demand the right to drink poison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No opposition to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious matter and it is to the credit of the Minister's predecessor as well as to that of the Minister that this proposal has been so carefully examined.  We <Col N="814" /> must therefore face the issue of whether or not we are to have it.  The idea of leaving it optional to the local authority is the worst solution.  We should make up our minds either to have nothing to do with it or we should do it.  If we make it optional, we shall have some authorities doing it and others not doing it.  We shall have some of them going into reverse later, like some of the American cities, on the question of cost or under local pressure.  In the case of matters like this, you always get groups of people who, for one reason or another, club together in strong opposition.  You had it in regard to vaccination.  I do not want to apply any epithets to people or groups like that but the fact is that such groups will be found.  The worst position would be to leave it permissive or a free-for-all.</P>
      <P>This is so serious a matter that it admits of only two decisions: either we stand firmly and say we do it or stand equally firmly and say we do not do it.  We cannot evade it and we should be doing a very bad service to the community by evading issues here.  It is like a free vote of the House; that kind of thing tends to be an evasion of responsibility.  That is what it would be in this case.  I am no expert on this subject, although I might perhaps claim to know a little more about it than some of those who pontificated about details, and I think it is a matter for medical and dental people, in particular for these commissions composed of all the experts and properly qualified people who have examined it as thoroughly as they have.  On that basis and taking the recommendations as I have found them, I would come down in favour of fluoridation and I say we should do it.</P>
      <P>I can understand the other principle and that other people might not agree, but, above all, let us not have this optional position which is simply an evasion of responsibility.  Let us make up our minds whether we are for it or against it.  This is not a case where one can have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be very brief.  Deputy de Valera finally <Col N="815" /> depends on the advice of experts.  He stressed the fact that he is not an expert and the Minister on the Second Stage also admitted that he was depending on the advice of experts when referring to the contribution of Deputy Manley.  He said both Deputy Manley and he were lay people, depending on the advice of experts. If that is so, will Deputy de Valera not understand that there is as much justification for one member as there is for another taking sides on this issue, not alone in accordance with the views of the expert but also in accordance with his own common sense. Perhaps if we brought a little more common sense into this argument, we might make more progress and reach more satisfactory results sooner than by dealing with all the reports of all the experts.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is that the Minister insists on compulsion.  If fluoridation is the remedy for dental caries, may I pose one question?  Why is it that in America, Britain, and elsewhere, where a large percentage of experts believe this is the remedy, the Governments have not insisted on compulsion? In my opinion that is a fundamental point upon which we are entitled to question the Minister as to the ultimate, wonderful results he believes will accrue from the introduction of fluorides into water.  Had it been compulsory in these countries, we might have a complete answer.  The Minister intends, with the solid support of those Deputies who have been interrupting here this evening, to make fluoridation compulsory on local authorities.  The Minister does not intend to give to local authorities the right to decide for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is wrong with those Deputies on my right who are members of local authorities?  Are they afraid they will not be able to carry their arguments to a successful conclusion in their own local authorities?  Are they afraid that a majority may say they are in favour of the reports of the experts who hold no definite conclusion has been reached which would prove completely satisfactory results, <Col N="816" /> the completely satisfactory results that are being claimed under this Bill?</P>
    <P>Compulsion may be a good thing when it is proved conclusively that the end justifies the means.  But that has not been proved here and the last person in the world who can prove it is the Minister.  He admitted on the Second Stage that he is a layman dependent on the views of experts.  If he is, then why does he find it so suitable to scoff at the miserable minorities, according to him, in other countries which, having tried out this scheme, decided to revert?  Minorities also have their rights.  If it were permissible, rather than compulsory, and Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council decided to introduce fluorides into piped water, what would be the effect of that decision on smaller counties?  If Carlow or Louth decided not to implement this scheme, would the Minister think it right to scoff at their decision merely because they are a minority?  The rights of minorities must be safeguarded provided they do not cut across any fundamental issues affecting the wellbeing of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no attempt to justify his position other than to say that he is standing over the experts by whom he has been advised.  Simultaneously he tries to denigrate the experts who advise a waiting policy because nothing has been conclusively proved yet.  I have tried to approach this from a common sense point of view.  The Minister made no attempt on the Second Stage to sustain the position he has taken up other than to hand out reports from other people who follow his line of thought.  There are many members of local authorities who are also members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I know a great many of them.  I know that they are decent, well-meaning people.  Why not give them an opportunity of deciding whether or not to implement this scheme?  Remember, nothing has been proved, despite anything the Minister may say.</P>
    <P>There is a later amendment to this Bill which the Minister will move. That amendment will completely cut across the Minister's own arguments so <Col N="817" /> far.  Those who have been so anxious to interrupt should question the Minister more closely in these amendments and his own amendment later.  It will be interesting to discover whether or not they are for or against the introduction of fluoridation of their own volition, or whether their attitude is that they wish to be able to say, on their respective local authorities: &ldquo;We cannot help it.  It is an Act of Parliament.  We must accept it.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the view of my Party. We think this ought not to be mandatory. We think it should be purely enabling.  All the arguments that have been adduced on the other side have simply been arguments to the effect that, if it is not made mandatory, one is shirking one's responsibility.  Some Deputies on the Government benches talked about vaccination and other preventive measures being mandatory and endeavoured to justify, on that analogy, the fluoridation of water supplies.  It is absolutely essential that we should have a clear perspective.</P>
      <P>Fluoridation is not essential to human life.  Chlorine is essential to human life because it destroys bacteria in water.  If water were not impregnated with chlorine, one could have serious and dangerous epidemic disease which might easily cause death.  Nobody can claim that, if water is not fluoridated, anybody will die because of that.  I never yet heard of anybody dying from a bad tooth.  He may suffer considerable discomfort and misery.  There may be a certain amount of deterioration in physical health, but a bad tooth is not of itself deleterious to human life.  Why, then, should we make this a mandatory provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister introduced this as a mandatory provision originally because he was sold on this idea by someone else.  I am sure he is quite genuine in his belief that he is doing something for the good of the country as a whole.  It does seem, however, that there is a volume of opinion against him.  It is not only the Fine Gael Party; the Minister has had representations from a number of different societies.  There is a very <Col N="818" /> strong force in Dublin known as Pure Water Association who are strongly opposed to this.  They have studied the matter.  They can be considered as experts in their own line just as much as the members of this distinguished committee whose report the Minister has quoted here.</P>
    <P>With regard to the report, I do not think they have disposed of one of the strongest arguments against fluoridation. I refer to the ethical argument. Is the State entitled to impose mass medication on the people?  Are parents to be forced to accept mass medication of their children?  The only voice parents have is that of public representatives. When this goes to a division, there is no doubt about the issue.  The Government have a sizable majority. I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that they got that majority some years ago, and, if there is a growing volume of opinion against this particular type of mass medication, the Minister would be well advised to take cognisance of it. People are not protesting against fluoridation for nothing.  We are not speaking here against fluoridation for nothing.  We are speaking against it from conviction.  We are speaking against it in the light of the advice we have had from experts just as the Minister is trying to impose fluoridation because he is acting on certain advice.</P>
    <P>He says that he is acting on the advice of a Commission set up by his predecessor.  I do not think that this Commission has absolutely, positively and categorically stated in the report that fluoridation is immediately desirable. They have said that some form of legislation is necessary to enable local authorities, &mdash;they use advisedly, the word &ldquo;enable,&rdquo;&mdash;to medicate the water.  It is natural that if that is to be done it would be necessary for the local authority to have the legal authority to do so but it is a different thing to make it mandatory on them to do it.  That is where I join issue with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I join issue with the Minister on the ethical question.  I am totally opposed to the State having the right to impose <Col N="819" /> anything upon people if they do not themselves desire it.  I do not think that this Commission dealt sufficiently with that point.  They said that there was opposition on ethical grounds but that they did not think there was anything in that.  The major objection to this whole measure is on ethical grounds.  There are many other grounds of objection but the major argument, to my mind, is whether the individual or the parent has the right to decide what his children should take or whether the State have the right.  That is the core of our argument.</P>
    <P>I have always stood for the preservation of the right of the individual and the parent to decide what medication his children should take.  If we get away from that we get away from the fundamental freedom and right of the parent to decide what is best for his own children.  Has the parent the right to decide that?  In free, democratic, sovereign States the parent has that right and that is why we should always stand up in defence of it.  For that reason I ask the Minister, on the ethical grounds alone, to accept the amendment.  He will not be losing any face in doing so or confronting any great wave of public opinion on the matter.</P>
    <P>I have not met anyone who wants the Bill.  In my constituency so few of us have piped water supplies that the proposal does not interest us, but, from speaking to people in Dublin and in towns which have a piped-water supply I have no doubt that if the Minister took a free vote on the proposal, or left it to a referendum, there would be an overwhelming vote against it.</P>
    <P>There may be some dentists in favour of it but it is true that there are a great many against it.  I have discussed it with them and the only argument in favour of it is that fluoridation in some cases, not in all, causes dental decay in the early years &mdash;in the years from six to eleven&mdash; and that it is easier to deal with children of the higher age group because they have a better understanding of what is going on around them <Col N="820" /> and are better able to cooperate with the dentist.  That is the only argument that I have heard in favour of the proposal.  Some dentists do not agree. Some dentists say that they do not know that it has been tried out long enough to give conclusive results.</P>
    <P>There was some strong feeling in the House when Deputy Ryan read out certain reports from America showing that there were votes by the local authorities, only small communities, wiping out the fluoridation that existed in their area.  There was some point in doing that.  It showed that although fluoridation is in existence only over the past twenty years or so, States in America and other parts of the world that once accepted it have freely voted against it.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the suggestion that it is shirking the issue to leave the matter to the discretion of the local authorities.  On the Second Reading of the Bill I stated that the local authorities are probably the most widely representative people of the whole community.  There are far more local authority representatives than other representatives and many of them are elected entirely free of politics&mdash;housewives, ratepayers representatives and so on.  They would be people who would really take an interest in a question of this kind.  It could be actively discussed at local authority level.  If the Minister indicates to the local authority that he considers it necessary, they would discuss it and every aspect would be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>But that is not the aim of the Bill. The aim of the Bill is to say to the local authority that it is mandatory on them to fluoridate the water.  Of course there will be opposition to that and it is going to lead to any amount of trouble.  I am not a member of a local authority myself but my knowledge of local authorities is that their function is to discuss the matter and then to provide the money for it.  The question of cost must come into this matter.  It will cost something to fluoridate the water and whether or not it costs sixpence in the pound in the rates in Dublin, as Deputy Ryan said, the fact is that the money will have to be produced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> It has already been said that one local authority has objected to fluoridation. Deputy Loughman has said that there is objection to it in South Tipperary.  If the local authorities object to it, surely it will lead to a lot of trouble, if we impose a mandatory Bill on them?  They will probably refuse to vote the money if they feel very strongly about it.  From what I know the pressure is already strong against it.  I would ask the Minister to remember that when you are in Government you do not always get the strong criticism which the Opposition gets.  The Opposition has a far greater opportunity of knowing the minds of the people than the members of the Government who are sheltering in Dublin and are dependent on advice.</P>
    <P>There is definitely opposition to this Bill.  The opposition is on two grounds&mdash;the ethical ground and the ground as to whether this should be an enabling Bill or a mandatory Bill. You cannot separate the two.  If you force this Bill on the people, you are taking away their ethical right to decide what medication their children should have.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider this matter and see if he cannot meet the views of the Opposition, which are reasonably sound.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the grounds on which Deputy Ryan argued that this question might be left to the discretion of the local authority was that the Bill would be expensive, that it would impose a rate of sixpence in the £ on the City of Dublin.  Deputy Esmonde indicated that he shared this view.  If the Deputy has a pencil and paper perhaps I could give him some figures which he could work out and check for himself.  I hope that then we will not have an endless repetition of that argument on this amendment.</P>
      <P>The population of Dublin is 539,476. It has been estimated from experience elsewhere that to fluoridate the water for that population may cost sixpence per head per year.  If the Deputy will divide 539,476 by 40 he will find that the annual cost of fluoridating the water of the city of Dublin is £13,500 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> That was the figure which was taken into consideration when I gave the House an estimate of the cost on Second Reading.  I hope I shall not be charged with being abusive when I come here to the House and try to correct the misapprehensions which Deputy Richard Ryan apparently created in the mind of a Deputy for whom I have a great deal of respect and personal regard.</P>
    <P>The next ground upon which it is urged that the Bill should not be made mandatory is that in some way the addition of one part fluorine to a million parts of water is unethical. Deputy Esmonde stated that his strongest objection to the purpose of this measure was on that ground.  He said that the process was unethical because it was an interference with parental rights.  This question of the ethics of the proposal was very carefully considered by the Consultative Council.  Deputy Esmonde and other Deputies, having read this report some time ago, may have forgotten what the council had to say on that point.  I think I read it earlier before the debate was interrupted by the long, tedious and repetitive speech of Deputy Ryan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for the benefit of those members of the House who may have heard Deputy Esmonde's arguments.  The Council in paragraph 37 of the report says that it received representations to the effect that the fluoridation of public water supplies was unethical, the main ground being that it was mass medication&mdash;a phrase which was used several times by Deputy Esmonde&mdash;that it was a usurpation of parental rights&mdash;Deputy Esmonde used an expression to the same effect&mdash;and an interference by the public authority with the integrity of the human body.</P>
      <P>This is what the Council has to say to these grounds on which objection was taken: &ldquo;These objections were carefully considered and advice was sought and received.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> I am perfectly certain that when Deputy Esmonde comes to consider what the Council stated there, he will realise that though the statement is concise and does not waste words, it carries the full weight of the Authority behind it.  The council goes on: &ldquo;The Council is satisfied there is no ethical objection than the margin of safety recommended in this Report.&rdquo; I hope, therefore, that we have disposed once and for all of the objection which has been taken to this proposal on ethical grounds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan occupied, quite unnecessarily, a great deal of the time of this House by reciting a list of municipalities at the other side of the world which he alleged had at one time adopted the procedure of fluoridating public water supplies but had then abandoned it after some time.</P>
    <P>Of course, one listening to Deputy Ryan is at a disadvantage.  It is quite obvious to most people who listen to him that he does not talk with any sincerity, that his whole effort was a performance to impress the uninformed and the gullible people he hopes will support him.  We in this House who have been able to check his statements know how unreliable they are.  I shall give one instance.  In the course of the Second Reading debate, Deputy Ryan said, and I am quoting from column 175 of the report of the debate on 26th October:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I want to return to Washington, to the first citizen of that great city... He is under medical orders not to drink the fluoridated water supply...</P>
    <P>That is what Deputy Ryan said on 26th October.  That particular statement happens to be a stock argument used by those who have opposed the fluoridation of the public water supply and therefore it was quite easy to check it.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I do not want to interrupt unnecessarily but the Minister was most meticulous in suggesting to the Chair earlier, when other speakers were contributing, that this amendment had to deal with the mandatory and permissive character of the Bill and <Col N="824" /> surely it is not relevant to that that the Minister should go back over Second Reading speeches in order to rebut points that were made.  If the Minister wants to have this discussion on the amendment, let us have it on the amendment&mdash;I am quite prepared for that&mdash;but if the Minister wants to go back over the Second Reading speeches, I am&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is how completely and utterly unreliable Deputy Ryan and those who support him are; and how utterly reckless they are in the statements they make about this very serious problem.  It happened that on March 7th the President of the United States made this statement, and I am quoting from the <i>Chicago Daily News.</i>  He was asked did he drink bottled water and he said: &ldquo;Yes; I drank bottled water when I was travelling&rdquo;. And he went on from that to say this:</P>
      <P>I do drink tap water here at home, but that is just because I figure it is just as good as bottled water.</P>
      <P>Then this question was put to him:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> Well, some people in the District have quit drinking the District water because they don't approve of fluoridation.  You know, there is a chemical added to the water and the advocates contend that it slows down tooth decay for children.  But the opponents of this idea insist that it may pollute the water, may make it unsafe for drinking.</P>
    <P>And the answer was:</P>
    <P>I know that.</P>
    <P>Then the question was put &ldquo;As to whether they...&rdquo; and the President of the United States interrupted the interviewer to say this:</P>
    <P>Well, I'll tell you; in the White House I drink it often, very often.</P>
    <P>And Deputy Ryan told us that the President's medical advisers had forbidden him to drink the public water supply in Washington because that water had been fluoridated.</P>
    <P>We have just got a long statement in this House of places which he alleges dropped fluoridation and he asks us to take his word for it that he is telling the truth.  In order to nail that misstatement once and for all, there follows this letter which was written from the White House.  It is headed: &ldquo;An official statement on fluoridation&rdquo;. It is in the form of a letter from President Eisenhower's personal physician, the doctor whom Deputy Richie Ryan alleged had forbidden President Eisenhower to drink the water from the Washington public water supply because it was flouridated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2) to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) A health authority shall not be required to add fluorine to a water supply unless and until a supply of pure water not containing fluorine shall be readily available at no extra cost to all persons residing in the area supplied with water to which it is proposed to add fluorine.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to preserve something we have at present, that is, a water supply which, in 50 per cent. of the country, at any rate, is free of fluorine.  The purpose of the Bill is to introduce into the water supply, which at present is regarded as as safe and pure as mankind can make it, a substance known to be dangerous and toxic and to which some people may be allergic.</P>
      <P>In countries which have introduced the fluoridation of water supplies, some manufacturers of foodstuffs have had to install defluoridation equipment to remove the fluorine from the water supply.  That has happened in areas where the water naturally contains fluorine and also in several areas where the water supplies are artificially fluoridated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tabled some Questions to the Minister for answer next week.  If he has the information at his disposal, he might like to disclose it on the discussion on the amendment.  I have asked for particulars concerning the number of factories processing foodstuffs in this country which might be affected by the fluoridation of water supplies.  On Second Reading, the Minister said the only way to get <Col N="832" /> fluorine into a cauliflower is to boil it in water containing that substance.</P>
    <P>Certain foodstuffs, while being processed, will absorb all the fluorine the water contains.  Jam manufacturers, jelly manufacturers, manufacturers of any foodstuff in which water is used substantially, fear that the fluoridation of our water supplies will compel them to install very expensive defluoridation equipment.  There has been incorrect reference by several Deputies to chlorination and an endeavour to draw a comparison between the chlorination and the fluoridation of water supplies.  There is this vital difference; you can get rid of chlorine by boiling the water&mdash;it goes up in steam&mdash;but you cannot get rid of fluorine because it remains behind like salt.  In this country, we have several food manufacturers in respect of whom I am not at all certain we have any standards regarding the fluorine content of the processed foodstuffs they make and which many of them export.  I do know that in other countries, particularly in America, there are very rigid standards in that respect.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, some of our manufacturers who have foreign markets at the moment will stand in great danger of losing their export trade, unless they have available to them a supply of water without fluorine, or equipment to de-fluoridate water which has got fluorine in it at the same cost as pure water.  In this Bill, there is no provision for a supply of water without fluorine to these manufacturers.  I think on that account if we are to have forced upon us a general fluoridation of water supplies, we should have some provision to give assistance to such manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Many beers or soft drinks, which are now manufactured with water which does not contain fluorine, through the operation of this Bill, will have a substance in them they do not now possess and it may well be that certain breweries in this country may have an advantage over others by reason of the fact that they take their water from some source which does not contain fluorine.  I do not think it is fair that that advantage should be <Col N="833" /> given to a brewery which has a natural supply of water.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister has now got over the heat and the malicious deportment of the earlier stages and that he may be able to deal with these technical problems calmly and reasonably. We can now come down to the individual in many parts of Ireland, whether he has a piped water supply or lives in an area which has no piped water.  At the moment he has water with no fluorine.  Now we take it upon ourselves to deprive him of that, although it is conceded even by the experts quoted by the Minister that the intake of fluorine is of no advantage to persons who have gone past their teens.  Yet we compel people to take water with a substance which is of no apparent use to them whatever.</P>
    <P>It has been proved by certain tests that in fact water with fluorine in it may have very dangerous effects on some people.  I say it is unfair to take from our people the supply of pure water which they have at the moment. I trust that I shall be understood when I make use of the word &ldquo;pure&rdquo; in this context.  I use it to mean water without fluorine.  People have water without fluorine at the moment and if they want to continue using it, I think it unfair to impose upon them the extra cost of de-fluoridating their supplies. Under the provisions of this measure if they want water without fluorine, they will have to buy it, and in other countries, a very profitable market has been set up for pure water in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>How would Dublin Corporation feel if people living within the area of their jurisdiction started sinking wells in their gardens or, maybe, in the streets?  It might be very well for people with land, but people in flats will not have a supply of water without fluorine and they will be put to the big expense of de-fluoridating the supplies, if they want to drink pure water.  They have at the moment something which is very valuable and we should not take it from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is, on its face, completely impractical.  In <Col N="834" /> order to give effect to it, it would be necessary to provide two separate water supplies for the whole area of Dublin city and county&mdash;one with fluorine to the extent of one part to every million parts of water and the other with any fluorine that might be there in the natural supply extracted from it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan has told the House that when he speaks of pure water, he means water without fluorine.  It is possible that the Dublin water supply contains even a more minute trace of fluorine than is contemplated by the Bill.  Therefore, in order to give effect to Deputy Ryan's proposal, and at the same time, to the principle of the Bill and the principle which I stood for when amendments Nos. 3 and 5 were debated by the House, we would have to provide, first of all, a fully fluoridated water supply for the city and county of Dublin and then another supply completely devoid of fluorine.  Accordingly, is it not quite clear that this amendment was not seriously intended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that possibly the water supply in Dublin at the moment contains fluorine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It may contain a minute quantity, even more minute than is contemplated in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister stating that as a fact?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that the Minister is introducing a Bill not knowing the quality of the supply of water used by 1,750,000 people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it appears from the Minister's remarks that he is introducing a Bill not knowing the extent of the problems with which he has to deal&mdash;whether or not we have to introduce one part of fluorine in a million parts of water or one per cent. of one part fluorine.  He has given certain costings to the House and now it appears these costings are not based <Col N="835" /> upon any technical data already collected.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not dealt with the responsibilities a local authority has to provide pure water.  One of the difficulties in the supply of fluoridated water is that is extremely difficult to control the fluorine content.  It has been put on record here that fluoridated water is all right, so long as the fluorine content is controlled.  But some pipes may corrode.  It has been found that where you have a fluoridated supply, you will have different qualities of fluorine at different points in the supply, since the fluorine will be disturbed at different densities throughout the system.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister it would be very costly to provide both pure and fluoridated water supplies, but the Minister is here taking away something that has been provided already at great cost&mdash;even if it is a supply of water containing far less fluorine than this Bill proposes to put in it. I do not agree that it is right to do that, nor do I think it is justified by any arguments we have heard in support of this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that present facilities in this country for the treatment, care and education of mentally handicapped children are deplorably inadequate and calls on the Government immediately to ensure that adequate facilities are made available so as to remedy the present unjust situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this motion is to draw attention to a national scandal, to awaken a dormant consciousness in our society to a great social evil and to urge the Government to take action to alleviate a gross injustice in our midst. It has, let me stress, no political overtones. Considerations of Party politics <Col N="836" /> do not motivate it.  For too long have the plight and condition of mentally handicapped children and of their parents been neglected and their tragic situation been avoided.  For too long have apathy and indifference contributed to official inactivity.</P>
    <P>There are too firm official statistics dealing with the extent of the problem but reliable estimates have been made and the facts which there estimates demonstrate are eloquent and require little embroidery.  There are approximately in this country 2,000 beds available for mentally handicapped children.  It has been reliably estimated that 7,000 more are needed. There are approximately 500 to 600 places in special schools for mentally handicapped children.  It has been reliably estimated that 5,000 are needed.  It has also been reliably estimated that approximately 10 per cent. of all our children are either mentally handicapped or educationally retarded and need special care and treatment.</P>
    <P>There is in this whole country one child guidance clinic.  There was up to recently only one qualified educational psychologist.  There is no psychologist attached to any local authority.  There is no official or one body responsible anywhere in the State for dealing with this problem.  There is no proper system of diagnosis.  There is no after-care system for children who may benefit from education and treatment at special schools and there is no placement system for such children after they leave school to ensure that they get adequate employment.  These are the facts of the situation.  This is the neglected system which for one reason or another has been permitted to develop in this country over the years.</P>
    <P>I have said at the outset that this has no political overtones and it is not my intention to apportion blame to any one Government, to any one Administration, to any one group of local authorities, but it is my intention that the Dáil should put on record its grave concern at this situation and endeavour to see that the Government takes action to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to minimise the problems which the Government and <Col N="837" /> local authorities may have to face but I do believe that those problems could be, at any rate to some extent, minimised if a favourable body of public opinion were behind the Government taking those measures.  One of the objects of this motion is to try to foster a public opinion of that sort which would in itself assist the Government in the steps and in the measures which it must, I believe, take.</P>
    <P>One of the things urgently needed in this country is proper legislation to deal with the problem.  I do not for a moment accept the statement in the White Paper published recently by the Government that our existing legislation is sufficient to deal with the problem. I feel certain that there was some debate in the Cabinet as to which Minister would be responsible for this motion; was this a health problem or was it an education problem; should the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education deal with it?  In the White Paper recently published by the Department of Health reference is made to the fact that there are educational problems involved in this subject.</P>
    <P>What has happened is that neither the Department of Education nor the Department of Health has any direct single responsibility for this matter, that the responsibility is diffused through these Departments and through local authorities and as a result the situation has not been properly dealt with.</P>
    <P>I suggest we need legislation in this country, legislation similar to that which exists under the provisions of the Education Act, 1944 in England. I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should have a look at that Act.  He will see there that, under Section 34, the educational authorities throughout England&mdash;and this applies to Northern Ireland also&mdash;are given a statutory obligation to inquire into the mental health of the children in their area and to provide special educational facilities where they are required.  No such legislation exists in this country.  There is no legislation in this country requiring any local authority to give special education to <Col N="838" /> our mentally handicapped children.  I would suggest that it is a <i>sine qua non</i> of progress in this regard that a proper legislative framework be established to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Legislation, of course, will not cure it and legislation is only the framework in which the problem will be tackled. What is urgently needed in this country is a proper system of diagnosis, treatment and after-care.  It would not be a difficult task to set up immediately a diagnostic clinic, for example, in the City of Dublin.  Suggestions have been made by a responsible person intimately connected with this problem that such a central diagnostic clinic could be attached to one of the Universities in the City of Dublin where a qualified staff could be present, where the extra facilities needed would not be very great and where general practitioners could send for diagnosis and report children with special problems with which they are not qualified to deal.  It should be possible to establish such centres in other parts of the country also.</P>
    <P>One of the important aspects of proper diagnosis of children is in relation to those suffering from suspected mental disturbances, mental illness or mental defects.  That problem could be solved comparatively easily, in the City of Dublin at any rate, and not at any great cost.  From my own knowledge I can say there is great need for a proper system of diagnosis of children suffering from mental handicap, mental disease or mental defect.  The tragedy of this situation is that a number of these children, not of course all, can be cured or at any rate have their condition considerably alleviated but because of lack of diagnosis they go through life handicapped, wrongly handicapped, because of inadequate diagnosis.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should wait until a committee is set up, until a committee has sat for two or three years and has sifted all the evidence, to know what any of the experts on this question will tell the Minister and the Government tomorrow, that the first thing that would help in a material way would be the establishment of <Col N="839" /> an adequate system of diagnosis and that such a system could be started without too much difficulty, in the City of Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Up to recently, as I have said, we have had one educational psychologist. There was a course started recently in educational psychology and it is in my information&mdash;and I understand it to be fairly reliable&mdash;that a small group of people who qualified from that course could not get jobs and had to leave the country.  That is a deplorable situation.  I see no reason why groups of local authorities should not have the assistance and service of one education psychologist. It would be a simple matter to work out according to area and population how many groups of local authorities should combine and how one could serve several areas at the same time. The courses are available; I think the applicants are there but the jobs have not been created.</P>
    <P>The problem goes beyond mere legislation and more diagnosis.  Treatment is necessary and I think it would be proper if a tribute was paid by me and by this House to the voluntary organisations who have been dealing with this problem, particularly the Religious Orders, the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God, the French Sisters of Charity and the Brothers of Charity who have brought their own vocation to this problem and who have given such tremendous assistance in the past.  There have been also a number of voluntary organisations who have alleviated the problem to some extent.  The fact remains that the efforts which have been made by the Religious Orders and by the voluntary organisations have been entirely inadequate.  We need a great increase in the number of people teaching and nursing mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>The problem can be divided into two sections: the problem of children who need institutional care and the problem of children who do better in day centres.  It is generally accepted that at a certain level of intelligence quotient it is better for a mentally handicapped child to attend a day <Col N="840" /> school or a day centre rather than get institutional treatment.  Up to a few years ago there was no day centre in the whole of this country.  There has been one started recently in the City of Dublin which copes very inadequately with an appalling problem. There has been one started recently in Cork and also in Waterford.  Beyond that and beyond the efforts of some voluntary organisations there has been no proper system of day centres.  It has been estimated&mdash;again on a perfectly reliable basis&mdash;that at least six day centres are needed in the City of Dublin and there should be at least one in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Sligo in order to start dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>The teachers who deal with mentally handicapped children require a special vocation and special training.  It has been said in an endeavour to excuse official inactivity that it might not be possible to get the necessary recruits for this work.  I do not accept that.  I know of people involved in this work who would gladly take it up as a career, who would gladly undertake it as a vocation if it was organised on a proper basis, if they knew there were going to be schools and that they could make their career out of it. However, there has been no opening and no career.  I should say, however, that the Department of Education has been endeavouring to get some of its national teachers to interest themselves in this problem and to undertake training in England.  There has been some response to this appeal, a response which has been entirely inadequate.</P>
    <P>At present we have a tremendous percentage of persons qualified to deal with mentally handicapped children, and the point I wish to make is that this is not one of the insuperable problems, that I believe there are people who would come forward to follow this vocation and who would be qualified to do so if, in fact, the machinery of the system were properly developed.  Of course the low grade mentally handicapped children require institutional care and treatment.  I know there is not a Deputy in this House who does not know of parents <Col N="841" /> with mentally handicapped children and of the terrific struggle they have to get them into one or other of the institutions.  These institutions are appallingly overcrowded.  There is an appalling shortage of beds for mentally handicapped children and the position is that many of these children will not get into institutions because the accommodation is just not there for them.</P>
    <P>The provision of hospitals and an adequate number of beds would cost money.  It has been estimated it would take between £5,000,000 and £7,000,000 to produce the facilities which would be needed to deal adequately with the institutional side of the problem.  Is that an insuperable difficulty?  Can we not find £5,000,000 to £7,000,000 to provide proper accommodation?  If the public were informed that it might have to put up with a penny extra on income tax in order to provide this, do you think would it accept that?  If the public had to do without some item of capital expenditure in order to provide this £5,000,000 to £7,000,000 do you think the public would willingly forgo some item of, perhaps, a luxury type of capital expenditure?  I think the public would.</P>
    <P>I think our people, if they were informed of this, would be willing to make whatever sacrifices would be necessary in order to provide the money needed to supply this extra accommodation, and we are fortunate in that we are not approaching the problem without any resources.  We have already the resources offered and given by the religious societies which are dealing with a certain percentage of mentally handicapped children and, therefore, our problem is not one of extraordinary difficulty.  It is one in which, perhaps, sacrifices would be required but I, for one, feel confident that if the situation were adequately explained to our people and public opinion informed, whatever sacrifices were needed would be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Of course the problem continues after a child has grown up and left a special school.  The experience elsewhere has been that a child who gets <Col N="842" /> proper treatment, who is fortunate enough to be attended by a qualified teacher, who is fortunate enough not to be too greatly retarded can, in fact, become a useful citizen and can fulfil himself or herself in a way which would be impossible and it not got this treatment, but we have no proper system of after-care treatment.  We have no proper system for placing them in jobs.  Young boys and girls who have gone to one of our special schools and who come out at the ages of seventeen or eighteen, without having anybody to look after them adequately for after-care treatment, are in a bad position.  Part and parcel with the legislation which I suggest is necessary, there should be a system of after-care for children who are attending special schools, and a placement system which would see to it that suitable jobs are made available for them so that they can play a useful role in society.</P>
    <P>The plain truth is that 70 or 80 miles from here, across the Border, mentally handicapped children are much better cared for, and the same is the case in Great Britain.  That is because somebody, some central organisation, has been made responsible and because the necessary funds have been made available.  I would suggest that this is something of which we cannot be proud in this part of the country but it is something which should spur us to greater effort.  The tragedy of the situation is that many of the children, who to-day are deprived of the services they could get in other countries, could have their lives bettered, could fulfil themselves to a much greater extent if they were given the treatment and care that is necessary, and some hope and happiness could be brought into the lives of parents who have to shoulder this great burden.</P>
    <P>We should not forget the problems of parents of mentally handicapped children.  One of the matters to which I wish attention directed is the fact that mentally handicapped children are somewhat in the position of persons suffering from tuberculosis some years ago.  At that time tuberculosis was a dreaded disease which people were afraid to discuss, were even <Col N="843" /> afraid to admit, and because of that its onslaught was made all the worse. I am sure Deputies know of parents&mdash; I know of several to my own knowledge&mdash;who have had mentally handicapped children and who have been afraid to admit it to themselves.  I know of one mother of a boy of five who did not know he was a mongol child who would be permanently mentally handicapped and the shock to her, following her unstinted devotion and personal training of this little child, was made all the more appalling when she learned that the child would be permanently mentally handicapped. Following on that I think the position of parents could be greatly relieved by a proper system of approach to this problem, a system of education of the parents, a system which could have the assistance of qualified people.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with the terms of the amendment that has been tabled.  I regret that the amendment has been put forward.  I feel it is bringing into the discussion an element of contention, if you like, an element of Party politics which should be absent from it.  First of all, the amendment suggests that Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P>while conscious of the fact that due to historical causes present facilities for the treatment, care and education of mentally handicapped children are inadequate, realises that it has been the constant purpose of successive Governments within the limits of the resources in money, personnel and accommodation available to them to remedy this situation...</P>
    <P>I regret that I must differ from that statement.  I do not think it has been the constant purpose of successive Governments, within the limits of their resources, to deal with it.  I believe it is a problem which has been largely ignored for one reason or another, a problem which people have not been concerned with for one reason or another.  As I say, I do not wish to apportion blame but I do not think there has been a public consciousness in this country among people in public life, among Deputies, among journalists, <Col N="844" /> among editors of newspapers, among teachers, among those responsible for guiding public opinion or dealing in public affairs, of the greatness of this problem until comparatively recent years.  That is something we should try to remedy.</P>
    <P>The amendment suggests that we should welcome the Government's White Paper entitled <i>The Problem of the Mentally Handicapped Children</i> which outlines the chief aspects of the problem and the progress which has been made in regard to it.  I do not see there is any reason to welcome the Government's White Paper.  I do not think it is a White Paper at all in anything but the name.  As I understand it, a White Paper is an official statement of Government policy in dealing with a given subject.  There is no policy in this so-called White Paper.  It is a statement of a very serious situation.  Information is given to the public on this problem in the form of an official document.  In the words of the White Paper itself it is stated that &ldquo;the primary object of this paper is to outline what is involved in the problem, what has been accomplished already and to inform the public as to the salient difficulties involved in making provision for further expansion of the services of the mentally handicapped.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no statement of Government policy, no statement of what the Government proposes to do.  There is in this White Paper a statement of the number of beds available, the deplorable shortage of accommodation and the statement that it would cost many millions of pounds to remedy. There are a number of questions at the end dealing with the problem, how to deal with such-and-such a problem, but, as a statement of Government policy, it is certainly inadequate. I do not think this White Paper is something the Dáil should recommend.</P>
    <P>The amendment suggests that the Dáil &ldquo;should note with satisfaction the accelerating rate at which deficiencies in institutional accommodation are being made good.&rdquo;  I do not note with satisfaction the accelerating rate at which deficiencies in institutional accommodation are being made <Col N="845" /> good.  I would suggest that no reasonable Deputy would note with satisfaction what is a deplorably slow rate of progress.  I am not denying for a moment that extra beds are being made available, but I would say the rate of progress is entirely inadequate and that certainly this Dáil should not note with satisfaction the present rate.</P>
    <P>We are also, the amendment suggests, to note with satisfaction the attention which is being given to the development of day training centres. What the White Paper says is that a day training centre has been set up in Cork.  Dealing with how many children? Ten.  What the White Paper says is that a day centre has been established recently in Waterford, a sort of <i>créche</i> rather than a day training centre.  It notes also that a day centre is being established in Dublin. I do not note with satisfaction that the Government have attended to these facts.  If in fact there was an indication that legislation was to be introduced to give power to establish day centres and to man them adequately. I would certainly note that fact with satisfaction.  But it does seem to me that we are using diplomatic language in a very extreme form if we are to suggest that we should note with satisfaction the fact that the Government have noted the developments of private organisations.</P>
    <P>The amendment also proposes that the Dáil should endorse the policy which the Government has outlined and is confident that it will be given effect with all possible speed.  I do not know what policy the Dáil is to endorse.  I know Ministers have said: &ldquo;This is a serious problem and we are doing everything we can to deal with it.&rdquo;  I know we have official statements from Ministers replying to debates from their Departments saying: &ldquo;Yes, this is a serious problem. Officials of my Department are considering it and, within the limits of our resources, we are doing everything we can.&rdquo;  That is the sort of official statement which a Government or a Minister will make to excuse inactivity. I do not see why the Dáil should be called upon in this amendment <Col N="846" /> to endorse the policy the Government have outlined.  I do not think the Government have outlined any policy in this subject.</P>
    <P>May I just refer to the only recent statements I have been able to find in this matter by different Ministers? The Minister for Education very briefly dealt with it when replying to the debate on the Estimate for his Department.  In a very short paragraph at Column 402, Volume 182 of the Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>The question of the mentally retarded child as an educationaly problem is always before our minds in the Department of Education.  We have at present provision in eight centres for such children and the full accommodation available in these centres is not being used.  In spite of that, plans are in train for increasing the accommodation, for making more educational provision for mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>He left it at that.  I have no doubt the Minister for Education, as a responsible person concerned with this problem, has asked that plans be put into operation to deal with this problem. However, we are not told what progress has been made.  We are not told how many national school teachers have gone to be trained in England.  Is it half a dozen, a dozen or 20?  I would suspect it is probably the middle figure.  If that is so, then the number being trained at present are entirely inadequate for our needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a statement on that which, if one interpretation is put on it, is certainly not accurate.  He says that we have at present provision in eight centres and that the full accommodation in these centres is not being used.  If that is to be interpreted as meaning we have enough day centres, that is certainly not correct. If it is to be interpreted as meaning that the people for lack of transport or knowledge, for one of many reasons, are not sending those children to one or other of those institutions and that that there are places available, that may be true.  It is not true to say or imply&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister so intended&mdash;<Col N="847" /> that we have adequate facilities to deal with day centres and accommodation. The Department of Health White Paper establishes that beyond any doubt.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health also dealt with this problem.  In answer to a Parliamentary Question on the 25th May this year, at Column 232, Volume 182, he said:</P>
    <P>I have been giving considerable thought to the general problem of the mentally handicapped and have recently had a White Paper published on the subject.  As the Deputy may see from reading that Paper, the subject as a whole needs a great deal of study.  As regards accommodation, there are 2,620 beds now available, and a further 600 beds are in prospect.  It is estimated that as many as 4,000 further beds may be needed, the capital cost of which might come to between £5 million and £7 million.  It would be quite impossible at the present time or in the foreseeable future to make funds of this order available for the purpose.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that is the statement of Ministerial policy referred to by the persons putting forward this amendment&mdash;&ldquo;the whole problem needs a great deal of study.&rdquo; I do not think that is a statement of policy.  Or does the statement of policy refer to the fact that we need £5 million or £7 million and that it would be quite impossible at present or in the foreseeable future that funds of this order would be available for the purpose? If that is the statement of Ministerial policy, I disagree violently with it.  If that is the sum necessary to make institutional treatment available.  I think it should be provided and that it is not exorbitant in current circumstances. May I say that if you were to sell the jet aeroplanes, you would get very nearly £5,000,000.</P>

I have stressed from the beginning that this is a matter on which the Dáil should place on record its view that the present facilities are inadequate and should ask the Government if that is so and have them do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the following: &ldquo;while conscious of the fact that due to historical causes present facilities for the treatment, care and education of mentally handicapped children are inadequate, realises that it has been the constant purpose of successive Governments within the limits of the resources in money, personnel and accommodation available to them to remedy this situation; welcomes the Government's White Paper, entitled <i>The Problem of the Mentally Handicapped Children</i> outlining the several aspects of the problem and the progress which has been made in regard to it; notes with satisfaction the accelerating rate at which deficiencies in institutional accommodation are being made good, as well as the attention which is being given to the development <Col N="849" /> of day-training centres; endorses the policy which the Government has outlined and is confident that it will be given effect to with all possible speed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My colleagues and I set down this amendment because we felt that the motion tended to give a distorted view of the position with regard to the care, education and treatment of mentally handicapped children by ignoring the historical background of the problem in this country, as well as by failing to recognise the very real advance which has been made in respect of this matter.</P>
    <P>While recognising the serious problem facing us, we felt that it would not help to decry what has been done and what is envisaged to help handicapped children.  We also believe, and I personally felt very strongly on this matter, that the inference from the motion, which was that nothing effective was being done to help these children and that it needed only simple Government action to provide us with a solution immediately, added a further burden of anxiety to the already heavy load of worry which is being borne by parents of handicapped children who have not yet been successful in having those children admitted to institutions.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are in close touch with this problem realise only too well the very difficult road which faces us in attempting to effect a solution to the problem but we are also aware that we are progressing along the road. We are citizens of a very old nation but of a very young State.  When we took over responsibility for our own destinies, we took over a country where conditions in the medical sphere were relatively primitive, particularly in the matter of hospitalisation and the treatment of the mentally ill and the care and treatment and education of mentally handicapped children.  I believe it is greatly to the credit of successive Governments that, taking into consideration the limited resources available to them, we have advanced as far as we have in the treatment of our sick people.  As was to be expected, we advanced more rapidly <Col N="850" /> and achieved more progress in some branches of medical treatment than in others.  Where a disease affected large numbers of people, where it was infectious, for example, public opinion saw to it that whatever money, accommodation or personnel were available would be utilised to curb and, if possible, to eradicate the disease.</P>
    <P>The fact that we had so much leeway to make up determined, whether we like it or not, that illnesses which were not infectious, which affected individuals only, which had not the appeal at the time to make the necessary impact on the public conscience, would be the slowest to be tackled and would receive only the crumbs left after the more urgent problems had been settled.  The care, treatment and education of mentally handicapped children unfortunately fell into that category.  This was so, not because Ministers and Governments were hardhearted, not because they did not realise the sadness of what I might term this affiction, not because they did not fully realise the worry and anxiety of parents of children such as these, but because public opinion decreed that diseases which were known to kill should be tackled first and by the time this was done, there was little in the way of finance or time or effort left to cope with the problem of mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>Although this was so, nevertheless, down through the years, considerable progress was made in dealing with this sad problem.  If we consider the position as set out at the end of the White Paper, we find that where there were only 500 places for mentally handicapped children in 1932, there are 2,620 in 1960.  From the White Paper, we also find there is a prospect of a further 600 places.  Even during the war years, when the energies and efforts of our people were diverted into so many different channels, finance and effort were still made available to find further places for mentally handicapped children.  But the most encouraging sign of a public re-awarkening, in my view, is the fact that the greatest progress in the provision of places for mentally handicapped children has been made in recent years. <Col N="851" /> I feel that this augurs well for the future.</P>
    <P>What are the problems facing us in this matter?  How are we to deal with them?  What can we do to speed up our efforts and bring about a happy solution?  As was pointed out in the White Paper, this is a problem which does not lend itself to any easy or ready-made solution.  It is a tremendous problem, not only in the numbers involved, not only in the cost of even attempting to overcome it, but in the fact that we cannot deal with it in the hope that whatever the expenditure now, we can be certain to overcome it in the future in the same way as we were able to cope with the problem of T.B.  With our present knowledge, we cannot cure it: we can simply teach and train these children to a certain degree and then return them to the outside world to be cared for by their families or by their parents or retain them in institutions.</P>
    <P>In principle, hospitalisation of mentally handicapped children is undesirable, except where it is imperative. That is understandable and it is in keeping with the modern outlook on this matter.  We appreciate the wonderful manner in which hospitalised children are looked after, attended and loved by the various religious Orders.  But those who lavish such loving care on them are the first to agree that there is no substitute for parental love, and, in particular, no substitute for the mother's love.  An institution, no matter how well equipped, is a poor substitute for the home, and it is the environment of the home and family which is most conducive to the natural mental development of the child.</P>
    <P>Dealing first with the very large group of mildly handicapped children, estimated at 18,000, it must be pointed out that these children are not in need of hospitalisation and it is only because other factors enter into the picture, such as unsuitable homes, that they have to be hospitalised.  It should be our aim, if we can, to eradicate the other factors so that these children will be looked after at home.  The <Col N="852" /> question then arises as to the best way of helping these children.</P>
    <P>The provision of special schools is one answer to the problem.  We have already an example of the type of school and I have no doubt particular regard will be paid to the results obtained in this particular school by the commission envisaged in the White Paper.  The question of a special class, or classes, in the ordinary school is also a possible solution.  To my mind it is worthy of serious consideration because when these children go to school with ordinary children they have a feeling of belonging. They go to school with other children; they play with them; they go home with them.  At the same time they progress with children of their own type and are not given a complex by being, as we used to call it, &ldquo;at the bottom of the class,&rdquo; or in a class with children who are much younger and, very often, much smaller than they are.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one drawback. Mildly handicapped children can be taught to read and write, understand money, and so on.  When taught and trained to the limit of their ability they can take their place in society. Their parents are naturally delighted with the improvement they find in the children; but at the back of their minds there is always the nagging worry as to what they will do with them when they leave school.  In view of that, perhaps a special school is the best solution because in such a school, especially in large centres of population, there can be special classes.  Many of these children are very mildly handicapped and in special classes they can be taught the rudiments of a trade so that when they leave school they can apprentice themselves to a particular trade and be able, to some extent at any rate, to support themselves.  The question of trained teachers to staff such schools arises.  What should such training consist of?  Have we any teachers qualified to teach children of this type?  If we have not got them, where can we get them?  How can they be trained?</P>
    <P>The second group of children, the <Col N="853" /> moderately handicapped, comprising some 4,800 children, in most instances needs hospitalisation, not necessarily because they are mentally handicapped but because of other factors which enter into this particular type of mental handicap.  They need protection, security, and guidance.  If they are manageable, they can be kept at home and brought to occupational centres.  This would be the best method for the reasons I have already mentioned when dealing with mildly handicapped children.  In such centres the emphasis would be on training and occupationally therapy.</P>
    <P>Again, we come up against the question of teachers.  What type of teacher would be best?  Is it a teacher-cum-nurse? Where can we have these children trained, and so on?  All these problems have got to be examined.  As has been mentioned in the White Paper, there are already some clinics in the country which are doing very good work.  The moderately handicapped child will not usually take its place in society.  Some may and it should be our objective that they ought to.  If they are trained to the maximum extent possible when they reach the adult stage, because they are easy to manage, they work very well in groups, particularly on farms. The ideal solution would be the environment provided by a suitable home with a farm attached to train these children in the kind of occupation that suits them best.  They could do all kinds of farm work, looking after vegetables, milking, and so on.  The farm could be run as an economic unit.  I think the White Paper envisages something along these lines. The main thing is that these children will be usefully employed, that they will be looked after, that they will enjoy certain amenities, and live a suitable community life which appears to suit them best.</P>
    <P>With regard to the third group&mdash; the severely handicapped; this is the smallest group&mdash;these must have hospitalisation. They will always require to have institutional treatment.  They always need the services of a trained nurse.  Our objective here should be to ensure that these are not sent to <Col N="854" /> mental hospitals.  It is, I agree, difficult at times to differentiate between the severely handicapped and the mentally ill; but, no matter how severely handicapped these people are, they are not mentally ill.</P>
    <P>Considerable provision has already been made in the provision of beds for mentally handicapped children.  As outlined in the White Paper, there are prospects of a further 600 beds being provided.  It is also recognised in the White Paper, however, that the number of places available for these falls far short of the number needing institutional treatment.  It was with this in mind that I made the suggestions regarding the future of trained adults in the mildly and moderately handicapped categories because it is here that we come up against the hard core of the problem&mdash;the provision of a suitable outlet for trained adults, the provision of the necessary training in hospitals, and the training of suitable staff.</P>
    <P>I put the provision of suitable outlets for the mildly and moderately handicapped first because in our particular circumstances more places can be made available in existing hospitals and institutions if we can find suitable employment for the trained adults.  It is recognised in the White Paper, as it is generally recognised, that in order to gain the maximum advantage from teaching and training it is essential that these children should be admitted to hospital or school at as early an age as the ordinary child is expected to attend school, and, if we consider the fact that these children are handicapped, even younger, we know that once they have reached a certain standard nothing further can be done for them in that particular line and by remaining in the institution they are depriving others of training and care.  That is a matter which will have to be given first consideration.  The provision of future plans for institutions is also important but it is of relatively minor importance in comparison with the need for trained staff.  In the future the training of staff and the provision of accommodation must run along parallel lines.  The care of mentally <Col N="855" /> handicapped children is of first importance and the provision of further accommodation without providing the staff is, in my estimation, of little value.</P>
    <P>We have on record the example of a kindly-minded group of people who had what would be, to our minds, unlimited resources.  They bought up a considerable number of mansions for the purpose of dealing with mentally handicapped children.  They equipped them with all the most modern equipment and then they advertised for trained staff but that was not forthcoming. I may say that that was not in this country.  We have begun to train nurses here and provision has been made for the registration of nurses for the mentally handicapped. I should like here to pay tribute to the religious Orders who have undertaken this work.  Both religious and lay nurses will be trained under the scheme, and it is envisaged in the White Paper that when staffs have been trained further accommodation will be provided in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>When speaking on this matter on the Health Bill, I said that sanatoria which are no longer in use are ideally suited for the accommodation of mentally handicapped children.  I should like this matter to be carefully examined.  If it is, I think it will be agreed that the lay-out of these sanatoria is very similar to the layout of our more modernly equipped children's hospitals.  I again suggest that part of the training of doctors and nurses should include the care of mentally handicapped children.  I think that our county medical staffs should attempt to detect this illness during their inspection of schools. Generally speaking, this is not done at the present time.  I am not blaming anybody for that; the school may not be a suitable place, the facilities may not be available there and the staffs may not have the necessary time at a school medical examination.  However, I feel that something could be done in this field.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that a certain part of a teacher's training should be devoted to learning methods of training mentally handicapped children.  I am <Col N="856" /> not suggesting that that training should be utilised for the training of whatever defective children a teacher might find in his own school.  That would be impossible but teachers should be trained to give simple intelligence tests so that they could detect disability and so inform the parents and the proper authorities.  We have courses for teachers in music and kindergarten and I would suggest that we should have summer courses given by experts in mental treatment and that teachers should be invited to attend them, in the same way that they attend other courses.</P>
    <P>From the White Paper and from what I have said it can be seen that we face a problem of a very complex nature in the provision of accommodation, the training of staffs, the provision of methods of treatment, suitable employment, after care and so on. That problem can be dealt with only by way of a planned programme.  Like myself, other members of the House who are deeply interested in this problem are in a hurry to set matters right.  We may ask ourselves why a programme was not planned five, ten or twenty years ago and we may be told, with some reason, that other urgent health problems had to be dealt with then.</P>
    <P>While we appreciate the excellent work that has been done we realise that to give ourselves a reasonable chance of solving this problem we must first have prepared a carefully considered programme based on the best advice available.  That is the reason we welcome the commission of inquiry which it is proposed to set up but I would ask the Minister to set a time limit to its deliberations so that, when its findings are known and reduced to a programme, it should be pushed ahead to the limit of our resources.</P>
    <P>We are making progress.  Progress in this field could not be too rapid to satisfy me but I want to make sure that it will be progress.  Haphazard methods will not achieve the progress that we are all so anxious to see.  That is why I stress my belief in a soundly-based programmes.</P>
    <P>I have dealt only in broad outline with this matter.  I could say much <Col N="857" /> more but I realise that there are other Deputies who wish to speak.  I believe that we are now setting about solving the problem in the right way by setting up a commission of inquiry so that we can lay down a comprehensive plan, while at the same time pushing ahead with the provision of further facilities which we agree are inadequate for the reasons I have stated.  This is a serious problem.  It is a complex problem.  It is a sad problem and I feel that only by facing up to the realities of the situation can we solve it.</P>

      <P>As the seconder of this motion, I was rather shocked when I saw the amendment.  The motion was not put down just for political advantage.  It was put down to call the Government's attention to a terrible state of affairs. All parents have to rear their children and they often have much trouble in rearing them while they may suffer from various complaints, and diseases, diseases that can be dealt with, but the parents of a mentally handicapped child are the people who know what real trouble is.</P>
      <P>The amendment shocks me.  As a matter of fact the proposer of the amendment, Deputy Faulkner, shocks me.  He wants to convey to us that everything is all right and he seeks to evade the issue by saying that the best thing to do is to set up a commission of inquiry.  Goodness knows, a commission of inquiry, in the experience of many people, is an indication that the Government have an urgent need to bury something.  The record, as shown by the White Paper, is astounding.  There are now 2,620 beds available and the prospect of a further 600 beds being made available. That is a prospect that would bring the figure to 3,220.  From something over 1,000 in 1932&mdash;that is, in 28 years&mdash;we have shown that we have only 3,220 beds, 600 of which are merely in prospect.  It is estimated that the cure of those needing institutional care may be as high as 7,000.  It took us 28 years to go halfway in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> The Government should have taken this motion in a better spirit.  Deputy Faulkner at one point in his contribution&mdash;he can see it, when he reads the Official Report&mdash;asked where could teachers be trained and then went on to tell us about children.  I should like to know what is being done about having teachers and personnel trained who could deal with this problem.  I have here a clipping from the <i>Waterford News-Star</i> which gives an account of a meeting of the Waterford friends of mentally handicapped children.  In it, it is stated that they were very glad to see that a special class had been established for slow learners in Lady Lane Convent which now had 17 girls.  Mr. Liam Raftis, God rest him, the chairman, said that the slow learners' class was a class which he never thought would be started in the city as there were only two trained nuns in the country capable of training such children. They were lucky enough in Waterford to have secured one of them.</P>
    <P>It is a deplorable state of affairs that there are only two there and that Government Deputies should put down an amendment to steamroll the motion put down by my colleagues and myself.  This should not be a matter to be used as a political shuttlecock in this House.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Faulkner say that an immediate inquiry should be made into the position of some of our sanatoria here.  There may be a good many beds vacant and an immediate census should be taken of people who are competent to deal with handicapped children.  An effort should be made in the very near future to ensure that a great many more beds are made available.  That is the way we should go about this matter.</P>
    <P>The public in Ireland, taking them by and large, are not aware of the seriousness of this problem.  They are not aware of the great sorrow this constitutes for many parents.  Deputies cannot but be moved by the harrowing position in which parents often find themselves with lovely-looking children who are mentally retarded.  We are only just grouping in respect of this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> I also appeal to the Minister to investigate the situation, through the various medical services under his control.  He should also, as Deputy Costello said, investigate, through the Universities, the possibility of setting up a diagnostic centre in Dublin and Cork to which children could be taken and, if possible, have the diagnosis and treatment of experts.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of what was said here in regard to what might be described as day treatment.  It is very important and it is something that could be expanded much faster perhaps than the institutional treatment. In the centres that have been set up, these voluntary organisations are trying to cope with the problem and are doing great work.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the work they are doing.  If possible, they should be put in the position of employing staff or the Department and its officers could employ staff&mdash;nursing staff or teaching staff&mdash;competent to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to approach this problem in the manner I have outlined.  It is very hard to say what Ministry or what Department should be in charge&mdash;whether the Departments of Health, of Social Welfare, or of Education or whether it should come under all or a combination of them.  I think we need some legislation by which we could say to the Minister for Health who is here to-night that he is dealing with this matter of mentally handicapped children and that in the matter of their education he has authority to do it.</P>
    <P>Two previous speakers asked where teachers could be trained.  I believe there are centres in England and in America.  I am sure the Minister will be able to tell us more about these than we now know.  If and when the Government intend sending personnel abroad to study and qualify to look after these handicapped children, it would be a good thing if they were sent to various countries. It is very hard to judge whether the British have a better way of looking after these children than the Americans <Col N="860" /> or whether the Germans or the French have a better way.  I would urge the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>There is a <i>créche</i> in Waterford and the men and women looking after it are volunteers.  They supply cars to bring the children to the <i>créche.</i>  They have done great work and they have brought lecturers, especially Sister Louise of the French Sisters of Charity, to direct them in a general way in the matter of running a <i>créche</i> and of helping these children.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see in the report I have before me, which I have already mentioned, that some of these children have improved very much under this treatment and by being brought from their homes to mix with other children. I should like to point out that the main funds for the purpose are derived from flag days.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should cast a benevolent eye on these people in these various centres&mdash;not only in my own constituency but in other places&mdash;who are doing such very fine work.</P>
    <P>In regard to retarded children, Deputy Faulkner mentioned that teachers should have summer schools. I hate to think of placing any further burdens on the shoulders of national teachers or of secondary teachers.  I do not think that this is the way to go about the matter; it should be approached through the medical officers of health.  The teachers might be able to draw the attention of the medical officers of health to such children. That is a matter which might well be considered.  In other branches of the health services we provide special treatment and send specialists down the country at various times.  It would be a good idea if the Minister would consider sending some outstanding specialist to diagnose this awful complaint.  Outstanding specialists could be sent to these various centres, perhaps even once or twice a year.  Arrangements could be made to have the children brought there; their case histories could be sent to the specialists beforehand.  That is a matter to which particular attention should be paid because I am sure if a number of these children were submitted to the observation of a first-class <Col N="861" /> specialist, it could happen&mdash;and the chance is well worth taking&mdash;that under his direction or directions given to the people in charge of the children, that these children could be improved in mind and in body.</P>
    <P>In regard to children who must have institutional treatment, one man remarked to me that it did not make much difference if we had a big central institution.  I thought that was a bit hard-hearted as parents would often like to come to see their children.  He pointed out to me that if they did want to see their children, they could travel in the same manner as people who are brought to the various hospitals and sanatoria all over the country by the local health authority. Transport is provided for them.  He pointed out that if there was a very large sanatorium which was not being used, and if the Minister was in a position to staff it in the near future, it would be better to have a centre there for the very bad cases in need of institutional treatment.</P>
    <P>He considered this institutional treatment would be better because it would be centralised and there could be a concentration of specialists there. I am not altogether convinced on that because the human element is involved. A centre in the country might be very remote from the children's parents homes.  I thought we might have three or four such places, but of course that is a problem for the Minister. I am not pressing that there should be one central place or three central places.  The Minister will be able to examine that question and the officers of his Department will be in a position to give him a fair idea as to <Col N="862" /> the best way of making a real impact on the problem of the large number of children in need of institutional treatment and for whom at present there are no beds or institutions.</P>
    <P>It is really a pity that we have an amendment proposed to this motion. During the Recess, when my colleagues and I decided to put down the motion, we thought it would be a matter which would be debated in a detached way by Deputies from all sides who, I know, are interested in this great problem.  The motion is a reasonable one.  The facilities at present are deplorably inadequate.  According to the White Paper, only half the children in need of institutional treatment are getting such treatment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state in respect of forests where the forestry bonus scheme is in operation (a) the total number of men employed in each county immediately prior to the introduction of the scheme, and (b) the number at present employed, giving totals for all counties; and if he will give the names of the forests where the bouns scheme has not yet been introduced and the approximate date of commencement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to (a) of the Deputy's question, the position is that the Incentive Bonus Scheme was not simultaneously to all Forests within a county, application in the various forests in County Wicklow, for instance, went on over a period of 21 months.  The preapplication employment figures given in reply to the Deputy's question of 26th October, 1960, and previous questions do not, therefore, relate to a particular employment week and to total them on a county basis would be meaningless.</P>
      <P>(b) Present employment (week ended 21st October, 1960) at Forests where Incentive Bonus Scheme is in operation:&mdash;</P>
