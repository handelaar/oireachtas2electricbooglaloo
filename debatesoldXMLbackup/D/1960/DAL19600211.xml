    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Minister's remarks last night, I just want to draw attention to one aspect. On the Second Stage, the Minister was able to mention various cases under the Health Act affecting people in Dublin.  He mentioned an individual in Churchtown and he mentioned the case of the man who became ill in Dún Laoghaire.  So far, the Minister has made no mention of any specific cases in relation to complaints about shortcomings of the Act as it is in operation in Cork at the present time. I should like to draw particular attention to the Minister's remarks last night about the people living in the city suburbs.  I hope and expect that he is not suggesting that the people, even though working in Cork city but living in the suburbs and who come within the jurisdiction of the county council, are not getting the benefits which should be theirs under the Health Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of the specialist services in the city.  Let the Minister understand that the very same services apply in the county.  They are afforded by the county council to all the people in the suburbs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry was not correct last night when he mentioned the question of these people.  The 33,000 people mentioned by the Minister are the people living in the Blackrock, St. Mary's, Bishopstown and other areas, but, because of the fact that they are living in the county, they are getting the county services.  If there are shortcomings in the operation of the Health Act in Cork City, the shortcomings are not noticeable to any degree whatever in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Healy, a supporter of the Minister, will bear me out when I say that one of the difficulties there is the shortage of dispensaries.  The acute position in relation to the number of dispensaries in the suburban areas of the city is not the fault of the local authority.  Indeed, I doubt very much, <Col N="215" /> as I said last night, that even the socalled unification of the health services in that area will be of any extra benefit in speeding up the provision of dispensaries in that district.  Therefore, I believe the Minister will have to go further if he wants to be able to justify the inclusion of Cork city and county within the proposals for unification of the health services.  I would with to leave it to other members to express their views after that.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the form as at present in operation in relation to the sanatoria board and also the Mental Hospital Board.  Should the Minister wish the Sanatoria Board to operate as a unified health authority within its own limits, well and good&mdash; we have never objected to that&mdash;but the point is that the Sanatoria Board, in conjunction with the manager and the officials and also in relation to the mental hospital authorities, are working satisfactory on their own.</P>
    <P>I have not yet heard any member of the Mental Hospital Committee say that he got any complaint in relation to the facilities afforded to patients or the facilities given to relations to visit them.  Therefore, if that service is giving satisfaction, why interfere with it?  The people of Cork city and county are quite satisfied with what they have in relation to sanatorium treatment and mental hospital treatment.  That being so, surely that area cannot be put on a par with Dublin in relation to the failure of the system.  We have no Churchtown or Dún Laoghaire difficulties in Cork. We have had our own difficulties and we are still awaiting a decision from the Minister to enable us to solve them.  I believe that this system of so-called unification will ultimately be detrimental to the people of Cork city and County.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing with this matter last night, I pointed out that where Deputy Desmond and I differ is that Deputy Desmond says that the people of Cork county are fully satisfied with the present set-up.  The people of the South Cork area, whom Deputy Desmond and I represent, are paying through the nose, at the rate of about <Col N="216" /> £2,000,000 in all, for legislation passed by this House 20 years ago.  We have been paying that amount for the up-keep of the poor of Cork city.  That is the sole reason I am backing this Bill and I do so in the hope that we shall get the situation altered.  That is the sole reason and I am not concerned with anything else.</P>
      <P>The people of South Cork, if I may give examples which have been given in this House before, paid in home assistance last year the sum of £38,900, and the people of Cork city paid £12,200.  For that amount, the people of Cork city received in home assistance £20,600 and the county got back only £18,300.  Those are figures that cannot be contradicted and they are dure to legislation passed by this House in open defiance of the representatives of South Cork in the House at the time.</P>
      <P>There is a free boot scheme supposed to be in operation and the bill for it this year was £15,500.  Of that, the grant amounted to £5,600, leaving a levy on the ratepayers of £9,900.  Of that amount, the city paid £3,300 and got back £9,400.  The county paid £6,350 and got back £6,000.  Those are the figures and they cannot be contradicted.  They are the effect of legislation passed by this House to force the rural ratepayer to pay not alone for his own poor but for the poor of Cork city as well.  There can be no justification for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am hoping that this Bill will change all that if it is properly amended and looked after.  There are enough plutocrats in Cork city to look after their own children who have fallen by the wayside.  These people have been battening on the rural community for a long time and there is no reason why the ratepayers of South Cork should subscribe over £100,000 for the poor of Cork city.  Others have questioned the reliability of these figures and the Manager gave them correctly.  I am concerned also with the memory of the men who had courage enough to stand up here in all parts of this House when the Home Assistance Act of 1939 was being passed and challenge the manoeuvre by which the county paid two-thirds of the cost and got back one-third and the city paid one-third and got back two-thirds.  I remember <Col N="217" /> the late Deputy Broderick and the late Deputy O'Neill standing up to oppose that kind of legislation when it was being passed here.</P>
    <P>We all know that there is no justice south of Dublin, as far as the ordinary people of this country are concerned. Anything that is going is for Dublin and north of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork will some day in the near future throw off the shackles of the lot of you.  We had to send a Cork man down to keep the Deputy's area out of bankruptcy.  That is the position in Cork.</P>
      <P>When I come to consider this Bill, I admit that we may get rid of some duplication of services.  There is no doubt about that but I would have far more faith in the successful operation of this Bill if the Minister would stand up and say that for the next three years the Dept. of Health would not interfere.  If he would say that, I would say we in Cork would work it out some way and make it a success, but what hope have we as things are? The cost of the sanatoria service in Cork county is decreasing.  That disease was brought under control to that extent.  However, there was the difficulty that the South Cork Board of Assistance had not enough beds. They applied for a wing in a sanatorium but their application was turned down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill there will be no necessity for getting sanction from the Department of Health for the removal of patients from one hospital, the property of a local authority, to another hospital, the property of the same authority.  That is one of the improvements I see in the Bill.</P>
      <P>A similar incident occurred in relation to a place called Lota in Cork which was taken over by the Sanatorium Board at a period when we had grave difficulty as to what we were going to do with patients in the sanatorium.  When we overcame that difficulty and did not require Lota to deal with the situation, we had 480 patients on the waiting list in the orthopaedic hospital and although the Sanatorium Board were quite willing to hand over the hospital, it took six months to obtain sanction for that from the Department of Health.  That is another thing that cannot happen any more when this Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>I do not know how these bodies will be able to dispose of the business they will have to deal with at meetings. Usually it takes about four hours for the Sanatorium Board to deal with the sanatorium.  Our Board of Assistance meetings sometimes last only a short time; more times they might go on for four or five hours.  I wonder how a team can be got, composed of these bodies, that will roll all the items to be covered into one day's work at a meetings?  What will be the function of these committees and how will they operate?  These are the questions I should like the Minister to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says we can have three committees.  He has given no indication whether those three committees will be joint committees, as at present, where you can have in the Sanatorium Board or in the Mental Hospital Committee representatives of the Corporation and the Cork County Council. I cannot find a provision to that effect in the Bill.  If a committee comes to <Col N="219" /> a decision and that decision is brought before the Health Authority the following week and the corporation members are not members of that committee, can they use their steamroller of 28 votes to roll the committee down the hill?</P>
    <P>I should like also some explanation from the Minister as to the effect of one of his amendments here.  In the Bill as it stands the matter of public assistance under the South Cork Board of Public Assistance is taken out of the arbitrator's hands; he has no say in the manner in which payment will be made.  I know I am digressing but this will govern our attitude towards the rest of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was relying on my own judgment and I do not think I am often wrong.  I should like to have the question of the committees to be formed under the Bill clarified by the Minister.  Are there to be joint committees? If so, what power is taken in order that we can have joint committees, and how many committees can we have?  Supposing we have a committee dealing with santoria treatment, and a committee dealing with mental hospitals, and mental hospital treatment, can we delegate to the ordinary committees that at present exist powers in relation to home assistance? Those are the things that are quite natural for us, and those are the things on which I should like information from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am not going to be called upon to be a sort of pacificator as between the city of Cork and county of Cork.  I should find myself very much like the grain between the upper and the nether millstone if I were.  I want to refer to Deputy Desmond's speech and to remind him that, as he pointed out, Cork is very well served by the Cork sanatoria board, and well served by the Cork joint mental hospital board.  They serve all the people of Cork irrespective of whether they live within the city boundaries, or outside the city boundaries.  That, I am told, has been found to be a very satisfactory arrangement.</P>
      <P>What we are proposing to do in this Bill is to extend that arrangement which has been so satisfactory in respect of these Cork health services to all the other health services in the city and county of Cork.  We are treating Cork, despite the unwillingness of its citizens, as one entity for the purpose of the health services, putting the county health services and the dispensary services on the basis that has been found to be so satisfactory in operation in regard to the mental hospital board and the sanatoria board.</P>
      <P>There is no justification for fearing that when we extend that principle to all the other health services that the people of Cork will have any reason to be apprehensive that they will not be better off under the new arrangement than under the old arrangement from the point of view of convenience and availability of the services.  I hope, in due course, to improve the services also because a degree of overlapping will be avoided; so that, as I said last night, we will be able to make a better utilisation of the institutions, and the personnel of these institutions which, at present, have five separate bodies in the city and county of Cork administering them.  That is a reasonable case for adopting the principle in Section 3, the principle of having a unified health authority for city and county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have gone, I think, a considerable distance to meet the special circumstances of Cork.  We have enlarged the size of the proposed health <Col N="221" /> authority, and have increased the numbers of those who, as members of appointing bodies, will be eligible to be members of the unified health authority.  We have made provision whereby the county of Cork will have 28 members, as against the previous proposal, and we are correspondingly increasing the number of members for the city of Cork from eight to 12.  It will be realised that the electoral areas within the county will have the equivalent of four members each on the new board, and there is a further provision that at least three members from each one of the electoral areas must be on the board.</P>
    <P>We understand that there is a rather rigid set-up, so far as one can see, in the composition of the Cork County Council.  There are three major Parties there.  I do not know where the Independents come in between, but there is provision anyhow to ensure that every interest will be as fairly represented as can be devised on the joint board.  There is room, of course, by agreement, to find a place on the authority for those who are not attached to any of the political Parties.  In addition to that, we have made further provision for local committees who will have certain statutory powers delegated to them, or conferred on them, by regulation to be made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We are assuming they will take the place of the existing local arrangements and will replace the Cork Board of Assistance and the other two committees which, at present, supervise the general administration of the health services in Cork city and county.  These committees will be empowered to supervise the general operation of the local health services in the districts concerned and will be in a position to make any necessary representations to the county manager and to the other appropriate officers in relation to them.</P>
    <P>On the question of any special arrangements which might require to be made, in regard to the management of the Cork sanatoria board and the Mental Hospital, as Deputy Corry mentioned there is nothing in this Bill which will prevent the unified <Col N="222" /> authority, when it is established, from setting up special sub-committees to perform the functions in relation to these institutions which are already being performed by the joint boards. It is not necessary that there should be any special legislative provision to that end, but if any member of the House is in doubt, I shall have the matter further examined.  My advice is that it is within the competence of the new unified authority to set up sub-committees and give them responsibility for discharging the functions which have been performed in whole or in part by the sanatoria board.</P>
    <P>I do not want that statement to be taken quite in the most general sense because there may be some things which it will be found, when the authority comes into existence, that the authority will have to do, as a whole, which at the present moment might be done by the sanatoria board or the mental hospital board.  By and large, however, I cannot see anything that would prohibit or prevent the authority from setting up sub-committees for special purposes, and giving certain powers to these sub-committees.</P>
    <P>Another question was: how are we to get people to devote their whole time to the affairs of the unified authority? I do not see how there can be much greater difficulty under the new set-up than under the old set-up, particularly having regard to the position in relation to the establishment of the local committees, and having regard to the fact that sub-committees with delegated functions can be established to look after special institutions.  The same demands are being made at the moment&mdash;demands which Deputy Corry thought would be too onerous and excessive&mdash;upon the personnel of the health authorities in the city and county of Cork.  These demands will not be enlarged in any way by reason of the establishment of the unified authority.  On the contrary, it is hoped that perhaps they may be a little less, and that the demands upon the time of public representatives will not be as great as Deputy Corry has indicated they are.</P>
    <P>Take the case, for instance, of the Cork Sanatoria Board.  It has 20 <Col N="223" /> members, four nominated by Cork Corporation and 16 by Cork County Council.  They have to spend a special day on that.  I assume if a sub-committee is set up to deal with the affairs of the sanatoria that demands will be made on the sub-committee, the same sort of demands that at present are made on the Sanatoria Board itself. Similarly, with the Cork Mental Hospital Board.  It has 26 members, four local authority members, five Cork Corporation members and 17 Cork County Council members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out to the Deputy that, so far as I have been advised up to this, it is quite within the competence of the proposed new authority to set up special sub-committees to look after these specialised institutions and to function in respect of them by and large as they have been doing up to the present. There may be some question about certain functions which at the moment they perform and which will have to be performed in principle by the new unified authority.  By and large, I think if the members of the unified authority want it that way there is nothing to prevent them having it that way under this Bill.  If there is any doubt about it I will have it looked into and see what would be necessary and I will put down an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am forced to admit that there is a good deal of substance in the points made by Deputy Desmond and in part by Deputy Corry.  I am in complete agreement with the principles of the Bill as far as they are applicable to Dublin, Waterford and Limerick.  These are compact areas. In Dublin with its centralised population these principles are easily workable but consider the distance from Youghal Harbour to the far point of the Beara Peninsula or let us realise the fact that when one reaches the <Col N="224" /> Cork border, travelling from Dublin to Cork, one is as far from the extreme end of the Beara Peninsula as he is from Dublin.</P>
      <P>There is another point we must remember.  There is no geographical centre in County Cork which would be equi-distant from any remote point in the county.  It is true that the city is the administrative centre.  It is 30 miles from Youghal, 40 miles from the Limerick border on the Northern side and 90 miles from the end of the Beara Peninsula.  I am quite dubious about the workability of this unified service in the County Cork.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Minister has come part of the way to meet the points put up when he assures us that the central authority set up under this Bill can appoint sub-committees to administer the affairs of parts of the county.  Why have the Bill at all if that is the case? I am not a member of any local authority.  I cannot speak with the same familiarity of the county services in Cork as those who have already quoted.  I take the detached, objective view.  I am concerned about the efficiency the Minister has envisaged in this Bill and the provision of better services under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister in all earnestness that the application of the Bill to County Cork should be deferred indefinitely until such time as he is assured that the Bill has behind it the desired results in the other areas, Dublin, Waterford and Limerick.  In that way he would be able to speak with greater conviction.  We would be all in the position to be better convinced at a later stage when we see how experience worked out in the operation of this Bill in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point.  In Cork City at the moment the county council services are diffused over the whole of the city because they have no central offices.  I think the day is very far distant when they will have central offices.  It would be unthinkable at the moment, with the state of the county finances and the high ceiling of rates, to envisage the building of central offices.  The Board of Assistance is administered from George's Quay.  Assistance is distributed at Grattan Street and in another part of <Col N="225" /> the city.  The Health Authority and the Sanatoria Board have offices in Grand Parade.  The Mental Hospital has its meetings in the hospital itself away up at the western side of the city.  Then we will have the City Hall in addition so that even with the unification of the Health Services in Cork there is no possibility of having the staff housed in any one particular area at the moment.</P>
    <P>That in itself is a drawback and a reason why the application of the Bill to Cork should be deferred indefinitely until such time as we realise these hopes, and it will be made opportune for the public authorities in Cork to have central offices from which the unified services can be worked.</P>

      <P>In one rather short section of this Bill the Minister proposes to make revolutionary changes in the administration of the Health Services in the county and city of Cork.  Where did this demand for such changes come from?  Did it come from the people of the county and city of Cork?  Did it come from the members of Cork Corporation or did it come from the members of the Cork county council?  Indeed, it did not.  There was no suggestion for any changes made either by the Oireachtas Members in Cork county, county councillors, local representatives or the general community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This move to establish a unified health service authority in Cork originated in the Custom House because we heard about this some years ago.  The idea is not a new one.  Some four or five years ago, when Deputy O'Higgins was Minister for Health, in a democratic manner he put the viewpoint that Cork Corporation and Cork county council should consider the feasibility of establishing a unified health authority.  It was rejected unanimously by the Cork County Council and there was no more vehement opponent to it on that body than the previous speaker here this morning, Deputy Corry.  Having regard to the unanimity of its rejection by the Cork County Council and, I understand, by Cork Corporation, Deputy O'Higgins in a democratic way accepted the viewpoint of the public <Col N="226" /> representatives of those two authorities and waived his proposal to implement a unified health authority in Cork City and County.</P>
    <P>That was all very well until the present Minister came into office.  Naturally the same promptings were at his disposal in the Department and what was his attitude to them?  Did he consult Cork County Council or Cork Corporation, or did he consult any authority on health legislation in Cork County?  He certainly did not.  At least that is the information I have.  Instead he introduced this Bill, with Section 3 in it, changing the health administration in Cork County.  We had a rather lengthy discussion in Cork County Council on the proposed change and I feel the Minister will agree that the members of that body, with their local knowledge, are just as much conversant with health administration in Cork, and with the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed change, as are the people in the Custom House who have no personal knowledge of the difficulties to be faced in satisfactorily administering a health service in an area such as Cork, which comprises more than one seventh of this State.</P>
    <P>The proposed change was rejected by Cork County Council and Deputy Healy will correct me if I am wrong when I say it was rejected by Cork Corporation.  However, the opinions of these bodies were not acceptable to the Minister and now he proposes to make a change in the original section to increase the membership of the unified health authority, from 16 to 28 in the case of the council, and from eight to 12 in the case of the corporation. He further informed us this morning that even though he intends wiping out Cork Mental Hospital Board and the Cork Sanatoria Board as statutory bodies, he intends allowing the establishment of these same bodies under the title of &ldquo;sub-committees&rdquo;. It seems ridiculous to me that with the passing of this Bill the Cork Mental Hospital Board will be wiped out but as a sub-committee it will be restored.  The same thing will happen with the Sanatoria Board and I cannot see how economy will be effected by that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> If these Boards are to be established in the form of sub-committees it is natural to assume that the staffs attached to them will be retained and, along with their retention, is it not also reasonable to assume that new staffs will be recruited for the unified health authority?  The Minister says that at present we have four or five different authorities in the country and city of Cork dealing with health administration but, judging from the statement he made a short time ago, it does not seem likely that he will reduce the number of these bodies.</P>
    <P>The Sanatoria Board will continue to function as a sub-committee.  I think there is very little in that because everybody knows that, so far as the administration of health services are concerned in any part of the country, the main functions rest with the county managers and it could be said that bodies like the Mental Hospital Board and the Sanatoria Board are only keeping a watchful eye on the manner in which the managers administer the moneys provided at the annual meetings of these bodies.  Everybody knows that their functions are very limited because the Government and the Minister have the right to abolish a body or board that does not act in conformity with Governmental and Departmental regulations.  Several such bodies who adopted an independent attitude were abolished in the past and it is not unlikely they will be abolished in the future.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear my colleague from Cork changing his viewpoint on this measure.  Deputy Corry now says that the only nice thing about it is that the people in Cork City who are in receipt of home assistance, and who qualify under the free footwear scheme will have to pay for these services within the city confines.  That is a very peculiar statement and I understand he has anticipated the Minister's approach to Section 11 of the Bill, that there will be a system of local charges. I am entirely and completely opposed to a system of local charges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry seems to think that if the citizens within the South Cork Board of Assistance area get assistance, <Col N="228" /> either in the shape of home assistance or free footwear, the Cork Corporation area should pay.  I do not agree with that viewpoint and I do not agree that it should happen if we have a unified health service in Cork.  I think if the rural part of the South Cork area is in the favourable position that much fewer of its citizens need public assistance in the way of allowances or free footwear, Deputy Corry and others on that body should be very pleased that is the position&mdash; that much fewer of their population need help and assistance from local authorities than do, say, residents of Cork City.  That is a peculiar approach to the support of this measure because, if that is carried to its logical conclusion, it could be said that benefits given in a particular area should be charged to that area and that we should have a system of local charges.</P>
    <P>It could be said that different electoral areas in the county should bear their local charges.  I believe that is entirely out of place.  I feel that if this unified health authority comes into being the proposals of Deputy Corry should be ignored.  Charges should be on a uniform scale, extending over the city and the county as a whole.  I make that statement even though I am completely opposed to the section and have my name down sponsoring its rejection. However, should the section be passed, I have a feeling the Minister will ignore the move being made to set up a series of local charges.</P>
    <P>I represent possibly the poorest part of Cork County.  I am a firm believer that wherever a local authority functions there should be the same rate of charges all over the area, irrespective of where the special or additional services are being provided.  Deputy Manley has referred to this question that has agitated the minds of all of us in Cork County.  It is more than 100 miles in length.  Furthermore, within the county, there is a large population residing in Cork City.</P>
    <P>What may be said to be applicable to people and to areas in West Cork or maybe in other parts of the county would not be applicable to Cork City. If a board, say, of 40 members is set <Col N="229" /> up and say, Deputy Healy has some special case to make for residents within the Cork Corporation area, will opposition to the provision of benefits for the people of Cork City, as expounded here to-day, prevail and will the members, say, from West or North Cork adopt the attitude &ldquo;What is happening in the city is not a close concern of ours; we will try to keep down the rates even in respect of a service that may be absolutely essential.&rdquo;  I am not too positive that that will happen but if we have too many Deputy Corrys on the board it is quite within reason that it may happen.</P>
    <P>I believe that once a person is on a board, whether a council or a health authority, he must approach questions coming before it on an equitable basis irrespective of where they come from, whether they come from the area from which he himself is getting his votes or from opposite parts of the area.  If there is no uniformity of approach by the members, I am afraid such a body would not do much useful work.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House.  I should not, however, like to resume my seat without asking the Minister, instead of expressing disapproval, to review once more the proposals submitted to him by the county health services committee regarding mentally defective children in County Cork.  To give the Minister a <i>résumé</i> of the position, this has been a very serious problem in Cork County for the past number of years.  We have several mentally defective children, divided into four classifications by the county medical officer, who cannot get suitable accommodation.</P>

      <P>In view of the ruling of the Chair there is not much more for me to say except that probably as good a case could be made by the Minister for a unified health authority for the whole country.  The length of Cork is very close on one-third of the length of the whole country and the population, as mentioned yesterday, is almost 350,000 persons, some 100,000 of whom live in Cork City.  How can a unified health authority deal with Cork where there are such different conditions in different parts of the country&mdash;in remote isolated districts; in groups of islands, in a big urban population; in big farming areas such as that in which our friends resides in East Cork where I am sure the people are doing fairly well?  Where there is a conglomeration of all kinds of rural life, no case can be made for a unified health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, if this <Col N="231" /> section should be passed, to take no cognisance of any suggestion that there should be local charges.  If there will be local charges surely we cannot say it will be a unified health authority.  I agree that the Cork Corporation should be a separate area in every sense of the word.  They should have a separate health authority.  The members of that authority would be thoroughly conversant with the position that obtains in a rural area like Cork with which members living in far away districts would not be so conversant.  The best way to achieve your purpose if you want to give over, as you say paying more assistance in respect of the Cork area than you are getting is by supporting section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy asked where the demand for this measure was coming from.  Anybody connected with public life over the last few years must realise that there is great dissatisfaction with the way the Health Act is applied in many areas.  There is great need for improvement in the administration of the services.  That is very obvious in the part of the country from which I come.  I can understand Deputy Murphy's feelings of disquiet because of the Mentality of the Deputy who spoke about putting charges on certain areas and keeping them to certain areas, but I do not think there is any necessity for that.  There has never been any disinclination to help in any way possible the people who have come, sometimes in their hundreds and sometimes in their thousands, from outlying districts seeking employment or seeking residences in the city of Cork.  They have never been treated differently from the people of longer standing in the city.  I should be very surprised if the same mentality did not exist in any other part of the country.  We have enough boundaries already without setting a boundary between city and country folk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only possible way of justifying confining the local authority completely to the city of Cork would be if the city boundary were moved out to reasonable proportions.  At the moment the position is that the city is overflowing, but Cork Corporation is building <Col N="232" /> residences for the citizens within half a mile of the city centre.  That is unrealistic and will have to be dealt with in the future but, until such time as that is done, there is no use talking about an authority for Cork city alone. It must be obvious that the new health authority could simplify the position. We are told the authorities in Cork work very well.  So they do, to my own knowledge, within the powers given to them.  But, as Deputy Murphy said, we all know that sometimes patients cannot be transferred to hospital because there is doubt as to whether they come under some section of the Act.  As a result the patient does not receive the immediate and special attention he requires.  Our first consideration should be the patient; secondly, maybe, the efficiency; and, thirdly, economics, but, if the patient is suffering in any way, we should do something to improve the position.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion I mentioned the position in regard to the supply of dentures in Cork city and county, where in one place you paid £6,000 for, perhaps, little more than 50 per cent. the number of dentures one could get for the same sum in the adjoining part of the same county.  I am not saying that the best is always the cheapest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do say that the charge should be universal and that it should be possible to apply the best scheme to all the area rather than apply it to some of the area.  I am privileged to be a member of a voluntary hospital board, of a mental hospital board and of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance.  It is hard for somebody on the Minister's side to say it, but I feel sincerely, without any political bias, that the Minister's Bill is an improvement on the present position and well worth a trial.  Only time will prove its weakness, if any, but it certainly is an improvement on the present position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before, this Bill follows a pattern.  We have a county board of health for Cork county with eight representatives, and <Col N="233" /> in the county we have three minor boards.  We have to do away with the county board and leave the three minor boards to do the job.  I am not at all surprised at Deputy Murphy's attitude.  It is the attitude I would adopt if I were representing the people he represents.  If I were another man, with my hands deep down in the other fellow's pocket, I would keep it there as long as I could.  The representatives of West Cork have always got fair play and justice, and more than justice, from Cork County Council.  They pay one-tenth of the rates of the area and get back about one-third.  I do not think they have any reason to complain. I am not surprised that Deputy Murphy is joining hands with his brother in arms, Deputy Healy, in that attitude.  When the cake is there every fellow must get a slice.  Apparently that is the attitude as far as the rural population of South Cork are concerned.</P>
      <P>I have given grave thought to this matter.  I felt from the first day that it was iniquitous to have a different basis of payment in respect of two authorities.  In respect of the mental hospital board and the sanatorium board there is a <i>per capita</i> charge, but in the case of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance there is a valuation charge.  The valuation charge was made under very peculiar circumstances. Following the burning of Cork city in 1920 a special arrangement was made under which the rebuilt areas were not revalued.  I appreciate the Minister's gesture in increasing the number of representatives, but whatever representatives come there, their job will be to administer an Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only treat Deputy Murphy's statement in regard to my attitude with contempt.  For seventeen years I have been chairman of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance, which has been administering that Act.  The people I represented paid two-thirds and got one-third back.  I challenge Deputy Murphy or any other Deputy to compare the conditions in St. Finbarr's hospital twenty years ago with the conditions there today.  Well over £500,000 has been spent on it.  Due to <Col N="234" /> the trickery of the Department of Health, two-thirds was paid by South Cork and one-third by Cork.  If Deputy Murphy gets his wish, he will have the pleasure of seeing those he represents pay some of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said they did not pay anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy hoped that would not occur.  If Deputy Murphy's hope is carried out, Cork county as a whole, north and south, will pay its share for Cork city.  Deputy Murphy's people and the North Cork people and the rest of them would be paying.  I think that would be an iniquitous proceeding.</P>
      <P>Deputy Healy refers to the city boundaries being moved out.  There was never any objection to moving the city boundaries out.  As chairman of the South Cork Board of Health for a long number of years I can say that we assisted in providing services outside the borough boundaries in the shape of housing, sanitary facilities and so on.  When the offer was made to the city to have the boundaries moved out, we had no objection but the moment they found that they would have to pay they pulled out of it.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said in regard to different committees. It takes my mind back to a very old pattern.  I remember being a member of the old finance committee of the Cork County Council 30 years ago and a proposal came to us from the Department of Local Government that we should have one county surveyor and two assistants to run the county. I remember leaning across and asking one of the assistants who was there: &ldquo;How do you think you will get on?&rdquo; and he replied: &ldquo;Oh, I will have plenty of time for fishing.&rdquo;  Then I turned to the gentleman who was to be county surveyor and I asked him the same question and he replied: &ldquo;Oh, I can be fishing all the time because the other two will be doing my job.&rdquo;  This is the old pattern coming back again under this.  I am voting for it for one reason alone and that reason is contained in Section 11.</P>

I am rather surprised at Deputy Manley's attitude with regard to it but, frankly, I confess I am deeply concerned with the fact that for many years the ratepayers in my portion of Cork county have been bled white under legislation passed by this House.  I object to any continuation of it.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that I am rather interested to hear the Cork Deputy's reference to Section 3. Section 2, of course, is what concerns us in Dublin.  I should like to place on the records of the House that, in the view of those concerned in Dublin, it is somewhat similarly placed in regard to conditions and circumstances as Cork.  We have no grievance against the Minister.</P>
      <P>I was rather astonished to hear Deputy Murphy talk about this Bill being hatched in the Custom House, apparently behind the backs of the Cork authorities, because we in Dublin have been discussing this matter for a very long period.  We had opportunities of discussing it amongst ourselves with the other authorities concerned and we found we could agree on most things and did in fact agree on representation and so forth.</P>
      <P>The matter about which we are concerned in this House, as well as the local authorities, is that there should be some improvement in the health services, particularly with regard to ensuring efficiency in administration and, obviously, ultimately with a reduced cost of administration.  There must be in Cork county and city the same overlapping that we have experienced. I do not understand why there should be objection to the principles of the Bill and the details as laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that we had a variety of apprehensions when this was first mooted quite a considerable time ago. There was the question of the staffs of the various authorities.  We now find that when this council is set up it <Col N="236" /> will take over from us in the city of Dublin, and also in Dun Laoghaire and the county of Dublin, the staffs previously used by us to the extent that they will be required.  There will not be any problem.  As I have said before, we shall have full representation on the council, with numbers agreed by the authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister's Department were very generous in their discussions and correspondence with our corporation and the Dun Laoghaire Borough Corporation and the County Council of Dublin.  I cannot understand why the Cork authorities' representatives could not have got together as we did and examined what the impact would be, particularly on the rates.  The Cork representatives ought to have another look at it and then discuss the various areas concerned. As Deputy Healy has stated the patient should be the first consideration.  In the long run patients will have greater service and prompter service.  In every way the Bill will help in the administration of the health services which have now become part of the life of the people and part of the responsibility of the nation as a whole.  The people will find it will be a better service at a much reduced cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with one point on Section 3 which I think applies to Section 2 and to each of the sections setting up a unified authority. It is a matter which has been referred to by Deputy Cosgrave and one to which I should like to refer briefly to secure the Minister's sympathetic consideration. I believe, as Deputy Healy said, that our first concern in a matter of this kind should be for the patient. It is common knowledge when people fall ill and it is deemed necessary to send them to hospital&mdash;in the case of many of us who have had that experience more than once it is not very alarming&mdash;that to many of them their first introduction to a hospital for treatment carries with it a great deal of concern and anxiety.  Heretofore, I understand it has been possible to allow a patient requiring hospital treatment to go to any hospital of his or her choice, provided it is a hospital recognised by the local authority and <Col N="237" /> one with which the local authority can deal.  I understand that in certain areas a practice threatens to grow up in which dispensary doctors are restricted from sending their patients to the hospital to which the patient would prefer to go, even though that hospital is in contact with the local authority and has accommodation, and are being pressed to send patients to a particular hospital, possibly because there is a temporary surplus of accommodation there or something of that kind.</P>
      <P>I recognise that economic considerations would actuate the executive officer in a health area to try to send patients to the hospital that had a lot of accommodation available, whereas other hospitals were at the limit of their capacity, but I want to urge on the Minister that, as Deputy Healy pointed out, our first consideration should be the patient.  It makes an immense difference if a nervous person facing his first hospital experience has a special feeling for the Sisters of Mercy or the Sisters of Charity or possibly knows one nun or somebody in one of the hospitals which are available. It makes an immense difference to that person if he is free to go to that hospital and have the feeling that there is somebody there who will come to him and perhaps speak a word to him and help him to become familiar with the physicians and the staff, if it is his first contact with hospital accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would therefore suggest that, whether it is done administratively or otherwise, it should be made clear to the executive authorities of these unified health authorities that they should be extremely slow to send a patient to a hospital other than that of his or her own choice, when the patient has expressed a choice.  I do not want to elaborate unduly on this matter.  I do not think it is a matter which has reached anything approximating to an abuse, but I feel that if it were allowed to develop, we might fail to show a reasonable regard for the reasonable predilection of a patient for whom I think we ought to have special solicitude in that they are meeting an extremely disturbing experience for the <Col N="238" /> first time in their lives in having to go to hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no knowledge of the particular case to which Deputy Cosgrave referred last night and I shall have to ascertain the facts. We must not, however, forget that the executive officer has financial responsibility in matters of this sort.  If a person elects to exercise his free choice of hospital, the executive officer must consider the financial advantages of having the patient go to a designated hospital.  Dublin Corporation, which is a wealthy body compared with the impoverished city of Cork, has, as an act of grace, accepted patients for general, voluntary hospitals and this difficulty does not arise.  As against that, the assistant county or city manager has the responsibility of trying to ensure that the local authority institutions are run as economically as possible and if everybody were to be permitted to go to the hospital of their choice, the cost of the health services, I am afraid, would soar enormously and we would have a number of derelict institutions on our hands.  That is a real problem and while it will be dealt with with all the human consideration possible, it is something we shall have to look at with a degree of realism, bearing in mind that the attitude of the ratepayers may be very different from that of ourselves as private individuals.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely <Col N="239" /> with the objectives of the Bill, but, as far as the city and county of Cork are concerned, I doubt very much if we are going the right way about achieving these aims.  My view is that public representatives, elected for particular purposes, should have direct contact with the administration of the various services in the county and that if a member is elected to the county council and has no contact, no direct responsibility in regard to the health services, it is not fair to him or to the people whom he is elected to represent.</P>
      <P>In the administrative areas of Cork city and county, we have at present a health committee in West Cork, and in North Cork, and a joint committee for Cork city and the surrounding area&mdash; Cork South.  Under this Bill, as I see it, not more than three sub-committees can be appointed and the result will be that if you have members on the sub-committee of the sanatoria and the mental hospital, only one other sub-committee can be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite wrong. The Deputy is under a misapprehension. The committees to be set up under Section 10 are local area committees dealing with the areas&mdash;which we assume will deal with the areas&mdash; which are at present under the control of South Cork Board of Assistance, the North Cork Committee and the West Cork Committee.  The sub-committees which the authority can establish have no relation to areas but may be related to institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, we are setting out to unify the services and if we are unifying the services by just appointing the same number of committees and sub-committees, taking some of the functions from them and giving them to a local committee on which less than half the council are represented, then, to my mind, we are not setting about the thing in the right way, from my point of view, at any rate.  I think those three committees should continue in the various areas with their statutory rights and authority and responsibility to those whom they were elected to represent.</P>
      <P>The one great difficulty, of course, about having a separate area for the city and county arises from the number of institutions that take patients from both city and county.  In addition, there are the voluntary hospitals where, up to the present, the controlling authority, the county council, appoints the members.  Now it is proposed that the appointments will be made by the health authority, which does not consist of either all the members of the corporation or all the members of the county council.  There will be a kind of executive appointing the members of those voluntary hospitals instead of the public representatives having the right to make the appointments.</P>
      <P>With the present scheme of things, I do not see that for many years, until there are central offices, any success whatever can be achieved in our aim of having unified services.  The county manager's office is in the Courthouse; the county health offices are in the Grand Parade; the dispensary services are in George's Quay.  The offices are spread all over the place.  Until there is centralisation, I cannot visualise very much success in achieving the aims the Minister has in mind in promoting this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Bill in principle, <Col N="241" /> undoubtedly, but, owing to the circumstances in Cork, I doubt that we are going the right way about doing what we have in mind.  At times, one would think the county health authority would have responsibility for a service but is informed that the matter comes under the dispensary services and one has to go to George's Quay.  There are staffs in all these places.  Until there is a central office to unite the staffs and to allow them to function centrally, no great benefit will accrue to Cork city and county as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If this section is approved, in regard to Deputy MacCarthy's point about the establishment of sub-committees, would the Minister agree that the personnel of these committees would be selected by the parent bodies, say, the county council and the corporation?  I agree with Deputy MacCarthy that on the proposed unified health authority, there will be only a percentage of the elected representatives from the city and county.  On the parent body, there will be all the representatives.  They can agree as to the number of representatives each body will be entitled to have on the sub-committees.  I feel that they should be appointed by the parent body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a wrong impression about one committee, as I am pleased to learn from the Minister's statement.  I refer to the Mental Hospital Committee. The one useful purpose that a sub-committee of the mental hospital would serve is that it would give a sense of security to the people, as the present committee is giving, particularly to the relatives of patients.  When meetings are held periodically at the hospital and their local representatives are on the board, these people are satisfied that the hospital management is keenly looked after by their representatives. It would be a retrograde step to withdraw such a committee. In the Cork institutions, there are, unfortunately, 2,500 mental patients. There are monthly meetings of some 20 representatives from all over Cork city and county at the hospital to ensure that the patients receive satisfactory treatment.  They do other useful <Col N="242" /> work such as inquiring, at the request of relatives, about various patients.  That is a feature of public representation in Cork in regard to mental illness and I am particularly glad that permission will be given under this Bill to have a mental hospital sub-committee, even though such committee may be much smaller than, say, the existing body.</P>
    <P>The main point I wish to make is that which I made on rising, that is, to ask the Minister, in the event of the section being approved, will he agree with Deputy MacCarthy's suggestion that the appointment of the personnel of the sub-committees would not rest with the unified health authority but with the parent bodies, Cork County Council and Cork Corporation, in proportion to the numbers determined by them.  Would the Minister be able to throw any light on that matter now, if the change is possible or feasible, or would he consider it for the next stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I intervene at this stage is not a desire to interfere with the local affairs of Cork but to recall Deputies' attention to the perspective of the Bill as a whole.  The discussion has tended to become one of local mechanics in Cork and it seems that opposition to the section in the Bill will be based on that aspect.  That would be a mistaken approach if that approach were to be adopted, for these reasons: We have to ask ourselves what is the Minister trying to do in this Bill and should what he is trying to do be done.  What he is trying to do, incidentally, is something which affects Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  What is he trying to do? He is trying, in short, to bring a certain amount of order into the health services where there is manifestly disorder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any Deputy from any one of these municipal areas, whether it is Dublin, Cork, Waterford or Limerick, will deny that there are serious administrative problems in regard to health services in those areas and there are many problems which we Deputies are meeting.  Speaking for Dublin, I know that one of the acute public matters at the moment <Col N="243" /> is just this question of the health services in some aspect or another. I need not go into it.  There is the question of charges.  The Minister has had it at Question time.  There are a large number of questions relating to the health services which are causing concern to a number of people and which are causing a great deal of inconvenience and dissatisfaction amongst the members of the public who are affected at the present moment.  That is an undeniable fact and the Minister is taking cognisance of that fact.  I take it that we want to remedy that position.  If anyone wants me to go into detail, I can give some details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>About the position in Dublin and I shall leave Waterford, Limerick and Cork for other people to give details in regard to them.  That is not what is at issue. What is at issue is the unsatisfactory situation at the moment.  What are we going to do, what is there to be done, to remedy that situation?</P>
      <P>Clearly, the overall question of health services and the provision of public health services generally is one now that has taken on a national character.  It has gone beyond the stage of being a local concern and whatever ideas there may have been that health is a purely local authority function have gone and everybody accepts that they have gone.  Some people will complain that the load is too much to shift from the ratepayer to the general taxpayer, while other people take the point of view that people are entitled to these services and that the community should finance them.  It has now become a national matter and not a local government matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is a national matter, there must be an element of co-ordination.  There must be some overall rational co-ordination and that we have not got at present.  If one reads the explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill, one finds that the objects of the Bill are clearly set out and in the second paragraph, there is a significant phrase <Col N="244" /> that the Bill applies to every county except those mentioned.  So far as I understand the position, there have been fewer complaints about confusion and injustice&mdash;I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; as it will appear in cold print; I might say the voluntary injustice that is to be found in particular areas&mdash;from the rural areas.  Those who have examined the situation take the attitude that in the rural areas there is a relatively satisfactory mechanism. And then there is the question of how to bring the situation in the different municipal areas into line with that in the country and with the general national approach, the Minister's approach, and whatever Minister is in office, there must be a unified approach.</P>
    <P>What I am arguing is that what may be said in regard to Section 3 may, in general terms, be also applied to Sections 2, 4 and 5.  If we look at Section 7...</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, are we discussing Section 3 or are we to include other sections?  Deputy Corry was ruled out of order for introducing other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with Section 3 but I do not think I am out of order in saying that the same remarks could be made in regard to other sections.  The problems that are high lighted and the questions that are brought to mind by a reading of Section 7 apply in their entirety to those in Section 3.  Dealing specifically with Cork I am not out of order if I say that the same remarks apply to Dublin, Limerick and Waterford and the first act to bring the situation under control must be the setting-up of some rational mechanism that will operate a national scheme and a first essential of that is unity.  Any scheme set up must be in accordance with the overall scheme for health services on a national basis and it must have an essential unity which does not exist in the areas mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is so, what possible objection can there be to the Minister's approach in this legislation and, in particular, to Section 3?  What rational objection in principle can be argued against the <Col N="245" /> setting up of the unification which that section envisages?  One Deputy on the far side&mdash;I think it was Deputy Manley&mdash;argued not so much for its rejection as for its postponement indefinitely.  I can understand the argument that there may be mechanical matters to be set right.  That is a matter for the Cork Deputies themselves and I shall not interfere in it. Where there are such matters, let them be attended to.  We all assume that when a general purpose section like this is passed, practical steps will be taken to make it effective.</P>
    <P>Do not let the detailed mechanical problems of that kind confuse us to the extent of saying that we should throw the whole thing out.  As Deputy Corry has said, the Bill is not perfect. There are flaws.  Are we to destroy the general principle as a whole because of that?  Though we admit there are flaws in the Bill, let us not be so blinded by these flaws as to seek to destroy the whole measure.</P>
    <P>I have thought it well to intervene to stress the need for an overall plan and to ask the question: &ldquo;What is the alternative?&rdquo;  Are we to take any one of these areas out?  Do we want separate detailed legislation for each of these areas?  You could say that you want a separate code for Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Waterford, but if you say you want a separate code for Cork, you should be logical and say that you want a local government approach to it.  You have to take it completely out of the national scheme, if you take that line.  I can understand Cork Deputies saying: &ldquo;Let us have Cork to ourselves and we shall finance it&rdquo; but I do not think any Cork Deputy will take that approach at present because it is a national problem which demands a national solution.</P>
    <P>There has to be a contribution from the whole community and direction by the body that represents the whole community, namely, the Government and the Minister for Health.  Section 3 does no more than legislate for an organised way of dealing with the problem.  It does not merge Cork completely with Dublin or anywhere <Col N="246" /> else.  One of the things I like about this Bill is that there is in it a real attempt at organisation, an attempt properly to organise the administration of the health services in the local areas.  When that is being done, it is rather a pity that the difficulties and mechanics should be used in a situation where the very fact that the Minister is trying to cater for decentralisation should lead us to help him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for the prolonged debate on this section.  I am anxious to finish it as there is so much in the Bill dealing with other areas.  Deputy Briscoe, speaking very briefly, came to the point.  He did not refer to the Bill as a whole.  Deputy de Valera wandered away from the point, holding us up completely laying down laws for us.  If he had been here last night and earlier this morning he might realise how far removed he was from the difficulties we are trying to straighten out and he might understand how unfair he was to the Minister in holding up the Bill in elaborating as he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke only once.  How many times has the Deputy spoken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera lays down the law in stating we want local government law.  Does he not realise that the system in operation in Cork is one that was put into operation by the laws passed by this House and all we were asking is that we be allowed to operate that system given to Cork under those laws?  It is a complete waste of time for Deputy de Valera to speak as if we were looking for something completely contrary to the Health Act and completely contrary to democratic rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point on which I must continue to disagree with the Minister. He has spoken about what he calls unification of the sanatoria services and unification of the mental illness services.  He poses the question: if it is good in regard to the Sanatoria Board and the Mental Hospital Board, why should it not be applied to general health services.  We say &ldquo;no&rdquo; in <Col N="247" /> regard to Cork.  There must be, of necessity, a scrutinising of the position in relation to the services given and the type of patient treated either in the mental hospital or in the sanatoria as against the problem of patients coming under the health services, whether it be the local dispensary services or of the hospitalisation kind. We know the system is being successfully operated for mental hospital services and the sanatoria services because the type of patients are so different; unfortunately the time patients spend in these hospitals very often means years; it is completely different for the person in the general hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon when speaking, a while ago, concentrated on choice of hospital.  The choice of hospital in Cork does not come into it at all.  The problem in Cork is to get more hospital beds for the people.  I have yet to come across a case in south Cork where the relatives of a sick person insisted they must get a bed in a certain hospital; all they ask for is to get a bed in any hospital.  Is the Minister suggesting to us that Section 3 will give us what we want in Cork? We say it will not.</P>
    <P>Take the case of people in the Bandon area, Macroom area, the areas of west and north Cork.  We consider the unification of services for the whole of County Cork and of Cork City will nullify any advantages to be gained from the services.  Our opposition to this section is based on the present position of the dispensary services and our understanding of the conditions that exist.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister alone because the Minister before him turned down our application to get county homes in various parts of Cork to implement our hospital plan.  Does the Minister suggest that the unification of health services in Cork will give us what has been refused to us, an increase in the number of hospital beds, and the various dispensary buildings we want?  Matters of that kind must decide the issue to a great extent.  I <Col N="248" /> am not interested to the same degree as others may be in the numbers in the various committees.  I do agree that every member elected should have a say, but that must be of only secondary importance.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when he takes a different line from that of Deputy Corry on the financial issue. I am naturally as anxious as the Minister to improve health services and if there are unfortunate people who must depend on home assistance, free boots, and so on, it is the Christian duty of those who can afford to pay to do so. When this issue comes up in regard to Cork there are many on one side and few on the other.</P>
    <P>There is provision for one medical officer for the city and county.  No names are mentioned but I should like to know what he will do.  What can he do except supervise the work of the officials?  Who will suggest that one medical man could really act in an efficient manner as county medical officer and city medical officer combined? We shall still have our county medical officer under a different name; we shall still have all the officials concerned there.  We are going to relieve a county manager or an assistant county manager of his present functions to deal with the health authority but it is obvious to every one of us that from the administrative side there will not be the improvements the Minister expects and there will not be any greater financial benefits than have already been given under the Health Act to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>There is much we favour in the Bill.  We said here last night we were in favour of the principles of the Bill and that the suggested improvements for Dublin and Waterford were not alone worth considering but worth supporting. We have given that support but, as regards Cork city and county, because we know from experience that the provisions of this section will not give us the benefits it is suggested will accrue and because there are so many disadvantages, we cannot support the section.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is really to meet the position of the Cork Corporation.  As the Bill is originally drafted, the person making a determination of the expenses could not have regard to expenses other than services under the Public Assistance Act, 1939.  With the section, as amended, he may have regard to that.  When he is making his determination, he does not apportion the expenses under the Public Assistance Act but in trying to arrive at a fair allocation of the general expenses of <Col N="252" /> the board as a whole, he may have regard to the manner in which the public assistance expenses would be borne by each.</P>

      <P>To add to the section the following subsections:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10)  Nothing in this section shall be taken as preventing a demand by the council of the county of Dublin being made on, and being met by, the Dún Laoghaire Corporation, at any time after the local financial year in which the Dublin Health Authority are established, to provide for adjustments in respect of expenditure, for that year or any earlier financial year, on the services which are transferred to that authority.</P>
      <P>(11)  Without prejudice to, and subject to any adjustments arising from, the provisions of this Act in relation to the proportions in which the expenditure of health authorities established by this Act are to be met&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  a local authority who appoint members of a health authority established by this Act shall pay to that authority in the local financial year in which that authority are established&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  any moneys included in their estimates of expenses for services administered by them which are transferred to the health authority which, at the date of the establishment of that authority, have not been expended, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> (ii)  any moneys demanded from them by a body dissolved by <i>section 15</i> of this Act which, at the date of such establishment, have not been paid to that body, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the council of the county of Wicklow shall pay to the Dublin Health Authority, in the local financial year in which that authority are established, any moneys demanded from that council by the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Board which, at the date of such establishment, have not been paid to the board.</P>
    <P>(12)  An agreement under this section between two or more local authorities shall be made by resolutions of those authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to add three subsections to Section 11.  In the Dublin areas at present, and until the end of the financial year in which the Dublin health authority will be set up, the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council meet all the health expenditure.  The Dublin County Council levies its share on the whole administrative county, raising the county health districts' share by their own rates and demanding the Dún Laoghaire borough's share from the corporation there, who raise it by means of the municipal rates.  After the end of the local financial year in which the Dublin health authority is set up the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation will contribute direct to that authority their share of its expenses and the county council's share will then be levied only on the county health district.  The purpose of the new subsection 10 is to make it clear that any adjustments needed then in relation to earlier periods when the county council was entitled to demand a share of their health expenditure from the Dún Laoghaire Corporation can be made by way of supplementary demands on that body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now <Col N="254" /> read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to implement the Financial Resolution agreed to by the Dáil on 9th December. As Deputies will recall, the Financial Resolution introduced a fresh definition of unladen weight for motor tax purposes.  I do not not propose to go into detail again on the reasons for bringing in the Financial Resolution.  To avoid any misconception, however, I should like to recall two points.  First, it was designed to give effect to what had been the generally accepted interpretation of the previous definition up to recently. Secondly, it was necessary to deal with the matter as an urgent one to enable local authorities to deal with applications for licences for the present calendar year.</P>
      <P>The definition of unladen weight, exactly as set out in the Financial Resolution, is contained in Sections 1 and 2 of the Bill.  Various suggestions had been made for the modification of the definition, and these were all fully and carefully considered.  It had been suggested during the discussions in the Dáil in December that the definition needed tightening to ensure that it would not catch such items as barrels of water.  I gave the Dáil then the reasons why it is considered that such amendment is not necessary and I am happy to tell them that no difficulties have arisen on this score in connection with the licensing of goods vehicles for 1960 on the basis of the new definition. Licensing authorities have interpreted the definition reasonably and I do not think that vehicle owners can complain on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations were also made that the definition should be modified so as to afford concessions to various classes of vehicle operator.  These again were fully and, I may say, sympathetically considered, but I regret that it is not possible to meet them. The principle followed in the 1952 Act was to cut out special concessions of this type and to base the tax rate on the class of vehicle.  This principle was followed to the extent that, by an extra-statutory arrangement, Stateowned vehicles were required to make a contribution to the Road Fund in <Col N="255" /> the same way as other vehicles.  Motor tax is a service charge, for the use of roads, and any concession given merely shifts the ultimate charge to other users.  Despite strong complaints made at the time of the 1952 Act, road users on the whole have come to accept it as operating equitably and fairly in the matter of revenue for road works.  The same principles have to be applied in this Bill.  If a concession were given to one group, another would seek it, and so on, until eventually the whole purpose of the Bill was lost.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 contain provisions relating to enforcement.  They will enable the Garda and the local authorities to deal with the case where a vehicle is taxed at a certain weight and later used at a higher weight.  The normal owner will see to it that the extra tax is paid before the higher weight is used.  There will always be the occasional case of the man who seeks to evade the law.  The present powers to deal with him are contained is the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  For reasons which I shall mention later, these powers are defective, so far as motor taxation is concerned.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (1) of Section 3, a member of the Garda Síochána will be empowered to require a person in charge of a vehicle which the Guard suspects to be infringing motor tax law, to bring the vehicle to an appointed weighbridge not more than five miles distant and there have its unladen weight checked Even if the vehicle is lightly laden, the Guard may make such a requirement.  This provision is necessary to meet a case where a driver could claim the vehicle was laden even if it contained a sack or two of goods that could easily be removed and later replaced on it; at present a vehicle must be completely unladen before it can be required to be weighed for motor tax purposes.</P>
    <P>Again, under existing law, a Guard can require a vehicle to be weighed for tax purposes only if it also infringes road traffic law on weights of vehicles. The weighbridge must be not more that two miles distant, and it must be a Road Traffic Act weighbridge, of which there are only about one per county.  Section 4 of the Bill enables <Col N="256" /> local authorities to &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; for motor tax purposes a number of weigh-bridges in or adjacent to their functional area, and this should get over the shortage of official Road Traffic Act weighbridges without putting local authorities to the expense of providing more.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of Section 3 of the Bill will enable a local authority to call in a vehicle for reweighing after it has been taxed.  A general power to do so is given in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a) of the subsection.  A local authority would use this power where they had reason to believe that a vehicle had been altered during the licensing period or where for some other good reason they felt the weight should be checked.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (ii) gives power to a local authority to call in a vehicle for weighing in the specific condition in which it was observed in use on a particular occasion.  This could be used where a Guard had seen a vehicle used with additions not included in the unladen weight for tax purposes, but could not have it reweighed at the time for any one of the number of reasons, for example, there was no appointed weighbridge near enough, the vehicle was laden, and so on.  I may state that local authorities had a certain power already in regulations made under the Roads Act, 1920, to call in a vehicle for reweighing.  In view of the necessary extension of this power, it is considered desirable to put the whole matter in the Bill rather than in regulations.</P>
    <P>Certain conditions are attached to the power to call in a vehicle for reweighing.  Under subsection (6) of Section 3, at least seven days' notice must be given to the registered owner of the vehicle.  Subsection (5) requires that where a reweighing is required of a vehicle in a specific condition observed in use, notice must be given either at the time it was observed or within 14 days.  This is to ensure that the vehicle owner will be warned near enough to the occasion his vehicle was observed to warrant his remembering what &ldquo;additions&rdquo; were used with it.</P>
    <P>Under Section 4, fees for the reweighing of vehicles will be met by the local authority, not by the vehicle <Col N="257" /> owner.  Local authorities' expenses will ultimately be met from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>The provisions regarding enforcement have been drafted to ensure that vehicle owners are given fair treatment. As a corollary, it is necessary to ensure that prosecutions are not made impossible through technical pleas, and certain provisions regarding onus of proof have been inserted.  Nobody likes these, but they are inevitable at times and there are plenty of precedents for them in cases like this, where the facts concerned would be within the knowledge of the vehicle owner, would be in his interest to prove, and would be practically impossible for the State to prove or else involve undue expense.  The provisions I mention are in subsection (5) of Section 2 and subsection (8) of Section 3.</P>
    <P>A maximum penalty of £50 is provided in subsection (7) of Section 3 for failure to bring in a vehicle for reweighing.  The existing penalty under the Road Traffic Act is £10, a figure which bears no relation to present day money values and rates of motor taxation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the definition of unladen weight operates as from 1st January, 1960, in accordance with the Financial Resolution.  The other provisions will come into force on the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister one question?  It may be somewhat extraneous to this Bill but my recollection of the previous legislation is that power was taken to increase the unladen weight to a maximum of 7 cwts. to overcome any question of apparent hardship.  Could the Minister say has that been availed of to any great extent and has it met the main burden of complaint?  If he could tell the House, it would be helpful in discussing this Bill and it also might lead to a shorter discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to that query, the provision regarding the 7 additional cwts. has been brought into being by the Minister for Transport and Power, that 7 cwts. to be added to the weights in regard to all licensed hauliers' plates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> Over and above that, of course, as was then stated, the hardship clause still remains which can be operated and if necessary will be operated by the Minister for Transport and Power in giving further weight additions, where hardship would have been proved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage, in the middle of February, these complaints ought to have arisen and been resolved or organised by now.  Has this additional power to increase the weights resulted in the deletion of the complaints or are there many still on hands and unresolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to correction, I think the figure of all queries raised, in relation to this matter, to date only slightly exceeds 70 out of all the hundreds of cases that could have arisen.  Whether or not they are all resolved as yet, I do not know.  The volume of queries raised is an indication that the 7 cwts. addition has, to a large degree, met the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And the hardship clause is still there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given reasons why this Bill is necessary. He tells us it is due to varied and varying decisions of district justices but that he has not had an opportunity of testing these decisions by way of a case taken to the High Court.  He also tells us that owing to a changing in the mode of transport on the roads this Bill is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did we ever ask ourselves why there has been a changing in the mode of transport?  Is it not because of the deliberate action of the present Government in closing down the railways? The railways have been closed down and we must find an alternate transport. The alternate transport is the heavy lorries which the Minister wishes to tax to the extent of £100,000.  That <Col N="259" /> is the sole reason for the introduction of this Bill and it is one of the natural consequences of the closing of our railways, particularly our branch railways.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why a decision of the High Court was never sought to confirm the decision of one or other of the district justices.  From the moment one requests a district justice to state a case until the case is actually heard, it generally takes two to three months at the very outside.  I cannot understand why we did not ask the High Court or the Supreme Court to give an interpretation of the law as it stood without legislation.  Is it not evident that the Minister and the Government are anxious to collect £100,000 more and that is the only reason why this Bill is being introduced?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, this Bill is being introduced for the purpose of putting the small haulier and private lorry-owners off the road by increasing taxation. Take, for instance, a lorry-owner who has a lorry for his own use for farm produce or for bringing home his turf and who must pay an excess £8 per annum tax on the lorry.  That will drive him off the road.</P>
    <P>There are a few vehicles which are being used which are worrying me very much.  The first is the ambulance or break-down van used by garage proprietors. It is a vehicle which is stripped down and has generally a crane attached to it for towing purposes or for lifting portion of the vehicle on to the chassis of the body of the ambulance.</P>
    <P>Supposing a very heavy lorry is involved in a crash and an ambulance has to take it to a garage.  It has to tow it or partially place it on it.  How are we to determine the unladen weight of the ambulance?  Perhaps the Minister might look into it between now and the Committee Stage.  I cannot understand how they will determine the unladen weight of that vehicle.</P>
    <P>Take the common steam-roller which we are all accustomed to see on our roads.  Tax is payable by the local authority into the road fund on it. When a steam-roller moves from one locality to another it has attached thereto the living accomodation of the driver and the flagman.  It has also <Col N="260" /> attached thereto generally the crusher and the tar boilers.  Are we to find the unladen weight of all these vehicles in order to assess the tax payable on the roller?  If we are not, why are steamrollers put in a different classification to that of vehicles used by others?</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the circus proprietor. When he moves from one site to another he links up all his vehicles, sometimes four or five.  We are all accustomed to see them going along the roadway.  To determine the tax and unladen weight of the towing vehicle, have we to do it in the case of all the others?  If it has not to be done in the case of the county council, why must it be done in the case of the circus proprietor?</P>
    <P>Take a building contractor.  He has a number of mobile machines in operation in the building business.  If he is moving them from one site to another, he takes them in tow.  Have we to find the unladen weight of all these vehicles in order to assess the tax on the towing vehicle?  The Minister should look into it.  It will be very serious now.</P>
    <P>I am speaking from a purely local point of view.  This Bill will hit very many lorry-owners on the Western seaboard where turf is produced.  As we all know, road merchandise licencers are not necessary for the haulage of turf.  Purveyors of turf save the turf and then hawk it around the country for sale.  If they pay an additional £8 for the creels which they will attach to their lorries they will pass that on to the consumer by increasing the price to the poor man who has to depend on turf as his main source of fuel.</P>
    <P>There has grown up on the Western seaboard a new industry, the fishmeat industry.  For the haulage of the raw material for fish meal, the fish offal, it is necessary now to get a metal container or a metal body on the vehicle. These metal bodies are very expensive. They are very heavy.  They will add to the unladen weight of the vehicle. Most of the people who use these lorries have to attach turf creels to them later on when transporting turf. That will put up the tax on such vehicles from £10 to £16 per vehicle per year, which is a considerable amount.  Take the case of a farmer <Col N="261" /> who has a truck for ordinary farm work, which be may use once a month to bring his cattle to the market, to the mart or to the fair.  If he attaches a creel to it for that purpose, even if he has to use it only once a year, he has to pay the additional tax, which is a minimum of £8 per year.  That is not fair.</P>
    <P>I can understand it in the case of big concerns such as C.I.E. but one should think of the small truck owner. Owners of trucks who work for local authorities throughout the country have had to attach self-tipping machinery to their vehicles.  That machinery is labour-saving, but unfortunately it is also very heavy.  Now it will be taken into account in assessing the unladen weight of the vehicle. Grants are being given at present to local authorities from State funds for the repair of roads.  A considerable part of these grants is going in the transport of materials.  In Deputy McQuillan's county, they have protested strongly against the transport of road materials over long distances.  If we add to the tax on the vehicle, naturally we increase the cost of transport. More of the money from the Road Fund will be switched to transport costs and taken out of the pocket of the ordinary labourer on the roads.</P>
    <P>This Bill will put off the roads many more private lorries and will drive people to employ C.I.E. vehicles.  At the moment C.I.E. have a monopoly of transport on our roads&mdash;a monopoly which is very costly for the users of these vehicles.  There is no doubt whatever that if one were to seek an estimate from C.I.E. and all estimate from a private haulier, there would be a difference of anything between 12 per cent. and 25 per cent.  If we put these small lorries off the road by increased taxation, we shall increase the C.I.E. monopoly and thereby do considerable damage to the economy of the State as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Section 3, under which a member of the Garda Síochána may, withing certain limits, demand the weighing of a vehicle.  In my own constituency, we have but three public weigh-bridges.  We certainly have not one within a radius <Col N="262" /> of five miles of any point of West Donegal.  Will a trap be set for these lorry owners by waiting until they are found within a radius of five miles of some weigh-bridge and then compelling them to weigh these vehicles? One can imagine what would happen on such occasions.  I think if a vehicle is weighed at the beginning of the year, when it is being taxed, that it should suffice and that there should be an onus cast on the owner of the vehicle at that time to sign a declaration that he will use no heavier container or trailer than is attached to it at the time of weighing.  If he contravenes that later, he may be prosecuted.  But it is very unfair that a member of the Garda Síochána should have the right, merely on demand or on giving of notice, to request the owner of a vehicle to come in and have it weighed.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Road Fund, this may be desirable; but are we in a position at the moment to stand extra taxation of £100,000?  I think it was the former Taoiseach who stated here quite recently that we have reached the limit of taxation.  In my opinion, we have reached the limit of taxation.  Down the country at present the greatest amount of transport on roads is transport used by local authorities.  If we increase the tax or duty payable on these vehicles, that will be passed on by way of additional taxation to the ratepayer.  I do not think there will be any benefit to the country other than increased taxation, and for that reason I certainly oppose this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a corollary of the Financial Resolution which we passed before the Dáil adjourned in December last.  We supported the Financial Resolution then, and, as this Bill merely implements the purpose of that Resolution, we support this Bill too.  If there is one thing clear in this whole discussion, it is that the law must be made clear beyond any doubt whatever.  Various decisions have been given as to what constitutes the unladen weight of a lorry.  It is because of that indecision that, so far as the law is concerned, it has been necessary to clarify the position. Deputy O'Donnell suggested there <Col N="263" /> should be a case stated from the district court to some higher court and that the law should be unravelled at that level, although he stated it might be necessary to take it even still higher to ascertain what the supreme interpretation of the law was.</P>
      <P>To a large extent, that is really a misuse of the courts.  It is not the business of the courts to make the law. This Parliament was elected to make laws for the government of the people. The courts were never elected to look after the laws of the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple function of the courts is to interpret the laws we make.  If there is any doubt, we should remake the law and make it perfectly clear so that everybody will understand it.  If there are people anxious to get a more favourable interpretation of the law than is administratively possible, they may go to the courts and seek that interpretation. It is the function of Parliament all the time to state what the law is, to make the law and to amend it to bring about any necessary clarification. Parliament ought not to part with that function and permit the courts to exercise anything else but an interpretation of the law.</P>
      <P>If there is confusion, indecision or doubt as to what the law is, quite frankly, I think it would be as good&mdash; it certainly would be a more democratic process&mdash;to go back to the people's Parliament and say: &ldquo;There is some doubt about this law.  It is a man-made law and anything done by human hands or minds is liable to all the frailties of human hand and mind, but we shall remake it as perfectly as we can.&rdquo;  That is what I understand this Parliament is doing at this moment.  It is because I support the right of Parliament to make laws, remake laws or alter laws that I am supporting this Bill&mdash;in order that the people themselves, acting through Parliament, will interpret the law for their own benefit and guidance. I believe that in the long run that is the more democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the reason for the <Col N="264" /> Financial Resolution was not to impose additional taxation on people but to get people to pay the legitimate taxes which would have been imposed on the owners of vehicles if the law, as the State understood it, had been administered.  It is because the law was being implemented in a way other than the way the Legislature intended that there was a danger of losing a very substantial sum of money.  The Financial Resolution, plus this Bill, is intended to stop that haemorrhage. Bear in mind that the money so collected in future with the clarification of the law will go into the Road Fund and will be used for the purpose of making roads and making these roads better for the people who will use them for their lorries in future.</P>
    <P>I have got one complaint in this whole matter and I think it is a legitimate complaint based on sound economics.  It is that we have a very large road mileage to be looked after, with a very sparse population and the job of maintaing the roads is imposing a very heavy burden on all our people.  The fact of the matter is that we have too many miles of road for the number of people living in the country.  You can pass by roads in the country every day of the week and you would not see a car.  If you happened to get a puncture, you might wait for an hour and not see a person passing.  Our roads are not sufficiently used for the simple reason that there is not enough traffic in the country to use them, because there are not enough people in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are too many roads; they are too long and too expensive; and they all have to be maintained and it is their maintenance that is costing everybody a very substaintial sum of money.  The greatest damage to the roads is done by the big heavy lorries, the six and eight wheelers of ten, 12 and 16 tons.  One has only to travel the roads being used by these lorries to see the extent of the damage they do.  If they get off a main road at all, the evidence that they have been on secondary roads can be seen, once they use those secondary roads a couple of times.  It is legitimate that <Col N="265" /> those who use big lorries&mdash;all imported&mdash;should be made pay a fair share of the road taxation.  There is no answer to that.  Certainly the unfortunate who has only a bicycle to depend on should not be compelled under an over-all system of taxation to pay for the heavy cost involved in the maintenance of roads and he does pay it in one form or another.  A fellow living in a labourer's cottage pays his rates on that cottage.  A substaintial portion of his rates goes for the upkeep of roads.</P>
      <P>In my view, the very heavy lorry is doing enormous damage to the roads. it is taking traffic away from C.I.E. and it is making us spend money on the maintenance of roads which are damaged excessively, in my view, by the use of these very heavy vehicles.  I do not think, therefore, having regard to what we spend on roads and the damage which the heavy lorries do on the roads, that there are any grounds for complaint by, and not much justification for sympathy with, the owner of the very large vehicle, an imported commodity, which does so much damage to the roads and so much consequent damage to a national undertaking like our publicly owned railway system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell made the point that the increase in the unladen weight will cause hardship to these people. Quite frankly, I do not accept that. There have been two previous increases in the unladen weight of road vehicles &mdash;that is my recollection&mdash;which everybody got.  That was done to satisfy a demand that the unladen weight should be increased and these people asked for the unalden weight to be increased in the full knowledge that once it was increased, they would have to pay a higher rate of taxation.  I make this offer to anybody: if you announce to-morrow that you will increase the unladen weight of every vehicle by another 20 cwt. you will not find a single person in his sane senses who will not gladly avail of the extra 20 cwt. on his unladen weight, even though he will have to pay an extra rate in respect of the taxation of his lorry.  Lorry owners have accepted the view that once you concede a <Col N="266" /> demand for an addition to the unladen weight, you have to pay the extra rate of taxation associated with the increase in unladen weight.  As I said, the best evidence of their interest and their keenness is to announce to-morrow that you are willing to increase the unladen weight by another one ton.</P>

There is nothing more you could do to gladden the hearts of the lorry owners to-morrow than to say you will increase their unladen weight by another ton and they would cheerfully pay the extra taxation.  If they are to get their unladen weight increased by 7 cwts. they would hope to pay because 7 cwts. represent an improvement in their carrying capacity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody will get it. If, however, he puts it on, he will be valued in future for extra weight. Not only does everybody get it but the hardship clause in the 1944 Road Transport Act will be used to give him an addition of the 7 cwts. so as to iron out that inequality.  So far as the ordinary merchandise lorry, the man who has a plate, is concerned, there are about 1,000 of those in the whole country.  Most of them are relatively small vehicles and they are not a problem with C.I.E.  C.I.E. have never been worried about what one might call the plated transport haulier. He does not make any serious in-roads on C.I.E.  C.I.E. will tell you <Col N="267" /> that the licensed haulier is not a problem nor a menace.  What C.I.E. is concerned about is the large private firm which has its lorries constantly on the road carrying a whole lot of merchandise of a substantial character in value and volume which they think could be handled by the railways.</P>
      <P>So far as the licensed haulier is concerned, I should like to see him treated sympathetically and even generously so far as this additional 7 cwt., plus whatever weight may be added to deal with cases of special hardship, is concerned. There are only 1,000 of them in the country and it would be an easy matter to deal with them.  They are no menace to C.I.E. and in the main, they do not do much damage to the roads because they are all in the small lorry category.</P>
      <P>Whatever way this Bill operates in its interpretation, we should at all events make sure that we shall recognise the merits and special circumstances of anybody who might appear to be unfairly or unreasonably dealt with.  Taking power to increase the unladen weight, as was done in the Financial Resolution and which is being implemented here, plus the assurance that the hardship clause in the existing Transport Act will be used to meet cases of hardship, should meet the case.  I do not think it will really make any impact on the Road Fund and I do not think we shall make any impact on the economics of C.I.E. By treating licensed hauliers fairly, we can make sure the law is observed and observed without imposing hardship on that section of the community which I think is the one which has been reasonably safeguarded in the changes we are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Most members of the House, I think, accept that this measure is somewhat necessary.  We had a great deal of discussion when the Financial Resolution was introduced and that discussion covered largely the ground that should be gone over now. Many points of view have been put forward in regard to this matter and the time that has elapsed since the Financial Resolution was introduced <Col N="268" /> has helped to some extent to allay certain fears expressed then.  We were all quite clear then about the purpose of the Financial Resolution.  I agree with the previous speaker that when there is any doubt about the law it should, as far as possible, come back to this House to be discussed and if necessary to be clarified.  The suggestion about having cases stated to the High Court where it is a question of interpretation might be desirable but the more effective way, and certainly the way that appeals most to the plain people, is to have this House amend the law. When we have done what is possible to produce good legislation and when experience shows afterwards that it does not give the results expected I think the people would expect the House to go back and rectify any faults for which it was responsible.</P>
      <P>At the outset it would help, to some extent, if we were prepared to admit that for a number of years the methods of weighing commercial vehicles came on the road and we uniform.  Local licensing authorities, by and large, had not the same arrangements for assessing the actual weights nor for interpreting certain doubts that might arise.  That had been the situation almost since commercial vehicles name on the road and we should be careful when we are trying to correct long standing practice to try to do so without creating too many drastic changes.</P>
      <P>It might be asked: how can there be ill-effects when the former practice is not correct?  According to an old saying if people get a bad habit of doing something for a long time, and if you sent out to correct it overnight by introducting a rather stringent set of rules, there may be difficulty. People operating trucks have adapted themselves to the type of truck most suitable for their purposes, from capacity and taxation points of view, and you interfere now very drastically with the economy of truck owners who will be affected by this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill, it is said, is to more or less penalise a number of small truck-owners, get them off the road and give the traffic to C.I.E.  The previous speaker dealt very ably with that and I do not think <Col N="269" /> people will accept Deputy O'Donnell's point of view.  We know C.I.E. are not worried about competition from small truck-operators.  Experience has shown, in fact, in recent years that when licensed hauliers offered to sell their plates to C.I.E., C.I.E. were not interested.  C.I.E. does not consider that licensed hauliers' operations, in the main, affect C.I.E. operations and they are quite content to allow these hauliers to carry on as they have been doing.</P>
    <P>Such hauliers will be affected by this Bill in so far as certain receptacles or attachments to their trucks will now come under notice and will result in having the taxation rates increased and the unladen weight of the particular vehicle must be increased accordingly.  This constitutes a separate problem for the hauliers who must have their plates adjusted for the increased weights.  The Minister has explained that provision has been made by another Minister in that connection and that the increase of 7 cwt. has been offered and that it seems to meet the situation in the case of the majority of licensed hauliers.</P>
    <P>We should not confuse the position regarding licensed hauliers so far as increased weight is concerned with what is really specified in this Bill. Another speaker said that the smaller type of vehicles were most likely to be affected by the provisions of the Bill.  I do not agree with that, except to a small extent.  I think the vehicles mostly affected are those of larger carrying capacity such as are used by merchant firms and industrial concerns carrying large loads over long distances.</P>
    <P>One particular case comes to mind which I would like to refer to the Minister because the Bill will create hardship there which, in my opinion, will have far-reaching effects.  It is the case of creameries, co-operative and dairy disposal creameries.  They haul large quantities of milk from central points to chocolate crumb or cheese factories in the south of Ireland, using their own trucks which are of a heavy type and fitted with large tanks. This Bill is of vital importance to these creameries because the price <Col N="270" /> paid by the purchasers, whether chocolate crumb or cheese manufacturers, is cut very fine.  In order to compete in that business the creameries some years ago had to fit a larger type of tanks on their trucks in order to keep down costs by increasing the total quantity of milk carried. Those tanks in the past were not weighed in as part of the unladen weight.  There was ambiguity about the matter and it was accepted that the receptacles need not be included. The owners did not weigh in those receptacles and I think it could be said that they acted in perfectly good faith.  There is no doubt about their position under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Under the Financial Resolution which has already taken effect and particularly under the Bill they will be obliged to weigh these containers or receptacles because they are on the truck all the time.  They cannot be lifted off and left at their destination until the following day, week or month.  They have to be emptied, in some cases pumped out, and returned on the truck the same day so that they will be available to bring another load on the following day.</P>
    <P>One creamery company which has this type of receptacle fitted on the truck has told me that the additional taxation per truck would be from £60 to £80 per annum.  That is a very large sum of money when spread over the quantity of milk carried.  Now these creameries do not operate the trucks fitted with the receptacles the whole year round.  They are fitted on the trucks during the period of milk production, for about half the year. Then the receptacle is removed and the truck is used, possibly, for the transport of butter, cheese or other solid products manufactured during the peak season and, in winter, for the delivery of fertilisers to the creamery suppliers.  It can be said, therefore, that the receptacle is used for approximately half the year.  Yet it appears to me that under the Bill the truck owner will be obliged to pay taxation on the gross weight including the receptacle for the whole year.  I want the Minister to look into that point.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of Section 3 deals <Col N="271" /> with the power of a member of the Garda Síochána to require a vehicle to be weighed.  I submit that great care should be exercised in giving that power to any officer of the State. It is a power which could be used without due care and to irritate and annoy people who have to operate trucks.  Admittedly, the section contains some protection in so far as the weighing of a partly-laden or lightlyladen truck is concerned.  Nevertheless, the power provided in this section is a little too wide.  Take it that a Garda does not like the operator of a truck or has a bee in his bonnet.  He can order the owner of the truck, particularly an unladen truck, to go to the nearest appointed weighbridge for the purpose of having it weighed or, alternatively, if the truck is laden, to go there within a certain number of days.</P>
    <P>People who operate trucks will tell you that the weight of a truck may vary from month to month, according to climatic conditions.  Truck assemblers manage to bring the unladen weight close to a particular unladen weight.  It is a matter that they are at their wits' end to regulate because of the different standards of unladen weight laid down.  It may be only a matter of pounds.  When the truck is new it is quite possible to bring it within the permitted weight but the truck may get heavy in use, some of the material used in the truck may hold water.  Experience has shown that when the truck is reweighed within 12 months, in nine cases out of ten it goes over the permitted weight and comes into the next category, which involves higher taxation.</P>
    <P>It would be a very bad thing if the taxation officers or the Garda Síochána were to irritate people in that connection by being over-suspicious.  The Minister should try to correct the rather awkward position in which we find ourselves on this point, as quietly as possible and with the least irritation to truck owners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a suggestion <Col N="272" /> here about the acquisition of weigh-bridges. I am rather glad that that matter is being dealt with at last.  The weighing facilities that existed heretofore were not very satisfactory.  In order to have a truck weighed within the requirements of the local taxation office it was necessary that an officer from the office or a member of the Garda Síochána should witness the weighing.  The truck owner had to make special arrangements to have one of these people present.  I suppose it is a matter that can be dealt with by regulation but I suggest that the Minister might bring in an amendment on the next Stage of the Bill fixing certain hours, a period of, say, four or five hours of the day, for the purposes of weighing operations so that the truck owner would not have to search for a taxation officer or a member of the Garda.  There should be some liaison between the taxation officer and the truck owner, so that arrangements could be made that these people would be available when required, or that a certificate from a public weigh-bridge, which is certified, would be acceptable in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The question of C.I.E. was raised and it was stated that this Bill would favour C.I.E.  I assume that C.I.E., being a semi-State body&mdash;one could almost say a State body&mdash;have conformed to the general principles of the law in a more rigid manner than private operators have done in the past.  If that is so, this Bill will have very little effect on C.I.E. because C.I.E. are already paying their due share of taxation for trucks.  If that is not so, and if they have been in the same boat as the private commercial operators, they are equally affected. Does not this legislation then impose on C.I.E. the same burden as it imposes on the private operators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One feature that I am sure will be regarded by all sides of the House as satisfactory is that any money collected&mdash;a sum of £50,000 to £100,000 has been mentioned&mdash;will go into the Road Fund and has to come back by way of grants to the local authorities for the purpose of maintaining the roads.  If it transpires that the very heavy operators of trucks are the worst offenders in connection with the situation <Col N="273" /> the Minister is attempting to correct, they will make the greater contribution to the total additional taxation that is collected.  That would go to show that the liability is placed correctly by this legislation.  There is no doubt that the heavy trucks that are being operated are doing very great damage to the roads.  One has only to travel close behind those heavy trucks, when fully laden, to appreciate the damage they do to the very foundations of the road.  I do not know whether it would be appropriate or not on this legislation but, if it were, I would go so far as to suggest to the Minister that the time has long since arrived when a maximum load should be specified.</P>
    <P>Not alone should the unladen weight and carrying capacity be defined but the maximum load should, as far as possible, be controlled.  Any attempts to keep our roads in a proper state of repair will be futile if eventually we did not do that.  The additional taxation which is being visualised in this measure will, when it goes into the Road Fund, eventually come back, as it has come back, and so we can have no complaint.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would suggest to the Minister that he might look into the point I made at the beginning with regard to trucks which are casually employed in a particular operation which would necessitate the carrying of a tank or container and the owner of which would be adversely affected. There might be some way of easing that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand what the last speaker was trying to. get at.  He first praised the Bill and then criticised it.  I put it to the Minister that this measure is aimed at the private haulier, especially in the West. We have seen the private haulier being squeezed out in the beet campaign in Galway.  It is like the eradication of T.B.  They are trying to eradicate the Private haulier.  It is a measure to push him off the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise one particular point &mdash;the question of unladen weight.  The unladen weight, whether it be of container, <Col N="274" /> creel or box, varies from month to month.  At one period, particularly in the turf season, creels are used. Then the lorry may be used to draw gravel for the County Council and the box is used and the creel may be used again for the drawing of kelp or seaweed. I think the Minister should try to strike a happy medium between the weight of the heaviest addition, which may be the creel, and the box.  I am not in favour of this measure because I believe it is another step in the process of pushing the private haulier off the roads and the Minister should not add further to the numbers leaving our shores every week, particularly from western areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill appears to me to have a threefold purpose.  One is to counteract a decision given by the courts.  Legislation is being introduced to annul that decision.  The second is the primary object, that of raising a sum approximating to £100,000 which is another imposition of taxation.  The third reason would appear to be the giving of a further monopoly to the Semi-State body&mdash;Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is going to raise £100,000 it is our view that that money should go to the Road Fund to be used for the purpose of improving the roads and that it should be added to the road grant and so on.  In the first instance, that £100,000 should be applied to every county in Ireland. This Bill is bound to pass, as any measure introduced by the present Government with its large majority, is bound to pass and I should like to hear from the Minister, if there is an increase of £100,000 in the Road Fund, whether that sum is to be equitably distributed over all the counties in Ireland.  There are certain grants out of the Road Fund that are transferable to different counties at the pleasure of the Minister.  I should like him to tell the House that this additional money will be equitably distributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Court decision, it seems to me that a better way to approach the situation, if the Minister was dissatisfied with the Court decision, <Col N="275" /> was to appeal against that decision.  It would have been the best way to test the decision.  If the decision were reversed it would not have been necessary to introduce the Financial Resolution or this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know that he is imposing a hardship and that there are many private hauliers barely carrying on at the moment who will not now be able to carry on and will be pushed off the road.  He must know that practically every business firm has its own lorry and it is useless to say that if a firm has not got its own lorry it can rely on public transport. If any firm had to rely on public transport it could not get a lorry for an indefinite period from the semi-State monopoly.</P>
    <P>This measure means that those people who carry goods such as beet and corn in the harvesting season will have to pay a substantial extra charge.  They will have to recover that extra charge from somebody else and it only means that for those who manage to survive, and all lorry owners will not manage to survive, the only way to recover it is to get it back from some other source and that source is the consuming public.  This is just an extra means of taxation, a means of getting another £100,000 from the community in general.</P>
    <P>There is one section in the Bill that I do not like and that is the enforcement section.  In that section, as far as I can understand it, it is possible, if a lorry is passing along a street fully loaded, that a Garda can come along and insist that the lorry be driven up to a radius of five miles to be weighed.  The section also states that the driver will be requested to unload the lorry if it can be done without undue inconvenience.  I should like the Minister to clarify that part of the section.  Take a lorry passing through a country town loaded with beet or turf or some other commodity and a Guard desires to have it weighed.  If a Guard suspects that a lorry is not fully taxed he can ask the driver to take him five miles to the nearest weighbridge and to unload the lorry.  There is the question of undue inconvenience.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> It is very hard to interpret this Bill; it surely needs some clarification.  Is it undue inconvenience, when a man is working perhaps night and day&mdash;these Bills are drafted by people who do not work night and day&mdash;perhaps in the rush season, the grain season and the beet season, to ask him to drive five miles, perhaps in a short day in the winter months, and to unload the lorry, which will take a considerable time, and to weigh it to satisfy the whim of the Guard?  If this provision becomes law the Guard will only be doing his duty but he will be imposing an unnecessary burden on certain members of the community.  However, he is imposing it not only on the lorry driver in the beet season&mdash;I refer to the beet season because this applies particularly to it&mdash;but on many farmers as well.</P>
    <P>When a farmer wants to send his beet away, particularly if he is a small farmer, he has to arrange with a neighbour or have extra labour standing by to load the beet.  The lorry driver will communicate with him and say he will collect the beet on such-and-such a day at such-and-such an hour.  If the lorry driver is held up by a Guard, taken three or four miles away to unload his lorry, have it weighed and reloaded, how much time will be wasted and what will happen to the other people waiting for the lorry to come?  Their whole system of disposing of the beet will be upset and all their arrangements will go awry just because of a stupid piece of legislation like this.</P>
    <P>In the enforcement Act there is a section which allows a period of seven days in which to deal with the request for the weighing of a lorry.  Is that not sufficient if the Minister wants to get legislation through this House to ensure he will get the last shilling from the lorry owner and the last penny sought in taxation under this Bill?  Is that not sufficient legislation without inserting a special clause as well?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain what motivated him in making these provisions.  Does he suspect that there are droves of lorries all over the country being driven about on which the correct tax is not being paid? Incidentally the tax payable is considerable. <Col N="277" /> On a form I have here I notice that for a lorry over nine tons the tax is £50 a ton extra tax.</P>
    <P>I believe this legislation is designed to put the private haulier off the road and to allow a semi-State body to operate in the main.  This will impose hardship in many ways.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, a reduction in rates has taken place.  Probably the Government had to accept the views of the commission dealing with this question. They would have to accept the advice of C.I.E. as to whether they would restrict the services which, as a statutory body, they would be entitled to do.  However, there must be areas where the private hauliers has to a large extent carried on his own business and where&mdash;I could give instances in my own constituency&mdash;there is no public transport whatsoever.  If these people are to be put off the road hardship will be imposed on the public; not only that but extra charges will also be imposed on the public.</P>
    <P>When you are dealing with a body such as C.I.E. whose financial circumstances do not really bear thinking about, if they get a monopoly&mdash;I am not suggesting they will get a monopoly throughout the country but suppose they get a specialised monopoly in certain areas&mdash;can they not charge what they like?  Fianna Fáil Deputies from rural areas know of many isolated areas not only in the west but in the more populous parts of Leinster as well, where, under these new provisions, there will be a bad service and a slow service by C.I.E.  Apart from charging what they like, I assume they will have to pay the tax charges the same as anybody else and they must meet those charges by putting them back on the public.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider carefully what I have said about the enforcement section.  I do not think it is right that the busy agricultural community&mdash;this refers not only to the agricultural community, although in the main it does, but also to the industrial community&mdash;should be at the beck and call of the Garda as will happen if this legislation is passed, when there are already safeguards to enforce the law.  There is a local official who can ask the lorry to be <Col N="278" /> brought in and weighed.  He has the courts at his disposal, as he should have in a democratic State, to enforce that.</P>
    <P>Why are these special provisions being imposed on the Irish people? In every Bill that comes to this House we seem to be giving away the liberty of the subject which is sacred in everything. The relevant sections in this Bill should be removed because there is no justification for them.  The only justification I can see for this Bill is a concealed means of getting extra taxation to the tune of £100,000 from the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is calculated that the effect of this Bill will be increased motor taxation to the extent of £100,000.  When we consider who is going to bear that burden and examine the statistics we find that this extra taxation will be paid by private vehicle owners, farmers and traders.  In Rush alone it is calculated that these extra taxes will cost between £1,000 and £1,500 extra to the market gardeners and farmers of that area.  As you know, the lorries are sold by traders with a standard type of body, not one that is useful for carrying certain types of goods.  You have, for instance, the example of the farmer who purchases a truck and may require that truck to carry livestock once in the week to the cattle market.  They are obliged to prepare creels to carry the livestock, and this extra tax in the new scheme will impose on them the necessity to pay for this extra burden.  Many trucks which were being taxed at £64, as a result of this arrangement whereby they use gear on the truck to carry a certain type of load, are now being taxed up to £80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We remember, some years ago, before the Fianna Fáil Government changed the system of road taxation, agricultural lorries were taxed at a flat rate of £25.  Farmers and others engaged in agricultural production are still inquiring: &ldquo;When will we get back to paying a flat rate?&rdquo;  Their vehicles are not constantly on the roads.  They are not used for commercial purposes; they are used purely for the transport of their goods, in a convenient way, from one place to another.  It is not, if you like, a commercial <Col N="279" /> enterprise.  The farmers have the same tax to pay as any other man with a lorry of the same size whom it does not pay to be put off the road, and whom it pays to be on the road as often as possible, every moment of the day, covering the largest possible mileage.</P>
    <P>There is the example of the haulier's truck which may do four times the mileage of the farmer's truck.  They both pay the same tax and obviously, the haulier's truck will do much more damage&mdash;more than four times the amount of damage&mdash;to the road than the farmer's truck, which will probably go out with a load and return empty, whereas a man engaged in a commercial enterprise who will have to do four times the mileage must ensure that his lorry will be loaded to the maximum, and that it will be loaded at all possible times, in order to make it a paying proposition.</P>
    <P>The same thing arises in connection with traders and shopkeepers who use vans and light trucks for the convenience of their business.  It is not convenient for them to organise their business in such a way that it will be possible for the semi-State transport system to provide the necessary service to transport their goods.  That is why the semi-State transport system cannot be availed of to a great extent by farmers and shopkeepers.  The business to be done by that vehicle must be organised to such an extent that they cannot avail of the service to the best advantage.  As I have mentioned, this Bill will affect the mileage of traders and farmers and not those engaged in commercial enterprise, particularly the road-breakers, the 15-ton vehicles which travel night and day doing considerable damage to the roads.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows the quality of our roads, and everybody knows that there is a limit to the weight which they are capable of bearing.  When it comes to crossing a bridge, the weight of a vehicle which may cross that bridge is determined.  There is a notice on the bridge saying that a vehicle over such-and-such a weight must not be allowed to pass over the bridge, because, if it is, the bridge will be <Col N="280" /> damaged, or smashed, or broken. These heavy vehicles can go where they like on our roads which are not capable of taking the very heavy vehicles which are being used.  They are driven at the highest possible speed and they are doing the greatest possible damage.  Some effort should be made to restrict the weight of vehicles which can be used on certain types of roads, because the weight of the vehicle will, in turn, damage the roads in relation to the weight and the speed at which it travels.</P>
    <P>I feel that this extra burden is not justified when we consider that the extra gear to be used on these lorries is used only periodically by farmers in particular&mdash;perhaps once in a week for a market, or at harvest time, for the purpose of carrying turf or bringing in the harvest.  They are not habitually used; yet we find these farmers and traders paying exactly the same tax, even though they are doing only one quarter of the mileage of other vehicles used for commercial enterprise.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I want to put to the Minister.  I may have misread the Bill, but I do not see how the question of the weight can be disputed.  If a vehicle is stopped in very wet muddy weather, it is possible that it will be over the weight.  When it is weighed&mdash;the weight is decided on the weighbridge&mdash;will the owner get an opportunity of cleaning the mud off the vehicle, drying it and getting it weighed again, when it might be found that, in fact, the actual weight of the vehicle without this extra burden from the wet that soaks into the timber of the vehicle, in addition to the mud was less.  It has been found that it makes a considerable difference in weight if a vehicle is clean and dry, compared with a vehicle that has been working in wet weather and is laden with mud and, as I say, has absorbed the dampness of the weather, and perhaps of heavy rainfall through which it passed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will reconsider this matter.  I feel that he is making an attack on one section of the community for the benefit of another.  He is attacking the owners of private <Col N="281" /> vehicles, and the only advantage it will bring will be to force them off the roads, and force them to avail of the limited services which can be provided for them by the State transport system. In the long run, it will result in higher prices to the consumers.  I hope the Minister in future will give long consideration to a change because, on this occasion, the owners of these lorries and vans had no opportunity to make alternative arrangements. They were notified, approximately early in December, that their tax was to be increased.  They had no opportunity to change over to a lighter vehicle, or to alter their business arrangements in order to avoid this extra burden.  Instead, they had to continue with the vehicles they were using, get them weighed, and they were then required to pay the extra tax.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider those two points: the weight of vehicles being used on the roads which are not fit to carry them and on the other hand, a flat rate for vehicles engaged in agriculture, which have such a small mileage, compared with other vehicles on which a similar tax is being paid.</P>

      <P>A number of items were raised by various Deputies which are common to their various arguments. I should like at the outset to say that we have not designed this legislation with a view to imposing increased taxation.  We have not designed it in order to get, as has been said repeatedly here to-day, an extra £100,000 in road tax during the coming year.  We have brought in this legislation to ensure that we do not lose upwards of £100,000 out of our road tax moneys, as we see them at present.  We have availed them of the opportunity, in so doing, to make any of the small changes necessary to ensure uniformity in the application of the law, which, regardless of what that law may effect, is a very desirable thing.  If we are to have a law enforced at all, which is not capable of being uniformly enforced, then it falls into disfavour and disuse, and there is complete disregard for the law and for those who are enforcing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> Deputy O'Donnell raised a number of detail points and mentioned the questions of the break down truck, ambulance, hearse or whatever you like to call it.  These vehicles are, in the ordinary course of things, used under the garage trade plates but if taxed they would not be rated as goods vehicles but as vehicles containing machines at the rate of £1 per h.p.</P>

      <P>They are not really creating any problems as a result of this Bill at the moment.  Road rollers, which have been mentioned, are exempt from duty specifically under the previous Act of 1952.  We do not propose to do anything there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to vehicles towing trailers, the tax is actually paid on the hauling vehicle although it is true to say that an extra tax is payable on the hauling vehicle in respect of the towed vehicle that it proposes to haul but the actual trailer itself is not subject to these taxed weighings as outlined in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell also mentioned the difficulties in regard to weighing vehicles and the scarcity of public weigh-bridges.  While it is true to say that public weigh-bridges by and large in many parts of the country are scarce, nevertheless, there will be, as a result of the terms of this Bill, more weigh-bridges available for the purpose of weighings than there were in the past when only a specific weighbridge in the counties could be used. In general, there is only one such weigh-bridge in each rural local authority area at any rate.  There does not appear, on examination, to be any other method of administration that would seem to me reasonable and sensible taking into consideration the circumstances in so far as the availability of weigh-bridges and weighing vehicles are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not one but a few Deputies raised the question of a vehicle hauling road materials.  It was mentioned in that regard that agitation is developing in some parts of the country in relation <Col N="283" /> to the normal haul of apples, gravel and so on.  I want to say that whether road material, road making materials or what you will, is carried on the vehicle it is still justifiable, whatever the type of road material, that the unladen weight of the vehicle should be brought into line with other vehicles used for different purposes.  These vehicles, which may be used from time to time for road materials, are very often used for many other purposes as well, so that the question of any unjust addition in respect of local authorities in this matter does not arise.  The determination which we propose, and which exists at the moment, is quite justifiable.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the attachments mentioned such as dipping gears, the various types of sideboards and so on, were taxable up to the present.  In the great majority of cases the tax was legitimately paid on all these attachments.  This Bill stems from a desire to bring in the minority who, through ignorance or otherwise, evade their just share of this tax.</P>
    <P>I think no one will disagree with me when I say that to treat everybody in the same manner and have all owners paying in respect of their vehicles a fair and equitable amount is only fair, particularly when we have regard to the fact that these people are the road users and that the money derived from their tax goes exclusively into the Road Fund which is in turn exclusively used for the maintenance, repair and improvement of the very roads they are using to the greatest extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney seemed to regard the question of the powers given to Gardaí in this Bill as something that was not just quite right.  In the first instance, I should say that Gardaí have similar powers under the Road Traffics Acts as we now have them. Furthermore, and in reply to somebody else who said the Gardaí would possibly pick on a truck owner and operator and pull him in because they did not like him or for some other flimsy reason just to irritate the lorry owner, if we were to regard all our law enforcement in that light and give precedence to that particular aspect <Col N="284" /> of things we really could make out a case that we should not have any laws or Gardaí at all.</P>
    <P>The Gardaí do their specific jobs. Their job is not, indeed, always a very happy one but to try to make it appear that the Gardaí generally go out of their way to find fault with road users is very far from being true.  From the experience of everybody in this House we know that, generally, the Gardaí are quite reasonable and, far from going out looking for trouble for road users by activities which also make trouble for the Gardaí, if there was any complaint surely it would be in the opposite direction?  When we hear of the Gardaí using their powers, the suggestion is rather that they do not use them fully enough in regard to road matters than that they overuse them.</P>
    <P>I should also point out to the House that under the Bill it is not just enough for the Gardaí to come along and take in somebody because they do not like him or because they crossed swords with him before.  The Garda has got to suspect that the particular operator is committing an offence in regard to the weight or other matter.  It is not just enough for him that he does not like the fellow.  I do not think the House or the Deputy who raised the matter need have any fears whatever that there will be any undue weight given to that view by any member of the Garda.</P>
    <P>The question of trucks used by a creamery was mentioned by several Deputies, including Deputy Moloney. I did not make the case that these trucks would only be used with their heavy containers for possibly three or four months.  Let me first of all say that these people comprise one of the groups whose specific problem we have considered in the Department. To make an overall concession to any one such type, regardless of whether their case is better than some of the cases made to us would open the door not only to the carriage of milk but to trucks with containers for oil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Minister?  Would it be possible to have them weighed separately for that quarter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="285" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just what I am about to deal with.  No, but on the general question of making it cover not only the carriage of milk but also the carriage of oil, stout and so forth.</P>
      <P>What we are considering in the Department, and what we hope will be the result of our full consideration is that when the lorry owner or lorry owners in question, where such an eventuality arises, have only use for a limited period in the year of a heavy container, the lorry owner may tax the truck at the beginning of the year at the lighter weight.  When the next quarter comes along, or the commencement of the period in which the heavy container will be required, he can then pay the higher tax but he will have to pay that tax for the entire remainder of the year.  In other words, if he had no heavy container for the first quarter, used a heavy container for the second quarter and did not use it for the third and fourth quarters, he would be allowed to tax the vehicle at the lower rate for the first quarter and, at the beginning of the second quarter, at the higher rate, which higher rate he would have to pay for the remaining three quarters of the year.</P>
      <P>What we are now considering, and here I cannot give details because this may not happen due to problems in administration, is that if the owner only has a use for a heavy container for only one of the remaining three quarters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even by then, it might not be possible to work it out, but what we hope is that we would provide for recoupment for the period in which he did not use the heavy container.  In other words, if an owner taxed at the light weight for the first quarter, then put an additional weight on for the second quarter of the year and used it only in that quarter, though he would have to tax the vehicle at the higher rate for the full three quarters, we hope to work out a method whereby we will refund him the extra payment for the last two quarters of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there was a suggestion, also from Deputy Moloney, that the weigh-ins be confined to certain hours and that a provision to that effect be put in the Bill.  I think it should be stated right away that it appears from my examination that anything rigid like that should be completely inappropriate in the Bill.  The only thing I could add in regard to administrative matters with reference to the various authorities, whether they be the Garda, local authorities, or who they may, is that instructions will be issued on these points that may likely arise that would cause irritation. That will be done in the instructions to local authorities and taxation officers, and even in anything we pass on to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also the point raised by Deputy Rooney, Deputy Moloney and possibly by Deputy Desmond as well, that maximum loads should be fixed for public roads.  The general findings of the experts and the research engineers show that what does the damage is the gross axle load, and there are provisions under the Road Traffic Acts to deal with this aspect of gross axle load.  Of course, I think everybody will agree it would be absolutely <Col N="287" /> impossible to fix varying weights for the different roads throughout the country, considering the vast variety of roads which we have to treat with, and it would be absolutely impossible to say that a truck can carry such a weight on one road and, if the owner intends to go off that road, will have to drop part of his load.  That just would not be possible.</P>
    <P>I might add that during the enactment of the road traffic proposals which we hope to have in the not too distant future the matter of vehicle weights, axles and wheels will be gone into very thoroughly, and possibly some changes that might meet more closely the wishes of the Deputies who raised this point might be decided.</P>
    <P>There has been a general sort of cry from a few Deputies that this whole taxation was devised to produce money, in the first instance and, in the second instance, was being brought into operation to force the small haulier out of existence and to push more traffic over to C.I.E.  The fact is that in the case of C.I.E., being the largest haulage undertaker in the country, if there is any increased taxation, contained in the Bill now before the House, it will naturally fall upon it to pay the greater proportion of that extra taxation, and no credence whatever can be given to the idea that our avowed intention is to go out of our way to put the small haulier out of existence.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Rooney who mentioned that the Rush farmers alone would pay £1,000, or £1,500 extra, by virtue of this Bill.  If any weight were to be given to that claim, and if we were to base our calculations on it, we would find that it was our hope to get an additional £1,000,000 from all road users throughout the country.  In addition to that, he made a complaint in regard to changing the tax for machinery that was only in limited use; that the people in question, the people he has in mind, would not use their machines one-fourth of the mileage or the time that a haulier would use a similar truck, and that a concession should be made in their case.  I wonder very much at Deputy <Col N="288" /> Rooney making that suggestion because my recollection&mdash;and I think he knows more about this than I do&mdash;is that one does not get very much concession from the insurance companies if one does only ten miles with a machine to-day as against another man who does 100 miles.  They do not give much satisfaction to that point which the Deputy was making, and well does he know it.</P>
    <P>In addition to those points which he raised, Deputy Rooney said that the additions that had to be made to trucks for bringing home turf and the harvest by the farmers in county Dublin were such as to create this £1,000 or £1,500, additional taxation.  The usual thing I have seen in bringing home the harvest is that a truck is stripped, rather than that anything is added to it, and I am sure the Dublin farmers are likely to be the same as those elsewhere. If they want to bring home oats or bales of straw, it is not by adding to the truck but by removing fixtures from it that they do it.  If one looks at this matter closely, the suggestion of an additional £1,000 or £1,500 falling on the Rush people is completely without foundation, but, if one wants to believe it, then it could be said that we will get an extra £1,000,000 into the Road Fund, and I do not think anybody would seriously give consideration to that viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde suggested that we were looking for the last shilling by way of taxation, that we were squeezing in this last shilling out of our small hauliers, and then went on to say that a lorry of nine tons weight would yield an extra £50 per ton.  It is hard to reconcile his concern for the small man who, allegedly, is being victimised in this matter with the concern he expressed in the same breath for the owner of a truck exceeding nine tons weight.  There is a vast difference between that type of lorry owner and the small man from whom the Deputy believes we are wringing his last shilling.</P>
    <P>Let me say right away that if these road users have been paying, and the great majority of them were paying, what they were justly liable to pay under the existing road tax code, then <Col N="289" /> there would be no incidence of increase whatsoever.  That, in fact, is the case and will be the case in a great many instances.  If, on the other hand, some road users were evading or avoiding payment or succeeding, by virtue possibly of the interpretation of their local tax office, in getting away with something under the existing law which their counterparts failed to get away with elsewhere, I think everybody will agree that that situation should be rectified and that regardless of what part of the country the operator may be and the road user may exist or live in, his share of contributions to the Road Fund by way of tax should be equitable and parallel to what his opposite number in any other part of the country is paying.  That is something that is being inisisted upon and ensured in the proposals before the House.</P>
    <P>I feel that when the full picture emerges, as it is now beginning to emerge, in relation to the proposals contained in this Bill and already put into operation under the Finance Act as from 1st January, the fears expressed here before Christmas and even today will be found to be more or less unfounded and that the big incidence of additional tax that has been suggested here will not in fact arise.  The preliminary&mdash;it must be appreciated it can only be preliminary &mdash;knowledge so far obtained from our tax offices throughout the country indicates what we have been saying all along, namely, that there is no additional impost in general being applied throughout the country: it is bringing uniform charges to everybody for the same service.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of adding tax. It is a question of ensuring that the leak from the Road Fund does not become greater and, in turn, that that Road Fund which is entirely given over to the repair, maintenance and improvement of our roads, will not be allowed to lose by virtue of the law as it was coming to be interpreted in the recent past.</P>
    <P>I feel the House will be quite satisfied as the year advances and more <Col N="290" /> experience of the terms of this Bill emerges that what we are doing is ensuring that our taxes are equitable, that the Road Fund does not lose as a result of any change in the mind of the courts or anybody else and that, by and large, there will be fair treatment for all our road users in the matter of tax.</P>

That does not make the difference between bankruptcy and solvency but it constitutes a substantial additional burden on the individual.

      <P>The only retail prices available to the Central Statistics Office are those ascertained for the quarterly Consumer Price Index inquiries and these relate to a 2 lb. loaf of a quality in substantial demand in the areas reported.  I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to circulate, in the Official Report, a statement showing the significant increases in the national average retail price of a 2 lb. loaf between successive inquiries during the period between mid-February, 1957 (the date nearest to March, 1957 in respect of which the index is calculted) and mid-November, 1959 (the <Col N="293" /> latest available date).  The effect of the increase in the price of bread advertised to become operative on the 16th November, 1959 may not be fully reflected in the prices returned at the November inquiry which related to the same date.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>SIGNIFICANT increases in the national average retail price of the 2 lb. loaf of bread between successive quarterly Consumer Price Index inquiries in the period February, 1957&mdash;November, 1959.</P>

      <P>As the information requested by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.  I am including in the statement particulars of the tax chargeable for the current year, 1959/60, and the tax which would be chargeable by reference to the alterations in the allowances and reliefs provided for by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1959.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I have read the speech in question but fail to see that any statements of mine regarding the Verolme Cork Dockyard Project made on the Committee State of the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, 1959, require to be reconciled with the information given on the 16th December, 1959, by the Chairman of the Industrial Credit Company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I held the view that the Minister for Finance should not be required to answer questions in the Dáil on behalf of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  The point I made at all times was that we should regard it as an ordinary bank.  I have no objection to the chairman of any bank giving any information he wants to give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not recall accusing Deputy Dillon and myself specifically, and I think Deputy Norton, of national sabotage for seeking to have this information made public and saying that it would effectively prevent any development if such information were made public&mdash; not by the Minister but made public? Now one would think that in ordinary decency he should apologise for the words he used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's anticipated reply, would he agree that it now looks churlish on his part to have spent so much time uselessly defending the withholding of the information when the Chairman, his own appointee, distributes the information broadcast, so that it is now the subject of prolonged correspondence in the newspapers?  When the Minister was answering this question some months ago it was a life and death secret; now no dog in the street would bother to look at the information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of (a) married men, (b) single men employed on special employment schemes during the months of December, 1959, and January, 1960, in the employment exchange districts of Killybegs, Dungloe and Dunfanaghy, County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The records of <Col N="304" /> employment kept by the Special Employment Schemes Office do not distinguish between married men and single men, nor are the records related to Employment Exchange districts. I regret, therefore, that the specific information asked for by the Deputy is not available.  The average number of men employed weekly on special employment schemes in Co. Donegal was 518 in December, 1959, and 388 in the first three weeks of January, 1960.  About two-thirds of these were in the west Donegal area. As the regulations in respect of the recruitment of workmen for employment schemes require that unemployment assistance recipients are listed in the order of the number of their dependants and Unemployment Assistance payments, it may be assumed that the majority of the workmen are married men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that these grants are given for the employment of the unemployed and that special consideration is given, as the Parliamentary Secretary stated, to those with the greatest number of dependants? If that is so, all married men who are not widowers should get priority of employment over single men who have no dependants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fairly general regulation which, as far as I know, is adhered to whereby married men with dependants do get preference on these works schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary heard the reply given by his colleague yesterday as to the number of married men unemployed in this locality and I now suggest to him that single men who are members of Fianna Fáil Cumainn receive preferential treatment over their colleagues in the matter of employment over their colleagues who are married men with dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is not true.  The Deputy can easily visualise the case where the question of distance is bound to come into this also. If a married man is living seven or eight miles away from the particular job perhaps it is not feasible for him <Col N="305" /> to come in to this job when there are single men living beside it.</P>

      <P>I propose with permission to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The preliminary investigations recommended in the Rydell Report on the Shannon problem are in hands, but the engineer's report in the matter will not be available before the end of the year.  Some time will then be required for study and consideration of the report.  These preliminary investigations include examination of suggestions for possible diversions of the River Suck, and, accordingly, the question of a drainage scheme for the Suck catchment must await consideration of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the first question, is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that his predecessors, Deputy Donnellan and the late Deputy Beegan specifically guaranteed that the river Suck would be next on the arterial drainage list after the Corrib? Will the Parliamentary Secretary say now that order of priority has been altered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware, the Suck was never on the priority list in that order and furthermore, as the Deputy must know, the Rydell report on Shannon flooding specifically recommended that separate drainage of the Suck would aggravate the Shannon flooding.  It did not recommend that it should be undertaken before the Shannon drainage would be put in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it from that reply that the advice and recommendations of the Board of Works engineers for the past 30 years, that the drainage of the Suck would not affect the Shannon flooding and could be undertaken as a separate scheme, were incorrect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the engineers or the advisers of <Col N="307" /> the Office of Public Works ever gave such advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, in view of the fact that on the 2nd May, 1957, the Government directed the Board of Works to carry out a survey of the recommendations made by Mr. Rydell and as that is almost three years ago now, will the Parliamentary Secretary say when the people of the Shannon flooding area are likely to have some scheme carried out that will alleviate the conditions from which they have suffered over the last 40 years and that we hope will be brought to an end maybe within the next 40 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be able to give any specific time as to when this can be done but, as the Deputy knows, the survey referred to is in progress at the moment and is expected to be finished by the end of this year.  Pending a decision on that I cannot give any information as to what may happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

      <P>It is not necessary to introduce new legislation to cover the arrangements for intermediate river drainage.  The proposals involve an extension of the drainage programme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to cover small catchments. The intention is to proceed with the arrangements concurrently with the carrying out of the main drainage programme so that the small catchments can be reached early without interruption of the main programme. Preliminary inspection of a number of catchments has commenced.  As the various statutory steps prescribed by the 1945 Act must be followed, it is unlikely that the construction works stage can be reached this year in any area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state the reason for the baton charges in O'Connell Street, Dublin on Christmas Eve night, 1959; if he is aware that between 40 and 50 persons were injured in these charges, many of them being innocent bystanders or persons proceeding to their homes; and why no persons were charged with an offence arising out of these events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, that there was no baton charge in O'Connell Street, or elsewhere in Dublin, on Christmas Eve.  There were disturbances and disorderly scenes in O'Connell Street, and individual members of the Garda Síochána may have had to draw their batons at times, but there was certainly no general order for a drawing of batons, much less a baton charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> I am not aware that anybody was injured by a Garda baton on the occasion in question.  The suggestion that forty or fifty persons, including many innocent bystanders, were so injured, is, I am satisfied, a gross exaggeration to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>When disturbances take place, the primary duty of the Garda Síochána is to restore order and maintain the peace.  The officer in charge of the Gardaí on duty in O'Connell Street on the occasion in question took the view that, having regard to the large numbers of people involved, the restoration of order and the maintenance of the peace could best be secured by not making arrests.</P>
    <P>Both the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, and District Officers concerned have received several messages commending the Garda Síochána for the way in which they dealt with the disturbances.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that on Christmas Eve night, any Christmas Eve night, between 10.30 and 11.30 o'clock there are anything from 10,000 to 15,000 people innocently inebriated in O'Connell Street?  Ninety per cent. of these people drink whiskey on that day only and for the remainder of the year they drink plain porter.  Is the Minister further aware that on that night 40 persons were injured as a result of blows from batons?  That is the number given to me at Jervis Street Hospital when I went there yesterday. I was also told that the majority of them were brought in by the Guards. Therefore the Guards are aware of who they are and could have brought charges.  It is an extraordinary thing that not a single person was charged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to assume that the Deputy is referring to the newspaper report which was a gross exaggeration of the facts.  The statement made by Deputy Sherwin just now is a still more gross exaggeration. The Deputy has stated that he made personal inquiries at the hospital and was told that 40 people were treated for injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>May I state that the Garda authorities immediately after the publication of this report, went to the hospital in question and asked for confirmation of the report.  They were informed by the hospital authorities that all matters relating to the treatment of patients were strictly confidential and that they could not give information of any description in that regard, not even to the Garda authorities.  In these circumstances, I have grave doubts as to the statement made by Deputy Sherwin to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I want to impress on the House that a disturbance took place in O'Connell Street.  I do not know whether the people who caused that disturbance were members of an organised gang, but they were part of a gang who have been frightening the public for some little time to the extent that the public would not come to the aid of the police in certain circumstances through sheer fear of these types of individuals, some of whom were circulating in the crowd at the time.  These are the people who were the centre of the disturbance on that occasion.  Some of them had broken bottles in their hands and if individual <Col N="320" /> Guards did draw their batons I commend them for doing that.</P>
    <P>I am informed that a Garda who uses his baton has to make a report giving the circumstances in which he uses it, and that the only circumstance in which a Garda can use a baton without an order is to defend himself. If a Garda defended himself with his baton against a ruffian with a broken bottle who was prepared to use it as a weapon I say that he was quite correct in doing so.  As far as I am concerned, the Gardaí have been given, like the rest of us, natural weapons of defence&mdash;their hands.  If they use these, against this particular section of the public who are doing so much against the good name of the city.  I want to repeat they will have my commendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

      <P>I would <Col N="321" /> refer the Deputy to the comprehensive review of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme which appeared in the November issue of my Department's <i>Farm Bulletin</i> and was circulated to all Deputies for their information. Steady progress has since continued. The accreditation of the entire western Clearance Area should be feasible during the year.  Good progress is also being made in counties Cavan and Monaghan, which became Clearance Areas in July, 1959.  The first round of clearance tests should be completed in these counties by April next.  Almost all herds in the midland and eastern counties are now under test and there has recently been a noticeable increase in the number of individual Accredited Herds in some of these counties.  In the southern dairying area over 60 per cent. of the 70,000 herd-owners in the six counties concerned have already joined the new scheme which was introduced on 1st October last.</P>

      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>1.  Full information about all licences issued under the Road Transport Acts is contained in the Statutory Register of Merchandise Licences prescribed by Section 29 of the Road Transport Act, 1933 and which is open to inspection in my Department at all reasonable times.</P>
      <P>2.  The Road Transport Acts do not provide for the limitation of the unladen weight of vehicles operated by authorised (merchandise carrying) companies, i.e., statutory companies.  The average weight of unladen vehicles operated by &ldquo;existing carrier&rdquo; licensees, i.e., private operators, in 1933 or at the present time could not be ascertained without considerable research.  The standard lorry weight applicable to the bulk of licences in 1933 did not exceed 1 ton 15 cwts.  The minimum standard lorry weight now applicable to these licences is 3 tons 2 cwts.</P>

    <P>4)  In the case of the statutory companies, three such companies have been absorbed into C.I.E. since 1933, viz., the G.S.R., the G.N.R., and the Grand Canal Company; there are two such companies, viz., Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Co., and the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee, which have not been so absorbed.  The remaining public transport company&mdash;the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway Co.&mdash;has ceased to operate. At no time did any of the statutory companies hold more than one licence; the &ldquo;new&rdquo; licences issued to these companies since 1933 were replacement licences.  The licences absorbed by C.I.E. were allowed to lapse and C.I.E. now hold only one licence.</P>
    <P>(5)  The number of licences held by private hauliers in force on 31st November, 1959, was 960. The difference between that figure and the number of licences (1,360) issued following the enactment of the 1933 Act is accounted for by:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  386 licences acquired by the statutory companies of which 316 were acquired by C.I.E. and its predecessors;</P>
    <P>(b)  248 licences expired or revoked and,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant of a new manufacture licence to the Verolme Cork Dockyard Limited to enable the company to engage in the building of ships at Rushbrooke was subject to the specific condition that, without the permission of the Minister, they shall not build vessels of 3,000 tons dead weight and/or 2,000 tons gross, or less for the domestic market.  It is mandatory on the Minister when considering any application for a new manufacture licence to have regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to the position of existing undertakings lawfully established at the date of the application, by persons entitled to operate without a new manufacture licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, the condition inserted in the licence granted to the Verolme Cork Dockyard Limited was necessary to safeguard the position of the existing Irish shipyard and it was clear that the only circumstances in which a waiver of the conditions would be warranted would be that an order for a ship would otherwise be lost to the country because the existing shipyard was unable, at the time, to take the <Col N="333" /> contract.  In the case of the vessel referred to by the Deputy, these circumstances did not exist, and I had no option therefore but to refuse the application for a waiver of the licence condition.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the announced object of the Verolme Cork Dockyard in establishing a major shipyard at Rushbrooke was to build large ships.  In view of the imminent prospect of an order from Irish Shipping Ltd. for the building at the Rushbrooke yard of a ship of 14,700 tons dead weight, I am not aware of any ground for any uneasiness in the port of Cobh.</P>
    <P>The implication in the question of discrimination by the Minister in favour of any particular area in the discharge of his statutory functions is very much to be deprecated.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the names of persons have been removed from the register of Dáil electors because of their British nationality.  The register in each area is compiled by the county registrar for the area and every citizen of Ireland who on 15th September in each year has attained the age of 21 years and who is not disqualified by law is entitled to be registered as a Dáil elector in the constituency in which he was on 15th September ordinarily resident or in occupation of business premises as defined in the Electoral Act, 1923.  It is clear, therefore, that if the name of a person is removed from the register it would not be because of his British nationality but because of his not being a citizen of Ireland.  If he is a citizen of Ireland as well as being a British national he is entitled to have his name on the register if he is otherwise qualified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the strong objections which residents adjacent to the property known as &ldquo;Stonehouse&rdquo;, Stillorgan Road, County Dublin, have to the proposed erection of a petrol filling station on this site; and if he will consider taking steps to prevent such station being erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On 23rd December, 1958, the Dublin County Council gave permission, subject to certain conditions, under the Town and Regional Planning Acts, to Irish Shell Ltd., to erect a petrol filling station at &ldquo;Stone-house&rdquo;, Stillorgan.  Residents in the <Col N="343" /> area formally appealed to me to revoke the permission.  Having considered the amenity and traffic considerations raised by the appellants, I revoked the permission by sealed order on 15th August last.  The legal effect of this revocation was as if the county council had refused to give permission in the first instance.</P>
      <P>On 25th January, 1960, the solicitors for Irish Shell Ltd., wrote to the Dublin County Council referring to my decision and saying that they had decided to proceed with the erection of the filling station within three weeks of the date of their letter, adhering to the conditions imposed by the county council in the permission I had revoked. The county council replied on 6th February pointing out that my order had revoked their permission, which had now ceased to exist for all purpose and stating unequivocally that the council would give no countenance whatever to disregard, by Irish Shell Ltd., of my order.</P>
      <P>My powers in this regard are limited to determining appeals against decisions of planning authorities. When my decision alters that of a planning authority, the decision as so altered becomes, legally, the decision of the planning authority.  The law gives certain powers of enforcement of decisions to planning authorities. It is for the planning authority to consider what further steps should be taken in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it follow from that that the county council has authority, if this filling station is erected, to have it pulled down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers of enforcement open to the county council are to serve a prohibition in respect of unauthorised development, and, where that is not obeyed, to follow it by a declaration, contravention of which is a criminal offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Department of Finance provides moneys for the payment of pensions doled out by the Minister's Department, would the Minister confirm that even the Revenue Commissioners do not consider such prizes as income?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A special allowance is not a pension.  It is an allowance granted to relieve hardship.  It consists of an annual sum which when added to the applicant's means must not exceed a prescribed sum, and the value of any capital possessed by an applicant is assessable.  This £2,000 was notified to my Department by the social welfare officer and had to be assessed as capital possessed by the applicant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands what progress has been made to date in carrying out the £100,000 scheme in the Shannon valley; and when the present scheme is likely to be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 84 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission scheme for amelioration of conditions in the Shannon Valley is not a scheme of flood control but is aimed at giving relief from the hazards of flooding, in so far as this can be done, by the provision of new buildings on higher sites, together with dry stands for stock against the risk of abnormal floods.</P>
      <P>Continuous progress is being made towards implementation of the scheme. The Land Commission have had conditions in the Shannon Valley under observation in the light of the recent flooding and are satisfied that no major revision in their main proposals is necessary, apart from review of building sites proposed by the landholders in about 4 per cent. of the cases.</P>
      <P>New or reconstructed dwellinghouses are already well under way for some 75 farmers in four counties, while other projected works are under contracts. Altogether, buildings are proposed for some 100 farmers in the vulnerable stretches of the Shannon Valley, and, in addition, the improvement of approach roads is being undertaken.</P>
      <P>The migration of a limited number of landholders to other counties is also involved and, to date, five such exchanges have been carried out. Allotments of land on higher ground as secure stands for stock have already been provided for 30 farmers and proposals for further similar allotments are being examined.</P>
      <P>Expenditure to date has been £30,000.  The rate of progress necessarily will depend on landholders, contractors etc. but, granted full cooperation, the Land Commission are hopeful that the Scheme will be substantially completed by the end of the present year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that, if in the light of the recent serious <Col N="350" /> flooding, when an examination is made, it is necessary to increase the amount of money for the £100,000 scheme, the Minister will be prepared to do so in order to take in other individuals for consideration who are not included in that scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that all the people concerned or likely to be affected were investigated and examined by the Land Commission officials As I have indicated, I understand that, in the main, with the possible exception of about four per cent of those concerned, the scheme as visualised by the Land Commission will be adequate.  The Deputy will appreciate that in a number of cases in the area, the owners are not, in fact, living on their lands.  They are living elsewhere and naturally nothing will be done in their cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken into consideration the fact that where improvement works have already been carried out, namely, the raising of roadways and their improvement, the roadways were again this time submerged by the Shannon, although the indication was that they would be raised above the flood level? Furthermore, is the Minister aware that a number of floats on which the new houses are to be built and on which stands are to be made available for cattle were surrounded by the flood waters?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report in a local newspaper on somewhat similar lines.  The information given to me does not bear out these allegations.  I am told that, in the main, with the exception of one place where there was water to the extent of something like two inches on this occasion, the plans were satisfactory.  Some people have <Col N="351" /> refused to accept houses or sites elsewhere. They insist on houses being built on the sites of the old houses. That problem is there, too.  As far as I can judge from the information at my disposal, the scheme envisaged by the Land Commission is sufficient to deal with the problem in so far as it can be dealt with in its present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As the reply to this question includes detailed information some of which is in tabular form, I propose, with the permission of the <Col N="362" /> Ceann Comhairle, to have it circulated with the official report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">NATIONAL SCHOOLS.</P>
      <P>The attached statement shows the number of new national schools erected in each county during the year ended 31st December, 1959, and also the number of new national schools in course of construction on the 31st December, 1959.  I regret that, as the records dealing with Primary Education are kept on a county basis, I am unable to give the information on the basis of each local authority area.</P>
      <P>As regards the estimated annual progress in the provision of new national schools, my Department proposes to aim at an annual target of 100 new schools.</P>
      <P>As regards the capital expenditure required for the replacement of existing unsuitable schools, it is estimated that a sum in the region of £6,000,000 will be needed but as pointed out to the Deputy in reply to his question of the 4th March, 1959, this is only a rough estimate.</P>
      <P Just="Center">VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS.</P>
      <P>During the year ended 31st December, 1959, the building of six new vocational schools was completed: one in each of the local authority areas of Counties Donegal, Dublin, Kilkenny and Meath, and two in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>There are at present eight new schools under construction, one each in the local authority areas of Counties Donegal, Dublin, Kerry, Kildare, Limerick, Longford, Westmeath and Tipperary (South Riding).</P>
      <P>Progress in providing vocational schools is dependent on a variety of circumstances which make it difficult to forecast the number of schools which may be provided annually in the future.  It is estimated, however, that the figure will not fall below six schools per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to give an estimate of the total capital requirements for all future vocational school building development.  It may be said, however, <Col N="363" /> that new building projects which are at present under way, or are likely to commence within the next three years, will involve a capital outlay of some £1,600,000 within that period.</P>
    <P>The above information is in respect of new national and vocational school buildings.  Considerable capital expenditure will also be involved in the reconstruction and extension of existing schools.</P>

    <Title>Health Authorities Bill, 1959&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress I was dealing with amendment No. 9 and I was pointing out the manner in which the local expenses would be raised.  It might, perhaps, make the matter shorter if I explained that the section which it is proposed to amend is the section which provides for the general allocation of expenses as between the various appointing authorities.  The main purpose of Amendment No. 9 is to provide that if the health authority should happen to come into existence in a certain year they might find themselves without funds and this is to ensure that the fund properly raised for the services will be handed over to the health authority.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 11, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better read my note on this.  Sections 9 and 10 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, deal with the manner in which the estimates of a local authority shall be prepared, and with the procedure for holding an estimates meeting at which the estimate of a local authority <Col N="367" /> is adopted.  If Section 13 were not here, this provision would apply to the adoption, by the health authority in the four areas, of the estimate of their expenditure.  It has, however, been decided that the procedure for the adoption of the estimates of a health authority should differ from the normal procedure of joint boards in that the rating authorities should be given an opportunity of examining the demands which will be made upon them by the health authority before these are finally adopted.  Provision for this is made in the Second Schedule to the Bill and these provisions will have effect, in relation to the health authorities, in substitution for the provisions in Sections 9 and 10 of the 1955 Act.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  A health authority established by this Act shall make every payment which&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  is in respect of any local financial year after that in which that health authority are established,</P>
      <P>(b)  would, but for this subsection, be made by a local authority who appoint members of that health authority, and</P>
      <P>(c)  would, but for this Act, be part of the net health expenditure for the purposes of the Act of that local authority in respect of that local financial year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is merely to ensure that after the end of a local financial year in which a health authority is established under the Act, only that authority can receive payments from the health services grant for its area; to ensure that any item of expenditure which at present ranks for recoupment from that grant will continue so to rank. The amendment will ordinarily provide that such an item will become the responsibility of the health authority <Col N="368" /> and not of the authority who might remain responsible for making the payment if it were not for this provision. A clear case in point is that of a person who has been a former official of one of the appointing boards and who has been retired on pension. The responsibility for his pension will be transferred to the health authority.</P>

      <P>I should like to say something on the section.  I say it in order to correct a statement made by the Minister on the Second Reading with which I had not got an opportunity of dealing.  I opposed the provision in this Bill which sought to abolish, or merge, the Dublin Fever Hospital Board in the new health authority.  I corrected the statement which the Minister made in his introductory speech to the Second Reading to the effect that the abolition of the Dublin Fever Hospital Board was an integral part of the Dublin unified health proposal.  I said that I was not so aware and later on in his closing speech the Minister said, and I quote from the Official Reports, Volume 177, Column 809:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy O'Higgins, when speaking last night was betrayed by a faulty recollection of what in fact had been his ideas&mdash;I do not want to put it further than that&mdash;in relation to the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  It was included in the scheme which he had <Col N="369" /> before him and it is common property that he had it before him because he visited the Waterford Corporation and the various local authorities concerned in Waterford and Cork in 1956 with a view to getting the principle of unification accepted.  In his particular scheme the Dublin Fever Hospital Board was included.  I am saying that because there has been the suggestion made by Deputy Dockrell that in some way I am influenced by some degree of malice or vindictiveness against the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.</P>
    <P>I want to assert that I was never aware at any stage, when I was Minister for Health, that it was proposed to abolish the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  Furthermore, I want to correct, from the Minister's own records, the statement he made that the Dublin Fever Hospital Board was always part of the Dublin unified health authority proposal.  This proposal was first communicated to the Dublin local authorities by a letter issued in 1952, on the 30 Meán Fómhair, 1952.  In that letter which contained the Dublin unified health authority proposal as it was known to me, it was proposed, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes that in Dublin city and county there should be one health authority to consist of 16 members of the Corporation and eight members of the County Council to carry out the health functions of the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council and the three boards of assistance and the functions of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Authority.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, the proposal in that letter was considered fully by the Dublin bodies affected under a joint committee which subsequently brought out a report known as the Dooge Report.  It was the work of the present Professor Dooge and in that report it was pointed out that the Minister's new health authority would not administer the present functions of the Dublin Fever Hospital Board which would still remain as a separate local authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> I want to know why it could be suggested here that I was at any time informed, or as Minister for Health that I ever suggested, that the Dublin Fever Hospital Board would be abolished?  It was not part of the proposal before me.  I was never so informed or advised, and if the Minister will go back on the records he will find that I interviewed each body, or received and discussed with each body affected by this proposal, what might take place.  Not only did I go to Waterford and Limerick, as mentioned by the Minister, but I discussed this matter fully with both the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council. I interviewed, and I had discussions with, everybody affected by the proposals in this Bill.  I never had any discussions on this matter with the Dublin Fever Hospital Board because, so far as I was aware, they were not to be affected.  It surprised me that a statement of this kind should have been made, particularly as I have made a statement here from my own recollection on the matter.</P>
    <P>I concede that possibly on the large health authority file which has grown up since 1952 there may have been second thinking with regard to the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  Somebody may have included the abolition of the board in the proposal but certaintly it was not brought to my notice or to my attention.  If it had, I would undoubtedly have rejected it because when I was Minister I was always concerned to foster and to keep alive voluntary effort not only in other services but also on the hospital boards. I do not intend to say anything more but I wanted to correct that for the record.  It does appear that this proposal was not originally associated with the unified health authority while I was there.  It may have come in later, but, if it did, I was not aware of it.</P>

      <P>I put this question down in defence of the ordinary citizen and the Garda and not, by any means, in defence of the teddy boys or the ruffians, as the Minister described them in his reply.  It was in order to get a satisfactory explanation of why innocent bystanders were beaten that I sought the information.  I asked the Minister to state the reason for the baton charges.  I also asked him if he was aware that 40 or 50 persons were injured in those charges, many of them innocent bystanders.  I also asked him why no person was charged and his answer was&mdash;a funny enough answer: &ldquo;I am not aware that anyone was injured by a Garda baton on the occasion in question.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have a feeling that there is an attempt to &ldquo;cover up&rdquo; this business. It is common knowledge that fighting was going on for a couple of hours, that there was a shuttle service between Jervis Street hospital and O'Connell Street as a result of the row between the Gardaí and, if you like, the ruffians and the unfortunate people who were also injured.  Yet, the Minister states: &ldquo;I am not aware that anyone was injured by a Garda baton on the occasion in question.&rdquo;  The Minister goes on to say that the suggestion that 40 or 50 people, including innocent bystanders, were injured is gross exaggeration. The rest of his reply is only a cover up.  The two points I want to deal with are &ldquo;that no person was injured by a Garda baton,&rdquo; and that my statement that 40 or 50 people were injured, including innocent bystanders, was a gross exaggeration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The occasion was Christmas Eve and the Irish morning newspapers that came out afterwards reported what happened.  The <i>Irish Times,</i> which is quite a conservative paper and does not run amok in its views states that the row started at 11 o'clock.  &ldquo;The police drew their batons with the object of clearing the street&rdquo;&mdash;meaning O'Connell Street.  O'Connell Street is a large place and the <i>Sunday Review</i> on the following Sunday said: &ldquo;There were never so <Col N="372" /> many people in O'Connell Street.&rdquo;  As we know, O'Connell Street could hold 50,000 people.  At a conservative estimate, I would say there were from 10,000 to 15,000 people at the time this disturbance began and the paper said that &ldquo;When the disturbance began, the Guards drew their batons to clear O'Connell Street&rdquo;; in other words, to clear the people who were causing the trouble&mdash;I assume, a couple of hundred I do not know if there were many more &mdash;and also the 10,000 or 15,000 people who were then in the street and who had a right to be there as they were innocently celebrating Christmas Eve.</P>
    <P>The public houses close at 10 o'clock, but on Christmas Eve, it is nearly half-past ten or 11 o'clock before they are emptied.  The cinemas go on until 11 o'clock and, being Christmas Eve, everyone is inebriated. I know that.  I used to drink myself; I do not drink now but I know what happens on Christmas Eve.  I represent O'Connell Street.  I live around the corner, and I suppose I know every newsboy and parking attendant in the area.  I know that on Christmas Eve, O'Connell Street was full of innocent people who were &ldquo;canned&rdquo; if you like, celebrating the occasion. It is not the practice when friends meet each other on Christmas Eve to offer stout; they drink whiskey and when they come out, they stand about talking and chatting and celebrating the occasion.</P>
    <P>Also celebrating the occasion were a number of students throwing &ldquo;bangers&rdquo;.  On an occasion such as Christmas Eve, I should imagine that the older, experienced Gardaí would not give that too much attention. They would hope the students would get rid of their &ldquo;bangers&rdquo; and go home.  There was always a certain amount of disturbance and slap-bangs on Christmas Eve in O'Connell Street.  It is observed like New Year's Eve in New York or Guy Fawkes's Night in London, but nobody pays much attention.</P>
    <P>I understand this all began because some students threw squibs and some teddy boys started jeering.  One report says: &ldquo;The teddy boys started to jeer.&rdquo;  The three newspapers admit that <Col N="373" /> there were casualties.  The <i>Irish Press</i> says: &ldquo;Twenty persons were injured and taken to Jervis Street hospital&rdquo;; the <i>Irish Times</i> says: &ldquo;Seventy persons were injured&rdquo;; and the <i>Irish Independent</i> says: &ldquo;Forty people were taken to Jervis Street hospital.&rdquo; You might as well say that these three newspapers are exaggerating.  I am told by the Minister that I am exaggerating but then the newspapers are also exaggerating and if I am a liar, they are liars also.</P>
    <P>The fact is that O'Connell Street was full of innocent people.  There may have been a few hundred &ldquo;bowsies&rdquo; among them and because of this, the Gardaí decided to clear O'Connell Street of 10,000 or 15,000 people.  That is my complaint.  What caused me to put down the question is that a man from Parnell Street aged about 50 came to me with both eyes blackened and his nose broken.  That same man presented himself to the <i>Irish Times</i> and it was the <i>Irish Times</i> office that rang me up and then I investigated the matter.  This man's statement was that he had been looking on, as were many others also, and that he got a baton across the face. He said that what did so much damage was that he had both hands in his pockets and he could not take them out in time and fell flat on his face on the ground.  Another man who was home from England and had arrived the day before was making for his bus after coming from a picture house at the time and had to take a beaten face back to England with him in the next day or two.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to admit that a number of those present deserved what they got but my complaint is that the Gardaí ran amok and decided to clear O'Connell Street and bashed out right left and centre with that object in view, with the result that at least 30 innocent bystanders, I would say, were injured.</P>
    <P>All the evidence is there and I ask, in view of these Press reports, why the reports were not denied by the Minister and why did he wait for my question to deny them?  In effect, the Minister said I was a liar when I said I was in Jervis Street hospital yesterday. <Col N="374" /> Naturally, when I was making a case&mdash;and I have a case&mdash;I went into Jervis Street hospital and they were rather reluctant to tell me anything, just as the Minister admits.  They said it was not for them to give information but that did not disprove the argument that 40 people were injured.  It proves nothing.  What the Minister said was that they declined to give information but that does not get away from the fact that 40 people were treated there that night.</P>
    <P>I went there yesterday.  The nun in charge said: &ldquo;We do not like giving information.&rdquo;  There were two doctors sitting beside her.  It was I who put the question.  I am probably a little smarter than some of the guards.  I asked: &ldquo;Is it not correct that 40 persons were injured?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes, there were 40 treated here on the night and,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the Guards brought many of them here.&rdquo;  I made a statement of fact and I object to being told they were not injured.</P>
    <P>I have experience of teddy boys and I am not trying to defend them.  I object to being misrepresented; I object to people thinking that I am putting in a word for them.  I have been in the dance business all my life and I probably know every teddy boy and it was my business to prevent them getting into the dance halls when I ran them.  I have no feeling for them at all and I have no objection if the Guards used their boots or drew their batons.  I am not objecting to that.  I am simply objecting to them running amok and bashing up everybody in O'Connell Street.  It is these people who came to me, as their local Deputy, to complain.</P>
    <P>I object to this cover up.  It is all right for the Minister to make an excuse.  Why the innuendo that I am exaggerating?  Let him tell all the newspapers that they are exaggerating and telling lies and send the Garda back to Jervis Street to ask the question again, without attempting to deny there were 40 people injured.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am not defending the hooligans.  I hate them as much as the Guards hate them.  I have the greatest respect for <Col N="375" /> the Guards and have had occasion to send for the Guards many times and was delighted with their help.  My point is that they ran amok in O'Connell Street and lashed out at innocent people celebrating the occasion.  It was wrong to do that because that kind of action would bring the Guards into discredit with the public, especially with so many of the public there.</P>
    <P>If I am defending anyone, it is the innocent bystanders and I shall defend the Guards next.  I do not care about the hooligans.  I want to vindicate what I said.  I was in Jervis Street.  I object to being told that I am inventing. I am not a liar.</P>

      <P>The Deputy protests too much.  He implies by his very question that the Gardaí, on Christmas eve, batoned the public of Dublin.  In the course of his statement to-day, he said: &ldquo;Is the Minister further aware that, on that night, 40 persons were injured as a result of blows from batons?  Now, that is the number given to me at Jervis Street Hospital.&rdquo;  I do not know which of the reports the Deputy accepts because he himself quoted that one paper said 20 people were injured&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that another said 40 and that another paper said 70 were injured.  That gives one some idea of the accuracy of the newspaper reports.  What I want to make clear is that when the senior officer of the Garda Síochána made inquiries at the hospital in question, he was informed that information in respect to the treatment of patients is confidential and that, therefore, it would not be given.  I do not know from whom Deputy Sherwin got his information. It is quite possible that he got it from some minor official.  He certainly did not get it from the Registrar, who is the person who refused to give it to the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>It may be true that 40 persons were injured, that 40 persons were treated in the hospital, but they were not treated for wounds caused by batons.  I want to impress that on the Deputy.  In the particular disturbance that took place and which, as the report in the newspaper stated, was caused by students but was taken up later by teddy boys and carried on, whatever injuries were caused to bystanders were caused because of missiles which were used by these scoundrels who were organising this riot and who tried to cash in on what may have been the innocent actions of students who were facing their holidays.</P>

      <P>Is it not a peculiar situation that not a single complaint has reached the Department of Justice with reference to any damage that was caused to any property in the street on that occasion?  Therefore, I am going to suggest that whatever disturbances took place on O'Connell Street on that occasion took place in the centre of the roadway where these people were gathered and that the innocent bystanders who were walking on the paths were competely and entirely out of the disturbance and, therefore, were not caused any injury whatever.  Whatever injuries were inflicted on any persons were inflicted in the course of the fracas that took place in the middle of the roadway.</P>
      <P>The Deputy not only implied in his question that Gardaí batoned the people but has repeated it on a number of occasions in the course of his speech now, that the Gardaí alone were responsible for these injuries.  I want to refute that.  I want to say that a number of Guards were injured. Surely the Guards did not injure themselves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>They were injured in the course of their efforts to restore peace arising out of a disturbance in the street.  The Guards are a disciplined body of men who, when they are brought out in a section or group, <Col N="377" /> are under the strictest possible discipline, and the Garda authorities have assured me that the officer in charge of the section in O'Connell Street on that occasion did not have to have recourse to instructing these men to draw their batons and that they did not in actual fact at any period draw their batons.</P>
      <P>I said in the course of my reply to the Deputy today that certain individual Gardaí, when they found themselves isolated and attacked by these individuals, may have defended themselves with their batons, but we have not got any proof of that.  In other words, we have not got any report from any Garda that he had to do that, and it is to be assumed that, even in that case, they did not draw their batons.  What they may have done, and what I certainly would commend them for doing, was to use their fists to defend themselves and to clear these people off the street.</P>
      <P>Is it not an extraordinary situation that not a solitary complaint has been made to me in respect to anybody who was injured in the disturbance?  If some innocent person were injured, I am pretty certain that that person would have had my attention drawn to the fact.  I have had no complaint of any single kind from any such individual and I must assume, therefore, that no innocent bystanders were injured, as suggested by Deputy Sherwin.</P>
      <P>I repeat that the Deputy has grossly exaggerated a statement which he saw in the Press.  He was not in O'Connell Street and neither was I.  He is accepting reports which he read in the newspapers. I am accepting an official report written by a responsible officer, submitted to the Commissioner and submitted to me by the Commissioner. Is the Deputy suggesting that the papers are right and that the police authorities are wrong?</P>

      <P>That is a still further charge against the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána are an organisation designed to preserve the peace and that is what they were trying to do on this occasion.  The Deputy tries to suggest that because there was no arrest, there was something sinister.  The reason there were no arrests was the season of the year and I may add that no Garda brought any injured person to the hospital, as suggested by the Deputy.  I am not aware that any person was treated in the hospital for injuries caused by batons.  They may have been injured by actions of the Gardaí in defending themselves by the use of their fists.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy from my own experience of the training the Guards receive for their own defence that they were capable of defending themselves against the gentlemen with whom they were dealing and I am well aware that these gentlemen will get the worst of it.  When the ordinary citizen is attacked and beaten up with belts and buckles, he cannot defend himself but the Guard is trained to deal with such matters.</P>
      <P>I regret that a Deputy should take up the stand Deputy Sherwin has taken.  He has the right, and so has every other citizen, to criticise the Guards, if they deserve it, but to criticise them in the manner in which the Deputy has criticised them is doing something wrong.</P>
