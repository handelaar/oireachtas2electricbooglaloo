      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order, Nos. 1, 11, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16. Questions will be taken at 3 p.m.  I should mention for the information of the House that the Second Stage of the Rent Restrictions (No. 2) Bill will be taken next week.  The Government have agreed to the request of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to make all the time on Thursday next available for Private Members' Business.</P>

Personally, on the Order of Business, I am not in agreement with that and I maintain that the recommendation as such was not made known to Deputies.  I do not know what it is except that the Taoiseach tells us that there is some recommendation that all the time on Thursday will be made available for Private Members' time.

      <P>I must point out that the main business of the Dáil is to legislate and not to debate motions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the proposal submitted by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is regarded as an interim measure dealing with the existing accumulations of motions and that the Committee has announced its intention of turning its mind forthwith to the question of dealing with the future disposal of Private Members' Business?  The Thursday proposal is an interim measure dealing with the accumulation and the Committee propose to make further recommendations generally concerned with the question of Private Deputies' time in the light of our practice in this session of sitting on only two days per week.  Is that not so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate what I said on the Second Stage, that the solicitors' profession are undertaking a very substantial burden in the contribution they are now going to make to the Compensation Fund. It will be something appreciable in terms of money; whether it is a big office or a small office it will be substantial. Proposals have been made to the Parliamentary Secretary, as he is aware, and I appreciate his approach to those proposals on the Second Stage.  I want to reinforce, however, what I said already in the most categoric manner, that it is up to the Parliamentary Secretary, the Department of Justice and to the other Ministers concerned to see that because of the liability that is being undertaken in this Bill the most sympathetic approach is made towards those proposals to cut solicitor's costs in other ways.  There must be no mere idea that because a thing has been done for years in a particular way a change is unnecessary.  Changes to offset the additional administrative costs that are proposed in this Bill are essential and it is essential that the Parliamentary Secretary should see that the Government give to all officers, be they court officers or officers of other Departments, specific instructions that they are to lean over backwards in an attempt to find administrative savings as a means of offsetting the additional costs undertaken in connection with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Parliamentary <Col N="528" /> Secretary concludes, I want to say that there still seems to remain in respect of this Bill a residue of anxiety as to whether it fully meets the requirements of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  We all know that this is not the first Solicitors Bill.  The first Solicitors Act foundered on a constitutional issue raised in the course of disciplinary proceedings.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be most unfortunate if a similar situation arose in connection with this Bill when it becomes an Act.  I do not think the same unfortunate consequences would tend to follow from an adverse decision of the Supreme Court, if such were forthcoming, if the President were advised to exercise the constitutional prerogative of referring the Bill to the Supreme Court before giving it final legislative effect by his signature.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should ask the Minister and the Government to consider the desirability of that course so that we could be reasonably sure when the Bill is finally enacted that the President's signature could be regarded as definitive and effective and would put an end finally and authoritatively to the dilemma in which the profession at present finds itself in being unable to enforce the disciplinary measures which the profession itself considers necessary for its proper regulation.</P>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Sweetman has said in regard to the Fund which the profession is undertaking to establish for the protection of any persons who may suffer loss as a result of default on the part of a member of the profession.  They are undertaking a substantial burden and I think they are entitled to the appreciation and congratulation of the Oireachtas in assuming that burden for the protection of the people whose funds are entrusted to the care of members of the profession.  It would not be right to pay that tribute without calling to mind that the profession requires to be made to provide against the contingency of a microscopic fraction of the whole profession proving unworthy of trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> It is right to recall that if an individual member of the profession should default, there is much talk and comment about it whereas the day-to-day work of hundreds of members of the profession which proceeds for the protection of their clients is never commented upon and, indeed, is little known by the public at large, but it is desirable to put in correct perspective the necessity for this Fund on an occasion of this kind.  It is provided by the vast majority of an honourable profession to provide against the default of the very few who prove unfaithful to their trust.  I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary, in concluding, would refer to the constitutional consideration to which I have directed his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that I am very conscious indeed, and, in the course of the negotiations which have taken place as a background to this Bill, I have been aware at all times of the responsible manner in which the solicitors' profession are facing up to their responsibilities in taking on themselves the fairly onerous obligations which this Bill imposes upon them.  I think it redounds very much to the credit of solicitors and very much to the honour of the profession, that, as the Leader of the Opposition has put it, in order to make good the harm done by a small minority of the profession, the majority is prepared to take on this obligation. I have great confidence that the spirit the Council have shown in the negotiations and discussions to date will do much in cleaning up the profession in the interests of solicitors themselves as well as of the general public.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated on the Second Stage, if we in the Department of Justice can do anything to help the solicitors in the administration of their offices, and in their work from day to day, we shall do so.  I give the House the assurance that any suggestions of that nature which are put to us will receive most careful consideration, and, if we can help in any way, within the means at our disposal, we shall be very glad to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the constitutional issue, I should like to repeat that we <Col N="530" /> have done all we can to ensure that this Bill is constitutional.  May I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the matter which he is now raising on Section 12 is, I think, something separate and distinct from the point in issue in the Supreme Court decision on the 1954 Act?  We have done all we can to ensure that the Bill's provisions are constitutional and we and our advisers are satisfied that they are constitutional.  In those circumstances, we do not accept that it is up to us to have this Bill, as the Leader of the Opposition suggests, referred to the Supreme Court.  It can be referred in a certain way if that is wanted, but we do not intend to take any step.  We are as satisfied as we can be that the Bill is constitutional and, in those circumstances, I think it would be wrong for us to adopt the procedure which the Leader of the Opposition suggests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary is he satisfied that the vast majority of the profession have had prior knowledge of the proposals contained in this Bill which is now about to become law?  Is it a fact that only the <i>élite</i> or the alleged <i>élite</i> of the profesion, were brought into the consultations on this matter, and that the vast majority of solicitors were not aware of them and had no opportunity of making themselves familiar with the terms of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could make a very short answer to that by using a word like &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;.  I prefer to say this: the solicitors' profession is a very well organised one.  Vocationally speaking it is probably the best organised profession we have in the country.  The Council of the Law Society is democratically elected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not entitled to go outside the Council of the Law Society.  I have dealt with the Council, and I am satisfied that in doing so I was dealing with those who <Col N="531" /> represent and reflect the wishes of the profession.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the terms of Section 9 followed generally the general power provided under the State Guarantees Act.  I then asked him why did we repeal Section 8, Ref. No. 4 of the Schedule, of the State Guarantees Act and then re-enact in Section 9 of this Bill what the Minister tells me is substantially the general power he had in the State Guarantees Act.  Are we adding anything to the general power in respect of this special company or why have we taken the precaution of providing <i>ad hoc</i> powers under Section 9 for Irish Steel Holdings Limited, instead of using the general power the Minister <Col N="534" /> had under the State Guarantees Act of 1954?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder is that a desirable thing to do?  If every private enterprise company is required to pay stamp duty, and all these ordinary charges which normally attach to business activity, is it fair to continue to levy these on firms operated by private enterprise and exempt State companies?  It seems to me seriously to distort the relative advantage as between private enterprise and State enterprise. I readily concede that the abolition of stamp duty where this company is concerned, inasmuch as it is wholly owned by the Treasury and the Government, is really a bookkeeping transaction; but, for the purpose of maintaining a fair comparison between private and public enterprise, it does not seem just that the publicly-owned company should be exempt from these taxes while the privately-owned company continues to pay them.</P>

      <P>On this, I take the opportunity to make a slight criticism. I suggest that where a Bill is circulated which says&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.&mdash;The section set out in Part I of the First Schedule to this Act is hereby substituted for section 34 of the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1931.</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;The section set out in Part II of the First Schedule to this Act is hereby substituted for section 36 of the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1931.</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;Each enactment mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act is hereby repealed to the extent specified in the third column of that Schedule.</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;(1)  This Act may be cited as the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1960.</P>
      <P>it would not be unreasonable, I think, for the Department concerned to set out what we are deleting.  This Bill is not a particularly bad example of that about which I complain because, in fact, you have simply to look at the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1951, and it is all there; and I do not think it would have been a wholly unreasonable burden in this instance to ask people to go back and get just one Act of Parliament and check with it. It does, however, make consideration of these Bills a good deal more onerous if you have to root out ancient statutes to find exactly what the substitution is. A short White Paper setting out the sections proposed to be deleted in conjunction with a Bill setting out the sections proposed to be substituted makes for intelligent consideration and makes that intelligent consideration much easier for all members of Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <P>I freely concede that I have at my disposal, as a result of arrangements which were made in the last Finance Act, resources which enable me to get this information.  It is also true that I can communicate that information to my colleagues who are interested in the Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would direct the Minister's attention to subsection (5) of the new Section 34 which sets out that the decision of the High Court on an application under this section shall be final.  This raises exactly the same problem as was raised in connection with the solicitors' profession.  I do not say that Section 12 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill refers exactly to the same issue as was raised in the Supreme Court in regard to the old Solicitors Act which has been declared unconstitutional, but it was in the background of that constitutional litigation that the new Solicitors (Amendment) Bill we have just passed was drafted.</P>
      <P>If the Minister will look at Section 12 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill he will there see that in that section. which is described as a section to deal with finality of orders of the High Court, subsection (1) sets out:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to subsection (2) of this <Col N="538" /> section, an order of the High Court under section 8 of this Act, under that section as applied by section 11 of this Act or under section 9 or section 10 of this Act shall be final and not appealable.</P>
    <P>That is substantially the effect of subsection (5) of the new Section 34 which it is proposed to insert in the Veterinary Surgeons Bill.  But, in the Veterinary Surgeons Bill, we stop there.  We simply say that the decision of the High Court on an application of this section shall be final.  The Solicitors (Amendment) Bill does not stop there.</P>
    <P>After subsection (1) of Section 12 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, subsection (2) provides:</P>
    <P>By leave of the High Court, an appeal, by the Society or the solicitor concerned, from an order of the High Court under section 8 of this Act, under that section as applied by section 11 of this Act or under section 9 or section 10 of this Act shall lie to the Supreme Court on a specified question of law.</P>
    <P>I doubt, and I have already expressed my doubt here, whether that is a sufficient protection of the constitutional right of a citizen to access to the Supreme Court.  I do not know what views the Supreme Court will take of it but at least it is an attempt to reserve that constitutional right in the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>If any veterinary surgeon comes into collision with the new Section 34 which we propose to insert and seeks in the Supreme Court, on constitutional grounds, a right to appeal from a decision of the High Court on an application under Section 34 of the Bill, he will succeed.  If he succeeds his success will have the effect of having the Veterinary Surgeons Bill, as enacted by us here, declared unconstitutional, with all the consequential annoyance which that action precipitated in connection with the Solicitors Act.</P>
    <P>It has, however, this additional possibility. In regard to the Solicitors Act we were dealing with a purely domestic issue, all parties to which fully understood the constitutional implications and difficulties that our <Col N="539" /> domestic set-up involves.  In this Veterinary Surgeons Act, we are dealing with the situation where we have close reciprocal relations with the profession in Great Britain.  In Great Britain they have no written constitution and the question of a conflict between legislation and the written constitution does not there arise.  It is very important that we here in Ireland should be satisfied that the veterinary profession in Great Britain maintains the same standards that we enforce for our profession here.  It is equally important that the veterinary profession in Great Britain should be satisfied that we maintain in Ireland the same high standards that they maintain in Great Britain.  It would be most unfortunate if misapprehension were created in Great Britain when the governing body of the profession here sought to enforce disciplinary measures against a member of the profession under this Bill, when enacted, because the Act broke down in the process of enforcement.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest that this Bill should be referred to the Supreme Court for review before it is finally enacted so that the possibility I envisage can be effectively avoided. There is no violent urgency about this Bill provided it is in the process of enactment.  It would be most unfortunate if it broke down in operation.  I recommend to the Minister the cautionary step of having its constitutionality tested before its actual use in the maintenance of ethical standards in the veterinary profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In consultation with the legal advisers of the Government, I have considered all that was said during the Second Reading on this measure and this particular provision. On coming here on the occasion of the Second Reading debate I was convinced as a layman, and I think I stated so here, that, in the first place, the machinery that was being provided for here sounded very fair.  That would not be enough, I admit, because it would have to answer the other requirements to which Deputy Dillon has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> I think I said also that, since the Bill was one designed solely to meet and to rectify the position that had arisen as a result of a Supreme Court decision, there could not have been any doubt in the minds of those who were responsible for designing the new machinery as to what was expected. It was a constitutional question.  That was what they had on their table and this is what they gave us to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>I therefore felt convinced that we were safe enough.  I was equally anxious that what we were, in fact, providing would be adequate to the case because I appreciate, as does the Deputy who has spoken, that it would be very undesirable that there should be any doubt in so far as the human mind and ingenuity could guard against doubt.</P>
    <P>Since the discussion in the House on Second Reading, I have had talks with the legal advisers of the Government on this matter.  During the course of these discussions I took the line that the Deputy here has taken in order that they would see all the pitfalls as far as I could see them.  The general attitude was that they were satisfied that the provision in Section 34 was adequate and safe but at the same time they indicated to me that if I had any special desire to bring this measure into line with the Bill dealing with the solicitors' profession they would have no objection to my taking that course. They knew and I know and, as the Deputy has stated, we all know that the two professions and the two situations are different but, on the other hand, the rights of individuals, no matter to what profession they belong, should be the same.  If there is any desire on the part of any member of the House to have this Bill brought into line with the Bill which has just passed dealing with the solicitors' profession I have here&mdash;it has not been circulated&mdash;the form the amendments should take so as to bring about that situation.  If there is a desire that I should do that, that is all right with me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has stated that there is not any great urgency about this <Col N="541" /> matter.  I do not agree that that is the case.  If I were sure it was unnecessary, I should not like the idea of prolonging the investigations.  Deputy Dillon has referred to the reciprocal arrangements.  I do not like adding to this measure a provision that could possibly prolong the investigations before the profession here could deal with an alleged offender.  However, if it is thought that it might be the best course, I have no objection to taking it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On that amendment, I want merely to record a measure of agreement and I think of disagreement between us and the Minister.  The Minister and we are agreed that it is desirable on the whole to take the precaution of making the Veterinary Surgeons Bill march with the Solicitors Bill, on the purely constitutional aspect of this question.  There is another aspect of the question to which the Minister referred and that is his personal reluctance to see any protraction of proceedings in a disciplinary matter. I want to record my disagreement with the Minister's view there.  When a disciplinary body of a profession like this or the solicitors' profession or any other professional body is striking a man's name off the register we in the Oireachtas should not underestimate <Col N="543" /> the gravity of that decision on the individual.</P>
      <P>Although that individual may be obscure and insignificant for him it can mean the end of his career and the destruction of his standing in the society to which he belongs.  We would be mistaken in this House in saying that his deep concern in such a situation is to be disregarded in order to secure a higher degree of expedition in disposing of the matter.  If you propose to wipe out a man professionally, destroy his standing in the community to which he belongs and alter his whole situation in life, no matter who he is he is entitled to the protection of all the institutions of this State which are ordinarily set up to protect the individual against the Executive or any other authority arrayed against him.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in principle, I welcome the decision we have taken here now not only on the constitutional grounds which are agreed between us and the Minister but on the sound philosophical principle that the right of the humblest citizen of this State to invoke the protection of the highest court in the land to defend his modest interests against the authority of his profession or of the State itself is something this House should always be solicitous to vindicate and to reinforce.  The fact that in this case we have restored to the most insignificant member of the veterinary profession his right to invoke the full majesty of the Supreme Court to protect him against what he may think is an injustice, however mistaken he may be, establishes in my opinion a good precedent.  Over and above the protection it provides for the individual members of this profession what we have done this morning will entitle us hereafter to ask: since we have vindicated this right in the Veterinary Surgeons Bill, is it not worth doing it in any other similar Bill that is ever brought before us?  For that additional reason, I rejoice in these five amendments that have been adopted by the House.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill provides statutory authority for the increases in civil pensions payable from the Exchequer or other public funds, including the funds of local and harbour authorities, which I announced in the Budget last April.  The Bill was introduced in this House on the 28th June, 1960, and under the authority of an Additional Estimate for £127,000 which was passed on the 19th July, payment of pensions increases has already commenced in most cases.  This Bill covers civil pensions only; separate legislation is being enacted to cover similar increases in Army Retired Pay, Disability Pensions and Special Allowances and Military Service Pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's pensions increases extend to all pensioners who retired before the general pay increases of 1st November, 1955, or whose pensions were calculated <Col N="545" /> in whole or in part on the salaries payable before that date.  In some cases, although retirement took place after the 1st November, 1955, pension was calculated on average salary over a period which fell partly before and partly after 1st November, 1955.  Special provision has been made in Section 7 of the Bill to allow a proportionate pension increase in such cases.  A pension calculated on average salary can accordingly be increased even though retirement took place as late as 1958.</P>
    <P>The increases under this Bill, like those granted last year, are weighted in favour of those pensioners who are longest retired and whose pensions are lowest in relation to current levels. Pensions calculated on the salaries in force prior to the general pay increase of 1st November, 1948, are being increased by 7½ per cent. while pensions calculated on the salaries payable during the period between 1st November, 1948, and 1st November, 1955, are being increased by 5 per cent.  A proportionate increase is provided under Section 7 of the Bill for pensions calculated on average salary over a period which fell partly before and partly after 1st November, 1948.</P>
    <P>As explained in the White Paper circulated with the text of the Bill, in any case where pay increases corresponding to the Civil Service pay increases of 1st November, 1948, and 1st November, 1955, were granted on other dates, eligibility for the 7½ per cent. or the 5 per cent. increase will be determined by the actual date of the pay increase.</P>
    <P>The Bill follows generally the lines of the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1959, and its provisions have been explained in detail in the White Paper already circulated.  There is, however, one change which I think will appeal to Deputies; the provision restricting pensions increases within the limits of an overriding maximum, which was a feature of previous Bills, does not appear in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer pensions which are increasable under Sections 3, 4 and 7 of the Bill are listed in Parts I and II of the Schedule to the Bill.  The fixed <Col N="546" /> pensions payable to widows and children which are specified in Part II of the Schedule are increased by 7½ per cent. or 5 per cent. according as the basic rates were fixed before or after 1st November, 1948.  Increases in these fixed rates will apply to future grants as well as to pensions currently in course of payment.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 empower local authorities and harbour authorities to grant increases in the pensions payable by them which are specified in Part III and Part IV of the Schedule. The increases will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Health in the case of local authority pensions and to the approval of the Minister for Transport and Power in the case of harbour authority pensions.  The increases allowed will be similar in amount and will be generally subject to the conditions and limitations governing increases in Exchequer pensions.</P>
    <P>Under Section 8, increases are payable from 1st August, 1960, or the date of commencement of pension, if later.</P>
    <P>Section 10 contains various consequential provisions, in particular, for the application to the pension, as increased, of any statutory provisions as to payment, etc., applicable to the original pension.  It also provides that any increase in the Bill shall not be assessed as means for the purpose of an Old Age Pension or a widow's noncontributory pension.</P>
    <P>The cost of the Bill to the Exchequer is estimated at £118,000 in a full year, including recoupment of part of the increases payable by local authorities. About 7,620 Exchequer pensioners will benefit under the Bill.  Of these, about 3,880 will receive a 7½ per cent increase and about 3,740 a 5 per cent increase.  The main categories of pensioners are:</P>
    <P>2,089 Civil Service pensioners: estimated cost, £40,300 in a full year; 2,705 national teachers: estimated cost, £37,000; 2,440 Garda pensioners and widows: estimated cost, £24,100; 386 R.I.C. pensioners and miscellaneous: estimated cost, £4,500.</P>
    <P>This makes a total of 7,620 pensioners <Col N="547" /> at an estimated cost of £105,900.  Recoupments to local authorities are estimated to cost a further £12,100 to bring the total to £118,000.  In addition to these Exchequer payments, it is also estimated that local authorities will expend about £15,000 in a full year out of their own funds on pensions increases.</P>
    <P>The cost of the Bill in the current year will be about £72,000, and the balance of the £127,000 voted by this House in July last will be required for increases in Army pensions, Retired Pay, Military Service pensions and Special Allowances, which will be covered by separate legislation.  Including the increases in these pensions and allowances, the total cost to the Exchequer of the 1960 pensions increases is estimated at approximately £212,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be general agreement in favour of the proposals but I regret that the Minister has not found it possible to do more for the various categories of State pensioners. Everyone is familiar with the circumstances in which pensioners become entitled to pensions.  Pensions are regarded as part of the remuneration earned by State employees whether they are civil servants, Gardaí, Army personnel, teachers or employees of the local authorities and that portion of the pension is deferred pay which is retained for the pensioner on his or her retirement.</P>
      <P>While this is so, in almost every case the actual increase in the payment of the pensions has been delayed for a certain length of time after the pensioner retires.  This applied particularly in the case of pensioners who have retired for a number of years. The increase proposed in this Bill will, to some extent, compensate those pensioners who retired earlier and is on a graduated basis applying a 7½ per cent. increase in some cases and 5 per cent. in others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is generally recognised that these increases are not only justified <Col N="548" /> on the basis of the increase in the cost of living which has taken place since pensioners retired but that in actual fact there is a time lag in every case and, as I say, particularly in the case of those pensioners who retired earlier in the payment of an increase.  Persons who still serve or who have served up to recently either in the Civil Service, the Army, the Garda or in the services of the local authorities secured the various increases in salaries and wages which were granted on the basis of the rise that had occurred in the cost of living but, in the case of pensioners, the rise took place and the increase in pension was not paid until long after the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>It seems, therefore, that there should be some automatic adjustment in the case of pensioners to compensate persons for the increase in the cost of living.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that consideration should be given to this question.  Some private companies give more or less automatic adjustments in the case of pensions and the Civil Service Arbitration and Concilation machinery provides increases for serving officers.  So far as I am aware, the various public bodies have a similar procedure but in the case of retired pensioners the only increases that are granted are those under the various pension increase Acts&mdash;the first one, I think, in 1949 or 1950 and another one in 1956 and the Pensions (Increased) Act last year as well as this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think it is generally recognised that pensioners are adversely affected in two ways.  In the first place their pensions have been calculated on the basis of salary or wages at the date of retirement and if the cost of living rises, as it has invariably risen since the war years, they find that for a period they are existing on a pension fixed on the basis of a lower cost of living, while those who continue in the service of the State or that of the local authorities invariably have an adjustment made quickly and the person who has retired finds he or she has to exist for a period on a pension fixed on the basis of a lower salary or wage.  A period of time elapses and then the increases <Col N="549" /> that have been mentioned are granted, so that, in actual fact, these old retired pensioners in most cases have never been fully compensated for the rise in the cost of living because of the time-lag involved.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister should sympathetically consider the question of having some machinery put into operation which will enable a revision to take place similar to that which applies in the case of existing State servants, either through arbitration and conciliation machinery or the procedure adopted in the case of teachers and of serving personnel in the Army and Garda.  As I say, this proposal is welcomed in so far as it provides an increase for pensioners, graduated according to the date of retirement, but there is the point that there is a time-lag that has continued over the years between the date of retirement and the date of increase in pension.  I suppose it is true to say that in some cases pensioners have died without receiving any increase.</P>
    <P>In almost every case, payment of pension will be for a comparatively short spell.  Indeed, I think an estimate has been made of the number of years in each individual case and it works out at something less than ten years. For that reason, I feel there is a very strong case and that, in equity, these retired pensioners are entitled to have pension increases granted in the same way as increases are granted in wages and salaries to serving personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the only point raised by Deputy Cosgrave was that he would like to see pensioners fully compensated for the increase in the cost of living.  I can understand anyone holding that view but it would be a very difficult and onerous task for any Government to undertake.  As a matter of fact, I think I can say that no Government has accepted the principle that pensioners should be fully compensated. Indeed, it is even a novel idea to give these increases because I believe increases to pensioners were unknown until after the last war, so that at least we have done something that was not done before.  With the limited amount of funds at our disposal&mdash;and this, of course, applies to <Col N="550" /> all Ministers for Finance&mdash;we have tried to do better for the more lowly-paid pensioners than for the higher paid pensioners.</P>
      <P>There has been a higher percentage given under former Acts to lowly-paid pensioners and, for example, if one takes the case of a civil servant who retired on a fairly low salary back in the 1940's, I think it will be found that the percentage added to his retiring allowance is substantially more than the percentage given to a person with a higher pension.  I feel the best we can do at present is to try to keep some sort of relationship, if you like, between the lower pensions and the increased cost of living but I am afraid we cannot fully compensate pensioners.  All we can do is to try to lessen their hardship to the greatest extent possible within the limits of our resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 24, to delete &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As it stands, the section says there shall be reliefs given in respect of farm buildings, outoffices and other buildings which are begun and completed in the period of three years ending on 31st day of March, 1963, and my reason for moving the amendment is as stated by Deputy Dillon on Second Reading.  During the war years, we in this country were prohibited from using essential materials on the building of outoffices, barns, stables and cowsheds, owing to the scarcity of these commodities.  None of the requisite materials was available for buildings such as these, but, from 1947 or 1948, onwards, there was a drive to improve farm buildings when the essential materials again became available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> In or about that time, we had a trade agreement with Great Britain which gave a certain amount of impetus to the agricultural industry, particularly to beef and livestock generally.  Farmers took advantage of the availability of building materials to improve their farm buildings.  They were exhorted to do so by various Ministers for Agriculture and grants were made available to them.  We had the drive for the pasteurisation of milk and farm buildings were improved. Now for the past few years, there has been a drive for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and farmers have done a considerable amount of improvement.  This section as it stands will give relief only to those who build their farm buildings within the three years ending 31st March, 1963. In other words, any person who built before 31st March last will get no relief whatever but any person who built or builds between 31st March last and 31st March, 1963, will get certain reliefs from taxation.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Dillon, the Minister said he could not see his way to go back to give relief to those who carried out those improvements in the past.  He said a date had to be fixed. The reason we asked him to fix 1948 is that on that date building material became available.  It is unfair to penalise those farmers who pioneered these schemes.  At the same time as we are victimising the people who showed initiative in the building of these various outoffices, we are giving relief to laggards, those who hung back and did nothing to improve their farmyards until this incentive was given to them under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think that would be very unfair. When Deputy Dillon suggested 1949, the Minister said to him: &ldquo;Why not make it 1939?&rdquo;  Of course, if it were made 1939, the 20 years would have elapsed in most cases.  In any event, there was no building between 1939 and 1948.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment and give relief to those farmers who were the pioneers in farm building improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the Deputy's view on this matter and also that he has gone to the trouble of putting in this amendment, nevertheless, I do not think we should take this matter out of its proper perspective. The relief of rates in this Bill has the fundamental purpose of encouraging building and it is not a question of penalising or victimising anybody, as has been suggested, because of not going back to 1948.  We look upon this Bill as an encouragement, as an incentive rather than a pay-off for something already done.  It is true that if we went back to 1939, which seems to be as reasonable as 1949, the 20 years now proposed would already have expired, but those who built before 1948, the date now suggested by Deputy O'Donnell, would naturally have as good a case for a refund of rates as those who built in 1949 and onwards would have to get this retrospective legislation passed in their favour.</P>
      <P>It has been said that this relief will be for the benefit of the laggards who did not build during the past 10 years, but there might be other reasons for their not building.  It could well be that they might not have been in a position to build during those years or might not have foreseen that, if they had built, they would be in a position to pay the additional rates which would fall due after the seven years' remission which has been operating for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, we have the situation arising from the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.  As this scheme develops throughout the country, many farmers will find themselves in the position&mdash;indeed, some of them are already in the position&mdash;that in relation to full clearance status, the buildings in which they house their stock, particularly their milking stock, are no longer regarded as suitable.  In fact, in order to meet the requirements of the law and eradicate the disease, they may find themselves in the position that they must build, whether they like it or not.  Today, on that basis, there is a <Col N="553" /> very much better case for a greater rates remission to encourage building because now people may find them selves having to build, whereas in the past they were not so compelled.</P>
    <P>In addition, though many people built in the past when exhorted to do so by various Ministers, they would not have done so if their own circumstances and the circumstances of the time had not allowed them. Further, over the years since they erected these new buildings, they have had the advantage of them.  In addition to the seven years' remission of rates, they have had the big advantage of improved buildings in order to carry on their business better and to look after their stock in a more satisfactory manner.  Let me repeat that this is a matter of encouraging to build.  It refers not only to farm buildings; the whole idea of rates remission is to engender more building of houses, factories and hotels, as well as farm buildings.</P>
    <P>The farmers' associations made the case to previous Ministers, including Deputy O'Donnell, that the burden of rates should be eased on farm holdings. Nothing was done as a result of those efforts.  However, on this occasion when the farmers' organisations came to seek relief of rates, they made a proposal that there should be a rates remission for the future on new buildings for a period of 25 years.  In this Bill, I am proposing to give 80 per cent. of what they have asked&mdash; in other words, 20 years' remission of rates.  It was the first time a proposal was made in that form and we have gone a very long way towards meeting them.</P>
    <P>Further to that, they made the case to various Ministers that there should be a relief of rates.  This is a relief as far as new buildings are concerned. It not only meets their case almost fully but should prove a decided incentive towards the building of improved farm buildings during the next three years.  It is for that reason, that basically this is an encouragement and not a question of a pay-off for something already done, that the matter takes the form it does, a form <Col N="554" /> in which I would propose to the House it should remain.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to continue in being the present Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests in Ireland, to consolidate and amend the various statutes relating to the Commissioners, and to make certain changes in the law of charities.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I think I should pay tribute to the Commissioners for the excellent work they have done and continue to do.  They are an unpaid body who devote an amount of their time to what are very important functions in the life of the community.  As at present constituted, they date back to an enactment of 1844, and, in the years since then, they have an outstanding record of public duty and devotion to the obligations imposed on them.  They are drawn from men of different religious persuasions and their tasks are sometimes of a delicate nature.  Nevertheless, they have always worked amicably together, and they are proof, if proof is needed, that Irishmen, Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter, have no difficulty in successfully combining for the good of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with the provisions of this Bill, I should like to say something of its historical background.  In October, 1952, and following on a resolution <Col N="555" /> passed by the Commissioners, a committee was set up by the Minister for Justice &ldquo;to consider the question of the consolidation of the statute law in relation to charitable donations and bequests in Ireland and to make recommendations&rdquo; to him.  The committee consisted of the late Mr. W.E. Glover, former Registrar of Titles and a former Chairman of the Commissioners, Mr. G.F. McCarthy, B.L., formerly Director of the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office and Mr. P.P. O'Donoghue, S.C., former Principal Legal Assistant to the Attorney General, with Mr. J.S. Martin, Solicitor, Secretary to the Commissioners, as secretary.  Messrs. McCarthy and O'Donoghue are Commissioners. The Committee reported in May, 1953, recommending certain changes in the law and also submitting the draft of a consolidation Bill.  The report of the committee was forwarded to the Commissioners for their views. They suggested a number of additional changes in the existing law and, in particular, they were of opinion that the existing statutory provision, providing that a gift of land for charitable purposes is ineffective if made within three months of the donor's death, should not be re-enacted until the advisability of so doing had received the most careful consideration.</P>
    <P>In December, 1954, the then Government authorised the Minister for Justice:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  to have a Bill drafted to provide for</P>
    <P>(a)  the substitution, for the existing common law concept of a charity, of a more satisfactory definition and</P>
    <P>(b)  the consolidation of the statute law in relation to charities; and</P>
    <P>(2)  to move for leave to introduce the Bill in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Charities Bill, 1954, was accordingly introduced in Dáil Éireann and a Bill was prepared incorporating a definition of charitable purposes.  In the meantime, the Charitable Donations and Bequests (Amendment) Act, <Col N="556" /> 1955, was enacted in July, 1955.  This Act provided for a substantial increase in the <i>cy-près</i> powers of the Commissioners, and allowed them to deal cheaply and expeditiously with a number of cases which might otherwise have involved the legal costs of applications to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;charitable purposes&rdquo; in the 1954 Bill met with strong opposition.  It was pointed out that, as the definition would exclude from rates a number of hitherto rateable properties, the effect on ordinary ratepayers would be serious.  &ldquo;Charitable purposes&rdquo; has a more restricted meaning in valuation and rating law than it has in income tax and estate duty law.  On the revenue side, objection was taken to certain aspects of the definition and also to an amended definition that would not apply for rating purposes.</P>
    <P>In view of the difficulties of obtaining a definition more or less acceptable to the various interests involved, the present Government were satisfied that it would be better to drop the idea of a definition in the present Bill.  In arriving at this conclusion, the Government took into account the fact that it is obviously preferable to have no definition of a charity rather than a restricted one.  Moreover they felt that a better line of approach would be to amend the law so as to get rid of certain existing anomalies concerned with what is and what is not a charity.  A committee on charities in the Six Counties&mdash;the Newark Committee&mdash; which reported in 1959, found themselves &ldquo;unable to recommend any major change in the legal conception of charity.&rdquo;  In England, in a Government White Paper issued in 1955 consequent on the Nathan Report on Charitable Trusts (1952) it is stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.  Therefore, the choice is between leaving things as they are and adopting a new definition which is different in substance.  The Government agree with the Committee that there is no reason to change the present content of charity and therefore they do not propose that a fresh statutory definition should be enacted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> One of the problems, which it was hoped in 1954 that a definition of &ldquo;charitable purposes&rdquo; could clear up, was that contemplative Orders might possibly be held not to be charitable because of the decision of the British House of Lords in 1949&mdash;<i>Gilmour v. Coats</i>&mdash;that the Order of Discalced Carmelite Nuns was not charitable. The late Judge Dixon refused to follow this decision in a case decided in the High Court in 1956 in regard to the same order in Ireland, holding that a bequest to the Carmelite Convent, Blackrock, Dublin, was a good charitable bequest.  The late Judge Gavan Duffy had already held in 1943 that the Order of Marie Reparatrice, generally called the Order of Perpetual Adoration, was charitable.  It is unlikely that <i>Gilmour v. Coats</i> would be followed by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I can, of course, only express my own view on this; but I must say that I find it hard to imagine that the reasoning in that case, that contemplative Orders do not confer any public benefit, could be accepted ultimately in this country as sound or valid.  Indeed, as the history of gifts for Masses in each country shows, the law of charitable trusts in Ireland has over the years tended to be different from what it has been in England.</P>
    <P>Where a religious Order has objects, some of which only are charitable, a gift to the Order <i>simpliciter</i> is not charitable, but this difficulty may be overcome by specifying that the gift is &ldquo;for the charitable objects&rdquo; of the particular Order.  In a case reported in the <i>Irish Reports</i> for 1935, a gift &ldquo;for the absolute use of the Jesuit Order in Ireland&rdquo; was held by a majority of the Supreme Court to be a valid non-charitable gift for the benefit of a class, namely, the individual members of the Irish Province of the Order.  Chief Justice Kennedy dissenting, held the gift to be charitable. In 1881, a gift to &ldquo;the Sisters of Mercy at Bantry&rdquo; had been upheld by the former Irish Court of Appeal as a bequest to the individual nuns of the community. Unfortunately, however, bequests continue to be drafted in terms which leave their validity, either as <Col N="558" /> charitable bequests or as ordinary bequests, open to doubt, and we are satisfied that something ought to be done by legislation to cover certain of these cases.</P>
    <P>We cannot, of course, solve every difficulty but it is, I think, necessary to urge people who intend to make bequests to charity to take some care with the form of the bequest.  In fact, it is very, very often the use of elaborate and unnecessary language that leads to unnecessary trouble in the interpretation of the intention of the donor.  Again a testator should be clear in his mind as to whether he intends his bequest to be a charitable bequest or a bequest to a particular person absolutely.  The traps may be avoided if more care is taken in the drafting and particularly the trap of the rule against perpetuities. In Section 45, it is proposed to validate gifts for purposes some of which are charitable and some not.  At present such gifts are usually void for uncertainty.  I shall examine Section 45 later.</P>
    <P>In July, 1957, the Charities Bill, 1957, was introduced in Dáil Éireann. The Bill is in the same form as the draft 1954 Bill, except that it does not contain a definition of charitable purposes and that it incorporates a number of additional amendments in the law which, in the opinion of the Commissioners and of the Government, are extremely desirable.</P>
    <P>I shall now discuss the Bill in some detail.  Part I of the Bill is the preliminary and general part.  Part II proposes to continue in existence the present Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests (the Board), and it consolidates with amendments the relevant provisions of the Charitable Donations and Bequests (Ireland) Act, 1844 (the 1844 Act), the Charitable Donations and Bequests (Ireland) Act, 1867 (the 1867 Act), and the Charitable Donations and Bequests Act (Ireland), 1871 (the 1871 Act). These Acts are the main Acts dealing with the Commissioners and their powers.  As at present, there will be 11 Commissioners, appointed by the Government, but there will be no provision <Col N="559" /> as to their religion.  The jurisdiction and powers of the Board are dealt with in Chapter II.  The following is a summary of their principal powers which it is proposed to continue:</P>
    <P>(1)  Power to dispense with the publication of charitable bequests&mdash;Section 20;</P>
    <P>(2)  Power to advise charity trustees&mdash;Section 21;</P>
    <P>(3)  Power to sue for the recovery of charitable gifts&mdash;Sections 23 and 24;</P>
    <P>(4)  Power to institute legal proceedings and certify cases to the Attorney General with a view to his instituting such proceedings&mdash;Sections 25 and 26;</P>
    <P>(5)  Power to frame <i>cy-près</i> schemes &mdash;Section 29;</P>
    <P>(6)  Power to accept gifts for charitable purposes&mdash;Section 31;</P>
    <P>(7)  Power to sell or exchange charity land&mdash;Section 34; and</P>
    <P>(8)  Power to sell and buy rent charges&mdash;Sections 35 and 36.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the Charitable Donations and Bequests (Amendment) Act, 1955, considerably increased the <i>cy-près</i> powers of the Commissioners.  Prior to that Act, the powers of the Commissioners were limited to cases not exceeding £300 principal or £30 annual sum.  In cases over that amount, application had to be made to the High Court.  The 1955 Act increased the jurisdiction to cover any gift for the time being consisting of:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  personalty up to £2,000,</P>
    <P>(ii)  land up to £60 rateable valuation,</P>
    <P>(iii)  an annual sum up to £100.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Bill will replace the 1955 Act and, as suggested by the Commissioners, it is proposed to give the Board <i>cy-près</i> powers for any gift up to £5,000 in value, the value of land to be reckoned at fifty times the rateable valuation, the value of any rent charge at fifteen times the annual amount thereof, and the value of any ordinary periodical payment at twenty times the annual amount thereof.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> The new provision will allow the Board, first, to revoke an existing <i>cyprès</i> scheme, whether made by the Commissioners or by the court, that is found unlawful or impracticable, and, secondly, to substitute a new <i>cy-près</i> scheme in its place.  I shall give an example of the circumstances in which it is necessary to have a <i>cy-près</i> scheme made.  If, say, a person leaves by will money for the building of a church in a particular district and on his death, it is found that such a church has already been built, the money will be applied <i>cy-près</i> for the repair and upkeep of the church.  The expression <i>cy-près</i> comes from the French, and although its exact original meaning is doubtful, it has now, by professional usage, come to mean &ldquo;as near (as possible)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As well as the existing powers of the Board, Part II of the Bill proposes certain additional powers to which I wish to draw attention.  The sections concerned are Sections 6, 30, 32, 38 and 44.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the Board shall have and be deemed always to have had power to acquire, hold and dispose of land.  The power of the Commissioners in regard to land itself is doubtful, although they are specifically entitled to own a rent-charge. They already hold land which came to them under the 1844 Act from an old Board of Commissioners, established in 1800, which ceased to function in 1844.  By the way, there is an overlap between Section 5 and Section 6 in the matter of holding land, but this can be cured by amendment later.</P>
    <P>Section 30 will allow the Commissioners to alter schemes under the Educational Endowments (Ireland) Act, 1885.  This Act established a Commission of five members who were given wide powers of drafting schemes for the future management of educational endowments.  These schemes were to supersede all existing statutes, trusts, etc., in regard to the endowments.  The power of the Commission to draft schemes expired in 1897, but the 1885 Act, in Section 18, enacted that the Commission might <Col N="561" /> provide for the alteration of a scheme from time to time by the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, upon application by the governing body or any party interested, and I quote: &ldquo;provided such alteration shall not be contrary to anything contained in this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is serious doubt as to the Commissioners' powers to amend these educational endowment schemes.  An example of the type of alteration needed in a scheme is where the governors, owing to lack of pupils, desire permission to dispose of the school premises and apply the endowment moneys towards the grant of scholarships to other schools.</P>
    <P>Section 30 proposes specifically to authorise the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests to make any alterations in a scheme, framed and approved under the 1885 Act, at the request of the responsible person of persons, provided that any alterations so made are in furtherance of education; and any such alterations shall be deemed not to be contrary to anything contained in the 1885 Act. The section makes appropriate provision for the giving of public notice of any proposed alterations other than those of a minor or formal nature.</P>
    <P>Section 32 proposes to allow the Board to invest charity funds under their control in securities not authorised by law or not authorised by the trust instrument, and to permit ordinary charity trustees to do likewise.  At present, under Section 12 of the 1867 Act, where securities are held on trust, after the determination of or subject to a prior life or other limited interest, for charitable purposes, the trustees may, if the Commissioners do not object, vary, alter or transpose the securities; and, if the Commissioners object, the trustees may apply to the High Court to carry out their proposal. The object of Section 12 of the 1867 Act seems to have been to prevent trustees adversely affecting the interests of the life tenant, and this object is now enshrined in Section 33 of the Bill, which will re-enact the existing law.  It is proposed in Section 32 to make similar provision for <Col N="562" /> charity funds not subject to a life or other limited interest.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of Section 32 confines investment of charity funds by, or with the approval of, the Commissioners or the Court to such investments as are (1) authorised by the trust instrument or under the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, or (2) investments in Irish securities, such securities being (a) stocks or shares, the ordinary shares being quoted on the Dublin or Cork Stock Exchange, in any industrial or commercial company incorporated in the State, or maintaining in the State a register of its shareholders resident in the State, or (b) freehold or leasehold land in the State.  There is a saving for investments expressly forbidden by the trust instrument.  The proposed amendment of the law is in line with Government policy as enshrined in the 1958 Act, and also with the policy adopted by the Minister for Finance in connection with the Private Bill dealing with the Iveagh Trust, and now before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 38 of the Bill is necessary because of a doubt as to whether under the existing law&mdash;Section 14 of the 1867 Act&mdash;the Commissioners may direct the trustees of a charity, whom they may authorise to sell, exchange or lease the charity land, to pay the moneys arising from the transaction to the Commissioners, so that they may be invested by the Commissioners for the benefit of the charity.  The Commissioners have power to give directions for the due investment of the moneys, but they consider that it should be made clear that in an appropriate case they shall also have power to invest the moneys themselves for the benefit of the charity.</P>
    <P>Section 44 proposes to give the Board power to order the taxation by one of the High Court Taxing Masters of a bill of costs claimed by a solicitor in respect of business conducted on behalf of a charity or charity trustees.  The Board have not got this power at present but have suggested that, in the interests of charitable trusts, they should have it. <Col N="563" /> The English Charity Commissioners have had a similar statutory power since 1855.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill&mdash;Sections 45 to 54&mdash;contains certain miscellaneous provisions in regard to charities.  With the exception of Sections 45, 46 and 54, this Part simply proposes the re-enactment of existing statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned Section 45, and I shall now examine it at some length.  The section is concerned with imperfect trusts.  These are trusts which at present fail because the objects include both charitable and non-charitable objects.  A usual type of case is where property is given for a charitable purpose linked disjunctively with a non-charitable purpose, such as &ldquo;for charitable or benevolent purposes&rdquo;.  The inclusion of secondary objects which are not charitable, or the use, even in association with the word &ldquo;charitable&rdquo;, of words such as &ldquo;public&rdquo; or &ldquo;benevolent&rdquo;, in the form &ldquo;charitable or public&rdquo; or &ldquo;charitable or benevolent&rdquo;, will prevent the trust from being a charitable trust, and the trust becomes completely void.</P>
    <P>The Scottish courts have taken a different and more sensible view than the courts in England and Ireland.  In Scotland, a conjunction of the words &ldquo;charitable&rdquo; and &ldquo;benevolent&rdquo; does not impair the peculiar virtues of the word &ldquo;charitable&rdquo; and in a case in 1947 one of the Scottish judges simply treated the words as synonymous. This problem was raised in an acute form in England by reason of three leading cases decided by the British Courts in the 1940s.  These were the Diplock (No. 1), the Oxford Group and the Ellis cases.</P>
    <P>In Diplock, a case in 1944, a testator left the residue of his estate&mdash; more than £250,000&mdash;&ldquo;for such charitable or benevolent object or objects&rdquo; in England as his trustees and executors should in their absolute discretion select.  It was held, following a number of previous decisions, that, &ldquo;benevolent&rdquo; being wider than &ldquo;charitable&rdquo;, the executors were entitled to apply the fund outside the <Col N="564" /> sphere of charity.  The bequest was not entitled to the privilege, enjoyed only by charities, of exemption from the rule that the objects of a trust must be precisely defined.  It was, therefore, void for uncertainty.</P>
    <P>In <i>Oxford Group</i>, a case in 1949, it was held that the Oxford Group, a registered limited company, was not entitled to exemption from income tax as a body established for charitable purposes only, because certain of its subsidiary objects were not strictly charitable.</P>
    <P>In <i>Ellis</i>&mdash;also a 1949 case&mdash;land was conveyed to trustees on trust to permit the erection of buildings suitable for a Catholic Church or Catholic school, or for use &ldquo;generally in such manner for the promotion and aiding of the work of the Roman Catholic Church in the district... as the trustees with the consent of the Bishop may prescribe&rdquo;.  It was held that the words I have quoted enlarged the scope of the trust beyond exclusively charitable purposes, and, accordingly, that the trustees could not successfully claim exemption from tax.</P>
    <P>Trusts similar to those concerned in <i>Oxford Group</i> and <i>Ellis</i> had, before these cases were decided, been generally considered to be valid charitable trusts.  The British Nathan Committee, which reported in 1952, recommended that such trusts should be validated provided the trust instruments were in existence on December 31st, 1950, and provided they passed certain tests. The Committee could not reach a unanimous conclusion on the question of validating future imperfect trust instruments and concluded that the existing law should apply to such instruments.</P>
    <P>In 1954, the British Parliament enacted the Charitable Trusts (Validation) Act, 1954, and a similar Act was enacted in the Six Counties in the same year.  The 1954 Act provides that any imperfect trust provision contained in an instrument taking effect before 16th December, 1952, the date on which the British Government policy on the matter was announced, shall have, and be deemed to have had, effect&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> (a) as respects the period before the commencement of the Act, as if the whole of the declared objects were charitable; and</P>
    <P>(b) as respects the period after that commencement as if the provision had required the property to be held or applied for the declared objects in so far only as they authorise use for charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>The matter came up for review again in the Six Counties when the Newark Committee was considering the law of charities.  Despite the Nathan Committee's conclusion that future imperfect trust instruments should not be provided for by legislation, Professor Newark's Committee recommended that existing legislation in Australia&mdash; Victoria and New South Wales&mdash;and New Zealand should be followed, and that no trust shall be held to be invalid by reason that some non-charitable and invalid purpose as well as some charitable purpose is, or could be deemed to be, included in the purposes to which the trust fund might be applied. This recommendation is, however, subject to the proviso &mdash; not found in Australian or new Zealand legislation &mdash;that the court shall have power to approve the application of some part, or the whole, of the funds to the charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 45 of the Bill is modelled on the Australian and New Zealand legislation but it is so drafted as to ensure, as far as possible, that it will be reasonably and liberally interpreted.  In Victoria and New Zealand, the tendency has been for the courts to construe the relevant legislation narrowly. In a case in New Zealand, in 1950, it was held that a gift &ldquo;to the trustees of the Church of Christ, Wanganui, to help in any good work&rdquo; did not come within the relevant statutory provision on the ground that the provision applies only to cases where the creator of the trust had provided a means of severance, where, for instance, by using the word &ldquo;benevolent&rdquo; he allows the court to omit that word or strike it out and thus to employ what is called the blue-pencil technique.</P>
    <P>This decision has been severely criticised as being a far too narrow <Col N="566" /> interpretation in that it prevents the validation of trusts&mdash;which have obviously charitable purposes but which include non-charitable purposes by implication&mdash;merely because the charitable and non-charitable objects are not mentioned separately or because a testator has not used a word which, by itself, would be upheld as charitable so as to allow the trust to be severed.</P>
    <P>Last year, the New South Wales section was the subject of an appeal to the Judical Committee of the British Privy Council.  The Committee in a liberal and reasonable interpretation of the section held that it applied not only where a testator had expressly indicated alternative purposes, the one charitable and the other non-charitable or not necessarily charitable, but applied also where the gift was for a purpose, described in a composite expression, embracing both charitable and non-charitable purposes.  The section would, in the opinion of the Committee, apply where the gift was for an object so predominantly charitable&mdash; such as an order of nuns&mdash;that a charitable intention on the part of the testator could fairly be assumed, or for, say, benevolent purposes, which connoted charitable as well as non-charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>The Government do not favour the Newark Committee recommendation that the court should be allowed to sever a mixed trust so as to empower the court to apply the whole or part of the funds to charitable purposes. The recommendation suffers from the defect that there are no principles to guide the Court as to when or how it should sever.  The Newark Committee were conscious of this defect but pointed out that the instrument creating the trust would be before the court and much may&mdash;and I emphasise &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;they said, depend on the exact terms of the instrument. However, leaving the matter to the Court can only make for uncertainty and also for expense in ascertaining the intentions of a donor or testator.</P>
    <P>The object of any change in the law should be to validate for charity what was obviously intended to be for charitable <Col N="567" /> purposes in the popular sense of that expression.  Allowing the court to sever could benefit relatives whom a testator had no intention of benefiting or for whom he had otherwise amply provided in his will.  In favour of the Australian and New Zealand legislation is the fact that, though the solution does not take account of the testator's intention&mdash;in so far as that intention can be ascertained at all in such cases&mdash;there is a greater benefit to the public at large.</P>
    <P>Section 45 of the Bill will mean that the courts will no longer find themselves in the unhappy position of feeling compelled to invalidate what were obviously intended to be charitable bequests purely on the ground that proper technical words were not used by a philanthropic donor or testator.  In Ireland, a number of cases have come before the courts involving trusts with mixed charitable and non-charitable objects and they all illustrate the rule that where a trustee has an absolute power of selection between the objects the gift will fail.  This rule was cited with approval in the decision of the Supreme Court in the 1935 case to which I referred at the beginning of my speech.  The extraordinary result of the rule has been well illustrated by the former English Lord Chief Justice when he said in the Court of Appeal, <i>Diplock's Case:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For myself, owing perhaps to the fact that I was not brought up in this branch of the law, I cannot feel any enthusiasm for this rule.  Indeed, when I find a rule which says that if property is left to trustees to give to charitable and benevolent purposes, that is good, but if it is for charitable or benevolent purposes, it is not, I regard it with some distaste.  That was described by the Master of the Rolls in the recent case of <i>In re Horrocks</i> as a trap into which the unskilled draughtsman not infrequently falls.  For myself I cannot have any doubt that the draughtsman in this case fell into a trap, <Col N="568" /> because it is obvious that Mr. Diplock's intention was to leave the money to charity in the popular sense of the term, and had it been pointed out to him when he said: &lsquo;I want to leave it to charitable or benevolent objects,&rsquo;&ldquo;well, if you use those words the money will not go to charity but to your first cousins once removed&rdquo; (of whose existence he himself probably did not know) then, provided Mr. Diplock was of sound mind and memory and understanding, there is not the least doubt in the world that he would have said: &ldquo;Cut out the word &lsquo;benevolent&rsquo;.&rdquo; The fact that I do not regard this rule with the respect that one should ever pay to long existing rules is neither here nor there, and the cases oblige me to hold that this gift is void.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mixed trusts may fail because either (1) the testator has left the choice of objects to his executors or trustees or (2) the non-charitable objects of his bounty are not ascertained or ascertainable. Except in the case of a charitable bequest, a man must make his own will: he cannot leave it to his executors or trustees or to the court to make it for him.  In the case of a charity, provided that there is a clear charitable intent even though the testator does not use the word &lsquo;charity,&rsquo; it does not matter if the objects are not particularly defined; and the general charitable intention will be carried into effect by means of a scheme framed by the court or by the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  A charitable trust will be executed for a testator on the basis that there is a legal conception of what is charitable; but a so-called benevolent trust is too vague and there is no legal conception of what is benevolent.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the State, in the person of the Attorney General, as <i>parens patriae</i> taking all charities under its protection, is in a position to enforce a charitable trust.  If there be no specified charitable beneficiary who can come to the court to have the trust performed, the Attorney General may appear and is entitled to insist on the trust being carried out by a scheme <i>cy-prés.</i>  It is only where the trustees have a discretion <Col N="569" /> to apply the trust fund to a charitable purpose or to a non-charitable and indefinite purpose&mdash;so that they may apply it to one purpose to the exclusion of the other&mdash;that the trust will fail.</P>
    <P>In the leading case on the subject in 1804, the matter was put as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The question is not whether the trustee may not apply it upon purposes strictly charitable, but whether he is bound so to apply it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is at this type of case that Section 45 of the Bill is aimed.  Where the trustees have a discretion to apportion between charitable objects and non-charitable objects&mdash;whether definite and ascertainable or not&mdash;the trust will not fail if there is a clear intention to devote some part of the fund to the charitable objects to that the executor is not free to apply the fund to one purpose to the exclusion of the other or others.</P>
    <P>If the trustees do not apportion, the Court will apportion and, if it appears impractical to fix the proportions, the fund will be apportioned equally. However, if it is found that the bequest is void or illegal in so far as the share apportioned to a non-charitable object is concerned because, for example, the object is indefinite or a gift to it offends the rule against perpetuities, the part apportioned to that object will go to the next-of-kin as on an intestacy.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that where there is a general overriding trust for charitable purposes, the trust is good, though some of the particular purposes to which the fund may be applied are not strictly charitable or though one of two alternative modes of application is invalid.  In such cases, the court will give effect to the general charitable trust but the trustees are restricted from applying the fund to the purposes or in the manner which, are objectionable.  Section 45 of the Bill will not affect these cases nor will it affect cases where there is at present apportionment; but, it will affect cases where there is a choice left to the trustees such as cases of gifts for &ldquo;charitable or benevolent&rdquo; purposes.</P>
    <P>A gift for a &ldquo;charitable <i>and</i> benevolent&rdquo; purpose is a good charitable gift under the present law because &ldquo;benevolent&rdquo;<Col N="570" /> is read conjunctively, as meaning both benevolent and charitable, so that the gift is one to such benevolent objects as are charitable or such charitable objects as are benevolent, charity in either way predominating. It should be pointed out that the use of &ldquo;and&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;or&rdquo; is not conclusive in every case.  Where a complex form of words is used such as &ldquo;benevolent, charitable and religious&rdquo; the gift may be void.  It depends on the language and the intention of the donor whether the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; or &ldquo;or&rdquo; is to be read conjunctively or disjunctively, which comes back to the suggestion I made earlier that donors and testators should eschew the use of elaborate language.</P>
    <P>As well as the &ldquo;charitable <i>or</i> benevolent&rdquo; case, Section 45 will cover the gift to a religious Order <i>simpliciter</i> or a gift &ldquo;for the purposes of a religious Order&rdquo;.  The section will validate as charitable such gifts in any case where it might be held that the purposes of the Order are mixed purposes, some charitable and some not.  The law as to these orders is not free from doubt; and I am not to be taken as saying that a gift to a particular religious Order or for the purposes of a particular Order is not a valid charitable gift.  That is a matter for the Supreme Court to determine in respect of the particular Order.  Nevertheless, the Bill saves the courts the trouble of having to decide future cases where the purposes of a religious Order might be held to be mixed purposes, some charitable and some non-charitable, and where there is not what I have called an overriding trust for charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of Section 45 proposes that subsection (1) shall not apply in the case of any instrument taking effect before 1st January of this year, or in the case of an instrument, the terms of which provide for apportionment between the charitable and the non-charitable objects.  I have already explained the apportionment cases.  In these cases there is no criticism of the existing law, and we do not propose to interfere with what is a perfectly valid bequest to a charitable object and also to a non-charitable object. <Col N="571" /> The law is settled in this type of case and no particular difficulty arises.</P>
    <P>As regards the limitation of Section 45 to instruments taking effect on or after 1st January of this year, I should like to say that this aspect was carefully considered by the Government. In fixing a particular date, account had to be taken of the rights of next-of-kin.  Where an imperfect trust provision in a testamentary gift causes the gift to fail completely, the property goes in the ordinary way to the next-of-kin or residuary legatee. Where the imperfect trust provision causes the gift to fail as a charitable gift, but as an ordinary gift, the beneficiary has to pay succession or legacy duty.</P>
    <P>A charitable devise or bequest, in so far as the property is applicable for charitable purposes in Ireland, that is, the whole 32 Counties, escapes legacy and succession duty.  However, the gift is liable to estate duty.  If the property is real estate, the estate duty is a charge on the gift itself.  If the property is personalty, the estate duty is a testamentary expense payable out of the residuary estate.  It is, of course, always possible for a testator to provide that estate duty on real estate shall be paid out of the residuary estate.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of Section 45 is designed to cover a case where a tax or duty has already been paid to the Revenue Commissioners between 1st January last and the date this Bill was circulated.  The tax or duty will not be liable to be repaid.  Furthermore, anything done or any determination made during that period, in connection with the administration of property comprised in any gift coming within the section, will not be invalidated. The idea is not to upset or interfere with things properly done under existing law in respect of a particular gift coming within the section.  In so far as possible, we must avoid tampering with rights lawfully acquired.</P>
    <P>Section 46 is designed to save for charity a gift for a grave, tomb or memorial.  It proposes that such a gift shall be deemed to be charitable, <Col N="572" /> provided it does not exceed, in the case of income, £60 a year and, in the case of capital, £1,000.  Under existing law, gifts for the upkeep of a grave, tomb or memorial inside a church are charitable as being connected with the fabric of the church, and thus as being for the advancement of religion.  However, gifts for graves, vaults or tombs outside a church are not charitable, and, if they provide for perpetual upkeep, they will be void as offending the rule against perpetuities, that is to say, the rule that nobody may tie up his property indefinitely&mdash;the permitted period being that of a life or lives in being and 21 years thereafter.</P>
    <P>Charitable trusts are exempt from this rule.  In the case of non-charitable trusts for the upkeep of graves or tombs, it would appear&mdash;although the law is not free from doubt&mdash;that, if the capital is not tied so that both the income and the capital may be used within the 21 years or, if there is no provision as to income, so that the capital may be used within the 21 years, the trust will be a valid trust; but it will be subject to taxation, such as legacy duty and income tax, from which charitable trusts are exempt.</P>
    <P>We can see no real reason for distinguishing between a gift to keep in repair a grave in a church and a gift to keep in repair a grave in the ground around a church or in a graveyard elsewhere.  Section 46 will succeed in giving practical effect to what has been described as one of the oldest sentiments of the human race, namely, the feeling widely and deeply held that one's last resting place should be decently marked and suitably maintained.</P>
    <P>Similar proposals to that contained in the section were made, in England, in the Fourth Report (1956) of the Lord Chancellor's Committee on the Rule against Perpetuities and, in the Six Counties, in the Report (1958) of the Newark Charity Committee.  In the English Report, the proposal is to validate gifts for graves as ordinary gifts, though not as charitable gifts.</P>
    <P>Section 54, which was inserted in the Bill at the suggestion of the Glover <Col N="573" /> Committee, following recommendations by successive local government auditors, authorises the Commissioners to pay into their general account, out of the income of the Embezzled Charity Recovery Fund, the sum of £17 13s. 5d., being the amount of a deficit which has appeared in their annual accounts since 1873.  It is not known how this deficit originated, but the Commissioners consider it desirable to clear it off their accounts.  I doubt if there can be any objection to this.  The Embezzled Charity Fund is an old fund handed down to the present Commissioners to provide for the recovery of embezzled charities. It is now used as a grant-in-aid for the Vote of the Office of the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to the Schedule to the Bill, which lists for repeal a number of enactments dealing with charities.  In the main, the repeal of these enactments is consequential on the provisions of the Bill.  However, I desire to draw the attention of the House to certain of the provisions of the 1844 Act which are being repealed, but which are not being repeated in the Bill.  These provisions are Sections 15, 16, 17 and 18 of that Act.  I shall discuss Section 16 in a moment.  Sections 15, 17 and 18 impose certain disabilities on Catholics and Catholic religious Orders, in so far as charitable bequests are concerned.  In the opinion of the Glover Committee, these provisions were repealed by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and by the Constitution. &ldquo;If they are not,&rdquo; said the Committee, &ldquo;they ought to be.&rdquo;  We entirely agree.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the 1844 Act provides that a gift of land for charitable purposes is ineffective if made within three months of the donor's death. The section was referred to by the Commissioners in their observations on the Glover Committee Report, and they recommended that it should not be re-enacted until the advisability of doing so had received the most careful consideration.  The Government are satisfied that the section should be repealed and not re-enacted.  It was originally designed to prevent improvident <Col N="574" /> gifts by those who knew they were about to die.  It is peculiar to Ireland, and has led to an amount of difficulty.</P>
    <P>A decision in 1865 that the section also invalidates gifts of money arising from the proceeds of land has been followed over the years.  It was specifically approved of by the Supreme Court in the 1935 case I have previously mentioned, although it was argued on behalf of the Attorney General in that case that the decision was erroneous in principle.  The position in regard to the Section has become absurd by reason of the fact that a well-recognised conveyancing device&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;O'Hagan clause&rdquo;&mdash;allows any properly advised donor to defeat the section.</P>
    <P>In the foreword to Dr. Vincent Delany's recent work on the law of charities in Ireland, Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore, who is a Commissioner, said that &ldquo;no living man can justify the retention of Section 16 of the 1844 Act&rdquo;.  We are aware that there are solid arguments for restricting the disposal of his property by a testator at the expense of close relatives, and this whether or not the disposal is made in fear of death.  However, we cannot see any reason for a law which allows a person, whose property consists of stocks and shares, to give it all to charity at any time before death, but which does not allow a person to give land or the proceeds thereof to charity, if the donation, devise or bequest is made within the arbitrary period of three months prior to his death.</P>
    <P>The Newark Committee in the Six Counties has recommended the repeal of Section 16 of the 1844 Act.  It has already been repealed there in its application to hospitals.  The section in the 1844 Act was based on a more comprehensive and restrictive provision in an old Act of 1736, which applied to England but not to Scotland and which was repealed in 1888.</P>
    <P>Under the English Mortmain and Charitable Uses Act, 1891, which did not apply to Scotland or Ireland, land willed to a charity must be sold, unless it is required for actual occupation <Col N="575" /> for the purposes of the charity and not as an investment; but there is no restriction in England on willing land to a charity.  In the English Charities Act, 1960, enacted in July of this year, the 1891 Act has been repealed as well as all other statutory provisions dealing with mortmain.  The statutory provisions governing mortmain in this country were repealed by the Mortmain (Repeal of Enactments) Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I found it necessary to speak at some length on this Bill.  It is in many respects a highly technical measure, and I trust I have, in what I have said, gone some way to clarify its complexities.  The law of charities is by no means an easy subject.  For this reason, I have had to explain in more detail than would normally be necessary certain of the changes the Bill proposes to make.  Reform of the law generally requires an explanation of its history and background in order to appreciate and, if necessary, to criticise what is proposed.</P>
    <P>In preparing this Bill, the Charity Commissioners, who have, of course, a long and valuable experience in the field, have been of considerable assistance, and I should like to take this opportunity to thank them, and their secretary, for their help.  Dr. Vincent Delany, of the Law School of the Queens University of Belfast, also helped us.  Dr. Delany, who is a well recognised authority on the law of charities, was a member of Professor Newark's Committee in Belfast.  His views on various aspects of the existing law were always readily available to us.  We are greatly indebted to him.</P>
    <P>Since this Bill was published, the Commissioners have made some further suggestions for the amendment of the law.  They are, at present, considering the <i>cy-près</i> doctrine, and we hope to have definitive proposals from them in the near future.  <i>Cy-près</i>, like other aspects of charity law, is rather technical, and I do not propose to go into it in any detail on this Stage.</P>
    <P>I recommed the Bill to the House. I hope that the explanatory side-notes <Col N="576" /> have been helpful to Deputies in following the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>With reservations on a few minor points, I welcome the very late arrival of this legislation into the House.  I hope Deputies who have listened to the Parliamentary Secretary will read with greater interest and give more attention to the history the gave of all this.  It starts in the year 1953. A resolution was adopted that a committee should be established to deal with the law relating to charitable donations.  In 1954, the Government of that time authorised the Minister for Justice to have a Bill drafted to substitute for the existing common law concept of charity a more satisfactory definition.  In 1960, we get a piece of legislation which avoids that direction by having no definition.  The rest of the authorisation was to consolidate the statute law in relation to charities and to move for leave to introduce legislation in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I speak subject to correction but I think I am right in saying that all that is in this Bill was originally drafted by at least the autumn of 1956.  The recommendations were there; the acceptance of the various Departments of Government was given to many parts of it; and the legislation was held up for one purpose only and that was to get a good definition of what constituted a charity or a charitable use. Apparently since 1956, the time has been spent avoiding a definition and the conclusion which has now been reached in the winter of 1960 is not to define it at all, to leave it to the uncertainty and what I regard as the unsatisfactory state of the law as produced through some decided cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After reading this, Deputies will begin to realise the difficulty there is for any Government in trying to deal with legislation, particularly legislation amending old-type legislation. The opposition to new definitions of charity was mainly put forward by the Revenue Commissioners, that is to say, those who were interested in the revenue derived from incomes and estate duty, and of course there was opposition from the Valuation Office. It appears to me that again they have <Col N="577" /> won a victory.  They have persuaded the Government not to accept one or other of the many definitions of charity which have been suggested for consideration and which have always met with objection from these two sources.  The Parliamentary Secretary acknowledges that in what he has read:</P>
    <P>On the revenue side, objection was taken to certain aspects of the definition and also to an amended definition that would not apply for rating purposes.  In view of the difficulties of obtaining a definition more or less acceptable to the various interests involved, the present Government were satisfied that it would be better to drop the idea of a definition in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I am curious about the phrase &ldquo;acceptable to the various interests involved&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The only interests that have been spoken of are the interests that were in opposition, that is, the Revenue side and the Valuation side.  I presume that is what &ldquo;the various interests involved&rdquo; means, those two sources. In any event, this has been given in to now and after announcing the abandonment of any effort to get a proper definition, the Parliamentary Secretary goes on to say that the difficulty in this country was caused in respect of the well-known case of Gilmour and Coats, that that was not followed in this country.  It was not followed and the judgment that is referred to is the previous judgment of the late Judge Gavan Duffy in respect of a particular Order.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered these are only High Court decisions open to challenge at a later stage in the Supreme Court, and the rest of the text of the Minister's speech says that the Supreme Court has from time to time taken a view in respect of charities which was not in conformity with what the late Judge Dixon decided in the case to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred.  The Parliamentary Secretary gives his opinion for what it is worth.  I am not sure that the Parliamentary Secretary will boast of any particular legal affiliation but his <Col N="578" /> opinion is that he finds it hard to imagine that the reasoning in the case, that is to say, in the Gilmour and Coats case to the effect that contemplative Orders do not confer any public benefit, could be accepted ultimately in this country as sound or valid.</P>
    <P>I remember the time when the case referred to was before the late Judge Dixon and I may say that there were many days of anxiety passed before the judgment in that case came.  The judge realised that he was, so to speak, breaking new ground and I think the phrase he used then was that in his judgment, he was happy to find that common sense and the law for once seemed to agree.  That was an individual judge's point of view in a High Court judgment and it stands until it may be challenged in a law case in a higher court.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary at a later stage to bring before the House the two or three definitions of charity.  There were many of them but they resolved themselves into two or three real proposals for a concise definition of a charity or charitable uses.  I should like, for the enlightenment of the Dáil, and, through the Dáil, for the education of the public, some indication to be given as to what these definitions were and the reasons for them, apart from Revenue and Valuation reasons.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, following on what I have quoted, said:</P>
    <P>Indeed, as the history of gifts for Masses in each country shows, the law of charitable trusts in Ireland has over the years tended to be different from what it has been in England.</P>
    <P>Of course, it has.  The whole fight with regard to charities has been that there was a religious bias against certain forms of charitable bequests in this country.  It took many years of argument in the courts and with devices like the O'Hagan clause to get round the particular point of view held by judges who were, one would not say, sympathetic with testators who left money in different ways.</P>
    <P>I want to know where we are now. <Col N="579" /> The Parliamentary Secretary founds a good deal on the quotations from a committee in Northern Ireland and from a committee in England.  They have their problems.  They do not look at this matter of charities in the way we do.  It is quite wrong to put before this House these phrases.  It is all very well over there because the courts have the view of the people. Here the courts have not always had the view of the people.  It is doubtful whether in charitable matters they will not still find themselves bound by precedents established in the bad days.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters I should ask the Parliamentary Secretary to cover comprehensively when replying. Is there anything in this proposed legislation which was not reported on by the Commissioners?  I take it for granted that these were all matters that were reported on favourably by the committee or by the Commissioners themselves.  There are not very many new things in this proposed legislation.  It is, in the main, a consolidating matter with certain improvements.  One of the biggest improvements is Section 45 to which the Parliamentary Secretary devoted most of his time.</P>
    <P>I said I welcomed the legislation with certain reservations.  There are certain minor matters, but before I go on to deal with these minor matters, I want so say that I gather that this is not to be the last piece of legislation on charities.</P>
    <P>Long and all as this legislation has been delayed, it is a far way from settling the law of charities.  I make those remarks because the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, however, bequests continue to be drafted in terms which leave their validity, either as charitable bequests or as ordinary bequests open to doubt.</P>
    <P>In the next phrase, he says:</P>
    <P>and we are satisfied that something ought to be done by legislation to cover certain of these cases.</P>
    <P>I take that to mean something more <Col N="580" /> than what the present legislation brings forward.  In any event, at the end of his statement, he said that the Commissioners were again considering the matter of <i>cy-prés.</i>  That means this Bill is to be somewhat delayed and, I would hope, in order to see what the Commissioners' views are on the matter.  This legislation was brought under consideration in 1954 and now it is brought in in 1960.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that all he can do after remedying certain things is to advise taking some care with the form of bequests.</P>
    <P>Finally, we get a lecture from the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the misconception which arises from the peculiar view which the courts have taken from time to time on the meaning of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; as opposed to the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.  Again, the Parliamentary Secretary recommends that testators should really be more careful in their language and should not go in for complicated forms.  All these matters might have been better dealt with if a definition had been put into this legislation to make clear what this House intended to be considered as a charitable purpose.</P>
    <P>With regard to the details, there are very few I wish to discuss.  I welcome Section 7 which replaces the old section.  It says that the Board shall consist of not more than eleven members. Again, it should be remembered that that replaces the old-time legislation where the enactment was that the Board should consist of three people and ten others but not more than 13, of whom five and not more than five could be Roman Catholics. We are at last getting rid of what was a remnant of the 1844 period.</P>
    <P>In Section 13, there is a repeal of something that is in the 1867 Act&mdash; something I want to question at this time as to whether it should be considered. Section 13 is to the effect that a judge of any court shall not be prevented or disabled by reason solely of his being a member of the Board from hearing and determining any case relating to a charity or any case arising under this Act, but may hear and determine it as if he were not a <Col N="581" /> member of the Board.  Section 25 enables the Board to give a direction with regard to legal proceedings so that such legal proceedings may be instituted.  In other words, the Board gets power to institute legal proceedings in respect of any matter relating to charity.  Section 26 proposes that the Board may certify in writing to the Attorney-General that the case is one fit for proceedings.  Thereupon, after consideration, the Attorney General may institute proceedings as he considers fit.</P>
    <P>If one joins these two sections together, it means that if there is a judge on the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests&mdash;and there is one at the moment; there used to be three who were <i>ex-officio</i> members&mdash;and he gets the Attorney General to institute proceedings, in these days it is being enacted that he may determine the case which he himself has helped to institute or got the Attorney General to institute.  I think that is a proviso one should get rid of. I do not think it is proper that a member of the Board who is given authority to get proceedings instituted should himself officiate in respect of proceedings which he has instituted in that way.</P>
    <P>Again, in Section 14, there is a re-enactment of an old provision.  Section 14 is the section which provides for the audit of the accounts.  The auditor will be appointed by the Minister for Local Government.  When an audit takes place, according to subsection (4), paragraph (d), it is intended to reinstate the old position.</P>
    <P>If anybody goes before such an auditor and is examined on oath and if he wilfully makes any false statement, he shall be deemed guilty of perjury.  That, I think, is taken from the old Act.  I think the very wording is the same, but I should like to have it re-examined, because surely it is essential for the crime of perjury that whatever is stated falsely must be material to the proceedings, and that is not stated here?  It is also good law that it is not necessary that a thing should be false in order to have it a perjured statement.  If I <Col N="582" /> understand the old Act properly, and it can be applied here, perjury is committed by a person who, sworn in judicial proceedings, makes a statement material to the proceedings which he knows to be false or does not believe to be true.  A person can believe something to be true and not be guilty of perjury, and I do not know why this critical matter has slipped in in this easy way, that a person who makes any statement on oath before the auditor &ldquo;shall be deemed guilty of perjury.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I have said it before, but I shall repeat it now, that I know this is taken from the old law.  That phrase, I think, is copied verbatim, but a better view should be had of this when we are instituting these auditors and when it may be the situation that a person shall be deemed guilty of perjury.</P>
    <P>In Section 20, where there is power to grant exemption from the obligation to publish advertisements, I do not know whether it is done deliberately or not, but the phrase that comes from the 1871 Act is slightly changed.  As the section remains at the moment, it reads &ldquo;having regard to the amount of any charitable devise or bequest...exempt any person,&rdquo; but the old Act contains the words &ldquo;small amount&rdquo;.  Whether the word &ldquo;small&rdquo; has been deliberately dropped or not, I do not know, but I should like to know why it has been left out.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to Sections 25 and 26 but in these days when the Attorney General is given a certain position under the Constitution, I am questioning whether it is wise to have Section 25 brought into the legislation at all.  It is a re-enactment of the first part of the section in the 1867 Act.  These two sections are joined in one part in that Act and I do not understand the necessity for having these things taken away from the control of the Attorney General.  Section 26 demands his consent and Section 25 throws powers to the Board itself to institute proceedings.  Section 26 would have to be amended slightly to bring the two together.  As it stands, it runs:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> If in any case it appears to the Board desirable that legal proceedings with respect to any charity should be instituted by the Attorney General, the Board may certify the case...</P>
    <P>but if Section 25 were dropped and the phrase &ldquo;by the Attorney General&rdquo; left out, and then the rest of the paragraph given, it would bring about the situation in which the Attorney General would have the matter sent to him for consideration in every case in which it was decided to institute proceedings.</P>
    <P>The increase, in Section 29, of the powers of the Board to frame schemes applying the <i>cy-près</i> doctrine to certain charitable gifts is, of course, very welcome and is one of the matters definitely recommended by the Commission. It is now an acceptance of the fact that the value of money has dropped very much.  It is desirable to give the Board these powers but I want to question sub-section (4), which is said to be new.  I think it is quite right to give the Board the right to apply <i>cy-près</i> in certain cases but sub-section (4) refers to an exception made where a scheme has been framed by order of a court and is found impracticable or unlawful to apply.  There is also an adjustment to £5,000 in the value of a charitable gift and, in these circumstances, the Board is given power to revoke the scheme and frame a new scheme in its place.</P>
    <P>One can see the reason for giving the Board power to apply <i>cy-près</i>, but, where a matter has already been before a court and a scheme has been framed by the court, why is it considered desirable, instead of going back to the court, to give the Commissioners powers to override the scheme already considered by the court and framed between them?</P>
    <P>Section 32 and Section 45 are the other important sections.  It gives the Board powers to invest any fund, held by them upon any charitable trust, in such manner as they desire.  We are now getting away from trustee securities and all the old-time law.  Indeed, we are getting very far away by the amendment suggested in subsection (3) <Col N="584" /> (a), paragraph (ii) which permits the investment of charitable trust moneys in any debentures, debenture stock or guaranteed, preference or ordinary stock or shares of any industrial or commercial company incorporated in the State.</P>
    <P>The only safeguards are that a company must be incorporated in the State, that it must maintain in the State a register of its shareholders resident in the State and that the ordinary stocks or shares are quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange or the Cork Stock Exchange.  It may be wise to do that but I think some explanation should be given by the Parliamentary Secretary as to why the ordinary shares of such companies are brought in and considered proper for the investment of charitable funds.</P>
    <P>Section 45, which deals with the construction of gifts for mixed purposes, is very welcome.  It deals with a matter which has been brought to my notice frequently and there is such conflicting laws on it in England and Wales&mdash;I have not adverted to the Scottish law&mdash;that to have the situation cleared up to the extent that it has been in Section 45 is very welcome. We are certainly getting away from the situation in which charitable gifts may be voided because something is added on to them.  That is very welcome and I should like to give further consideration to that point when I have time to read what the Parliamentary Secretary said, but, from what I heard him say and what I have read of his speech in the brief interim, I think it is a very welcome section.  Again, I am quite sure it was one of the matters recommended earlier by the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, and with reservations, this Bill is to be welcomed and we cannot complain of any delay involved.  I hope there will not be any great delay, but, if the Commissioners are considering the whole matter of <i>cy-près</i>, it would be well to hold it up for a month or more to enable us to get their views on that very important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, I welcome the provisions of this Bill and feel <Col N="585" /> that the House should approve of it without any reservations.  I note with considerable satisfaction that the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out that under the Bill there is no question of religious qualification for membership for the Board of Commissioners. Possibly to provide for representation of one denomination on the Commission may have been desirable, though I am rather doubtful on that point.  That this provision now is making a Board of Commissioners without any reference whatsoever to the religious beliefs of the members is a sign of growing maturity on our part for which we should all be devoutly thankful.  At the same time, I think that any Government will probably keep in mind the desirability of having different religious beliefs represented on this Commission, not so much because the interests of certain religious charities should be represented by members of that particular Church as because very often a member of one Church is apt to be more strict in his literal interpretation of the law to the detriment of his own Church, rather than the reverse.  The very high standard which has always been maintained by the Commissioners is partly due to the fact that it has been a mixed Commission.  A person burdened with this responsibility might easily feel that he was being unduly prejudiced in favour of a charity belonging to his own Church.  In such a case, it is helpful to have a member of another Church to bear the burden with him and to prevent anyone feeling he is erring on the side of being prejudiced in his own favour.  On the whole, I feel that the complete elimination of any religious qualification for membership of the Commission is very sound and very much to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy McGilligan, I am still somewhat dissatisfied that some progress has not been made on the question of the legal definition of the word &ldquo;charity&rdquo;.  I can quite see the difficulty which can easily arise with people like the Commissioners of Valuation, but at the same time, it is <Col N="586" /> unsatisfactory that such an important matter should be left in any uncertainty whatsoever.  I am glad, like Deputy McGilligan, that the Parliamentary Secretary said that the Government are not satisfied with the present position and feel something ought to be done by legislation to cover the uncertainty. It is obviously a tragedy that people are in danger, when making their wills, of inserting a provision which will defeat the purpose they had in mind, simply by reason of some technicality, although I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy McGilligan that it is far from easy to achieve a satisfactory definition of this word.  I hope that not only the Government but also the legal profession will keep this matter very much in mind in an effort to achieve certainty in this case.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that Section 29 of the Bill provides for an increase in the <i>cy-près</i> sections in several instances, particularly in regard to the increase in respect of the total valuation from £2,000 in the event of a charity up to £5,000.  On the whole, I think it is very wise that increased power and scope should be given to the Commissioners. They are people upon whom we have all come to rely from time to time in connection with matters with which we may become involved and they have set a very high standard for themselves.  With that tradition built up, it is obviously wise that we should give them as wide powers as possible so that they may not be unduly restricted.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to sub-section (4) of Section 29 where the Board are given powers to alter a scheme, even where it had been previously framed by order of a court.  I do not know whether my interpretation of that is correct, but it would appear to me to be the intention that this provision would apply only in a case where the scheme framed by order of a court had been so framed a considerable time previously.  I would feel a certain amount of anxiety if I felt that immediately after a court had heard a case, considered it and framed an order, it might immediately <Col N="587" /> afterwards be varied by the Commissioners. Possibly that matter might be clarified on a later stage of this Bill, but if that was the intention of the Government, I would feel a certain amount of anxiety.  On the whole, I feel some clarification of subsection (4) is desirable.</P>
    <P>Section 30 appears to contain a very wise provision so far as alteration in schemes under the Educational Endowment Acts are concerned.  This is a matter which I know has arisen from time to time, where, due to the trend of population leaving the country areas, it has become impossible to carry out the precise terms of some educational trusts.  In that regard, therefore, it is very wise that the Board should have powers which would include the power to sell the school and use the proceeds for the erection of another school or for educational work generally.</P>
    <P>The provision for facilitating gifts of land to charity when made within three months of death also appears to be a very wise one, and I certainly applaud all efforts which are made to make the law reasonable.  This was a case where the law was quite clearly unreasonable and it is good to see a critical opinion being shown by the Legislature in trying to clear up old provisions which quite clearly have now no valid reason for subsisting any longer.</P>
    <P>The question of mixed trusts is dealt with under Section 45.  That is one with which, I think, all members of the legal profession are well acquainted and which has always given a lot of trouble.  Here again the Parliamentary Secretary has given his warnings as to the necessity of drafting testamentary instruments with great care, but in spite of that, some difficulty will probably continue to arise until the day dawns when we have a definite definition of the word &ldquo;charity.&rdquo; While that definition is still undiscovered the provisions of Section 45 are just about as good as they can be.</P>
    <P>The validation of gifts for graves to a total sum of £1,000 also appears to be one which will be welcomed by <Col N="588" /> certain people.  Personally I can never feel any great anxiety as to whether or not my grave will be suitably looked after but that is just another instance of my own peculiarity.  It has to be generally recognised that a number of people are greatly concerned that the last resting place of their earthly remains should be clearly identified and properly maintained.  In view of the fact that this is generally the feeling amongst people, it is clearly unreasonable that the law should make it impossible to carry out their wishes.</P>
    <P>I must say I am rather surprised, as Deputy McGilligan was, in regard to the question of the Board investing. I do not follow him completely in that. I follow his surprise but I do not follow his anxiety because I feel that the whole conception of investment of trust funds is one that was due for revision in any case.  The whole trend of the stock markets now is to make ordinary shares much more easily realisable and very often much more profitable.  A gilt-edged investment is one which now seems to be liable to much more depreciation.  I cannot feel that the Board would ever invest in the ordinary shares of a company which was in any way unsound.  It is far better, if we are to trust people at all, to trust them to the maximum extent.  The members of the Board will be responsible people and they will be prepared to consider an investment on the best possible advice available at the time.  If it should appear to them wise to invest in an equity rather than in preference shares or gilt-edged shares, they should have that power. If they are given that power, we have to rely on them to exercise it properly.</P>
    <P>My experience of this matter is small but from my limited knowledge I believe that this is a departure from normal practice and it is something on which I should like some further information from the Parliamentary Secretary at some stage.  But if he states that his view is something the same as that which I now express, and that that is done deliberately in an effort to give more scope and more discretion to the Board in its investments for the greater benefit of the charity which it was intended to benefit, <Col N="589" /> I should be very happy.  I hope that it was not just put in by mistake; I am sure it was not.</P>
    <P>In general, I feel that this Bill is a very courageous effort to deal with a very difficult matter.  In so far as it defines, I think it shows progress; in so far as it has dodged the main issue as to what a charity is I must still express some regret, although I have great sympathy with the draftsmen and with the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.  I should like to express the hope that the provision of a definition will not be left aside indefinitely and that not only will it come under active consideration&mdash;and indeed, active and favourable consideration &mdash; but that somebody will actually get down to work on it.</P>
    <P>There may even be a case for setting-up a small, mixed committee to deal with this matter because it is a matter which I feel needs considerable thought and one which any Government Department might well feel unable to deal with on its own.  For that reason, I hope it might be considered that the practising members of the legal profession might be drawn into this matter and their advice sought.  If it is not available at once&mdash;it may very well not be on such a complex question&mdash; at least some small group could be set up which would start work on it. Anything which makes the law more definite, simpler and more apparently reasonable, should be supported by everybody.  At present, and I am afraid in the immediate future at any rate, there will be considerable doubt in the minds of many people, not only laymen but even amongst the legal profession, as to whether a certain provision which a testator wishes to insert can actually be considered to be charitable or not.  Anything which may defeat the wishes of a testator should be avoided not only by the draftsmen but also where possible by the provision of the necessary legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say about a Bill which I welcome.  It always strikes me as being somewhat unnecessary to speak on a Bill with which you agree.  In this case, I am <Col N="590" /> tempted by one or two observations which were made by Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Booth.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will resist any pressure which may be brought to bear on him to define what is charitable.  I am surprised that anyone like Deputy McGilligan a practising barrister of very great ability and renown, should seek such a provision.</P>
      <P>Very few things in this world change as much as people's conceptions of what is charitable.  They changed very considerably since 1844 and I am quite sure they will go on changing.  It seems to me to be much wiser to leave to the discretion of the Commissioners, and the courts where necessary, to state from time to time what is and what is not charitable.  Deputy Booth went to some trouble to explain how difficult it would be for a testator or a donor to decide whether something was charitable or not.  If the person who wants to leave the money does not know whether it is charitable, it will certainly be a great deal more difficult for others to decide <i>in vacuo</i> whether or not it is charitable.  What has been done in the Bill is entirely desirable and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will resist any pressure to bring in legislation to define &ldquo;charitable&rdquo; precisely.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to sub-section (4) of Section 29 where power is given to the Commissioners to vary a scheme prepared by a court where the charitable gift does not exceed £5,000.  I do not see the difficulty.  The fact that the scheme is prepared by a court does not make it any more sacrosanct than if it were prepared by the donor or testator.  To my mind, sub-section (4) ties in precisely with sub-section (2) where the illegality or impracticability of a scheme prepared by a donor or testator is left to the discretion of the Commissioners up to £5,000.  I cannot see why the same provision cannot be made as is made in subsection (4), that is to say, that if the scheme happens to be made by a court, I do not think the court has any more sacrosanct opinions than the testator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other point I want <Col N="591" /> to mention.  Section 13 states that a judge shall not be prevented from hearing a case solely because of his being a member of the Board.  I had great doubts myself about this but it seemed to me to be so technical that I could not sort it out properly.  However, Deputy McGilligan was so clear on it that it does appear that a man should not be judge in his own case where he is already a member of the Board.  Deputy McGilligan very clearly linked this with Section 25 and Section 26.  I cannot understand the necessity for the provision in Section 13.  Surely judges and commissioners are not so very rare that in the odd case that might arise, it would not be possible to avoid such a situation.  If it is possible, I think it would be better to avoid what, to the layman, appears as a very odd provision, that the prosecutor should suddenly become the judge in this way.</P>
    <P>Apart from these details, there is the element of doubt in regard to a matter which Deputy Booth found to be admirable and which I think Deputy McGilligan did not quite approve&mdash; the power to invest in ordinary shares. According to Deputy Booth, it was very easy to know of a reputable company in which it would be safe to buy shares.  I should like to know how Deputy Booth works out that it is safe to invest money in a company: many people would like to know that.  Many people swore by Dunlops and they got an awful shock.  That sort of thing is liable to happen.  There may be a perfectly good reason for this decision and I should be glad to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say on it.  I should be hesitant myself, unless it is possible to put in some proviso that only a certain proportion of the money be invested in such a way, unless there is some safeguard that the greater part of the funds might not disappear at some stage in some deluge.  I can see the attractiveness of some provision that would give power in that respect but I think a safeguard should be put in as suggested.</P>
    <P>Apart from those observations, not alone do I welcome the Bill, but I welcome also the way in which the <Col N="592" /> observations I made before the Bill was brought in were met by the Parliamentary Secretary in the Bill and I thank him for the consideration he gave these observations.  I think the Bill is a very great improvement on present law and, generally speaking, I welcome it in its entirety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern that has been expressed by all the previous speakers in respect of Section 32 of the Bill, which empowers the Commissioners to invest funds at their disposal in the ordinary shares or stock of a commercial company operating in the State or maintaining a register in the State.  I have a suspicion that Deputy Sheldon, canny northerner as he is, knows what he is talking about when he states how uneasy he is about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, of course, that, in Britain, the whole range of trustee securities has been amended to enable all trustees to investigate ordinary shares. We know, too, that what were once regarded as first-class gilt-edge securities, heretofore ranking as trustee securities, such as railways shares, have been completely discounted.  No doubt there is scope for improvement in the law, but I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary in this section has gone too far.  It is all very well to copy British precedents in legislation of this kind but circumstances in this country vary very much.  We have not here the very wide range of investments which is available to trustees investing funds in Britain and another point that is very relevant is that with the best will in the world, the Commissioners of Charitable Bequests, considering if a commercial company is a suitable one in which to invest funds, will not have available to them, in the accounts or reports to shareholders of these companies, all the information they should have and would have if they were operating under a less archaic Companies Act than the Act of 1908.  In Britain, the Act requires that a much fuller description and fuller information be given to potential investors and shareholders than is usually made available here under the 1908 Companies Act. <Col N="593" /> If it were possible to implement Deputy Sheldon's suggestion and confine the ordinary stocks in which investments may be made to those which are unimpeachable, that might merit consideration, even though it is very difficult to forecast the standard that will be attained by companies.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the only other point which occurred to me in the brief examination I made of this Bill is one with which I think the Parliamentary Secretary will have a certain amount of sympathy.  In Section 14, we have very extensive audit provisions. The duties imposed on the auditor are most onerous and I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider requiring the auditor to be a professionally qualified person.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on this measure.  Obviously with this Bill and the Solicitors Bill which he introduced recently, he has been working very hard since he was appointed and I trust that we shall see more of the fruit of his labours in future law reform proposals.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Sheldon, there is very little I have to say and, in fact, Deputy Sheldon made the principal point I was going to make regarding the desirability of defining charity.  Frankly, I think it is impossible.  I agree with Deputy Sheldon.  Any attempt at definition will make the situation more uncertain, I am afraid, in the existing background of charity law in this country. We must not forget that although the Bill, and the Act when it is passed, may supersede effectively all previous legislation, there will nevertheless be a number of decisions standing.  Quite a volume of law and legal opinion has been built up around this subject, which cannot easily be brushed aside. Apart from that, difficulties arise from changing circumstances.  An object which would have been considered charitable&mdash;I mean in the general human sense and not the technical legal sense&mdash;say, 70 years ago, might not be considered charitable to-day, and an object which could not possibly be considered to be charitable 70 years <Col N="594" /> ago might conceivably be held to be such to-day.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, a nice question as to where you could start to make a definition of what charity is.  Synonymous words will not do, nor will they carry with them a great degree of certainty.  It is one of those fields of human activity where there is so much change, and such an undefinable border, that I do not think anyone could attempt a definition.  Worse still, such an attempt would be so rigid and narrow that it would defeat itself and certain points could give rise to further legal contention or ingenuity.</P>
      <P>The provisions about gifts made in previous legislation which were overcome by the O'Hagan clause, give a pretty good example of the type of thing that happens when you legislate for intention.  The Legislature clearly had a particular intention, but that intention could not stand up to the popular demand of the justice of the case and a legal formula was found.</P>
      <P>In dealing with legislation relating to charity, there is something of the same type of difficulty as is met with in dealing with the licensing laws. There is the difficulty of enforcement, the difficulty of ascertaining the precise limits of the problem and there is, finally, the difficulty of legal formulation. You cover one up and then inadvertently either expose another or so hem it around as to create an impossible situation.  Therefore, I join quite definitely with Deputy Sheldon in the view that the Parliamentary Secretary is perfectly right in presenting this Bill without an attempt at definition, that here we are dealing with something that must adapt itself to the times.  It is a concept that must adapt itself to the times and it is best left to the interpretation of the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, there is one other comment which can be made in this debate and it is perhaps an important one.  On the question of the investment of charitable funds, I must say that when I realised that ordinary shares would be a valid investment, it came as a shock, but as soon as the first shock was over, I asked myself <Col N="595" /> was my reaction that of old-fashioned prejudice.  I must say I feel the Board should have the discretion to do their best and I doubt whether a limitation to a particular description or brand of investment would be altogether helpful.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I freely concede that if there was a lack of responsibility or too much attraction by the profit of the moment, an improvident investment might easily be made.  For that reason, I wonder whether, seeing that the Board are in a sense something of the same nature as the State &mdash;a national or community entity&mdash; there might not be some method, perhaps in conjunction with the Department of Finance, of investing these funds in the State at an adequate return.</P>
    <P>I know that could be done by investing in a national loan or in bonds issued by the Government, but it would be difficult in practice.  The Board might have to wait for a favourable time of issue, or perhaps the Commissioners, when seeking an investment, would have to buy in circumstances which would compare unfavourably from a profit and perhaps a security point of view&mdash;not so much security of the actual holding but security of the value of the holding.  They might have to invest in unprofitable circumstances. If they invested in a certain national loan, they might at some stage have depreciation from its par value due to some long term factor, or something like that.</P>
    <P>I see there are difficulties and for that reason I ask myself whether it would not be possible for the Board which ought to be regarded in some sense as a State body&mdash;they certainly represent the community &mdash; to invest in the State in reasonable circumstances. I do not want to be more precise than that in any further suggestion, but I think that with regard to such a responsible body as the Board we are placing on them an onerous responsibility in the matter of investment if we tell them they are free to invest wherever they wish, while implicitly, if not explicitly, warning <Col N="596" /> them that they have a duty not only to do their best but to safeguard the fund.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is difficult to go further than that at this stage, but, nevertheless, I throw out the perhaps revolutionary suggestion that some machinery of investment in the State directly might meet the bill, if it were possible. It would be revolutionary, as I say.</P>
    <P>I should like to join in the congratulations which have been extended to the Parliamentary Secretary.  The production of this Bill must have entailed a great deal of research, effort and study back over the years from 1953. Deputy McGilligan referred to that.  In England there was, I think, a commission, or some such body, early in the 1950's engaged on some similar work.  As far as I know, legislation was introduced there only very recently. Here, as in England, there must have been a considerable amount of critical work involved in the preparation of this Bill, the more so as the historical background to charities here is one not altogether free from criticism.  It was one of bias.  At one stage, it was one of straining to effect a certain discrimination where statutory discrimination had been removed.  Apart from that, there was a tradition of discrimination. That background inevitably coloured the whole development of the law of charity and in this particular instance, therefore, the Department undertaking the examination was faced with a major problem.</P>
    <P>The Department has done a very good job as the length and complexity of the Bill show.  But, after all that is said and after all the work has been done, some credit must go to the Parliamentary Secretary who introduced the Bill because it was on him and the Minister that the task of making decisions ultimately devolved.  We all know how easy it is, especially if other people do it for us, to collect information for the purpose of making a study of a certain problem.  All that is required then is to master that information and assimilate it.  But it requires a great deal more to order it finally and take the decisions necessary for the production of a Bill in this <Col N="597" /> House.  That is what the Parliamentary Secretary has done here, done it in a very difficult sphere and done it, I think, very well.  I should like to join with the others in paying that tribute to him.</P>
    <P>One last remark I should like to make about <i>cy-près.</i>  Quite obviously the powers given in Section 29 are both necessary and desirable.  No one wants funds frittered away in unnecessary legal procedure or litigation.  The more the board are in a position to act executively and efficiently to ensure that funds are devoted in their totality as far as possible to the object for which they were left, or some equivalent object, the better it will be.  As time goes on, we can perhaps look forward to varying the limits but I certainly see no difficulty in giving such powers to the Board.  I think it is a good provision.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Sheldon said, there is very little to be said about a Bill with which one agrees generally.  Everybody seems to welcome this measure. I think they must.  If we are honest, we shall admit that there are very few of us who are in a position to criticise in detail all the ramifications behind this Bill.  It is to be appreciated that such a substantial and useful piece of social legislation has been introduced here in such a competent fashion.  Again, I join in congratulating those responsible for it.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil have an incurable passion for cheap and tawdry propaganda.  It is an astonishing feature that Deputy Vivion de Valera should be sent in here today to preach a homily to the House on the reason for the appointment of Deputy Haughey as Parliamentary Secretary so that, by his blood, sweat and tears, this monument of social legislation and legal reform of abundant complexity might issue forth from his powerful intellect.  We all know that is all pure cod.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was drafted and considered by the previous Government, four years ago.  Now Deputy de Valera is quite entitled to say to me: &ldquo;If you drafted it, and considered it, then why, <Col N="598" /> in the name of goodness, did you not bring it in?'  Th'e answer is quite simple: because, having considered it as a Government, the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General were asked to take it back to consider whether it was possible to provide a definition of a charity.  Before we left office we had not found any satisfactory definition of a charity very largely for the reasons mentioned by Deputy de Valera.  As he said, there is a long history behind this.</P>
    <P>Up to a very few years ago you could not leave money for a Mass because the British courts of the old dispensation had declared that the celebration of Mass was a superstitious and objectionable practice.  If you left money for a Mass the charity was void and we had to have recourse to the viaticum clause up to the time of Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy's judgment. His judicial decision reversed a long chain of judicial decisions of the British courts and set that particular item right.  We were conscious of difficulty.  We were conscious of the fact that you could not get a satisfactorily comprehensive definition of a charity, a definition which would not create more problems than it was designed to solve.  Apart from that, as I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will be the first to admit, this Bill was sitting in the Attorney General's Office for four years.  It is purely a consolidation Bill, consolidating a long series of Charities Acts which had got into a mess because of their number and because of judicial decisions which had interpreted them down through the troubled history of this country.</P>
    <P>There is an attempt made here in Section 46 to define a charity.  It is the kind of definition which brings into the wider definition of charity one specific thing in a limited form, designed to ensure that if a person wants to leave money for a mausoleum, he can do so; but if some &ldquo;dafty&rdquo; leaves £100,000 to maintain his mausoleum, the Charity Commissioners will have power under the law to disregard it.  If the income amounts to only £60 a year, or less than £1,000 in value, then it is a charity.  If it exceeds that, it is not <Col N="599" /> a charity.  That is an attempt to define a charity, but it is an attempt to define it by way of exclusion and limitation rather than by a comprehensive definition&mdash;a definition which neither we in the inter-Party Government nor the present Government have been able to evolve.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy de Valera does any good by his tactic here.  We have argued out the case as to whether it is not a gross waste of public money to appoint a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice when there is no work in that Department to justify the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary. We all know damn well it is a public scandal.  But the Government are entitled to appoint Parliamentary Secretaries, if they want to, and nobody is concerned to make any personal assault on Deputy Haughey; he happened to be the person chosen. What irritates me a little is Deputy de Valera's coming in here in that bland atmosphere of innocence that I so frequently remember in his revered father.  When he was up to some particularly dusty transaction, he would immediately assume the role of Robert Emmet's nephew; he would get up here and say: &ldquo;Everybody trusts me&rdquo;.  You always knew then that some particularly dirty work was on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera rambles in to say a few pious words about the Charities Bill.  He is not talking about the Charities Bill at all.  What Deputy Vivion de Valera is trying to say is: &ldquo;We were amply justified in making Deputy Haughey Parliamentary Secretary and look at the poor fellow burdened down with this great mass of complex work which he is achieving with wonderful distinction, address and expedition&rdquo;.  That is all cod. The decent boy is doing the best he can, floating about in his motor car and drawing a salary, which he is entitled to do, as he has been appointed by the lawful Government of this country.  He is getting nothing that he is not entitled to under statute but it is all cod to pretend that his blood, sweat and tears were spent in producing <Col N="600" /> this Bill.  This Bill was in the Minister's office four years ago and the only contribution Fianna Fáil have made to it is that it took them four years to come to the conclusion that the definition of a charity which was being sought four years ago is not to be found.  So, this Bill is thrown in for enactment by the House and it provides Deputy de Valera with his Thursday morning occasion to make a short homily, (1) to show that he does sometimes turn up here and (2) to show that he thinks the Parliamentary Secretary is the cat's pyjamas.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to Section 13 of this Bill.  The existing law permits by usage that if a judge is a member of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests that does not disqualify him from hearing a case in his official capacity to which the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests are a party.  Apparently some doubt has arisen on that matter and Section 13 appears in this Bill for the purpose of removing the doubt but, I think, removing the doubt in the wrong way.</P>
    <P>If a judge is a member of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests and a case came on his list for trial in which the Commissioners were a party, we would imagine, I should think, in this House, that the proper course would be for the judge to ask the Chief Justice to take whatever is the correct procedure in the High Court, to take the case out of his list and give it to another judge. Not, indeed, that it is likely that in a matter of that kind the judge would be influenced one way or another by his membership of the Commissioners but at least, as a Commissioner, he would have heard the Commissioners' side of the case argued and determined before the litigation began.  Bearing in mind that one of the essentials in a free society is that justice must not only be done but must appear to be done, it would seem almost ludicrous if a judge of the High Court, who happens to be a Charity Commissioner, should proceed to adjudicate a case brought by a citizen against the Commissioners of which he himself <Col N="601" /> is a member.  I cannot imagine it happening but why should we by Act of Parliament invite it to happen?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that Section 13 is quite misconceived and that we ought to leave the matter alone and either leave it in the discretion of the Chief Justice to arrange that if such a case came before the High Court it should be transferred to somebody else's list or else to state specifically in the Bill that, where a judge is a member of the Charity Commissioners, litigation in which the Commissioners were involved should not be tried by him.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in interpreting Section 32 as relieving the Charity Commissioners of certain restrictions on their discretion to invest funds.  I see the section is noted as being new. I hope Deputy de Valera, when he was sympathising with all the blood, sweat and tears of the Parliamentary Secretary, observed that as to more than 50 Sections of this Bill it is consolidating legislation.  Whenever any section introduces new law there is a special note, &ldquo;New.&rdquo;  This is a new provision and, I understand, removes from the Commissioners the obligation to confine their investments to trustee securities or securities of that character. I approve that.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is true that people must exercise the utmost care in the investment of trust funds but I inferred from what Deputy Byrne or somebody else said that placing upon trustees the obligation to confine their investments to trustee securities guaranteed the safety of the funds invested, which, of course, is quite ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Any unfortunate possessor of a trust who has been the subject of a trust confining the trustees to trustee securities has been ruined in the course of the last 50 years whereas those whose trustees were given discretion have become greatly enriched.  We have all seen recently the case of the Church Commissioners in Great Britain who got freedom from the trustee restrictions ten or fifteen years ago and, as a result of prudent investment of the funds of the Established Church of England in Great Britain, they have been able to increase the stipend of <Col N="602" /> every Protestant clergyman in the Establishment and averted a desperate crisis.  These men were on the verge of starvation and are now valiantly working in their vocations, on a wretchedly inadequate income still, but at least the exemption of the Commissioners of the Church of England from the obligation to continue investing exclusively in trustee funds has saved the clergymen of the Church practically from destitution.</P>
    <P>An interesting fact is that in the investment of funds that were subject to the trustee limitation in the last 50 years, no matter what care you took the funds of the <i>cestui qui</i> trust were bound to dwindle and the more conservative you became the more certain was ruin to come upon your <i>cestui qui</i> trust.  Those who went in for the non-terminable securities like the Consolidated Stock, which used to be of the nature of a conservative investment, have lost one-half or one-third of their entire capital.</P>
    <P>It is not so long since Lord Dalton was Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Issued British securities of 2½ per cent.  Consolidated Stock of Great Britain stood then at 98 or 99. Today it stands at 48 or less&mdash;44&mdash;and in 15 years more than one-half of the funds then invested have simply evaporated and will never be recovered because it is highly unlikely that these irredeemable stocks will ever rise to anything like their previous level.</P>
    <P>One must bear in mind that, no doubt, the Charity Commissioners and persons in those circumstances will remember that an investment in terminable fixed interest securities, provided they are of trustee status, that is, Government stocks or the like, guarantees the integrity of the nominal capital because, if held long enough, they are redeemed at a certain date but the retention of nominal capital values is very little consolation in a world where we are experiencing, year in year out, steady and sustained, gradual inflation and where it is becoming pretty clear that under modern social conditions in a capitalist society the maintenance of stability in social conditions requires a modest if restrained annual inflation. <Col N="603" /> So that, in the new world in which we find ourselves it would be a very great hardship indeed to confine any trust to exclusive investment in fixed interest securities, even of the most conservative character, in which I would include Government and Government guaranteed fixed interest stocks.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision and I think I had a hand in the discussion which led up to it exonerating the Charitable Commissioners from the obligation to confine themselves to what used to be called trustee stocks.  It is, of course, true that the utmost care will have to be taken to see that investments are wisely made, but the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests are not the only people in the world who are prepared to take care in the investment of their funds and I have no doubt that they will seek and get wise advice to that end.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy de Valera say today that he wondered should we not confine the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests to investment in Irish securities.  That is a rather alluring proposal, but let us remember that a large number of these charitable gifts are for excellent purposes. Many of them are exiguous, quite small.  If the Commissioners are to be released from their trustee stock obligations that operated heretofore, they should be given the widest discretion to invest funds where they can be most advantageously invested.</P>
    <P>I do not think we ought, as a Legislature, to pronounce that for some economic purpose these funds should be directed into one particular channel of investment; (1) I do not think the funds are of sufficient dimensions to make it important to the economic life of the country as a whole; (2) I do not think there is any real scarcity of capital in the country or available to the country if we want it; and (3) I believe it might act to the detriment of prudent investment of these funds if the Commissioners are debarred in their new discretion from investing them <Col N="604" /> where they think best.  It is doubtful also, when we are seeking to draw capital into the country, whether it is a good plan to announce that we prohibit the investment of domestic capital abroad.  On the whole, I think we will probably benefit rather than lose and I urge that if a new discretion is to be vested in the Commissioners, as I think it should, that discretion should not now be limited in such a way as that mentioned by Deputy de Valera.</P>
    <P>All measures designed to consolidate and to simplify the existing law are good.  They are very often difficult and tedious to draft and I have no doubt this Bill is no exception to the general rule.  I do not believe the Parliamentary Secretary had anything to do with the drafting or the preparation of this Bill.  I do not know whether he will have the spunk to stand up and say so.  It will be rather confusing to Deputy de Valera if he does but that is the fact.  I shall be glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to Section 13.  He referred back to the Act of 1867, Chapter 54, Section 23, and I was not aware that the right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think it is the desire of the House or of any Deputy to suggest that a High Court Judge will allow his mind to be prejudiced or influenced by any ulterior matter other than what is before him but it is very necessary that justice should not only be done but be seen to be done.

Only in the course of the last few weeks we had a piece of legislation which prevented anyone who is even a candidate from being a member of the board of directors of a State company.  We have no scruple about doing that and if you say: &ldquo;Why do you do that?&rdquo;  they say: &ldquo;Oh, well, it might disedify the public if somebody in public life were associated with that.&rdquo;  How much more disedifying to the people would it be that a judge, who had advised the Charitable Commissioners to contest an action, is not thereby disqualified from <Col N="606" /> himself presiding?  I think instead of consolidating, we should repeal that section of the Act of 1867.

If it is an invalid charitable bequest, this sum will fall back into the residue of the estate to be distributed amongst the next-of-kin. If, in the middle of the proceedings, some simple countrywoman leans over and passes some remark, and if it is decided this is valid, the Commissioners get the whole thing.</P>

      <P>Why not?  I have got the uncomfortable feeling that the judge ought not to be a member of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  It is reasonable to suggest that in the circumstances it would be much better for a judge not to be himself a Commissioner of Charitable Donations and Bequests. Any rational Deputy will agree with me.  I do not think it is an unreasonable stipulation to say that if a man is a member of the Board and attains to judicial office, he should relinquish his position as a Commissioner of Charitable Donations and Bequests. Surely in the whole of the Irish population, some person could be found to fill his particular niche, whatever it is, and to represent whatever section of the community he is supposed to represent on the Board?  It would be much more edifying if this dashing <Col N="608" /> young Parliamentary Secretary, who is supposed to be so lively in his approach to this legislation, looked at Section 13 instead of clinging to every word, letter and section to demonstrate his capacity to defend his brief in the Dáil.  He might, perhaps, discover something in relation to the legislation of 1867.  The world has changed considerably since. You have vast methods of communication and a far wider dissemination of news.</P>

      <P>I said I understood the existing law arose from practice rather than statute.  I now know there is statutory law for present practice.  I think I pointed out that it would be better to reject that statutory provision in the 1867 Act.  I do not believe that a judge of the Supreme Court, or of any court, should continue to act as a Commissioner <Col N="611" /> of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  In fact, when one comes to examine the matter, the only effective way of avoiding the evils I see in the system which it is sought to re-enact is to provide that if a person becomes a High Court judge, or a judge of any court, he should cease to be a Commissioner of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  I do not think that will involve any hardship and it may avoid much misunderstanding and much undesirable practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to deal with the suggestion that there has been inordinate delay in bringing this Bill before the House.  I agree that a considerable time has elapsed since it was first introduced, but I should like to direct the attention of the House to the position obtaining in Great Britain where the resources for doing this sort of thing are much greater than we have at our disposal. The Nathan Committee reported in 1952 in England but they did not succeed in passing their Charities Act there until 1960 so that, if you view our performance against that background, I think it is not altogether discreditable.</P>
      <P>I have been criticised by Deputy McGilligan and the Leader of the Opposition in that I took the 1954 Bill and more or less re-introduced it. Deputy Dillon spoke about the fact that it was one of the problems which they could not get around to solving and, at this point, I might be tempted to remark that it is only one of the very many problems which that Government never got around to solving. Be that as it may&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary for making the best riposte he can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out that by far the most important provisions in this Bill were not in the 1954 Bill at all.  I refer particularly to the provisions about mixed trusts, to the provision about graves and tombs and, indeed, to the subject on which Deputy Dillon has waxed so eloquent, the provision as to the investment of trust <Col N="612" /> funds.  When these major provisions are taken into account, the House will realise that this criticism that we are merely repeating the 1954 Bill is unfair.</P>
      <P>There has been a very great deal of talk about the fact that we have not succeeded in getting a definition of charity.  Deputy McGilligan was quite critical of us in that regard but again I could point out that between 1954 and 1957, he, wonderful legal expert that he is and justifiably recognised to be, was unable to procure a satisfactory definition.  Indeed, I am in full agreement with Deputy Sheldon when he says that the inclusion of a definition should not be the be-all and end-all of our policy as to charities.  It would be an excellent achievement if we could get a comprehensive and satisfactory definition, but we have failed.  I think we have failed because such a thing cannot be done.  Having failed to get an all-embracing definition, the Government decided that it was better to have no definition rather than a limited and unsatisfactory one.</P>
      <P>My point about people falling into drafting traps was referred to by Deputy McGilligan.  There are two aspects of this.  It is very desirable to avoid traps into which draftsmen may fall but, if we had an unsatisfactory definition, might there not be far more numerous traps than there are at the moment?  The question of a definition is one which has engaged the attention of all those concerned with this Bill.  I should have no hesitation, if I could have got a good definition, in including it.  In the meantime, in the absence of a definition, we are pursuing the best possible course by removing any anomalies in the existing situation.  In the absence of a definition, we are validating mixed trusts and making provision with regard to graves and tombs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, when arguing that there was nothing new in this Bill that was not in the 1954 Bill, carefully steered away from Section 45, though he mentioned Section 46.</P>

      <P>The insured person referred to by the Deputy claimed unemployment benefit at Waterford Employment Exchange, on the 17th October, 1960.  The claim was rejected by a Deciding Officer who decided that the claimant had lost his employment by reason of a stoppage of work due to the trade dispute at his place of employment and that he was accordingly disqualified by section 17 (2) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, for the receipt of unemployment benefit. This decision was notified to the claimant on the 24th October, 1960.</P>
      <P>The insured person has appealed against the decision.  The appeal is scheduled for hearing during the present week and the decision of the Appeals Officer will be given without avoidable delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána realise that Kildare Street, by reason of its location and the variations in its width, is liable to become congested at times, and they pay particular attention to the enforcement of the Parking and Waiting Bye-Laws there.</P>
      <P>In the year ended 30th September, for example, 190 summonses were issued for obstruction and 322 summonses were issued for unauthorised parking in the street and, in addition, a large number of oral and written warnings were given to motorists.</P>
      <P>Two Gardaí are normally on traffic duty in Kildare Street but because of especially heavy demands made on the services of the Gardaí engaged on traffic duty over the past month, arising from extensive road works in another part of the city, only one member could be allocated for traffic duty in Kildare Street.  It is hoped, however, that a second Garda can be restored to this duty in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully sympathise with the Minister's willingness to enforce the parking regulations, has his attention been directed to the particular difficulty of motorists in this street?  Is this not the street in which <Col N="620" /> you have to renew your licence if you are a motorist in Dublin?  Might not some suggestion be made to the municipal authorities, or whoever is responsible, that the office for that function should be transferred to some less frequented street as it is not easy for people who have to hurry to get their licences in order to carry on with their normal business to go there on foot and then go back and find their car again and pass on?  If that office were moved to some less frequented street a great deal of the obstruction could be averted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one feasible way of dealing with that situation.  The real way I suppose would be to prohibit parking altogether at that end of the street but the matter with which we are dealing at the moment, the particular congestion raised in this Question, is due in the main to the fact that where we had two Garda doing duty, for the last month or five weeks we have had only one, because of work that is being carried out in the vicinity of the City Hall.  That will be eased in the very near future and we may have to consider the question of prohibiting parking completely on one side of the street.  In respect to Deputy Sherwin's remarks, I know from my own experience that cars do not park outside the gate in the manner in which the Deputy has suggested and if he were involved in an accident he would have to examine his own conscience, to see if he were not himself responsible for the accident.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power how he reconciles his statement on 12th October last at Cork that the Government is irrevocably opposed to subsidies for transport with the financial assistance given by the State to purchase, build and maintain airports and aircraft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>My statement at Cork to the effect that the Government is irrevocably opposed to subsidies for transport referred, of course, to subsidies to meet operating losses.  This is, of course, quite different to the investment of capital sums in the building of airports and the purchase of aircraft. Such form of financial assistance is inescapable in modern conditions when initiating and developing a new form of transport, such as air transport.  No subsidy in respect of the operation of the national airline has been necessary since 1951.</P>
      <P>Shannon and Dublin Airports taken together made an operating surplus in 1959/60 though they are not yet able to meet the full cost of depreciation and interest on capital.  The national airline, while paying interest on loan capital, has not yet been in a position to pay interest on capital advanced from the Exchequer.  I hope that conditions will make this possible in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply of 18th May, I informed the Deputy that C.I.E. had submitted an amending pension scheme to the existing Wages Grade Pension Scheme to provide for payment of deferred pensions so as to enable redundant employees to take advantage of the provisions of paragraph 7 of the Second Schedule to the Transport Act, 1958, but that the amending scheme was not confirmed under Section 44 of the Transport Act, 1950, because its provisions, taken together with those of the redundancy compensation provisions, would have involved the Exchequer in a loss.</P>
      <P>A revised amending scheme was submitted by C.I.E. last month and the statutory public notice appeared in the daily newspapers on the 31st October, 1960.

      <P>Work commenced at Cork Airport site last November.  In the period 1st November, 1959 to 31st October, 1960, the total amount of rainfall in the Cork area at the point of measurement nearest to the airport site (namely Cork University College) was 57.65 inches and the number of wet days in the same period was 183 neither of which was exceeded in any corresponding period since 1902/03. The point at which the observations were taken has an average of 15 per cent. less rain than the airport site. In the standard period for comparison, 1916/50, the average rainfall for the ten months' period January/October, as recorded at Cork University, was 32.03 inches.  In the period January/ October, 1960 the rainfall recorded at Cork University was 44.5 inches, which was 39 per cent.  above the standard period.  A similar comparison for the four months July/October, 1960, shows that the rainfall recorded in the 1960 period was 70 per cent. in excess of the average for the same four months of the standard period.  The rainfall at Cork Airport was not recorded prior to January 1960 but for the period January/October, 1960 it was 53.22 inches&mdash;20 per cent. more than the amount recorded for the same period at Cork University College.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Sales of Irish whiskey, including liqueurs and of Irish gin represented 30% and 1%, respectively, of the total liquor sales at the duty-free shop at Shannon Airport in the year ended 30th September, 1960.  The total value of Irish liquor sold in the period was £73,507 and of non-Irish liquor £167,776.  These figures are not, of course, strictly comparable, as Irish liquors comprise whiskey, gin and liqueur only, while non-Irish liquors also include rum, brandy and wines. In fact, the sales of Irish whiskey and gin represented 40% of the total whiskey and gin sales.  This compares with 1953/4 when the sales of Irish whiskey represented 30% of the total whiskey sales.</P>

Would the Minister further <Col N="629" /> agree that the present position is that for every one bottle of Irish whiskey on the shelves for sale in the duty-free shop there are five bottles of different brands of Scotch whiskey?  Is the Minister aware that the position now in relation to the dollar has changed and that the duty-free shop at Shannon should now be for the purpose of selling Irish goods rather than for the purpose of getting hard currency, as was undoubtedly a genuine reason for it before?</P>

      <P>The catering manager has instructions to emphasise the display of Irish goods including Irish liquor in the duty-free shop and in the liquor shop but he is clearly entitled under the regulations to sell foreign goods at the same time.  In the opinion of the catering manager, whose decision I do not at present question, the total sales including the sales of Irish goods and Irish liquor can be enhanced if there is a varying display of goods including foreign goods.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether there is any legal impediment which prevents <Col N="633" /> a county council from providing water and sewerage to vested cottages on the basis of adjusting the annuities payable on such cottages so as to repay the cost of such services; and, if so, whether he proposes to take steps to remove it by legislation or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When a cottage has been vested pursuant to the Labourers Act, 1936, the annuity fixed in the statutory purchase scheme cannot be altered for the purpose in question.  I understand that Kildare County Council is considering an alternative procedure to facilitate the servicing of vested cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister think it desirable to remove the existing difficulty by legislation so that if a county council desires to provide water and sewerage services for a vested cottage, they may do so by charging the occupants of the cottage an annuity which could be associated with the annuity already payable on the cottage?  That would be by far the easiest method of dealing with a problem of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt it may seem easier than the alternative method that has been proposed, but, on examination&mdash;and I have had the matter fairly fully, though not conclusively, examined&mdash;it was found that legislation to do as the Deputy now asks would, by and large, have the effect ultimately of bringing into disuse the usefulness of the existing purchase schemes.  If those schemes were subject to change for that purpose, there is no reason why they would not be subject to change for the purpose, say, of building additional rooms. What purpose would there be in vesting these cottages if there was nothing fixed about them in the first instance, not to mention the difficulty of the annuities, the repayments, the raising of the loans and the fixed charges which are now being paid?  I might say to the Deputy and to other Deputies who I understand have a specific problem in Kildare with regard to the housing scheme, that if so, I shall be glad to have their views <Col N="634" /> and possibly find a solution to the problem as it now exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to any particular case.  What I have in mind is that a local authority&mdash;Kildare County Council is one of them &mdash;might desire to extend water and sewerage schemes to the vested cottages in particular parts of their administrative areas, but at present they cannot do so under the Labourers Acts because I understand that they cannot alienate the cottage for the purpose of guaranteeing repayment of the money spent on water and sewerage schemes.  While I do not think there is much difficulty in amending the Act to facilitate local authorities in providing water and sewerage schemes in accordance with the Minister's recommendations to the authorities, the alternative method seems to be to use the compulsory powers under the Sanitary Services Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The reply to both questions is contained in a statement issued on 24 Deireadh Fómhair, 1960, by the Búró um Eolas Stáit on behalf of my Department.  The statement was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Some weeks ago Mr. Mac Aonghusa, An Comhlacht Taifeadadh, approached the Department of Defence with a proposal for a radio broadcast feature on Civil Defence to be produced by him and asked for the Department's co-operation.  This co-operation was readily given by arranging for interviews with the Department's civil defence officials and for <Col N="636" /> statements by the President and the Minister for Defence.  Participation by the Dublin Civil Defence Services and volunteers was also arranged.</P>
    <P>The arrangement was that when Mr. Mac Aonghusa had edited the feature in the form in which he intended it should be broadcast, representatives of the Department would be given an opportunity of hearing the recording so that there could be mutual agreement on its content.  Due it is understood to the time factor, Mr. Mac Aonghusa submitted the final recording direct to Radio Éireann without reference to the Department of Defence.  With Mr. Mac Aonghusa's prior argreement, however, the Minister for Defence heard the recording at Radio Éireann on Saturday last.  While satisfied that generally speaking the feature had been excellently produced, the Minister felt that it would not be appropriate that the President and himself should be associated with certain statements included by Mr. Mac Aonghusa and of which they were not aware when making their recordings. He noted that an important part of the case for Civil Defence which had been recorded in one of the interviews had been omitted.  He considered, therefore, that the broadcast of the feature in the form presented should not be made.  He was quite willing to have the feature altered in agreement with the producer.  As time did not, however, then permit of any alteration being made, the Radio Éireann Authorities decided that the feature would not be accepted for broadcasting on Sunday, 23rd instant, as had been intended.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that an objection by him is sufficient to justify the cancellation of a broadcast by Radio Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a case of a programme which had, in fact, been supplied by us at the request of this producer and on a definite undertaking given at the outset, and repeated on a number of occasions in the interim during which the programme was being prepared&mdash;an undertaking which was not honoured. <Col N="637" /> The position was that the Department of Defence, and subsequently I myself, drew the attention of the Radio Éireann authorities to the fact that the undertaking given had not been honoured and that the programme as presented was not one that we were prepared to agree to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware, and will he not now admit, that the producer of this programme intimated to the officials of his Department that there would be no censorship of the programme, that the producer was entirely responsible for it, and that the officials of his Department agreed that there would be no question of censorship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There was certainly no question of censorship.  The fact was that this man approached the Department of Defence and asked them to co-operate with him in producing the programme.  It was quite clear that what he wanted was, in fact, that a number of items should be provided by, or arranged by, the Department and he would link those together and present them as a programme.  The Department agreed to do this on a definite undertaking given by him, and repeated by him on a number of occasions, that the programme, as he intended to present it, would be presented to the officials of the Department of Defence for mutual agreement on it before it would be submitted to Radio Eireann.  In the event, the producer attempted to slip a mutilated and doctored version&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Finally, arising out of the Minister's statement on Radio Éireann, does he not think, in view of the fact that the producer was prevented from expressing his point of view because of the newspaper strike, it was a dirty, low-down, blackleg effort on his part to go on the radio for 24 hours making an <i>ex parte</i> attack upon one of our most reputable radio journalists?</P>

This is a waste of time, a waste of money, and a waste of civil defence.  There <Col N="639" /> is no defence.  The Minister is fooling himself.  It is a waste of money. It is a fraud.</P>

    <P>The Minister has no statutory functions in regard to the omission or cancellation of a Radio Éireann programme except those contained in Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act 1960.  This section was not invoked by me in connection with the programme referred to in the Question and I have therefore no responsibility in the matter.  I may add however because of erroneous reports that appeared in some newspapers, that no Minister stopped this programme.  I understand that Radio Éireann decided not to accept it because the two parties concerned in it, the contributor who sponsored it and the Minister for Defence and his officials who supplied the material, were not in agreement in regard to its content.  This was what was known as a &ldquo;package&rdquo; programme, that is, it was initiated, prepared and recorded entirely outside Radio Éireann by a contributor who presented the completed tape.  Until <Col N="646" /> the recording was accepted by Radio Éireann it had no responsibility for the material or its presentation.  As I stated, Radio Éireann did not accept it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will reconcile Section 23?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  This Bill represents an important measure of law reform.  It is technical and, to some extent, intricate.  I think that the wish of the majority of Deputies in those circumstances will be to get the best possible measure.  Indeed, I know that it is the earnest desire of the various institutions and establishments whose interests will be directly affected by this Bill that we should get the best possible measure.  Therefore, to say the least of it, it is undesirable for the Leader of the Opposition to debate the Bill in the manner in which he has and to attempt to procure some slight political Party advantage in his approach.</P>
      <P>In my opening speech, I was very careful to outline fully the whole history of this measure.  I traced it from its origins and I did not in any way attempt to take any credit for anything in the Bill or to say what I had done or had not done.  Even now, under the provocation which the Leader of the Opposition has offered me personally, I do not intend to attempt to take credit for what has been done because I am fully conscious&mdash;as, indeed, I am sure, every Deputy is conscious&mdash;that a very great deal of credit for a technical measure of this nature should go to those who are not in a position themselves to take that credit&mdash;those who work quietly and unobtrusively behind the scenes and who bring their very great skill, experience and technical knowledge to bear on producing this type of Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the record, however, I shall say that the preliminary steps in regard to this Bill were taken by a Fianna Fáil Government.  The work in relation to it was continued by the Coalition Government which followed and now we hope that the Bill will be brought to fruition by the present Government. These are the simple facts of the situation <Col N="655" /> and I readily admit them.  I am prepared to give whatever credit is due anywhere it belongs and, as I say, I do not want to attempt to procure any Party political advantage in any way.  I think it is wrong for anybody else to attempt to do so either.  As this is a technical and difficult Bill, we should concern ourselves with arriving at the best possible result.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan criticised me along these lines.  He said the Parliamentary Secretary failed to get a definition and came along here instead with a rather weak substitute in the form of advice to testators and draftsmen. I do not consider that criticism fair.  The advice I gave in my opening statement is perfectly sound advice, well worth giving.  I suggest that anybody introducing a Bill of this nature, no matter what the state of the existing law was or is likely to become, might legitimately give that advice.  No definition that could be evolved or procured would cure bad drafting.  No matter what we do in this Bill, it still behoves the draftsmen and practitioners to be careful to ensure that the wishes of testators and donors are given effect to in proper language that will not lead to a dispute as to interpretation.</P>
    <P>On the question of a definition, I should like to quote from the Newark Committee which, as I have already mentioned, reported in the Six Counties recently.  They say:</P>
    <P>In any event, previous experience in other branches of the law tends to suggest that a statutory definition would become merely a starting point for a fresh body of case law to develop.</P>
    <P>I think that is very true and very well put.  It is a statement of which we should take serious note.  Further, on this point of definition, I think we should keep in mind that many of our charities have trans-Border implications. From that point of view and for other reasons, it is most desirable that the law in both parts of this country should correspond.  If we had a statutory definition of what was charitable that was not followed in the Six <Col N="656" /> Counties a difficult situation could arise.  I am glad to say that the thinking in Belfast so far as I am aware of it, is the same as ours in this matter.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed by what Deputy Sheldon had to say on the question of a definition.  He very rightly pointed out that the concept of charity is a changing one.  Today we have a new factor in the situation, namely, the welfare State.  The position with us falls short of what might be described as a welfare State, but at least we have a considerable growth in social services. This must affect the concept of charity.  Moreover, social conditions are changing all the time and it would be well to pause before committing oneself irrevocably to a watertight statutory definition of what is and what is not charitable.  I reiterate that they have in England grappled with the definition problem, but decided not to proceed with one, so that I feel sure the House will agree that criticism of this Bill, based on the fact that it does not contain a definition of charity, is not a very good criticism.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any force either in the argument that we propose to allow the Charity Commissioners to vary or alter <i>cy-près</i> schemes which have been framed by the courts.  I do not think it is relevant in that context to consider who devised the original scheme.  The point is that the scheme has failed.  A scheme framed by the courts is just as likely to fail with the effluxion of time and to become impracticable or illegal as one framed by somebody else.  There is no question of the Charity Commissioners overruling the courts.  It is simply a question of a situation arising where the <i>cy-près</i> doctrine must be applied again because the court scheme has failed.  The proposal is that, if the court scheme fails, the Commissioners may prepare another scheme.  I think it was Deputy Dillon who asked why we are doing this.  The overriding consideration is the question of expense. The whole idea behind giving <i>cy-près</i> powers to the Charity Commissioners and, indeed, increasing those powers, <Col N="657" /> is to enable charities to be spared the expense of going to court to have schemes drafted and settled.</P>
    <P>Somebody quite rightly remarked during the course of the debate that the discussion we had on Section 13 was more appropriate to Committee Stage than Second Stage, but I should just like to deal briefly with the arguments put forward.  As was indicated, this is a thing which has its roots in history.  Originally, the statutory provisions were that certain judges were <i>ex officio</i> Charity Commissioners. Deputy Dillon, with a characteristic wave of his hands, and invoking the simple people of Ireland to whom he frequently has recourse, asked could we not get these people freely, without having High Court judges.  That is an over-simplification of the position; indeed, it is a misrepresentation. Men of the kind who serve as Charity Commissioners are very scarce.  Ideally, they are men of skill, knowledge, a great deal of experience and they are people of integrity.  Men of the requisite calibre are scarce.  It is wrong for the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that there are so many of that type of person around that there is no need to put on the Board a person who might subsequently become a judge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I suggested was that, if he became a judge, he might properly withdraw from the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy went on to say that if a person withdraws or resigns from the Board, on being appointed a judge, he could easily be replaced.  I want to refute that.  I think it is not true.  People of the necessary qualifications are scarce and, unless there were some overwhelming and compelling reason why a judge should withdraw from the Board, I think it would be undesirable that he should do so.  Section 13 merely states that a judge shall not be prevented from hearing a case affecting a charity simply because he is a member of the Charity Commissioners. It goes no further than that. The normal etiquette which prevails amongst the judiciary still applies. Any judge, when a case comes before <Col N="658" /> him, will properly ask himself whether or not there is any factor that would prevent him, in accordance with the traditions and practice of the judiciary, hearing it.  Apart from Section 13, every judge will do that, and all that we are saying is that just because he is a Charity Commissioner, he will not, because of that fact alone, be debarred from hearing a case which has a charity content.  I cannot see any danger in that situation and am absolutely happy with regard to it.  I have complete confidence in the normal principles and traditions on which the judiciary operate in these matters. These principles and traditions will take care of any fears which Deputy Dillon may entertain.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the section concerning audits, especially to the provision in regard to perjury.  I realise that we have no modern Perjury Act in this country and I feel sure the House generally will agree that this is a very great lack.  Matters of perjury fall to be determined mostly under the common law.  I shall be glad to have another look at the provision, referred to by the Deputy, to see whether it is in need of revision. It is a little significant, however, that Deputy McGilligan, in a different capacity, approved of the text of the Bill which contains this very provision. However, I suppose he is perfectly entitled to come along at a later stage and take a different view.</P>
      <P>He also raised the question of the publication of notices of charitable bequests.  I have received recommendations from the Charity Commissioners in this matter and I am considering them at the moment.  I am aware that the Newark Committee's view is that publication should not be necessary, unless the Commissioners direct it; in other words, that the situation be the reverse of what it is at the moment.  The position now is that publication is obligatory, unless the Commissioners exempt from publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question which engaged the attention of most of the Deputies who spoke was that of investment, and here I have some pleasure in agreeing with a lot of what Deputy Dillon said, <Col N="659" /> and also with what Deputy Sheldon said.  Deputy Dillon pointed out quite rightly that the fiscal history of the past 50 years or so is one of decrease in the value of trustee investments. I believe the principle that should obtain in the matter of investing trust funds should be the avoidance of speculation.  It is desirable that, in order to avoid speculation, there should be the maximum amount of flexibility available to trustees. The safest way of avoiding excessive fluctuations is to have a satisfactory spread of investment.  The management of an investment portfolio in modern times, if the best results are to be achieved, involves a very considerable degree of flexibility and a considerable freedom of choice.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that the policy of the present Government, as enshrined in the 1958 Act, has been brought into being.  It is important to realise that, up to now, the court, in charity matters, had complete freedom to do more or less as it wished.  Funds could be invested inside or outside the State, and in any security.  The Bill makes a change in line with Government policy, and investments of charity funds must be kept within the State.  Section 32 is designed to enable the Charity Commissioners to invest and authorise the investment of trustee funds in a wide range of securities, including ordinary shares. There is no obligation on them to invest in all the securities now being authorised, but it is desirable that they should have a wide range to choose from.</P>
    <P>It will be recognised that an ideal way of investing funds today is to put a certain proportion into fixed securities, a certain proportion into less fixed securities and finally to put the remaining proportion into equities which do not have the same degree of absolute security as gilt-edged securities but which give an opportunity of capital appreciation and of substantial return in the form of income.  All we propose in Section 32 is to allow that sort of flexibility for investments of charity funds.  We can be sure that the charity commissioners and charity <Col N="660" /> trustees will have available to them first-class professional advice with regard to investments.  Nobody today need go out and invest funds and hope for the best.  As in most other things, there is readily available skilled professional advice in these matters; and I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the charity commissioners will make full use of such advice.  The fears expressed by Deputies with regard to our giving these extended powers of investment to the charity commissioners and charity trustees generally are groundless.</P>
    <P>May I, in conclusion, mention one point touched upon by Deputy Booth? He asked that the Government should bear in mind in appointing Charity Commissioners in the future the desirability of having a mixed Board.  He pointed out that the fact that in the past this Board had been mixed had, in his opinion, helped considerably in achieving the measure of success achieved by the Board in the performance of difficult and delicate duties. I agree fully.  Also I am sure all here agree that it is inconceivable in modern Ireland, as we know it, in the sort of society we have succeeded in building up here for ourselves, that there should be any question of a body such as the Charity Commissioners not continuing to be mixed in its memberships in the same way as it has been in the past.  I do not think there are any other matters which I need comment upon at this stage except to recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition will recall that what I said was that the Charity Commissioners do not contest actions.  That is quite true.  I did not state that they could not legally do so; I said they do not <Col N="661" /> do so, and neither do they, as a matter of practice.  Apart from that, if the Leader of the Opposition will study Section 23 carefully, he will see it has a very restricted, narrow application. It deals purely with the case where the Board sue for the recovery of charitable gifts improperly withheld, concealed or misapplied.  Even then, the Charity Commissioners could do that only with the consent of the Attorney General.  They would be the instrument of the Attorney General in counteracting a fraud.  This is a completely different sort of thing from what the Leader of the Opposition was speaking about when I contradicted him and said the Charity Commissioners do not contest actions.  As a matter of practice they do not.  Suing for the recovery of money misapplied is not contesting an action.</P>

      <P>In Question No. 26 on today's Order Paper, I asked the Minister for Defence what objection he had to a radio programme on Civil Defence, and the replies to the Question were so unsatisfactory that I asked your permission, Sir, to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The Minister indicated quite clearly that as a result of representations by him a decision had been made to ban a broadcast on Civil Defence which had been prepared by Proinsias MacAonghusa, a radio programme contractor and independent radio producer.</P>
      <P>The idea of having a programme on Civil Defence was initiated by Mr. MacAonghusa, who is well known in this country as a programme contractor and producer.  As far back as August, he contacted a Mr. Fay of the Department of Defence and Mr. Francis McManus of the General Features Office of Radio Éireann suggesting that a programme on Civil Defence should be produced by him and broadcast by Radio Éireann.  The title of the proposed programme was &ldquo;Civil Defence, 1960.&rdquo;  The suggestion was acknowledged and subsequently it was agreed in principle. Discussions took place between Mr. MacAonghusa and Mr. McManus on the layout of the programme and it was agreed it should take place on Sunday, October 23rd, 1960.</P>

      <P>I am reading from notes.  Subsequently, on the suggestion of Mr. McManus, Mr. MacAonghusa was in touch with Mr. Fay representing the Department of Defence, and discussions took place with regard to the presentation of this programme.  At the very commencement of the proceedings it was made plain by the producer of the programme <Col N="663" /> that there would be no question, as far as he was concerned, of censorship of the broadcast, that he was an independent producer and that in accordance with practice the producer of these programmes would not be prepared to accept censorship in these particular programmes; while it would be quite proper and reasonable to operate on the basis of consultations as regards the editing of the programme, the actual content would be a matter which would be left to the discretion of the producer.  This was made quite clear and was accepted by Mr. Fay on the initial occasion when these matters were discussed.</P>
      <P>Subsequently discussions took place regarding the personnel of the programme and the manner in which the programme would be organised.  As it was a question of the civil defence of the country, the authorities that should be approached in connection with the programme were also discussed. I understand that originally it was thought by Mr. Mac Aonghusa that the Minister for External Affairs might be interested.  The suggestion has been made that a civil defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will forgive me; I may be under a misapprehension.  I understood the Deputy to say that the producer required a guarantee that this script would not be censored.  Now, that raises a doubt in my mind as to whether it was the producer who was buying time or Radio Éireann which was to pay the producer.  Perhaps the Deputy would let me know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an interview between the producer and Mr. Fay who does not represent Radio Éireann and who I understand is connected with the Department of Defence and the producer would not be prepared to accept censorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; I thought it was Radio Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements were then made&mdash;it is not necessary to go into all the details&mdash;to have recordings made by officers of the Civil Defence Organisation.  The Minister <Col N="664" /> for Defence was consulted and indicated that he was prepared to broadcast, to be included in the programme. A contract was made and the President of Ireland also indicated that he was willing to be associated with the programme and to make a statement which would come in at the end of the programme.</P>
      <P>The technical problem of arranging for the preparation and presentation of the programme, like all other such programmes, was very difficult and complex.  One of the problems arose from the fact that the complete recording of the statements of the parties concerned and interviews between Mr. Mac Aonghusa and members of the civil defence movement here in Dublin involved a total period of something over an hour and thirty minutes.</P>
      <P>This, Mr. Mac Aonghusa was informed, was too long and it was necessary, therefore, that he should reduce the content by editing it.  This is a normal procedure.  Having gone through the various steps of editing and preparing a final recording for Radio Éireann he was advised on Thursday, October 20th&mdash;Radio Éireann having received the final recording&mdash;that it was completely acceptable to them. That was on Thursday, October 20th. However, on the following day, Friday, Mr. Fay contacted Radio Éireann and indicated, on behalf of the Minister for Defence, that he had certain objections to make.  He stated that the broadcast was not satisfactory to the Minister and he insisted that arrangements be made to have the recording played over on the Saturday morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During all this period, from August, through September and into October, officials of Radio Éireann were dealing and were familiar with the developments taking place and the preparations that were being made.  At no stage was any objection made by Radio Éireann except in regard to the query about the programme, as originally conceived, being too long.  However, on the Friday this question was brought to their attention and, to the surprise and consternation of those who had been dealing with this matter, <Col N="665" /> the Minister for Defence appeared to take exception to the programme being played without his hearing it and without his permission being given.  On Saturday morning arrangements were made to have the programme played in Radio Éireann to facilitate the Minister for Defence, who attended with officers of his Department.</P>
    <P>At this stage the Minister indicated that he had objections to the programme being broadcast.  Members of Radio Éireann, leading members, programme directors, and acting directors, etc., were present and at no stage had they indicated that there was anything wrong in their view with this programme. It appears that the only point raised in connection with this was by the Minister and on the basis that people might have a view other than the view he holds on the question of the value in modern times of civil defence.</P>

      <P>The broadcast transcript of the programme was produced and presented by Proinsias Mac Aonghusa and due to be broadcast by Radio Éireann on Sunday, October 23rd at 7.45 p.m.  It was objected to by the Minister for Defence on Saturday, 22nd October.  No objection was lodged by any other person and it appears that following the Minister's visit to Radio Éireann, accompanied by the Secretary of the Department and other people, at about 12.35 p.m. on Saturday afternoon, the decision was taken that the programme should not be proceeded with.</P>

    <P>The Minister is entitled to express his opinion and Deputies are entitled to express theirs.  The people outside this House are entitled to know, on this very important question of Civil Defence particularly in case of the use of nuclear armaments, what their position is and what the future may <Col N="666" /> hold for them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This appears to be the only paragraph in it that appears to cause the Minister for Defence some perturbation.  This is paragraph 2 which reads:</P>
      <P>R.A.S. Crawford, Senior Technical Officer, Civil Defence Organisation:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a one megation nuclear weapon fifty times as powerful as the Hiroshima atom bomb had fallen near O'Connell Bridge, Dublin, very briefly conditions might be something like this.  First of all a huge fireball nearly a mile and a half in diameter would be formed, and would shoot upwards into the sky, at the same time emitting a tremendous flash of light and heat, which would last for several seconds.  This could ignite inflammable materials about five miles away.  Then a huge mushroom cloud with a flat top would be formed.  It might be about 18 miles across and about 13 miles high, and a crater would be left in the ground which might be more <Col N="668" /> than a quarter of a mile wide and a hundred feet deep.  Now let's consider the blast effects.  Up to one and a half miles from O'Connell Bridge nearly all buildings would be completely demolished and most people in that area would be dead.  Now that one and a half mile ring would extend as far as Drumcondra, King's Bridge, Ranelagh and Ringsend.  From one and a half miles to about six miles there would be heavy damage to buildings and a large number of people would be trapped in them and would require to be rescued.  The heat flash would start many fires in this area and people who were exposed to this heat flash might get their skin charred or blistered.  This circle would extend to Collinstown, Clondalkin, Sandyford, Dun Laoire and Baldoyle.</P>
    <P>That is part of the proposed programme and commenting on it Proinsias MacAonghusa says:</P>
    <P>This is the age of the nuclear bomb.  That horrifying noise you heard a few minutes ago was that of an Hydrogen Bomb exploding. R.A.S.  Crawford, senior technical officer of the Irish Civil Defence Service, has described what might happen if an H-Bomb were to fall in the centre of Dublin City.  In fact the effects might be far greater than those he described and it is highly unlikely that they would be less severe.  Britain has the Bomb; France is well on the way to producing one; the Soviet Union is believed to have sufficient Bombs to wipe Great Britain and most of the United States practically off the face of the earth; America has enough H-Bombs to blow up the world.  Other countries have the knowledge and materials to produce the weapon.  Without doubt, if war were to break out, whether by design or accident, the world as we know it would be destroyed.  But men might live on.  Some believe that the Eskimos in the North would survive and that the nomadic tribes of the North African desert would live.  The rest of mankind would die <Col N="669" /> a fearful, horrible death.  You in Galway, you in, Cork, you in Antrim, you in Dublin.  You and your children, your friends, your relations, your neighbours.  All you innocent people will die frightful deaths if America attacks Russia, if Russia attacks America, if they accidentally attack one another.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy's time has now expired, I must call on the Minister to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, the broadcast was banned by the Minister and I put it to him that was a completely wrong thing to do, to interfere with Radio Éireann and the producer in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the statement issued by the Government Information Bureau adequately explained what happened in regard to this matter. Since some Deputies are prepared to take the view of the sensational English Sunday newspapers I want to explain what happened in somewhat more detail in the short time at my disposal.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, my Department were approached by Mr. Mac Aonghusa with the request that they should co-operate with him in the production of a radio feature on Civil Defence. He explained that he is a person who is engaged in the business of producing radio programmes and selling them to Radio Éireann.  Naturally, since my Department is charged by the Government with the organisation of Civil Defence, they wanted to know some more details in regard to the nature of the proposed programme and, as Deputy Larkin has said, the producer presented the Director of Civil Defence with an outline of the proposed programme. I have that outline here but I do not think it is necessary to read it.  I think, however, it is clear from it that what the producer had in mind was that a number of items would be supplied by my Department or arranged by the Department of Defence and that they would be linked together by him and presented to Radio Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> Following the friendly conversation they had with the producer, my Department believed in his <i>bona fides</i>; that he was genuine and that this was what he intended to do; but before agreeing to co-operate, the Department insisted on the condition that the final programme to be presented would be submitted to the Department in the first instance and that there should be mutual agreement on its content before it was submitted to Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I might as well say that there was no question of censorship.  It was a question of the producer and the civil defence section of my Department co-operating in the production of a programme and this condition was accepted from the outset by the producer. Not alone that, but in the period during which the programme was being prepared he was reminded of this agreement on a number of occasions by the officers of my Department and on each occasion the excuse he gave for not bringing it in was that the programme was not ready.  There was no suggestion that he intended to dishonour his undertaking but, from statements he made subsequently, it is quite clear that that is what he intended to do from the very start.</P>
    <P>In regard to the circumstances in which the effort made to circumvent the arrangement to submit it to my Department for agreement before submitting it to Radio Éireann was forestalled, it is quite clear that there was no question of censorship or banning of any programme of Radio Éireann by me or any other Minister. What happened was that having eventually heard the programme in Radio Éireann, not having heard it in my own office as had been promised, but having succeeded in hearing it in Radio Éireann, I pointed out to the Radio Éireann authorities who were present, the obvious fact that 90 per cent. of the programme had been supplied by the Department of Defence and this had been done on the undertaking that there would be mutual agreement on the content of the completed programme before it was submitted to Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> I also pointed out that this undertaking, which had been freely given by the producer, had not been carried out and that now when, in fact, we had succeeded in hearing the programme, we found we could not agree to it for a number of reasons&mdash;in the first place, the fact that these allegations against the justification for and the sincerity of Civil Defence which were to be made at the outset of the programme had been concealed from the officers of my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Concealed&rdquo; is a very strong word.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, before I recorded my own statement Mr. Mac Aonghusa's assistant played over to me what he represented as the portion of the programme that would precede my statement and, in his presence, the Director of Civil Defence outlined to me what he had been informed by Mr. Mac Aonghusa would follow my contribution. The statement I subsequently recorded was naturally based on the assurance that I had been made aware of the nature of the rest of the programme.</P>
      <P>We are not afraid to answer criticisms of Civil Defence; we know there is a contrary point of view and if I had been aware that the contrary point of view was the one that would be given emphasis in the programme, naturally, in agreeing to take part, I would have answered that in the statement I made.  In addition to that I pointed out that the case for Civil Defence, which had been very well made by the Director of Civil Defence, had been interfered with by the producer, not alone without authority, but against the direct and definite instructions that were given.  Certain points had been omitted which the Director of Civil Defence and I myself had said were essential for the presentation of our case and in respect of which the producer gave a specific undertaking that these three important points would be included.  However, these were omitted, and deliberately omitted, in order to make the case made by the Director of Civil Defence as weak as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> I pointed out to the Radio Éireann authorities that not alone were we not allowed to hear the programme but that the material supplied had been manhandled in this unscrupulous and deceitful way, and the very fact that this was done had been concealed from us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When we pointed out that we had in fact supplied this programme to the producer under the agreement that it would be submitted to us before being submitted to Radio Éireann, that the material supplied by us had been mutilated and doctored without authority by the producer and that this propaganda designed to promote a feeling of hopelessness and despair that is entirely foreign to our people had been surreptitiously inserted into the programme by the producer, the Radio Éireann authorities decided they would not accept the programme for broadcasting since the producer had failed to honour his undertaking and submit an agreed programme.</P>

      <P>When the Department of Defence was first approached by this producer seeking co-operation in a civil defence programme he stated to the Department that he had got the idea because he had been so impressed by the speech and tUachtarán made on the subject of Civil Defence to Muintir na Tíre.  He said he got the idea that a follow-up programme on similar lines would do a great amount of good and that he proposed, with our assistance, to put that idea into effect.  He has since put it on record that, before the approached my Department at all, he was firmly of the opinion that Civil Defence was a gigantic fraud in which, apparently, every Government in the world is implicated.  Obviously, then, he had a different type of programme from that which he described to us in mind from the very start and it is obvious that it was always his intention to slip this doctored programme through in breach of his definite and repeated agreement with my Department.  In other words, it is obvious, as I said earlier today, that he obtained the material for his programme from the Department of Defence under false pretences and with the deliberate intention of maltreating it in the way in which he did maltreat it in order to suit his own purposes and the purposes of those people with whom he is associated.</P>

      <P>The Minister ought to give all the circumstances.  He said there were three points but never gave them.</P>

      <P>I said he deliberately omitted the most important part of the case for Civil Defence <Col N="674" /> which was made by the Director of Civil Defence.</P>

      <P>If I did not say it before I say it now, that he substituted statements for questions and I have said he inserted material which he concealed from us and which, of course, if we knew it was going to be inserted into the programme, would have been answered by me and by the Director of Civil Defence.  It is quite obvious that we, being charged with the organisation of Civil Defence, would not take part in a programme unless we felt the case that we had to make for Civil Defence would be given fair play.  Surely no Deputy will believe that any Government Department, any experienced civil servant, would place himself completely in the hands of a person such as this without getting some assurances as to the manner in which the material, which was arranged for and supplied by my Department, would be handled?</P>
      <P>That is a statement of what happened.  I think it is quite obvious to anybody that the material was obtained from the Department of Defence under false pretences and that an effort was made by the producer to slip the programme through in breach of the definite undertaking which he gave to the Department before we agreed to supply him with the material for the programme which he proposed to sell to Radio Éireann when he had it completed.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 9th November, 1960.</P>
