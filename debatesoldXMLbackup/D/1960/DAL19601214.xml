      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, following on the quarterly inquiry into national average retail prices on 14th November, 1960, he will now give the information requested on 26th October last as to the actual increase and the percentage variation in the national average retail price of flour and bread reflecting the recent increases of 7/9d. per sack of retail flour and of 1/2d. in the 2-lb. loaf, which were announced in the press and came into operation on the 5th and 19th September, respectively; and if he will state the national average retail price at mid-February, 1957, mid-February, 1960, and mid-November, 1960 of (a) a stone of flour and (b) a 2-lb. loaf of bread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>Between mid-August and mid-November, 1960, the national average retail price of a 2-lb. loaf of bread, as ascertained at the Consumer Price Index Inquiry, increased by 0.44d. or by 3.0 per cent. The increase in the average price of a quarter stone of flour in the same period was 1.19d. or 5.1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national average retail prices at mid-February, 1957, mid-February, 1960, and mid-November, 1960, were: (a) Flour (3½ lbs.) 12.63d., 23.28d. and <Col N="1070" /> 24.53d. and (b) bread (2-lb. loaf) 9.09d. 14.62d. and 15.35d.</P>
    <P>Since 1960 the unit of flour priced is 3½ lbs. and the price now quoted for mid-February, 1957, represents one-fourth of the price returned for a stone of flour at that date.  Prices quoted, for the purpose of calculating the Consumer Price Index number, relate to a quality of each commodity in substantial demand in the area reported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the national average retail price of the food items included in the Consumer Price Index at mid-February, 1957 and at mid-November, 1960, and the actual increase and the percentage increase in each case.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement which gives the national average retail prices of certain food items at mid-February, 1957, and mid-November, 1960, together with the change in prices of these items and the percentage change over the period in the individual items and for all food items included in the Consumer Price Index. In the case of certain food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful.  The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive enquiries.  Price quotations in respect of some items of food are not available from all centres at each enquiry and the figures for the percentage changes in these prices, computed in such a way as to eliminate the effect of differences in coverage, may differ slightly from the percentages calculated from the actual changes.</P>
      <P>In comparing prices at mid-February and mid-November it must be remembered that prices of certain food items fluctuate seasonally and that allowance must be made for this factor.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <P>Feeding barley is not separately distinguished from other barley in the compilation of export statistics and the only relevant information available relates to the total exports of barley (unmilled). In the twelve months ended 31st October, 1960, the quantity of barley (unmilled, excluding seed barley) exported was 684,672 cwt. to a value (f.o.b.) of £760,279.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in a reply of 7th instant he included turf as a part of increased agricultural production; and, if so, what percentage increase this factor represented.</P>

      <P>The aggregates of agricultural output used in the preparation of the figures given in the reply of 7th instant included the output of turf by the farming community in each of the years involved, but did not include turf produced by commercial enterprises.  If turf is excluded from total agricultural output then the changes in the volume of agricultural output in the periods mentioned in the earlier reply are altered somewhat.</P>
      <P>On this altered basis it is estimated that in the ten years 1926/27 and 1936/37 the volume of agricultural output increased by 2.8 per cent., between 1936/37 and 1946 there was a decline of 7.2 per cent.  while in the ten year period 1946 to 1956 the volume of output increased by 21.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>In the ten years between 1942/43 and 1952 there was an increase of 10.5 per cent.  in the volume of output, while in the seven years 1952-1959 the increase was 13.9 per cent.  Over the whole period 1926/27 to 1959 the volume of agricultural output (excluding turf) rose by 20.3 per cent.</P>

      <P>There is no provision for the making of such arrangements in the Pharmacy Acts.  Legislation is, however, in course of preparation in my Department under which the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland would be enabled to register persons who have, outside the State, undergone certain satisfactory training and passed appropriate <Col N="1077" /> examinations.  If such legislation is enacted it will be open to the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland to seek an arrangement with the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain for the mutual recognition of each other's qualifications.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9 together.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the reprehensible innuendo in the first two questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A qualified assistant is a person who, having passed the preliminary examination of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, equivalent to Leaving Certificate, or Matriculation of the National University of Ireland, having served a three years apprenticeship in an approved pharmacy and having attended a full-time course of one term's duration in the College of <Col N="1078" /> Pharmacy has passed the Pharmaceutical Assistants Examination and been admitted to the register of Pharmaceutical Assistants.  The difference in the negotiated salaries between that of a qualified assistant and that of a qualified chemist, point for point on the scale, is small.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Pharmacy Act (Ireland), 1875, Amendment Act, 1890 provides that a qualified assistant may &ldquo;transact the business of a licentiate of the Pharmaceutical Society or of a registered dispensing chemist and druggist in his temporary absence but shall not be entitled to conduct or manage a business or to keep open shop on their own account.,, The term &ldquo;temporary absence,, is not defined.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that it is necessary for me to take any action in the matter.</P>

The direct return to the Exchequer is not, however, a full measure of the earnings of the investments as profits earned by some concerns are retained and used towards the financing of their capital programmes.

      <P>It has always been the practice to pay workers on bog development and employment schemes fortnightly and I am not aware that it causes difficulties as suggested by the Deputy.  Fortnightly payments are I understand also the rule with almost all county councils.  The proposal to pay workers on bog development and employment schemes weekly instead of fortnightly has been very fully considered on a number of occasions, but it is regretted that it has not been found possible to adopt this alternative.  Weekly payments would (a) necessitate an increase in clerical staffs at a cost out of all proportion to the benefits likely to be secured and (b) mean that technical staff would have to devote an undue proportion of their time to paysheet work at the expense of supervision.</P>

Does the Minister not agree that there is a grave hardship where a person is signed on from the Labour Exchange on a Tuesday, goes to work and does not get paid until the next Friday fortnight?

      <P>The Deputy will thus see that Mr. MacLeod did not explicitly state that the British Government definitely intends to legislate in this field.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice in relation to the complaint of forcible and unlawful detention of Tuesday, 7th June, 1960, made by a member of the South Tipperary County Council, whether, subsequent to the forwarding on the 29th June, 1960, to the Department of Local Government of the complete Garda report on the matter, (1) any other report or information on the matter was forwarded by his Department to the Department of Local Government before the 16th November, 1960, and (2) the Department of Local Government requested any further information before the 16th November, 1960; and, if so, if he will state the dates of such reports and requests.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer to the Question is that, apart from a notification to the Department of Local Government that two of the accused persons had been returned for trial to Clonmel Circuit Court, and a subsequent notification that the trial had been transferred to the Central Criminal Court, no written Garda reports relating to <Col N="1093" /> the case were sent to the Department of Local Government during the period in question.</P>
    <P>However, on dates in September, October and November, my Department confirmed, by telephone, to the Department of Local Government, in reply, to enquiries made by them, that the Garda Siochána had not obtained any information over and above that which was contained in the main Garda report sent to them on 29th June and that no opinion could be expressed as to when the criminal charges were likely to be disposed of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice why the Garda Síochána do not institute proceedings for assault in cases where, as appears from, evidence given in civil actions, teachers in primary schools have committed serious assaults on pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be several good reasons why the Garda Síochána have not instituted proceedings in particular cases where teachers were alleged to have assaulted pupils but there is no reason in principle why they should not do so if the assault is obviously serious.</P>
      <P>In practice, such proceedings are rarely taken by the Garda Síochána and the principal reason for this is that very few cases are reported to them.</P>
      <P>If a case is reported to the Garda Síochána, it is dealt with by them on the same basis as any other complaint about an assault, namely, that where they do not witness an assault themselves, the Garda Síochána normally will institute proceedings only where there is clear evidence&mdash;such as bruises or the like&mdash;that goes to prove that the assault was serious.  Where such objective evidence is not available, they leave it to the injured party to institute proceedings, either civil or criminal, himself.  I need not stress that the fact that a civil action may succeed does not mean that criminal proceedings would succeed or would be justified.</P>
      <P>If, however, there had been cases in which the Garda Síochána did not institute proceedings where assaults were committed and where there was clear evidence that they were serious assaults, I think that it can safely be assumed that the reason is that the parents either did not report the matter at all to the Garda Síochána or subsequently decided that they did not want to proceed with a criminal charge&mdash;preferring perhaps to rely on civil proceedings.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice why the Garda Síochána <Col N="1095" /> did not institute proceedings for assault against the teacher who is reported to have attacked and knocked unconscious a young child in a national school in County Mayo, who was successful in a resultant action for damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Question raises a matter of principle which I should like to bring to the Deputy's notice.</P>
      <P>I cannot undertake to go into the merits of a Garda decision, to institute or not to institute proceedings in a particular case.  I have no function in such a matter and, if I were to comment, it would inevitably mean that directly or indirectly I would be expressing an opinion on the case, which it would obviously be improper for me to do.  A person who is aggrieved by a Garda decision not to prosecute has the remedy of instituting such proceedings himself.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, the most that I can properly do by way of answering the Question is to draw the Deputy's attention, to the general reply which I have given to the previous Question, in which it was pointed out that it is not the practice for the Garda Síochána to institute proceedings in such cases unless there are visible marks that go to prove the seriousness of the assault.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is not unnecessary interference with Christmas shopping but that, on the contrary, Christmas shoppers, as well as the general body of road users, are greatly facilitated by the new arrangements, including the rigid enforcement of the &ldquo;no-waiting rule&rdquo; in the streets to which it applies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, would he not consider waiving the regulations which restrict parking to 20 minutes? Is he not aware there has been a very considerable decline in the volume of business transacted in retail stores in the centre of the city?  Does he not advert to the fact that one of the purposes of traffic regulations is to facilitate people to come into the city to transact their business, and that a very great mitigation of the present inconvenience would result from extending the period during which individuals may park their cars in authorised parking places from 20 minutes to, say, an hour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied, from meeting deputations of Dublin traders and from my own personal investigations, that there is no serious volume of interference with Christmas shopping in any way.  The Deputy will realise that by far the vast majority of Christmas shoppers use the buses, and in so as far as the new regulations have made it possible to have a free flow of traffic, they have convenienced the majority.  The main reason for the enforcement of the no-waiting rule and the 20 minute waiting rule is to deal with the person who parks his car in the street all day.  The fact that we have succeeded in eliminating that type of parking in the central city area has been generally welcomed by both shoppers and traders.</P>

Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise you can come in on some roads to Dublin at present and you might as well be motoring across the Sahara, because you would not see a car at all?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider that the concession of extending the parking period from 20 minutes to an hour, thus allowing something more like the normal volume of business to be transacted, would be a very great mitigation and would encourage people to come into town who are not now coming?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that that is a most misleading statement to make as regards the procedure of C.I.E.?  C.I.E. have definitely refused to meet a deputation of representative people of West Cork in connection with the closing down of <Col N="1102" /> the railways.

      <P>Do you not think that the Minister ought to answer that question?  There are points of principle arising.  My recollection is that when we discussed the Transport Act the present Taoiseach was asked to incorporate a provision in the Bill requiring C.I.E. on request to discuss a decision to close railway line.  He is on the official record as saying that he does not think it is necessary because he has provided a fortnight during which it would be ridiculous to imagine that Córas Iompair Éireann would not discuss the proposed closure with local authorities or other representative bodies.  On that personal <Col N="1103" /> undertaking of the Taoiseach the matter was dropped.  Córas Iompair Éireann now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(a) On the 30th November, 1960, the number of people employed in the Shannon Free Airport Industrial Estate (i) in manufacturing, processing, or in any way producing goods for export was 287 and (ii) in factory building operations was 208. The greatest numbers employed at any time in (i) was the figure of 287 already mentioned and in (ii) was 240.  Employment is given by the following firms:&mdash; Progress International Ltd., Lana-Knit (Ireland) Ltd., Sony Ltd., Standard Pressed Steel International Ltd., Rippen Ltd., Chinchilla (Shannon) Limited.</P>
      <P>(b) In the case of one firm commercial production has not yet commenced but the machinery is being installed.  In the case of three of the firms some of the machinery for the first planned stage of production has not yet been put into operation but has been ordered.  Separate statistics are not kept of exports from the Shannon Free Airport Industrial Estate.  In the six months period 1st April to 30th September, 1960, 186,212 lbs. of goods produced by the factories were exported by air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) Grants under Section 8 of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Act to the 30th <Col N="1108" /> November, 1960, amounted to £147,000.  No contribution was made to the firms for exports (i) by the State by way of loan but firms may qualify in due course for tax remissions under the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1958 and (ii) the question of remission of rates has not so far arisen as the factory buildings have not yet been valued for rating purposes.</P>
    <P>(d) With the exception of the special factory constructed by the piano manufacturer to his own specification, the factory bays in the zone are built to a standard design by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. and are financed out of State capital invested in the Company under Section 2 of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd.  Act, 1959. To date 10 days have been completed; a further 10 are under construction and will be completed by 31st March, 1961.  The cost of these 20 bays is estimated at £890,000.

    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> These figures for generating capacity represent the installed capacity at the time of the peak load.  The rating of the Pigeon House Station as shown in the annual reports of the Board is 95,000 KW but the station, which is an old and uneconomic station, is effective only to the extent of 55,000 KW.</P>
    <P>These figures should be interpreted in the light of my reply on the 7th December to a question put down by Deputy Lindsay in which I indicated, <i>inter alia</i>, that when there is a shortage of water for the hydro stations, which usually occurs in the Autumn, the steam stations must make good the deficiency and in the last two years when water supplies were at lowest, all the steam stations including both turf and coal/oil stations had to be used at times to maximum output capacity.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will find the whole matter very aptly illustrated in Appendix 13 to the Board's Annual Reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves <Col N="1114" /> of the scheme for contributory pensions for Members entitled Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pensions Scheme which was made by a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas on 1st December, 1960, and forms the Appendix to the Committee's Report (T.175) which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 8th December, 1960.</P>
    <P>I assume that most members are aware of the provisions of this motion and, therefore, no very minute explanation is required from me.  Deputies know that legislative provision for this motion was made in the Bill dealing with the allowances to Deputies and Senators passed last year.  It is under the provision in that Bill that this motion has been brought in.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the passing of the Bill the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, constituted of both Houses, appointed an informal committee which spent a good deal of time in producing a scheme generally acceptable to the two Houses.  We are indebted to the Committee for the time and labour they put into their task. This is a group scheme of a kind which might, indeed, be adopted by any group in the country.  It is entirely contributory and will get no contribution whatsoever from the State.  If approved by the House, contributions will be taken compulsorily at source from the allowances paid to every Deputy and Senator.</P>
    <P>Superannuation will be payable to any Deputy or Senator with more than ten years' service in either House or both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Ten years was taken because the committee considered, first of all, that a person could not have ten years' service unless he was elected at least three times to the Dáil or Seanad. They thought that a person who had spent three terms in the Dáil or in the Seanad would have his chances of rehabilitation in his own original employment very much reduced by his absence from his ordinary vocation and, for that reason, he would require some help to assist him in rehabilitating himself should he leave either the Dáil or the Seanad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> Payment will be at the rate of 1/60th of the allowance, whatever the allowance may be for each year of service. There is one saver; a person may not draw more than £1,000 by way of pension from public funds.  That will apply, in particular, to ex-Ministers and ex-Parliamentary Secretaries. Between the two kinds of service the superannuation may not exceed £1,000. It is hoped that the scheme will be solvent.  It is, however, a very difficult scheme to get any actuary to consider. He would, in fact, want to be a good politician, as well as being an actuary, to forecast the way in which the scheme may work out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He would want to be more than a politician.  He would want to be a prophet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  The intention is to try the scheme out for four or five years.  At the end of that period there will be a review and, if necessary, contributions may have to be increased or allowances decreased, if we take an optimistic view, the possibility is that the contribution will be reduced in the light of experience.</P>
      <P>The funds will be held by trustees. The trustees will be the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and the Minister for Finance.  Their task will be a small one on the whole.  As far as I can foresee, the only decision they will ever have to take is that governing the investment of the funds.  It is decided in the scheme who will be entitled to a pension and how much he should get. For that reason I say that the task of the trustees will be a very easy one. There will be no expenses because there will be scarcely any bookkeeping and once the amount of the pension is decided upon it will be sent out monthly or weekly so that there should be no expenses except, possibly, postage.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the committee for the labour they put into this task and for producing a scheme which, in my opinion, is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I want to say that we <Col N="1116" /> are consenting to this scheme only for the reason that it is a contributory pension scheme and that there will be no contributions from the Exchequer.  This is a scheme by which those of us who are in this House agree to contribute, out of the money paid to us for being here, a certain sum for the purpose of providing for those who may be no longer here.  The whole point of the scheme is that the pensions will be paid out of contributions made by us out of the moneys voted to us here, and that there is no charge whatsoever on public funds.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister for Finance that it is very difficult and practically impossible to make any actuarial calculation in relation to a scheme like this.  The only thing that we can do at this stage is to start off on the basis of contributions as they are now and hope that, on the basis of those contributions after a certain period of time, we shall find that there is a greater margin than some people might think. If there is such a margin we will be able to improve the scheme either by way of reducing contributions, or the number of years of service or perhaps to provide some means of commuting pensions for the widows of those who die in the service of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of the proposal but I disagree with the draft proposal before the House.  I do so because only members of this House and of the Seanad who have ten years' service will benefit by a pension and there is no evidence that any more than a few such members would be in need at any time.  Speaking from what I know of the members of the House from Dublin City, I am aware that practically every member at the present time is employed independently of his membership of this House.  He is either employed or has a business and the question of such a member ever being in need is not likely to arise.  I have a reason for making that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may also apply to members from the rest of the country and I believe, from what I know, that 99 per cent., if not 100 per cent., of the membership of the Dáil and Seanad <Col N="1117" /> consists of people who are employed at present and will continue to be employed or are people of means.  Most of the members of both Houses are accountants, members of the legal profession, secretaries of trade unions or businessmen.  For the odd case in which a man may be defeated at the polls and may be in need because of that, 95 per cent. of the membership of the Oireachtas will not be in need.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that one must be a member of the Dáil or Seanad for at least ten years before one can receive a pension.  That means that a person may lose his seat after paying contributions for seven or eight years during which time he will have paid in £400 or £500.  He may be a poor man; he may be only a worker and may have had to give up his job to attend this House.  Having contributed probably £400 or £500 over eight or nine years he will not be eligible for a pension although he may find himself in the position where that £400 or £500 would be very useful to him.</P>
    <P>When he ceases to be a member of this House he will probably find the bailiff after him for money due.  Such a man may be in much greater need of a pension than 95 per cent. of the people who have been members of the House for over ten years and will thus be entitled to a pension.  We all know the case of Deputy Murphy, a carpenter, who, because he was a member of this House, could not continue his employment.  We all know that he resigned from this House and we know the reason why.  He resigned because he could not afford to be a member. What about his case and other cases like his?  Suppose he had managed to survive a second general election and was defeated in the following one.  He would have contributed £300 or £400 but he would not be entitled to a pension.</P>
    <P>Independent Deputies are all in that position.  When they go up for election on the first occasion, everybody supports them but when they go up in following elections their supporters say that they must have made a pile of money and that they can look after themselves.  Independents usually do <Col N="1118" /> their electioneering work on credit and pay their expenses out of their allowances. If such a person is defeated, he may find himself in the position of owing £200 or £300 and having no money to pay it.  Have you anticipated that type of case?  You obviously have not.  You only talk in terms of members who may have two jobs or a business.</P>
    <P>If it is a question of the dignity of members surely the dignity of any member counts.  This scheme is not much use to certain Deputies unless they can get back some portions of their contributions.  You will be taking money from people who might not be able to afford it and then you will be refusing to give them back any part of it when they need it.  Surely that case has appealed to those who considered these proposals.  If not, I appeal to the Minister for Finance and those responsible to meet again and consider the case of the man who might have no income except his income from this House, who might have paid £400 or £500 into this fund and then, no longer a member of this House, being chased by people because he is in debt having fought an election and not having succeeded.</P>
    <P>As time goes on there will be more representation by the working man in this House.  Up to now it was the wealthy people and middle men who were largely members of this House. There ought to be some provision for a man when he ceases to be a member of this House so that he will at least get back the money he contributed. Unless that is done I would strongly object and I will use again the word I used on the last occasion, that is, a &ldquo;hold-up&rdquo; and nothing else.</P>

From my experience in this House I can say being a T.D. is a full-time job.  You may try to do other jobs but you will not succeed very well.  I have known men who had three or four farms and who finished up drawing the old age pension after membership in this House.  Another member lost a good business after 16 years and had nothing to fall back on except home assistance.  Deputy Sherwin need not be a bit nervous.

      <P>I do not want at this stage to see any dogs in the manger.  Deputy Sherwin should bear in mind that I have advocated for many years what has been introduced today.  We have been trying over the years to improve social services for <Col N="1120" /> every section of the community and this is a social advance to help the type of men who carried on their work here for many years on smaller allowances than tradesmen had, trying to keep cars, and so on.

      <P>This is a step in the right direction and I welcome it very much, all the more so because it does not impose any charge on the Exchequer; it is costing nobody anything but the members themselves.  It is a pity something like this has not been done in the past but it is better late than never.  The Committee have done a good job of work and they deserve the thanks of the Members of both Houses.  It was not an easy problem to solve having regard to the different points of view they had to consider.</P>
      <P>There is some point in the case Deputy Sherwin has made but I suppose the Committee had to draw the line somewhere.  However, with the passage of time if any injustice or seeming injustice arises as a result of the operation of this measure surely it will be well within the competence of the House and the Minister for Finance to remove it.</P>
      <P>The only other point I want to make is in relation to past members of the Dáil or Seanad who are not well circumstances today.  It is a pity the measure could not be extended to include some little thing for them.  I am sure we all know of past members who gave good service in the Dáil or in the Seanad and who are not now in the best circumstances.  If a revision of this measure is ever put under way I would ask the Committee and the Minister to have special regard to those people.</P>

      <P>The only point raised was that contributions should be returned to Deputies who served less than ten years.  The provision which states that nobody with less than ten years' service will get a pension is a feature of practically every group pension scheme of this kind.  There is always a minimum period to qualify for a pension and if contributors do not reach that minimum period they do not qualify.  It is perfectly obvious if you were to agree to this, the levy of six per cent. would not be nearly enough.  That would have to be very much more than it is.  Although we all would have a certain sympathy with the type of case mentioned by Deputy Sherwin, we have to give this scheme a trial as it is for the three or five years until a further investigation can be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Appeals about the value of land, etc., for estate duty purposes or where it is compulsorily acquired by a public authority are settled under one or other of three basic Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, there is the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910.  It lays down that certain appeals about the value of land for estate duty purposes are to be determined by a member of a panel of referees.  Appointments to the panel and the selection of the member to adjudicate on a particular appeal are to be made by a body known as the <Col N="1122" /> Land Values Reference Committee. This Committee consists of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Chairman of the Surveyors' Institution (Irish Branch).</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  It lays down that, where there is a dispute about the amount of compensation offered for land compulsorily acquired by any Government Department (excluding the Land Commission, which has its own special code of laws) or by any local or public authority, the dispute is to be referred to and determined by a member of a panel of official arbitrators.  As in the case of the 1910 Act, appointments to the panel and the selection of the member to adjudicate on a particular appeal are to be made by the Land Values Reference Committee.</P>
    <P>The third basic Act is the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  It prescribes that, in default of agreement, compensation for lands, easements, fisheries, water-rights, navigation-rights, etc., compulsorily acquired under that Act is to be fixed in accordance with the 1919 Act except that the arbitrator for the purpose is to be nominated from a panel of drainage arbitrators.  Appointments to and selections from this panel, also, are made by the Land Values Reference Committee.</P>
    <P>Most of the three categories of appeal that can arise have been under the 1919 Act.  The number of estate duty appeals being usually very small, it has been the practice since the establishment of the State to have the arbitrator appointed under the 1919 Act function as reference for estate duty purposes also.  Up to 1934, a panel of arbitrators had not in fact been appointed as it was found that the combined work involved could be done satisfactorily by one person.  Since 1934, it has occasionally been necessary to appoint an additional arbitrator in a part-time capacity but the amount of work still justifies, as a general rule, the employment of only one full-time arbitrator.</P>
    <P>Up to 1945, the full-time referee and arbitrator was appointed for limited periods renewed from time to time but, <Col N="1123" /> in 1946, the dual post was filled in a permanent capacity; that position still holds good.  It may here be mentioned that the functions of the Minister for Finance relating to the appointment of these referees and arbitrators are confined to determining their remuneration and period of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And paying their remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  With regard to appeals under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, there was until recently a panel of three drainage arbitrators, of whom one was the present full-time referees and arbitrator and the other two were civil servants.  Drainage appeals have turned out to be smaller in number than anticipated and as there are none pending at present, the panel has been allowed to lapse.</P>
      <P>While the existing practice has enabled appeals to be dealt with satisfactorily, the Attorney General advised that, as the law stands, the selection of referees and arbitrators should not be confined to a single nominee.  Therefore, in order to provide a panel, the Land Values Reference Committee appointed a valuer in the Office of Public Works as an additional referee and arbitrator, as a temporary measure pending further consideration of the general question of the suitability to present-day conditions of the machinery provided by existing legislation for appointing referees and arbitrators.</P>
      <P>Having considered the matter fully in consultation with the Reference Committee, I now propose that the law should be amended so as to abolish the need for panels as such.  Possibly they were necessary when the 1910 and 1919 legislation was undertaken for, incidentally, both this country and Great Britain, but no need for them has shown up here where the volume of referee and arbitrator work has been, and still is, only such as to require one full-time arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed that appeals under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, shall in future be determined by a property <Col N="1124" /> arbitrator, with special knowledge of the valuation of land or with other suitable qualifications, who will be appointed by the Reference Committee in accordance with rules to be made by them.  Emoluments and expenses will, as heretofore, be subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  In effect, this arrangement will mean the continuance of the existing practice whereby compensation appeals arising out of the compulsory acquisition of land are determined by the present full-time arbitrator.  The appointment of additional arbitrators, if the circumstances of a particular case or cases should warrant it, will also be provided be for but, ordinarily, there should be work enough for only one full-time person.</P>
    <P>The amending legislation proposed, therefore, will enable one or more arbitrators, who may be whole-time or part-time, to be appointed.  Thus, any category of appointment will be catered for.  It is intended that a part-time arbitrator will be permitted to engage in private practice but will be required, before being appointed to deal with a particular case, to undertake that neither he, nor any associate of his, has any interest in the dispute on which he is being asked to adjudicate. A whole-time arbitrator will be debarred from engaging in private practice.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, the number of estate duty and drainage appeals has been small, the annual average for the four years ended 31st December, 1959, being 12 estate duty appeals and 3 drainage appeals as against an average of 40 appeals a year under the 1919 Act.  It is proposed, therefore, that the separate legislation for the appointment of referees and drainage arbitrators should be rescinded and that, instead, estate duty and drainage appeals should in future be settled by a property arbitrator to be appointed under the 1919 Act as now proposed to be amended.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Bill to ensure that the conditions of service of the existing referee and official arbitrator will be no less favourable, when it is passed, than immediately before it is passed.  Provision is made, too <Col N="1125" /> to ensure the validity of decisions under the 1910 and 1919 Acts notwithstanding the fact that up to 1958 appeals had been decided without panels of referees or official arbitrators being in existence.</P>
    <P>Apart from the measures proposed to secure a more rational basis for appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators to determine appeals under the 1910, 1919 and 1945 Acts, no change in the existing law is proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill arises, I think the Minister will agree, following consideration by the Attorney-General of a question I raised in this House some couple of years ago.  The question I raised then was that the appointment of one person to be an official arbitrator, or referee as he was then called, was not complying with the law, which said there should be a panel. The Minister has accepted that the point I raised at that time was correct, and it is for that reason that the Bill is being introduced.  However, I regret very much that the Minister, in introducing the Bill, has completely departed from the panel system.</P>
      <P>I have tried to trace the exact method by which the person was selected from the panel of referees but unfortunately it appears to have been done by means of rules made under Section 33 subsection (2) of the Finance Act, 1910 and under a similar type of section in the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  Those rules, unfortunately, are not available in the Library.  Therefore, apart from certain knowledge that I may have in certain other places, I am not quite clear as to the manner in which the selection was supposed to be made under those Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say at once that I agree with the Minister that it is highly desirable that we would have a similar method of administration for appeals under the 1910 Act, under the 1919 Act and under the 1945 Drainage Act.  The basis and method by which appeals are taken on either of these procedures should be the same.  That does not mean at all to say that the arbitrator should be the same person.  In fact, it would be quite nonsensical to suggest <Col N="1126" /> that the arbitrator who would adjudicate on the value of profit rents arising in an estate duty case would necessarily be the best person to adjudicate on the improvement to the value of land arising under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The two types of skill required are quite different and, to a greater degree, the two types of experience required are different.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that in anything I may say in this respect there is no reflection whatever on the person who is covered in subsection (4) of Section 2 but it is quite impossible for any one man to be adequately skilled in every aspect. Apart from that, no one can get along in this world without occasionally crossing swords with another.  I am trying to discuss this without reference to the man to whom I have referred and who has been carrying on satisfactorily over the years.  One may cross swords with a person and on that account may feel one will not get a reasonable deal from him.  The person selected as arbitrator might perhaps have some interest in the property over which he is asked to arbitrate.  There are so many facets and aspects of particular interest that it is highly desirable not to restrict this to one person but to go back to the old panel system and to operate the panel system properly.</P>
    <P>I can see that it was highly desirable to have a different arbitrator for drainage.  I am not quite clear whether it was necessary to have three drainage arbitrators.  If it was, that can be cut down to one.  I do not at all see that it helps anyone to believe that he is getting a fair deal by having only one person appointed to deal with all the various matters and the Minister should agree on Committee Stage to change Section 2 and to ensure that at least the very minimum of choice remains by having at least two arbitrators.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, there have been very few estate duty appeals in recent years.  One of the reasons for that is that the Estate Duty Office of the Revenue Commissioners knew what they were in for under Section 6 and they made it their business to settle <Col N="1127" /> cases if they got half a chance.  On that account many cases were settled over recent years that otherwise perhaps might have gone to a more full hearing.  That is all to the good for the individuals concerned.  Perhaps the people who were affected, who were going to have to pay, did not realise why their solicitors had been able to effect a settlement so simply.  I hope the Minister will not now see a reversal of the procedure that has operated in the Estate Duty Office, after reference to the Valuation Office, over several years, to settle cases rather than have them thrown at an early stage to the referee, or arbitrator as he will now be called.</P>
    <P>Up to this, the position has been that every reasonable effort has been made by the Valuation Office to agree to estate duty valuations.  I hope that will continue.  I thought I detected in the last three or four months a slight change in the practice there.  I hope it was just that I happened to run across a series of cases which were out of the ordinary run and that the practice that there was there for years will not be departed from.</P>
    <P>I want, therefore, to urge the Minister very strongly indeed to retain the panel system, to retain it, if he likes, by having two arbitrators only, not any more, so that there can be a selection, so that a person, if he has had some difference of opinion&mdash;as we all have differences of opinion from time to time&mdash;with one arbitrator can select the other to hear his case.  I do not want to be trite in relation to these land acquisition cases but the Minister will agree with me that it is not a question of justice being done; it is a question or justice seeming also to be done.  If a person has had some difference of opinion with a man and knows that his claim must go before that man, that there is no possible choice and no chance of having anybody else to determine the compensation he will get, he will not feel that he has had a fair run for his money.  He will feel that there has been an element of confiscation in relation to his property, an element which perhaps has not been there at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> We want to ensure as far as possible, while making absolutely certain that there is complete fairness as between the Revenue, on one hand, and the individual on the other in estate duty matters, as between the local authority on the one hand in 1919 cases and the individual on the other and as between the Commissioners of Public Works on the one hand and the individual on the other in 1945 Act cases, that people really believe that they have got a fair crack of the whip.  If there is only one single arbitrator they will not so believe.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the Bill deals with what I would call the rationalisation of proceedings under the three previous Acts and a provision that is in Section 6.  I want the Minister categorically to assure the House that he has no knowledge of any case which has already commenced, or the commencement of which has been threatened, against the appropriate authority by reason of the fact that there was not a panel in existence in earlier years.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to a retrospective clause in this but that is only provided we know that we are not depriving somebody of a right of action which he has already commenced or has given notice that he intends commencing. The Minister is the only person in a position categorically to assure the House on the matter and I think it is very important it should go on the records of the House.  If that assurance were not forthcoming I would have very different views on this Section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that this legislation arises from the fact that Deputy Sweetman raised the matter in the Dáil on a former occasion.  The question was considered and the Attorney General had some doubts&mdash;very strong ones, in fact&mdash;with regard to the legal position about the panel.  As a result, this Bill has come along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question raised by Deputy Sweetman is that of one arbitrator.  As far as the Bill is concerned, we say this to the Reference Committee: &ldquo;You may appoint one or more arbitrators.&rdquo; If they do appoint more, they may be either full or part-time.  Accordingly, the Committee have great discretion in <Col N="1129" /> their appointments.  I think that is sufficient&mdash;that we should give the Committee this discretion in the appointment of arbitrators.  Deputy Sweetman thinks it is hardly possible for one person to be a good arbitrator under the three Acts.  One person has acted under the 1910 and 1919 Acts for years and as far as I know he has given satisfaction.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I could not accept the statement that he has given full satisfaction, now that the Minister has mentioned the matter.  A great number of people think they have had a raw deal.  However, I do not say there is anything sinister in the arbitrator's decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if we had any arbitration under the most recent Act.  If you have a good arbitrator on land values and if the value of land comes under the Drainage Act, obviously he would be the man to do it.  It would be a case of water rights.  What was provided for in one of the earlier Acts was that the arbitrator could have an assessor.  That could be done, I presume, under this Act or the Committee might, in a particular case, select another man who is an arbitrator and have him in such a case.  The Committee, at any rate, have all the discretion they could ask for and I think we are going far enough in giving them those powers.  Deputy Sweetman knows, but other Deputies may not, that the claimant has no right and never had to choose an arbitrator.  It was always the committee who did that.</P>

The position can very well be that the arbitrator would be appointed by <Col N="1131" /> reference to the number of cases and that he can be paid per case.  There is nothing in this amendment to suggest he cannot be paid per case.  If that is so and if you have one or 20 arbitrators you would not be paying any more out because there would be only the same number of cases and, if there were one, twenty or even forty arbitrators, the cases would be spread over the lot and the same amount in fees would be paid out to one as to forty.  Accordingly, my amendment would not involve any charge.  It can make a charge only if after the provisions of the Bill are enacted the Minister tries to pay the single arbitrator a bulk fee.  I suggest, with all respect, that my amendment does not necessarily mean there would be a charge on public funds if it were passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 :</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) to delete paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears, and we should like some clarification on the point, that as the Bill stands it would be possible to circumvent the decision provided for in the first paragraph, namely, that no force should be sent abroad without prior consultation with the Dáil.  We regard that as a very important principle. We made the point actually in the debate on the original Bill in July last that where any substantial contingent is being sent abroad to serve with <Col N="1133" /> U.N. the Dáil should have a full explanation of the reasons why the contingent is being sent, the destination to which it is being sent, its purposes and functions.  Under subsection (2) (a) it seems to us that an unarmed force could be sent to assist a U.N. contingent&mdash;we have no objection at all to that&mdash;but under (c) it would be possible to send a contingent from the Permanent Defence Forces to reinforce that unarmed force and there would not be any limit on the size of such contingent.  I wonder if that is a reasonable interpretation of that section.  If it is, we should like to have the principle originally enunciated adhered to, namely, the reservation of the right to the Dáil to debate or consider the matter where any contingent exceeding 12 members is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that it would not be possible under this section to reinforce an unarmed force by a contingent such as would be sent to an armed force.  If more than 12 members are going to serve with an armed U.N. force a resolution of the Dáil is necessary and paragraph (c) of subsection (2) cannot be used to send a contingent to an armed force under any circumstances except to reinforce a contingent already sent in accordance with a resolution passed or to replace such a contingent.  I cannot accept the amendment because its effect would be to make it impossible to maintain a contingent of the Permanent Defence Forces with the U.N. Forces in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to a particular situation might be very fluid and the despatch of reinforcements might well become a matter of extreme urgency in which case the Government would want to have a free hand to act quickly.  The hands of the Government would be unduly tied if it had to approach the House every time it became necessary to despatch additional troops for service with a particular United Nations Force.  I can see no necessity for such a course particularly when we bear in mind that the House would already have accorded its approval for the despatch of a contingent for service with that particular <Col N="1134" /> United Nations Force.  This section of the Bill only comes into force when the despatch of additional troops or reinforcements becomes necessary.</P>
    <P>It must be left to the discretion of the Government to determine the size of the contingent to be sent in the light of all the circumstances from time to time.  The Deputy need have no fear that this Government, or any other Government, would provide more troops in a particular situation than the circumstances at the time warranted. Certainly, with regard to replacements and reinforcements, the Government should be free to determine from time to time, in the light of the circumstances obtaining in the particular situation, what should be the frequency of rotation necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reason why the House should be approached each time it is decided to despatch fresh troops to replace the whole contingent or part of it seeing that the House would have decided by resolution in the first instance to despatch a contingent for service with the United Nations forces. If, at any time, the House desires to inquire into the position in relation to the service abroad of an Irish contingent with the United Nations forces they can bring in a motion and have the whole matter discussed here.  This amendment is not acceptable to the Government and I must press for its rejection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the attitude of the Minister when he says that the Government must be allowed to have a certain amount of discretion and to use its initiative in the type of situation responsible for the introduction of this Bill and for the introduction of the temporary Bill in July of this year.  It is true, as the Minister has said, that this House in July last gave permission for the sending of a contingent of troops for service in the troubled areas of the Congo in accordance with the responsibilities and obligations which we accepted when we became members of the United Nations Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, to say the least of it, the situation in the Congo at the moment is not the same as when it was presented <Col N="1135" /> to us in July of this year.  I do not want to talk about Lumumba, Mobutu, Kasavubu or anybody else. The situation there seems to me to be as confused as a jungle in the Congo itself.  I think that there should be a motion before this House any time we propose to send out a new contingent to the Congo or to reinforce contingents already there.  Possibly because we did not take sufficient interest last July it was possible for the Government to send out another contingent in August.  I was under the impression that the Government had no power to do that but it may be my fault that I did not pay sufficient attention to the Bill.  I was under the impression that this House would have to give permission to the Government to send out additional troops.  That was my conception of how things would work and it was my belief as to how things would work in the future.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that there is the machinery of the House whereby Deputies can put down questions or motions in regard to these matters. These questions or motions are generally misunderstood or misrepresented. Generally speaking, we support the Government with regard to the Congo and its approach to the problem in accordance with our membership of the United Nations Organisation but I do not think that that should debar us from talking about the situation in the Congo.  We have heard too little about the Congo.  All we have heard is that we are members of the United Nations and that we are supposed to make our contribution to the United Nations effort.  There is a little more to it than that.  What is the difference between policing the Congo and fighting in the Congo?  Our soldiers were sent out to be policemen but the reports in the newspapers are so confused and matters are in such a state that we do not know now with what our soldiers are confronted.</P>
    <P>There was a report on the radio or in the newspapers yesterday that because some of our soldiers were acting as policemen they found themselves under severe disadvantages as against <Col N="1136" /> approaches made to them by some other groups out there.  It is all very fine for the Minister to say that we can use the machinery of the House by way of question or resolution to question the right of the Government to send troops but the Government should also use their initiative in a case like this and they should themselves bring the issue here before the House, say they propose to send out another contingent and give the reasons why.  I do not attempt to question what the United Nations or the Security Council has done or is doing but we should know the reason for all these things.</P>
    <P>We have a Minister for External Affairs and he has not been in this country for the past 3 or 4 months.  I think there is an obligation on the Minister for External Affairs to be here in this House and tell us what he knows about the Congo situation. Instead of that he has been away at the United Nations Assembly since August or September.  Surely there is no reason why the political head of the Department of External Affairs should not be here to tell us what he knows of the situation?</P>

No matter what anybody says, no matter what the Minister for Defence or the other members of the Government may think, the public would like to know a little more about what is happening in the Congo and especially what is happening to Irish soldiers out there.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I shall let the Minister answer that but I had better say what I believe, that if there had not been the Congo situation the Minister for Defence, whoever he was, would have had to bring in a Bill similar to this because we had accepted membership of the United Nations and the responsibility to give military aid and send contingents as might be required. My complaint is that it was only when the drum beat and the necessity arose that we brought in the Bill, the very complaint the Deputy was making that things were so rushed last July that we could not give it the examination we should have.  That is the fault of the Government and the Minister in not bringing it in twelve months ago when there was no excitement at all.</P>
      <P>We must bear in mind in relation to this section that even when the Congo situation has been resolved and a contingent is required for some other place that problem can be dealt with if the Government thinks in its wisdom that that contingent requires further reinforcement.  The effectiveness of the force could be destroyed by waiting to get a resolution passed before the troops could be sent.  The Government must have the authority to send the contingent.  Leave the Congo out altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suppose that in twelve months' time some situation arises in <Col N="1138" /> some other part of the world and we are requested to send a contingent. The Minister for Defence or the Minister for External Affairs brings in a resolution to send a contingent to that place and tells us why he is sending it and what is the objective of the force he is sending.  When he has everything explained, everybody can examine that very fully.  However, in a short time afterwards if it is found necessary and the Government are satisfied that they must send reinforcements, or that they must call some of the troops home and send an equivalent number, they should have that power.  If we think things are not being done right, Parliamentary procedure then allows us to put down a motion. I do not think any Government could reject a request for Government time for such a motion because it would be a matter of major importance.</P>
    <P>Once we have come to the conclusion that such a measure is necessary, the Government must have that power.  It would lessen the effectiveness of the troops being sent, if it would not damage, their effectiveness, if that power were not given.  While I have every confidence in the present personnel and would like to give them everything required, I am looking forward to the future rather than concerning myself with the present.  I believe the Government should have this section as it stands to enable them to carry out their mission effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In commenting on the Minister's statement may I say without in any way reflecting on him or any other Minister that any assurance he gives in this House with regard to future Governments carries no weight whatever.  It is what is written into a Bill that counts.  That is why it is essential to have it in black and white what the powers of a Government are with regard to the use of our troops outside the nation.  Whatever Deputy MacEoin has in mind in regard to future emergencies, which we hope will not arise, the position we have to face is that this permanent legislation now being enacted affects in the immediate future the welfare of our troops in regard to the Congo, and <Col N="1139" /> I want to relate my remarks in particular to the Congo.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his opening statement said:</P>
      <P>This Bill provides, however, that except in certain clearly defined cases the exercise of this power will be subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann in each instance.</P>
      <P>I am quoting from Vol. 185, Column 777, of the Official Report of Wednesday, 7th December.  In regard to the clearly defined cases, the principal exception he made is subsection (c) which, in our opinion, completely negatives the assurance given by the Taoiseach that in each instance the approval of Dáil Éireann will be sought.  In other words, he said that in each instance the assent of the Dáil will be sought; then he said, &ldquo;except in clearly defined cases,&rdquo; and the exception, subsection (c), opens the back door to get away from that assurance completely.</P>
      <P>As far as the immediate circumstances are concerned, namely, the Congo, the temporary legislation that came in last June authorised the Government to keep these troops abroad for a period of six months. That means that if they intended to reinforce the contingent, or to send a fresh contingent, this House would have to consider, first, the question as to whether the situation had changed completely from the time when the first contingent was sent out and the Dáil, representing the people, would be entitled to comment whenever a new contingent was being sent abroad.  Under this new legislation the Government can keep on sending contingents to the Congo for the next 40 years without ever coming back to this House for any authority or discussion.  That is contained in this permanent legislation, and I believe that that is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very strongly on this.  The situation may change in the Congo and become such that it would be absolutely essential that this House would have an opportunity of discussing it if the Government decided, say next June or July, to send a <Col N="1140" /> further contingent there.  But if the subsection is passed as it stands, we will not have that opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to say that Deputies can put down a motion.  That is a very naïve attitude.  We know what the present Taoiseach thinks of motions.  He has nothing but contempt for motions put on the Order Paper. He has even sought to override the recommendations of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in connection with motions.  We know that motions could lie on the Order Paper for 12 months without being heard.  A motion is of no benefit whatever so far as the rights of Deputies are concerned in this question of sending further contingents abroad.  As was pointed out, the Bill gives the Government power to send troops to Tunis, Algeria or Japan tomorrow morning.  If a resolution is passed authorising the Government to send 12 armed men abroad, three weeks afterwards the Government could send the entire Army.  That sounds like an exaggeration, but there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Government from doing so.  The Government can, at their own discretion, reinforce whatever contingent we have abroad.</P>
    <P>It may be that we could have another Government which&mdash;we will flatter the present one&mdash;may not be as responsible as the present Government. There may be a wide divergence of view in regard to the future activities of the United Nations in certain countries.  In those circumstances, when the lives of our young soldiers may be at stake, it is absolutely imperative that this House should have an opportunity of discussing the matter and facing, as a responsible body, the decision whether they should be sent abroad or not.</P>

      <P>I was originally under the impression that Section 2 of the Bill was purely for the purpose of replacing or reinforcing the existing contingent in the Congo.

      <P>Under this section, we could do what the Deputy has said, but we could do other things as well. For instance, under the previous Bill we sent one battalion originally.  Subsequently there was an appeal from the United Nations for a further battalion and we sent a further battalion. We could do that under this permanent legislation if some situation, such as Deputy MacEoin referred to, arose in some other part of the world at some future time and a resolution was passed authorising the despatch of a contingent to that United Nations force.  If, shortly afterwards, a further request came from the United Nations for an increased contingent, the Government would be authorised to accede to that request, if they felt that circumstances demanded it and prudence justified it.  They would, of course, have regard to conditions here at home, both in regard to the availability of troops and the feasibility of despatching them from this country. The Government would be entitled to accede to that request and also to authorise the replacing of those troops after a period, such as will take place on the 25th January when the troops in the Congo will be replaced.  Those who are out there must come back and the Government will be authorised to replace them.</P>

Have they to come back afterwards to justify that in Dáil Éireann?  I appreciate that any Government must have a free hand to act in an emergency. You could not carry on otherwise, nor could you be a proper member of the United Nations if your hands were completely tied.

      <P>I have only two small points.  I do not think anybody would <Col N="1143" /> object to the Government having power to act in an emergency.  Deputy General MacEoin mentioned that.  He gave the example of a Government being faced with the situation, at a time when the Dáil was not meeting, that the United Nations wanted a reinforcement of 300 or 400 men.  He said it would be difficult, if not impracticable, to convene the Dáil and get this special resolution passed.  That would be a difficult situation but I do not think it is an impossible one.  If, for example, the disorders in the Congo extended over the border into the French Congo, the Government would then have to come here to get a brand new resolution to allow our force to go there.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask the Minister is there not a conflict between subsections (1) and (2) of Section 2?  I take it from subsection (1) that the Minister wants the Dáil to approve before any force is sent out under the auspices, say, of the United Nations or as part of a United Nations force in any part of the world.  Is that not correct?</P>

      <P>An armed battalion or two, whatever the case may be.  That is the sense of subsection (1) of Section 2.  I respectfully submit that subsection (2) controverts to an extent the intent of subsection (1).  Could it not be left simply to the Dáil to decide and to give the Minister power to replace only troops that have been sent out to a particular area or to reinforce them?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but then there is responsibility for it.  A situation arises in which, say, they bring in a resolution for a battalion again.  A situation occurs in which it is found necessary to reinforce that battalion within a month.  The Government should have the power to send another battalion if necessary without coming back because it is possible to lessen the effectiveness of the Government's actions, but the Government is responsible to the House and to the people. If they make a mess of it, to that extent, they can be brought to book for it.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, if this legislation were going through the House without the Congo, and the Minister had taken steps to argue every section as to the why and wherefore and the needs of each section and subsection, we would approach it in a cooler manner but we are a bit upset with the situation.  The Government today tells you they are bringing back the two battalions.  They are sending out one, they say, but they can send out two, three or four.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is no Minister who would be able to go ahead with that practice without being brought to book by the House. I do not accept the view that a motion <Col N="1147" /> would not be put down.  A motion of &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; in the Government in that case would have to be discussed by the Dáil.  I do not think there is any doubt about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not yet clarified the point I made.  Subsection (2) (c) reads as follows:</P>
      <P>the contingent is intended to replace, in whole or in part, or reinforce a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force serving outside the State as part of that International United Nations Force and consisting of more than twelve members of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      <P>The Minister whether he comes to the House or does not come to the House, can send out 12.  Is that correct?  Can he or can he not reinforce that 12 with 1,200?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot reinforce it by even one.  I cannot bring it up to thirteen without a resolution of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister had better clarify subsection (2) of Section 2. Subsection (2) says that a contingent of the Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State and then gives circumstances.  The circumstances are listed and the subsection contains authority to send out a contingent but only if the Dáil authorises the Minister to do so.  If the Minister sends out a first contingent he must get the authority of the House.  The subsection says:</P>
      <P>(2) A contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State with a particular International United Nations Force without a resolution approving of such despatch having been passed by Dáil Éireann, if, but only if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) that International United Nations Force is unarmed, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) the contingent consists of not more than twelve members of the Permanent Defence Force, and the number of members of the <Col N="1148" /> Permanent Defence Force serving outside the State with that International United Nations Force will not, by reason of such despatch, be increased to a number exceeding twelve, or</P>
    <P>(c) the contingent is intended to replace, in whole or in part, or reinforce a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force serving outside the State as part of that International United Nations Force and consisting of more than twelve members of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>In other words, you can send out 12 or, if you have two there, you can send out another 10 but not another 11. You can send out troops without a resolution of the House to replace or to reinforce.  It seems to me that under paragraph (c) of the subsection the Minister is taking power without a resolution of the House.  He must get authority in the House in the first instance. Having got that, he can then, without a second resolution of the Dáil, send out troops to replace in whole or in part or to reinforce a permanent contingent.</P>
    <P>If you had two battalions out there, the Minister would be entitled under this subsection to bring them back and replace them without a resolution of the House.  In theory, if you send out two battalions, you can take them back in January and you can send out four battalions in February to replace and reinforce the two that you brought back and when we come back here on February 8th we could discover that four battalions were now in the Congo.</P>
    <P>I am not saying a Minister or Government responsible to Parliamentary rule would do crazy things, but if that power is there, I think the Minister should try at least to provide that such a radical change would not be made without Parliament being consulted.</P>
    <P>It is a pretty wide power to give the Minister in a new venture of this kind which we started with two battalions, and while it is very understandable that you would want to replace these and bring them back from the rigours of <Col N="1149" /> an over-long service overseas, it is travelling pretty widely if you put in a clause which would entitle you to double the force by replacement or reinforcement.  For a small country with the limited defence resources that we have, that is a very wide power for the Minister to take and while I am in favour of discharging our responsibilities to the United Nations&mdash;if we are in a club we cannot opt out of it just because something happens which we do not like&mdash;I still think the Minister should not think it necessary to take such wide powers under the reinforcement provision of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is on the cards that the Minister will say he is as politically wise as the rest of us and that he would not do anything crazy.  That is not the answer in a democratic Parliament.  The House would probably like to be consulted and, if anything so drastic as reinforcements is concerned, the Minister should consult the House.  The more he carries the Dáil with him in this matter the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears there is slight confusion here because we are forgetting we are dealing with an Army and not with a collection of small boys who must be protected from danger. The men who have enlisted in the Army have done so as fighting men, to be trained and to act as fighting men whenever the Government of the day sees fit to order them to do so.</P>
      <P>While not wishing to be callous about it, we must remember that being in an army is a dangerous occupation. Up till very recently our Army has led a comparatively sheltered life and we must not get cold feet simply because we find our fighting men are in danger.  That is what they enlisted to do and I think we are perfectly satisfied they will be well able to give a good account of themselves in any circumstances that might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the idea that this House should control the number of troops, once a decision is taken in principle, is one which I cannot accept for a moment. Even in times of war there are very often attempts made by Parliamentary assemblies to intervene in matters of <Col N="1150" /> tactics and strategy and on many occasions these have proved almost certainly disastrous.  It is essential that the Government as such should have the control of the armed forces of the State and once they have been committed to a particular operation it is the Government which must control them, which must reinforce them, replace them, withdraw them as the occasion may arise.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from anything else, this is a matter to which the Taoiseach referred yesterday in connection with the handling of information and with the debating of events in a situation such as exists in the Congo at the moment.  It would almost certainly be the case that in such an event a long and possibly ill-informed debate might prove a considerable embarrassment to our troops at present operating under U.N. control in the Congo.</P>
    <P>I would hope that we would bear in mind we have taken a very drastic step already by passing the previous temporary Bill and I think we should have it clearly in our minds that we are voluntarily surrendering part of our sovereignty by committing some of our armed forces to the control of an international body.  We are doing this in the belief that it is not alone a correct discharge of our duty as members of the United Nations but also part of the essential defence policy of our country. Once we have parted with control, as we have done, then we must not go back on it.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be the duty of any Government to ensure that a contingent of ours serving under the United Nations should not be committed to action which has not the Government's approval in principle and the Government must retain the authority to withdraw troops should the situation drastically alter.  At the same time, we cannot intervene in day-to-day tactical movements of troops, reinforcements, or anything else.  We have surrendered that right by passing the Bill we did last July and we shall make that surrender a still more permanent one by passing this measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> It is a courageous and adventurous thing to make these men available and I am glad we are doing that.  I do not think we should be unduly nervous. Our action will certainly prove to be a real contribution to world peace in general.  If an operation such as is envisaged in this Bill has to be carried out, it will have to be carried out to a certain extent <i>in camera</i> so far as tactical decisions are concerned. At the back of my mind is the thought that a situation might arise in which our forces might find themselves in a position from which they might not be able to extricate themselves without reinforcements.</P>
    <P>In such an event the Government would have to be in a position to send out whatever reinforcement might be required, not alone to deal with the situation but also to preserve the lives of our own troops.  Imposing a liability on the Government to have each reinforcement debated in this House could be nothing but dangerous. Deputies will agree that if any Government exceeded its duties an immediate motion of &ldquo;No confidence&rdquo; could be tabled and would have to be debated at once.  Unless the matter were sufficiently serious to justify such a motion, I cannot see that debating replacements or reinforcements, tactical problems and so on, in this House could be anything but unwise, to put it mildly.  It could, indeed, be very dangerous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>For about 20 minutes most Deputies were hopelessly confused. It was like the perennial problem: &ldquo;Which came first; the chicken or the egg?&rdquo;  We have a clear idea now of what the section means.  I accept the section.  Having a little military knowledge, I realise it would be a dangerous thing if the Minister had to come before the House on any and every occasion because reinforcements might be held up and lives might be placed in jeopardy. Military matters, about which most Deputies know very little, would have to be debated.  Immediate support essential to safeguard lives might be held up.  Any hold-up might have <Col N="1152" /> fatal consequences for those whom we had already sent.  I agree the Minister should have the power sought in this measure.</P>
      <P>I am, however, a little concerned about another aspect altogether.  If the Minister has the support of the majority of the House, he can send a contingent.  That could mean a majority of one.  By that majority of one he could commit this country to war because we would have no knowledge of the extent to which we might become involved.  We might be asked to send 1,000 men.  If they were in danger, we might be asked to send a few more thousands; and if they were not sufficient, we might be asked to send several thousands.  We might, in fact, not even be asked.  That is just the point.  We could become seriously involved because, in the first instance, a majority of one decided we ought to send a contingent.</P>
      <P>As we know, international politics is largely a question of ideologies, Russia and the West; and we do not know what will happen within the international framework in the next couple of years.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that Russia may dominate the United Nations.  France, and other countries, may turn Left and support Russia.  We might be requested by our Russian dominated United Nations to do something.  That is where the danger lies.  If a Party here became Communist in outlook, we might find ourselves in a very difficult situation.  I believe most Governments in the next 20 or 30 years will be coalition Governments.  That might mean that a minority group in a coalition Government would be the dominant voice in that Government and commit us to sending, by a majority of one, a contingent abroad, that contingent to be followed by a whole Army.  That is not impossible. We have the example of Hitler.  His Party was a minority Party.</P>

      <P>Other Deputies ranged all over the place.  I thought I could do the same.  I accept the Minister's view that, once we commit ourselves, the Minister must have the power to send reinforcements in case of danger.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand the views of some of the speakers here today Listening to Deputy Booth, I felt for a moment that it was an empire we had here and that the question we had to consider was what country we intended to annex in the next five years.  It was a question of sending reinforcements to protect our troops in such a country and a question of essential emergency action.  If we got into that position as a result of this piece of legislation, the only comment I have to make is that it was certainly never envisaged. We have been assured that our troops in the Congo are there in the capacity, really, of a police force.  They are not there to go to war.  Under this section, however, a foolish Minister and a foolish Government could land us in very serious trouble, even in war, by a misuse of the powers that will be given under this subsection if it is passed in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a question of the tactics or manoeuvers of the military men. This is a question of a dangerous political issue involved in the sending of troops to this area.  Nobody wants to question or advise the Army men <Col N="1154" /> as to how they should run their manoeuveres or the number of troops they should use for a particular job. That is not what is under discussion. I put it clearly to the House, and I can tell the Minister that the country believes, that this legislation does not give him authority, and will not give him authority, to send any number of troops he likes to the Congo for the next twenty years without consulting this House.</P>
    <P>There is one other point.  I do not say that he would use this but we are giving him the power.  There are two battalions of troops coming back from the Congo next February.  The Minister may then send out there thirteen armed members of the Defence Forces at the end of January.  Next July, when this House has adjourned, he can send 1,000 troops out without consulting this House and without the country having a say in the matter. That is the power that is being given to him under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>He could send 13 battalions if he wanted to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>And this House would have no say in the matter.  The only safeguard for that, according to Deputy Booth, is that if the troops are sent out in July and the House does not sit until the end of October, a Deputy can put down a motion to have the whole matter thrashed out, There is no good suggesting a motion of &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; in the Government. That is no safeguard because the Government can send out a contingent when the Dail is not in session. They have done things like that before. This very Government, not so long ago, two days after the Dail rose, decided to invoke the Offences Against the State Act while the seats of the Dail were still warm.  I quote that as an instance of the action that can be taken by the Government when the Dáil is not in session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point about the summoning of the Dáil.  Is it any great trouble to convene this House by telegram if the question should arise of sending out a further contingent that we never thought would <Col N="1155" /> be necessary?  There is nothing big in that.  The Dail could be called together two days after the necessity arose to discuss whether or not a further 1,000 troops should be sent. No such power rests with the House if this section goes through.  There can be no discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Booth has not been very helpful to the Minister in his general remarks suggesting that certain things have to be done <i>in camera</i> and that we have surrendered some of our sovereignty.  I would also suggest that Deputy McQuillan's imagination is taking him away from what the intentions of the House are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the House wants to tie up the Minister or the Government in any kind of difficulties with regard to the general situation in the Congo on the one hand or with the intentions of the Army authorities on the other.  Again, Deputy Booth has not been helpful when he suggests that the Minister could send out 13 battalions tomorrow. The fact is that the Minister could do it, but we are not so divorced from reality that any of us think that there is the slightest danger of the Government or the Army authorities doing that.</P>
      <P>I appreciate, and any Deputy who had any experience of dealing with defence matters during the last war will appreciate, how difficult it is to get any communications of any kind from a Government in that situation. From the time the last war began until France fell there was no communication of any kind from the Government about the ordinary situation. It was with reluctance that the Government agreed to meet the Council of Defence to discuss matters when France did fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remarks that have been made in the discussion on the amendment may help the Minister and the Government to understand that a little more pliability is necessary but all this ought not to blind us to what is the <Col N="1156" /> simple thing that we are asked to do. In July last the House passed a Bill which gave power to send a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service outside the State as part of the United Nations Emergency force.  That was taken as a resolution enabling the Government to send two battalions. The sending of those two battalions was done by a free act of this Parliament. There was no surrender of sovereignty in any respect and there was nothing done <i>in camera</i> in the Dáil regarding the decision to send out these troops or about the selection of the men by voluntary means to go there.</P>
    <P>What is being done today is that the Government, in the light of the fact that the power they have expires on the 21st January, is providing a measure, however unsatisfactory it may be from the drafting point of view or from the point of view of the House, in order to be able to replace or reinforce the forces that are there.  I think we are all misinformed about the position in the Congo but I have no misunderstanding as to the desire of our people or our Parliament to stand by the commitments we undertook in July when we undertook to send a contingent to the Congo.</P>
    <P>We do know that while this Bill would enable the Government to send four battalions to replace the two that are there, they have no intention of doing so, that if they had any intention of doing it they would take the necessary steps to inform the House and get the support and backing of the House for it, particularly in the light of the difficult circumstances that exist in the Congo and in the light of the further difficulties that may arise. Therefore it is rather running contrary to the general spirit and the general intention of ourselves and the people of the country as a whole to raise elaborate problems of a constitutional or of a military nature.  However, the discussion that has taken place will be a reminder to the Government that we should be better informed, in so far as the Government are able to inform us, of the situation out there and a reminder to the Government that it may be necessary to have further statutory protection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> We understand the Government's intention in this matter and we want to make the Government's difficulties and the Army's difficulties as light as possible in doing whatever they consider has to be done to provide the assistance we were asked to provide, not for a police purpose and not for a military purpose but for the purpose of peace and of encouraging the various nations of the world to have a better understanding of the situation and to use their forces and their intellects in the best way they can to prevent a general war flare-up in the world.  Therefore, while the Minister may have difficulty in explaining some of the drafting here, the intention is quite clear and I for one would not ask for any particular commas or dots to be inserted to make clear the Government's intention.</P>

      <P>When I spoke a few moments ago I think I was under a misapprehension in regard to the second part of Section 2.  I was under the impression that the Minister could circumvent the wishes of the Dáil by sending out a force of 12 men and then reinforcing that with a substantially larger force.  The Minister has stated that that is not so, that for any force in excess of 12 members he must come to the Dáil to secure a resolution.</P>

      <P>I think it would be entirely wrong in this Bill to hamstring the Minister with regard to the obligations we have accepted in the United Nations.  In saying that, we must have regard to the fact that this discussion cannot be divorced from the events in the Congo.  I do not intend to discuss the events in the Congo but there is the fact that a decision to send men out there is not purely a matter for the Army who may be very competent from the point of view of exercising their troops in warfare or other duties.  If it should happen that a country like Ghana or Nigeria who threatened to pull out their troops, did pull out their 1,200 or 2,000 men we could be called upon to supply that defection and, in fact, we are giving power to the Minister for Defence to decide.  It is my opinion that that should be the decision of Dáil Éireann. That is a political decision, a decision of policy, not a military decision.  I go along with the Minister the whole way in support of the fulfilment of obligations in the Congo if we must send out two, three or four battalions and if we decide to substitute those battalions or possibly reinforce them to a modest degree.  However, if any of the other nations pulled out&mdash;and we already have indications that some other nations intend to pull out&mdash;we could be called upon under our obligation to make good that defection.</P>

      <P>I do not think that Deputies fully realise what they are suggesting when they suggest we should withdraw the paragraph.  It would mean that we would have to come back here in the case of sending out <Col N="1160" /> any reinforcement to a contingent sent out there originally as a result of a resolution passed by the Dáil.  Deputies have admitted that the type of situation against which they want to guard was really a fantastic situation, a case in which a Government would do something crazy or work some despicable kind of trick on the Dáil, such as sending out 13 originally and then sending out some thousands, thus tricking the Dáil into giving them authority to send out a contingent and then send out a number of men in excess of what the Army could reasonably provide.</P>

      <P>It might not be a case of the Government meaning to trick anybody.  Suppose the Government asked for 30 first and a month afterwards the United Nations suddenly told us: &ldquo;We want 1,000 men.&rdquo;  That situation could arise and the Government could say &ldquo;All right. We shall give them to you.&rdquo;  There would be no need to come to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be hardly necessary to specify with mathematical accuracy how many men the Government propose to send.  For instance, in the case of the original decision to send a battalion, the battalion was not organised at the time the decision was taken.  The actual detailed establishment of it was not worked out.  The Army authorities did not consider that a battalion, as it is organised in our Defence Forces, would be the most suitable unit to send out.  A provisional establishment was set up.  That was amended on a number of occasions according as details were worked out.</P>

      <P>The Dail has to approve the sending of a contingent in the first instance.  The size of the contingent is obviously a matter for the Government to decide, on the advice of the Minister for Defence; and he, naturally, is advised by the military authorities.  I think it is reasonable to ask the Dáil to assume that the Government will have some sense of responsibility in the matter. Surely Deputies can realise the type of strait-jacket into which this amendment would put the Government?  It would make the whole idea of sending a contingent unworkable.  We would be compelled to come here in the first instance with a certain specified number and get authority to send them.  If it was discovered afterwards that there was need to amend that number in any way, the Government would have to come back here to do it. That would be a ridiculous situation. After the battalion was sent out to the Congo, we got a request for additional Signals personnel.  If this suggestion were carried out, we would have to come back here to get permission to send out even one wireless operator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some strange reasons have been given for the maintenance of the section in its present form.  I do not think Deputy Booth helped the case the Minister is endeavouring to make.  Deputy Booth talked about the movement of troops <i>in camera</i>, that the operation could only be carried out by stealth and secrecy.  There was other talk about troops being in a very tight position, and the picture was painted of our fellows falling all over the Congo. If we reached that stage, then the Congo venture would be an appalling <Col N="1163" /> disaster for the United Nations.  But never let us think we shall reach that stage.  Our troops are not there to fight or to hold the Congo for any particular individual or group of individuals. Our people are in the Congo for one purpose, and that is to maintain the authority of Parliamentary Government.</P>
      <P>As I said the other day, I am not concerned with these individuals who flit across the stage&mdash;a variety of names which change from week to week, one taking the place of another temporarily displaced.  All that does not matter.  So far as the masses of the people and democracy are concerned, we must concern ourselves with maintaining the supremacy of democratic and Parliamentary Government. Our troops are not there for the purpose of fighting or showing their fighting power.  Our troops are there for the purpose of a police action.  It may be necessary, when you are dealing with semi-primitive people which colonising powers have kept in a primitive state for a long number of years, to defend yourself from attack, but that is only incidental to our purpose there. Our main purpose is to act as a police force and to try, along with the other nations associated with the United Nations there, to create a climate in which the Congolese people will endeavour to work out a settlement which pleases them and not one which pleases the Irish, the Belgians or any other group, whether represented in the Congo by troops or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of discharging our obligations to the United Nations.  I do not think there should be any two views about that.  We have committed ourselves to sending out troops there, and they are there.  They will be coming home and they are to be replaced in accordance with our undertaking that we would make a contribution towards the policing of the Congo State.  I travel that far without question, but I am not prepared to give the Minister power to double or treble that force without coming back to the Dáil and saying &ldquo;Look, a new situation has arisen in the Congo. <Col N="1164" /> Here is the situation&rdquo;&mdash;let him explain&mdash;&ldquo;The Government have considered the whole matter.  We feel it is necessary to do this, that or the other thing, and in these new circumstances we ask the Dáil for authority.&rdquo; We do not ask for a Bill to go through five Stages in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  We ask only for a motion.</P>
    <P>It takes three or four weeks to prepare these battalions to go to the Congo.  I remember one summer in 1936 when this Dáil was recalled by telegram for the purpose of reporting the fracture in the British Act of Succession caused by the sudden abdication of the now Duke of Windsor. We all assembled here and in one day we put George VI on the British throne, by our action in meeting here in response to that telegram, repaired the fracture in the Act of Succession and made George VI King of England. That was done by telegram. It was done in a day.  It takes three or four weeks to assemble a battalion for the Congo.  Why, while the assembling is going on, do not we call the Dail by telegram or in any other way we like?  The Dáil proceedings can be disposed of in 24 hours.  It will be another three or four weeks before the battalion is ready.  Then you have your moral authority and legal authority from the Dáil to add substantially to the force if in its collective wisdom the Dáil by a majority decides that the force should be substantially extended.</P>
    <P>Nobody has suggested that the Minister must come to the Dáil with a resolution if, when a battalion arrives in the Congo, somebody notices that they forgot the dentist and they send back for him, or if there is a driver short. Nobody suggested that it would require a resolution of this House before odds and ends of people like that can be sent to the Congo.</P>
    <P>I do not know the respective viewpoints of those who appear to share some of mine but we know the pattern of our Congo representation and I am in favour of allowing the Government to replace those people out there so that they may come home.  But, if the Government makes, as it is empowered <Col N="1165" /> in this section to make, a very substantial change in the number of troops that we send to the Congo, the Government should be asked to come back to the House.  The House can meet and discharge its responsibilities in 24 hours.  As I said, the battalion will not be ready for another 30 days.  Is it anything irksome to ask the Government to do that?  Is there any difficulty in that respect seeing that we have not a plane that will transport any of our troops to the Congo and have to rely on other people to provide that kind of transport?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at it from the point of view that all that is being asked of him is that before there is a substantial change in the pattern of our representation in the Congo the Government ought to be brought back to the Dáil and asked to put before the Dáil a resolution and the reasons for the resolution seeking to increase our military representation in the Congo.  That is not an irksome request.  It is not a difficult request. A sudden meeting of the Dáil has been used for a much less noble purpose and I can see no reason why it should not be used on this occasion to provide the Dáil with an opportunity of considering whether in the circumstances we should send additional troops or not.</P>
    <P>Judging by the rate at which troops are pulling out of the Congo at the present moment it looks as if we will have the honour of being the last there. The story of the ten little nigger boys looks like being a longer saga than the story of representation in the Congo, judging by the rate at which troops from the different countries are pulling out, troops of countries who have a much deeper interest in the maintenance of peace in the Congo and in Africa than we have.</P>
    <P>This is not merely a military question; it is a political question as well. If the Government want to change the pattern of our representation in the Congo they should be required to come back here and each Deputy who is legislating to draft these people to the Congo should be given an opportunity, and should give his own conscience <Col N="1166" /> an opportunity, of saying whether in the new circumstances he thinks it wise that we should embark upon a policy of large-scale extension of our representation in the Congo.</P>
    <P>There is nothing irksome in this at all.  It is merely asking the Minister to come here.  A review in any case at any stage would be well worth while from the Government's point of view, the Minister's point of view and the Army point of view.  The proceedings in the Dáil for one day will not interfere with the 30-day preparation necessary to assemble the battalion. I do not see that there is any real difficulty.</P>

      <P>I was a little surprised at the intervention of Deputy Mulcahy, who is a distinguished and very experienced member of the Legislature. I was surprised by his suggestion that while he saw that there were certain loopholes in this legislation we should trust the Minister and the Government in the circumstances and allow this Bill to go through.  I was deeply interested because my memories are so fresh of the debate which took place earlier on today here, when we were discussing the Order of Business and the interpretation of certain legislation concerned with C.I.E., in which the Taoiseach was reminded of what he had said when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He pointed out, quite rightly, &ldquo;It is not contained in the legislation, so I am not bound by any reflections I may have made at that time&rdquo;.  It seems to me that that as much as anything else of general principle would reinforce our contention that whatever we intend should be the law binding any Government.  We are not particularly concerned about this Government or its successors but any Government <Col N="1167" /> should be precisely guided in any action that it may be called on to take in future in another contingency such as the one we are concerned with at the moment.</P>
      <P>We accept completely, with the reservation I have made in other debates, the need to send out the reinforcements required by the Government. We have accepted that principle but I must remind Deputy Mulcahy again that we all pass away but legislation is permanent and whatever any of us may decide to-night may be the law under which some future Minister, who does not share any of our views, even though they may be diverse at the moment, may bind the Legislature or the country to the letter of the law as he reads it.</P>
      <P>So, I would appeal to Deputy Mulcahy, if he has any doubts about the powers being given here, not to depend on the goodwill of future Ministers or the present Minister but to bind him very precisely to whatever he has in mind in relation to future actions of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that we could put down a motion.  Everybody knows that I would very much like to discuss in great detail this Congo situation and that I failed to have been allowed to do so.  I am not questioning that at this stage but, clearly, I did not have as full a debate as I would like to have had.  That may not be of very great importance in so far as I am a minority but it is important that whatever views any Deputy may have on any particular subject and which represent a point of view held by any minority of people, he should be allowed to put them forward here.  I am sure that is a point which should have occurred to Deputy Booth.  I am sure Deputy Booth cannot give us an undertaking that if we were to put down a motion of censure in relation to the activities in the Congo, which I could justify I think, that we would get a debate on that motion before this Dáil dissolves, do not mind before the Dáil rises for this recess, before the Dáil dissolves completely.  In fact, although they did <Col N="1168" /> not say it, that was a dishonest evasion of the real point at issue in this whole question&mdash;the reason for which this amendment was put down&mdash;namely, Parliamentary control, democratic control.  Whether we are right or wrong and whether our views recommend themselves to the other members of the House, is immaterial beside the fact that we have a right which is a sacrosanct principle in our Parliamentary democracy.  That is the point that is at issue here, not whether the military will be allowed to use machine-guns or old fashioned weapons or whether they will be allowed to go on ten-day patrols to one part of the Congo or another.</P>
    <P>We are involved in the most delicate political situation that has faced this country since the last war or perhaps even since the appalling Civil War.  We are facing a deteriorating situation in the Congo.  The Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition agree that it is impossible to forecast what is going to happen in the Congo in the next few months. Nobody can tell.  There is the awful possiblity of a civil war involving 12,000,000 people, a situation which does not bear thinking about.  We, with our own knowledge of our own civil war tragedy, must understand that is a situation which may present itself with great speed to the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be presented with the problem of what action he proposes to take should these unfortunate people decide on civil war.  The whole United Nations conception is a wonderful one which we all back to the hilt, but it is in its toddling stage, in its absolute infancy.  It is inconceivable you could give a measure of the situation such as exists in the Congo to the Minister until we know what is involved in our guarantee to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I am completely at odds with the Taoiseach on this question.  He holds that our commitments are of one kind while I hold they are of another. None of us knows until we have had considerably more experience of this action how far we will be committed in any activity in the Congo or elsewhere. <Col N="1169" /> If the United Nations takes over Algeria and its problems from de Gaulle we shall have another terribly difficult situation.  In the quickly changing and unfortunately deteriorating situation in the world&mdash;in Africa, Asia and elsewhere&mdash;I think we must here retain as close a control on the Army as we have up to the present retained.</P>
    <P>The Army is merely like the Garda or any other part of the services&mdash; an instrument of policy.  It has no independent right of expression at all in the taking of political decisions. Every action we take is a political action and the Army carries out our political decisions and we feel those political decisions should be retained here in the House and by the House and that we should not surrender any of our sovereignty, as Deputy Booth suggested we had done, in our participation in this operation.</P>
    <P>Neither do I accept his suggestion about what he called our ill-informed debates.  I can only describe that as being a very insolent reference.  Why should our debates be ill-informed? Admittedly, we are not fully informed at times, but to the best of our ability we inform ourselves and it is to that purpose that we put down Questions and intervene in debates&mdash;so that we can ask people who have the information that we cannot have for the correction of any misapprehensions under which we may be labouring, or any false conclusions at which we may be in danger of arriving, from the facts at our disposal.  That is the whole purpose of the Parliamentary democracy in which we believe.</P>
    <P>Because of the serious nature of the present situation we feel the Dáil should continue to reserve to itself the final power to send out those troops after examination of the problem and after, as the Taoiseach has explained, the decision has been justified.  I have had very bitter experience of attempting to get information as a result of Parliamentary Questions.  I have been pilloried here by the Taoiseach simply because I ask questions.  When we were discussing the motion on the Congo, we heard the Taoiseach tell the Leader of the Opposition that he would <Col N="1170" /> not give Government time, even to the Leader of the Opposition, for a motion unless he himself were allowed to write the motion.  I think that must dispose of the suggestion that there is any satisfactory way of dealing with this difficult question other than by bringing it before the House.</P>
    <P>Anyone who examines the actions of the Government in this matter objectively must concede that they have certainly changed their minds from the time they took action at the beginning. The Taoiseach's subsequent actions are a complete reversal of the Government's original action.  Consequently, we cannot accept the suggestion that the Taoiseach or the Government are the best arbiters, are the most infallible arbiters, in taking any decisions in relation to our soldiers.</P>
    <P>I would say again that we press this amendment.  I would add the suggestion that if the Minister wishes, if he really is solely concerned with the matters he referred to&mdash;the lorry drivers and the dentists&mdash;if he feels he would be confronted with that kind of problem, his draftsmen would give us a new section which would meet with the wishes of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt already with the reasons it is impossible to accept this amendment.  I do not think it would be feasible for the Government to ask for anything more specific than the authority to send a contingent overseas.  It would not be feasible to specify the number of men it is proposed to send.  For instance, in the case of the present contingent in the Congo, we originally sent one battalion.</P>
      <P>In a very short time we had an urgent request from the Secretary-General of the United Nations to send more troops.  It would have been ridiculous if we were tied by a decision to come back and ask for authority to send one further battalion which was, in fact, doubling the one we had actually sent.  We had the advice of the Army authorities that it was a feasible proposition to send another battalion there.  We had the urgent request from the Secretary-General that it was vitally necessary that further troops would be sent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> It was not long since the matter had been debated and the Dáil had given authority to send a contingent.  It would be unreasonable, I think, to tie the Government to coming back in every instance.  It would be absolutely unnecessary, in the first place.  I have made it quite clear that this is a necessary power for the Government to have.  Provision is made that in specific instances the authority of the Dáil to send a contingent of more than 12 must be sought.  After that, it should be a matter for the Government to decide whether or not reinforcements are necessary and desirable. Practically every speaker has admitted that the type of situation he is anxious to guard against is one which is unlikely to arise.  The type of situation we want to provide for is the situation that has actually arisen and is likely to arise again in similar circumstances. It is one in which the Government would require to be in a position to act with reasonable speed.  I cannot, therefore, accept this amendment.</P>

Tá sé ar intinn go n-íocfaí cnapshuimeanna de £2,000 más fir singil atá san áireamh agus de £3,500 más fir phósta iad, gan bacadh le céim, sa bhreis ar pé sochair a bheidh ag dul fé na hAchtanna Arm-Phinsean do chleithiúnaithe na ndaoine a luaitear.

    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to make provision for the payment during the present financial year of certain lump sums to the dependants of former members of the Defence Forces who either were killed while serving with the United Nations Force in the Congo, or died from wounds or disease attributable to such service.  What is proposed is that, in addition to such benefits as the dependdants of the personnel referred to may be entitled to under the Army Pensions Acts, lump sums of £2,000 in the case of unmarried men and £3,500 in the case of married men, irrespective of rank, should be paid.  The Estimate is for the sum of £34,500 and is based on the prospective or possible payment of lump sums of £3,500 each to seven widows and lump sums of £2,000 each to the dependants of five unmarried men.  The cases involved are those of one married officer, one unmarried and two married non-commissioned officers, and two married and two unmarried soldiers killed in action; one unmarried soldier missing, and presumed dead, as a result of the same action; one married officer and one unmarried soldier killed accidentally, and one married non-commissioned officer who died following a surgical operation. In the last-mentioned case payment of the lump sum, as well as payment of benefit under the Army Pensions Acts, will depend on its being established that death was due to disease attributable to service.  In the case of the officer who was accidentally <Col N="1174" /> killed and who was not a member of the 9th Brigade, it may be that compensation will be payable direct by the United Nations, in which event a second payment will not be made by us.  As I stated recently in reply to a question asked by Deputy Cosgrave it is proposed to seek from the United Nations a refund of whatever payments are made.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that all Deputies will agree with the contemplated amounts of the lump sums and I, therefore, commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree entirely with the proposal to pay lump sum compensation to the dependants of those who died in the Congo.  This compensation will in no way compensate for the grievous personal losses sustained but it is at least evidence of the country's desire to recompense in some degree those who made the initial sacrifice towards establishing peace and bringing order out of chaos.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if the family of a person who dies while serving in the Congo will qualify for a payment of this kind?  I understand from the Minister that in one case the United Nations may pay compensation and there will not be two payments made in that case.  In the event of a person dying as a result of an accident as distinct from losing his life in an ambush or an accidental shooting will the dependants of such a person be entitled to compensation?  I feel that no matter how a person died in the Congo his service was given freely in the same way as that of those who died in the ambush and that his relatives should benefit in the same way. Subject to that query I endorse the Minister's remarks and support the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be widespread public approval of the decision to pay compensation to the next of kin of those who lost their lives in the Congo in what was a noble effort by the United Nations Organisation to endeavour to bring back order and the rule of law into the chaotic situation in the Congo.  These young men&mdash;they were all young men&mdash;would be with us <Col N="1175" /> here today in life and in spirit were it not for the fact that their generous impetuosity and their heroic spirit of humanity induced them to serve in the Congo in the cause of peace.  They would, therefore, be entitled to take their place as martyrs in the cause of peace and in the effort by the United Nations Organisation to establish the rule of peace and order throughout the world.</P>
      <P>No compensation will be adequate for the next of kin for the loss of their dear ones.  There is a vacant place in many homes today because of the casualties which our troops suffered in the Congo.  Unfortunately, it has not been possible to avoid those casualties, but as they have taken place the whole country will expect the Government to be generous in so far as they can do it in softening the sufferings, economic and otherwise, that many families will have to bear in consequence of the Congo deaths.  I am glad that the Minister is making money available on this scale to recompense the relatives of the dead without regard to rank.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned in the Minister's speech that these people will be entitled to other benefits under the Army Pensions Acts and we hope that these benefits will not be attenuated by the fact that they are receiving this compensations.  I take it that the ordinary soldier and N.C.O., who was covered for social welfare benefits while in the Army, will not have these benefits attenuated because of the payment of compensation and that that compensation will be over and above anything to which his dependants are entitled under the Army Pensions Acts and the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I wish to say that we welcome this move on the part of the <Col N="1176" /> Government to try to compensate or help in some way the dependants and relatives of the young men who sacrificed their lives in the Congo.  When this was first announced, the announcement helped through the House the Pensions Bill for the dependants of these young men.  It was the announcement that these lump sums were to be paid that enabled the Government to get through the House the miserable allowances which they had in mind with regard to the pensions scheme.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the position is with regard to the possibility that the Government will be refunded some of this money from United Nations sources.  I wonder would the Minister say whether the Government have in mind something of that nature.  I read recently that there was a possibility that the Government would be reimbursed for the expenditure involved in the payment of these lump sums to the relatives of the young men who died.  If it is true that the Government is to be refunded, in whole or in part, the amount of money which is being voted here tonight, then the question of their generosity is not so important.  I do not know how accurate the statement is and I am asking for information.  If there is a possibility of a refund, I think the Government and the country have a duty to make a very generous gesture out of our own resources in addition to whatever funds may be made available by the U.N.O.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to the Deputies who spoke for the manner in which they received the Estimate and for the tributes which they paid to the young men who unfortunately lost their lives in the Congo.  With regard to the points that were raised, a person who died as a result of accident or disease in the Congo will be covered, provided the death is held to have arisen out of his service.  I can assure Deputy Norton that the benefits to which widows of the people killed would be entitled under the Social Welfare Acts will be available in addition to the payments granted under the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of whether the money will be refunded <Col N="1177" /> by the United Nations, as I said in my opening statement it is proposed to seek from the United Nations a refund of whatever payments are made. I cannot say at the moment whether it will be recoverable in whole or in part but it is intended to claim it.  This liability was incurred by the Government as a result of United Nations service and we consider that it should be a matter for the United Nations but, of course, we also contribute our share to the funds of the United Nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be quite obvious to the Minister by now, in view of the long discussion that has taken place on this amendment, that there is considerable disquiet in the House about paragraph (c) of Section 2.  I accept the fact that the Government must be in a position to take sudden and decisive action but as has been pointed out by other Deputies, any action that would be taken in this sphere will be political action.  Therefore, the Minister must have the power but I suggest that paragraph (c) is badly drafted.  The Minister will not be losing face in any way and he will be meeting the wishes of quite a few Deputies if he takes another look at the section.  It is possible under this section that the entire Irish Army could be sent to the Congo independent of any political discussion whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out by several speakers here, even by speakers in my own Party, that no Minister in his senses would ever take action like that.  That may be so but our duty here as legislators is to see that proper <Col N="1178" /> legislation is passed and that legislation is binding on anybody who comes after us here.  I do not know exactly &mdash;I am not a draftsman myself&mdash;how the Minister would meet the situation. I do not believe that paragraph (c) should be deleted altogether as the amendment suggests.  Paragraph (c) is essential but some safeguard should be inserted.  Some power in the hands of the Government is necessary but I do not think they should be allowed such wide powers entirely independent of political control.  The Minister suggests that this matter can be dealt with by a motion in Dáil Éireann.  He knows perfectly well that that is not possible because by the time that motion came before us the whole political situation in the Congo, which is what we are concerned with here, could be entirely and dramatically changed.</P>
    <P>I do not know what has been agreed to among the Whips in regard to this Bill as to whether it is to go through in its entirely.  I do not know if it is possible to postpone discussion on the section so that the Minister would have time to consider it again with his advisers.  I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister because I believe the Taoiseach has directed him to get this Bill through as quickly as possible.  I agree that this Bill is essential, that it should be passed as quickly as possible but there is no use in our pounding through legislation and the Minister trying to pound through legislation when obviously there is a considerable volume of opinion against paragraph (c) as it stands.  If this paragraph stands it means that the Minister or the Government can send any number of troops to the Congo or anywhere else without any reference to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I support any actions the Government are taking to fulfil their obligations as a member of the United Nations, but I am opposing these powers being given without any political control.  It is all right for Dáil Éireann as a whole to take those decisions and I think we should defend our right to do that.  I should not vote for the amendment which is for the deletion of the section as a whole but <Col N="1179" /> I would ask the Minister to try to meet the wishes of quite a few <Col N="1180" /> Deputies by taking another look at this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (b), line 13, to delete &ldquo;whether before or on or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We suggest that these words should be deleted because we would like those men in the Defence Forces who volunteered for service in the Congo after July, when the Defence (Amendment) <Col N="1181" /> (No. 1) Bill was introduced and whose application for service was accepted by the Minister or by an officer authorised by him, as laid down in the Bill to have an opportunity to reconsider their attitude.  We believe that the changes proposed in this Bill are of such a radical and fundamental nature, retaining the service of any volunteer overseas for an unlimited period, that he should be given an opportunity to reconsider his decision to volunteer.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we think it is desirable simply from the point of view of the great change that has taken place in his status as a member of the Defence Forces.  Thirdly, we think it is desirable because the situation in the Congo is completely different from what it was when our men went out in July. They are facing a situation of possible civil war with all the associated terrible consequences.  They are now in a position to assess the situation there from the first-hand experience which their colleagues have had in the Congo and they might like to reconsider the whole matter.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Taoiseach has assessed the position in one way in July.  He has assessed the position in a completely different way now.  I am not criticising him for that at all.  He has a perfect right to do that and, indeed, has a responsibility to do it.  But, just as he exercised that right, all the ordinary members of the Defence Forces should be given an opportunity to decide as from the date of the passing of this Bill whether they wish to be held to their offer of voluntary service abroad and wish to go abroad. They may decide to go, even in spite of the apparently deteriorating situation and the possibility of civil war and in the knowledge that they are now rather inadequately, and probably completely inadequately equipped for the possibilities of jungle warfare or bush warfare or they may, for their own personal reasons or for domestic reasons, family reasons, decide that in all the circumstances they would prefer not to go abroad and would prefer to stay at home and discharge their responsibilities in the ordinary way as members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> There is another consideration.  These men have a right to assess not only the military position there and to come to a decision in regard to it but they have a right to assess the political changes which have taken place in the Congo. They were asked to go forward in the first instance as a United Nations force whose purpose was to hand back the Congo, or to see that the Congo was handed back, to the Congolese people as rapidly as possible and because of that opportunity to help the Congolese people they may have felt that they would like to go out and make their contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not agree with me, most Deputies may not agree with me, but very radical political changes also have taken place in the Congo and there may be members of the Defence Forces who share my view that the Defence Forces are being used for purposes for which they were not originally intended&mdash;the possible partitioning of the Congo and the other matters to which I referred on a number of occasions concerning the Government, the Parliament, the Premier, and so on&mdash;and they may for political reasons be anxious to change their minds and reconsider the decision and go out or not go out, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has made it clear that there is no shortage of volunteers for the new force, that he will have no difficulty, that the recruiting campaign has been most successful and that he believes the possibility of going to the Congo has shown itself to be an added incentive to recruitment. He is the best man to decide about that.  He may have the figures, and I hope we will get them from him next year, as to what the increase in recruitment has been as a result of the incentive of going to the Congo.  But, in the present situation we feel it would be better that any man who volunteered for one particular purpose and who believes that that purpose either militarily or politically has now changed, should be given an opportunity of considering the position again and, if he wants to go, let him go, let him volunteer again, let the officer in the ordinary form accept on <Col N="1183" /> behalf of the Minister and then carry through in the ordinary way, as suggested by the Minister.  But, the right to change his mind in the altered circumstances of the legislation, the military situation and the political situation should now be accorded to every member of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I had made it perfectly clear, I thought, during the Second Reading debate that there was no question of any personnel who volunteered to go to the Congo last July being held to that offer, that the battalion which is now being put in readiness was based entirely on a call for volunteers that was made within the past week or so, and that all personnel who are being assembled for that battalion are new volunteers, that there is no question of holding anybody to an offer made last July.</P>
      <P>I thought I had made that perfectly clear and I think it is regrettable that Deputy Browne should insist or pretend to believe that the opposite is the case&mdash;that some of those people may in fact be unwilling to go but that we are holding them to an offer which they made under different circumstances on the last occasion.  I agree that the tragic incident which occurred in the meantime has changed the circumstances this time but there is no question of holding a person to an offer made as far back as July last.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment because we need those words in the Bill.  We need the word &ldquo;before&rdquo; in order to ensure that we will have the authority to keep the troops already serving in the Congo there and who have volunteered for a period expiring on the 25th January next.  The legislation under which the present contingent is in the country will be repealed when this permanent legislation is passed and in order to keep the <i>status quo</i> it is essential that &ldquo;before&rdquo; should be retained in this section.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;before&rdquo; refers to last July but it applies only to personnel who are already serving in the Congo.  The personnel who are being assembled for the new battalion are all new volunteers&mdash;all people who volunteered for this new battalion.  Some of them may also have volunteered to go with the <Col N="1185" /> original battalions but were not called upon.  Their selection on this occasion is not based on any offer made at that time.  It is based on completely new offers of their services for the new battalion now being got ready.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is clear the Minister must keep the word &ldquo;before&rdquo; in this Bill; otherwise, he will be in difficulties with the people in the Congo.  What I would like to get from him is this: I understand that when the 32nd Battalion had been despatched, there were still a substantial number of volunteers and they were drafted into the 33rd Battalion which subsequently went to the Congo.  After that, there may have been a residue who were not assigned to either of those two battalions.  A lot of things have happened in the Congo in the meantime and the idea that it was a grand adventure has been dispelled by the happenings since the first two battalions were despatched. I take it from what the Minister said that anybody who volunteered in July or August and who was not accepted will not be held to his old offer of service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that in fact only those will be sent to the Congo who volunteered in the last week or two with their eyes wide open to the new situation.  In that case, only those who had volunteered in the last week or two will be sent?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's statement on the matter is quite clear.  It is imperative that he should have authority to keep the existing troops in the Congo after this Bill has been passed.  If he did not have this clause in the Bill, he would not have that power.  I am aware that there is still a spirit of adventure prompting the troops who are volunteering for the Congo.  They are not disheartened in any way.  Their morale is high and I should not like that it would go out from this House that there was any lowering of morale among the troops because of what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that this amendment was not put down for the purpose of suggesting, as Deputy MacEoin did, that there was an idea the morale of the Army had gone down.  There is no question about that.  The Minister has covered the point completely when he states that, insofar as signing for service with the new battalion is concerned, the volunteers will not be asked to do so until this measure becomes law. Every man is now in the position that his eyes are opened.  I have not the slightest doubt that many will go in a spirit of adventure.  Apart from that, there are many very sensible, reasonable men who would like to know for certain that they will not be used for the purpose of partitioning the Congo.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Section 3 put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other enactment the maximum period of service of personnel despatched <Col N="1187" /> for service outside the State for the purposes of this Act shall not exceed six months on any one period of such service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have asked for the insertion of this new section because we think a six-month period is the maximum desirable.  I do not suggest that our men would not stay there as long as they were asked or expected to stay, but I think we should alternate our troops.  When we have an opportunity of switching battalions and interchanging forces we should not ask our men to serve for any longer period in the terribly demanding, onerous and strenuous conditions under which they are now operating in the Congo.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept six months but is prepared to make his own limitation, we would be agreeable to considering that.  Six months was the period accepted by the House in July.  We think it is the desirable period.  The main thing is that some limitation should be placed on the length of stay abroad by our troops undertaking difficult police duties and possibly having to live under military conditions at some stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We made it clear to the United Nations that the maximum period during which our troops would serve in the Congo would be six months.  We consider that is a reasonable period taking everything <Col N="1188" /> into account.  This Bill is not for the Congo alone.  It is for any future situation that may arise.  The circumstances in the future may be different. From the point of view of climate and conditions generally, the duties to be performed, we are satisfied that six months is more than enough to ask our troops to serve in the Congo.  We made that quite clear to the United Nations.  We are of that opinion still and we do not intend any of our troops to remain there for longer than six months.  Circumstances, however, in any particular situation will obviously have to determine the frequency with which troops should be replaced.  It is obvious there could be situations in which it would be no hardship for troops to remain for a longer period.  A period of twelve months might not be excessively long in a particular area provided the normal leave, and so forth, was available to our troops.  We cannot determine in advance that six months should be the maximum period for every situation that may arise in the future.  It is reasonable to ask that this should be left flexible.  It is obvious the Government would take the circumstances in every case into account and make the necessary stipulation before sending any contingent to help the United Nations.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  I think it is six months.  As far as I know, six months is the period in regard to all troops.  So far as our troops are concerned six months does not seem to be too much, as the Taoiseach stated on the Second Reading of the Bill.  We have had reports from the Chief of Staff, who has just come back from the Congo, that the troops are in very good heart; they have been working under difficult conditions and under considerable strain, but their morale is excellent; they are in good heart and in good condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Good heart is, of course, a characteristic of the Irish soldier everywhere and has won renown for him on the battlefields of the World.  My information is that there is tremendous enthusiasm about getting home from the Congo.  A correspondent of some standing says that he is looking forward to getting home soon; he wants to get out of &ldquo;this living hell&rdquo;.  That is the description in this letter I have here.  Having some knowledge of the territory I can sympathise with his point of view and I am anxious that we should not put our people into the position of being constrained by exigency to stay there longer.  They have been sent there to act as a police force.  In the event of war they will have no business there. War is no part of their function.</P>
      <P>There are 97 other countries in association with the United Nations Organisation and we are entitled to ask that they should discharge their obligations.  We ought not to be given either an undue proportion or a disproportion of responsibility in relation to other countries.  Neither should our people get the rough end of the stick acting as police in troublesome areas like the Congo.  I hope that the Minister will not be diverted by pleas of urgency to decide that our troops should stay there longer than those of other countries.  There are a whole lot of people who have not gone near the place at all.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton has raised a very interesting point in his quotation of the title of the Bill and the police character of the force going out.  I wonder if that can be verified by the Minister.  Part II of the requirements of the United Nations is that they have military assistance which may be necessary to the government of the Congo.  Is there any difference between police work and military assistance? Apropos of the amendment, in view of the Minister's undertaking that this six month period applies to soldiers serving in the Congo, and that it is the maximum period which they will be called on to serve, we withdraw the amendment.</P>

I raised this point on the Second Reading debate and I say that in introducing legislation likely to be permanent and which deals with the future, it should be borne in mind that we might be sending personnel abroad which would not consist of men.  We might be sending nurses or ambulance drivers abroad in conjunction with the Army.</P>

      <P>The Minister will remember that I also raised this point on Second Reading when I mentioned the case of a man born years ago in India of Irish parents who was unable to enter the United States of America because he was on the Indian quota. I see in this section where the births are to be registered.  In the event of personnel having children born to them in Africa, will it be possible to have such babies born in Africa registered here at home as being born of Irish parents?  I have already mentioned the case of a man 75 years of age who was unable to join his family in America because he was born in India.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Section 2.&mdash; To delete the words &ldquo;or reinforce&rdquo; in line 46.</P>
      <P>On an amendment moved on the Committee Stage to Section 2 subsection (2) (c) it was sought to delete the section.  The purpose of the subsection was to empower the Minister to send on service outside the country a contingent of troops if that contingent was intended to replace, in whole or in part, or reinforce a contingent of the Permanent Defence Forces serving outside the State as part of that international United Nations Force and consisting of more than 12 members of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to avoid as far as possible going over all the ground that has been covered in the Committee Stage discussion on the section.  I said then that, so far as I was concerned, I was prepared to agree that, having entered into the commitment to send troops to the Congo, we should continue to honour that if circumstances remained in any way comparable to those in which we first entered into the commitment. I would not, for example, see any special reason why if every other country pulled its troops out of the Congo we should leave Irish troops to provide a blood bath.  However, on the assumption that the circumstances would be comparable to those in which the contingent was sent in the first instance, and provided the Government were satisfied that nationally and internationally our continued participation in the policing of <Col N="1195" /> the Congo was justified, I was again willing to allow the replacement of those who were sent out so that they could be relieved for home duties and so that we could fulfil our obligations to those who went out, as well as to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>In this section, however, there is power taken to reinforce the troops which are out there and, in that connection, while the Dáil was sitting there might be two battalions of Irish troops in the Congo and, by the time we came back after the Christmas Recess, there might be four or five battalions of Irish troops in the Congo without Parliament having had an opportunity of considering the matter.  So long as Parliament is allowed to consider the matter, Parliament by a majority can take any decision it likes.  I do not question that.  Nevertheless, I take the view, and I think my parliamentary responsibilities compel me to take the view, that if having in the first instance agreed to a Bill which provides for the sending of two battalions of troops to the Congo, my support of its passage is used, or misused, as the case may be, to send three more battalions, then I am morally bound to take some steps to prevent an undesirable situation such as that arising.</P>
    <P>The Minister said to-day that this section was necessary because, when you got out to the Congo, you might discover that you were missing a signalman or a driver and, therefore, you needed some reinforcements.  However, I do not think we should give the Government &mdash; this Government or any Government &mdash; a Bill which empowers them to send out one contingent, in the first instance, followed perhaps by two contingents, not to reinforce the first but to increase its strength by 100 per cent., 200 per cent. or 300 per cent.</P>
    <P>If circumstances arise in which there is a call for reinforcements in the Congo the question ought to be discussed in the Dáil and the Minister ought to say: &ldquo;There is a change in the whole situation.  We originally intended to send two battalions but we now discover, for reasons with which we will acquaint the House, that more than two are necessary.  We think five <Col N="1196" /> are necessary.  As this is a wide departure from the decision taken in the first instance we think the Dáil should be told about it and we want authority to send&rdquo;&mdash; four, five, or six battalions, as the case may be.  Parliament want to get a chance of looking at that situation. It is not just a question of counting heads, but of an entirely new political situation in the Congo.  The Dáil ought to get a chance of evaluating circumstances of that kind and of saying what it wishes the Government to do.</P>
    <P>My amendment would not prevent the Government from replacing, in whole or part, the troops sent there. Having relieved them and brought them home, we could say to the Government: &ldquo;You cannot reinforce the troops you originally sent there unless you come to the Dáil and ask for the necessary authority to do that.&rdquo; After all, as I have said, these troops are not taking a position of Custer's Last Stand.  According to the Bill, they are there as police officers.  We are entitled to say to the people who want our police officers: &ldquo;We are willing to give you a certain number but beyond that we cannot go without coming to our own Parliament.&rdquo;  In the long run this Parliament is the custodian of the interests of the nation.</P>
    <P>I think the Government could quite easily accept, in detail or in principle, that it will not send troops to the Congo or elsewhere in excess of the number sent in the first instance without coming back to the Dáil and getting the necessary authority.  If the Dáil, in its wisdom, thinks the situation is such as would necessitate giving the Government authority to send additional troops its good sense would prevail on an occasion like that as it always has prevailed.  In the meantime the Government should be held to consulting Parliament so that the Parliament would have an opportunity of evaluating the whole situation afresh and in the light of what we should do in relation to others and in relation to the general circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>On this occasion I should like to support the Minister, although I usually oppose the Government. <Col N="1197" /> This is purely a military question. In the first instance, when the Government asks that a contingent be sent, it is a political issue.  But when that has been disposed of, it becomes a military matter.  The question as to whether there should be reinforcements or replacements is a military one and should be left to the Government.  It would be very dangerous to allow a matter of that kind to depend on a vote of the House.  Our forces could be annihilated while the House was discussing the situation.  I have no great faith in the House in matters purely military.  It is a fact that the Tan War was not declared by the then Dáil, but by individuals.  If it had been left to the House, the Tan War would never have been declared, and they would have been talking until they were defeated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton made a point that it would take several weeks to send reserves.  That occurred in the first case because we were sending volunteers. But now, since permanent forces will be sent, there is no question of a delay of several weeks.  A force could be sent in two days.  If we have the men, the United Nations will supply the planes.  This is a question of speed being necessary.  I agree that we should talk our heads off in the first instance when discussing whether or not to send a force, but, having decided to do so, it should be left to the military authorities to decide whether or not to send replacements or reinforcements.</P>

      <P>I take it Deputy Norton really intends this as a token amendment to give him an opportunity of expressing to the House the anxiety he feels in this matter rather than as a serious proposition, because I cannot imagine a sensible Deputy such as he is contemplating a situation in which, after a contingent had been <Col N="1198" /> dispatched to serve with a United Nations Police Force in any part of the world, no additional personnel of any kind could be sent to join them except after the passage of another resolution by the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any alternative in this matter to assuming that the Government of the day are going to act in a reasonable and responsible way.  That would involve, it seems to me, when proposing the resolution initially to the House explaining the extent of the commitment they were proposing to undertake and the circumstance in which they thought it might be necessary or desirable to extend that commitment. Once the House in these circumstances knew the mind of the Government and the requirements of the situation and had given its authority for action, I think the Government must then be left to deal with the arrangements and that any other course is impracticable.</P>
      <P>Personally, I cannot conceive any circumstances arising in which we will have an armed contingent abroad with a United Nations Force in which it will not be the aim of the Government in office, whoever they may be, to try to bring the House along with them and to bring public opinion along with them in every step they take in that direction and to limit their undertakings or commitments to the extent they feel satisfied that they will have that general support in the House and in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  I am not going to go into the many arguments which have been advanced during the afternoon for the case which our amendments cover.  I should like to support Deputy Norton.  My reason for seeking some Parliamentary control arises from the terribly difficult situation in <Col N="1199" /> the Congo at present, a problem which, the Government has made it clear, is a problem of great magnitude. There is no question, I am sure, in Deputy Norton's mind of trying to limit the Minister sending out the necessary additional lorry drivers, dentists, surgeons, physicians or whoever may be required to make the detachment function efficiently.  The point I am concerned with is that no appreciable reinforcements should be permitted without referring back the matter to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The reason I am concerned about this appreciable reinforcement is this. If an appreciable reinforcement is required it must be assumed that radical changes have taken place in the initial situation which the Government faced when they brought the problem before the House in the first instance. When they came, as they did in July, and said they wanted one or two battalions, they made their case for that. They established their point of view and they got our authority.  As the Taoiseach said, he brought the House along with him.  Obviously, that is the most satisfactory way from his point of view, from our point of view and from the country's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty which appears to arise here is that the Taoiseach could come along, <i>bona fide,</i> present his case, get authority from us on the face of the facts produced by him and of the situation and thereafter he need never refer to the Dáil again for subsequent reinforcements.  We have dealt with the question of Parliamentary Questions, motions and so on, and established in a reasonably satisfactory manner that they are likely to be completely ineffective.  The only way in which we can have any sort of elucidation of the situation and of the reasons why these people are going out there or why reinforcements are required is in the restricted debate we have here on the particular problem. That has been most helpful, maybe only to a minority, but it is an important minority.  Any minority is important It may put their minds at rest.  It certainly clears up some doubts they may have; it has left some doubts in their minds but it was an <Col N="1200" /> advance on the position where we could send out reinforcements without any attempt to reassess the position after July.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the position has changed very radically indeed.  We are in a situation the outcome of which is completely unpredictable by any of us.  There is this prospect, as I said, of terrible civil war and in those circumstances it would greatly help the House and greatly reassure the people if they knew that if the Government honestly believed that we should send out very considerable reinforcements they would have to come back to the House and make their case.  We are just as reasonable as the Government are.  If the case is reasonable, the Government can make their point and can have their reinforcements.  In spite of what Deputy Sherwin says, the House can act rapidly and speedily when required.  I do not think the Taoiseach will find that any Deputy or any Party was likely to make his difficult position more difficult but we would greatly appreciate his continuing to accept the right of Parliament as a whole to make our points of view known.  It would be for himself to reject or accept them as he thinks fit. He, with the Government, would have to accept the final responsibility.  It is he ultimately who will have to accept that responsibility.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, this is a situation which is changing so rapidly that it would appear to me that the Taoiseach should welcome the expression of every point of view in the House so that he might get some assistance from us.  Most of our contributions have been in an attempt to find out the facts, to find out whether our conclusions are right or wrong in order that we may in that way inform the country.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to consider whether there is not some way, possibly not Deputy Norton's amendment, but some way the draftsman could devise, whereby it would be possible for him to send out the forces required to maintain in the field the number stated in the first instance without any delay of any kind but, where a radical change took place requiring serious or appreciable reinforcements, <Col N="1201" /> he would come back to the House, put his case to us and then take his decision on whatever conclusions he arrives at after that debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Parliamentary Government requires for its efficient operation the application zealously and continuously of checks and balances.  In that respect an Opposition has very considerable responsibilities, not merely to Parliament but to the people it represents.  It is a quite reasonable precaution to say to the Government in general principle, &ldquo;We support you in broad outline on things with which we agree but we are entitled to be consulted and to have an opportunity of evaluating a changing situation from time to time so that we can express our point of view and see whether we are necessarily still with you in altered circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In certain circumstances, as is known to every Deputy here, this House generously gave the necessary sanction to send troops to the Congo as police officers, and that is their function there.  So far as the House is concerned, therefore, its goodwill for sending these troops to the Congo in the circumstances then existing is well known and I do not think anybody wants to get away from that situation.  I certainly do not.  If we are a member of the United Nations, we ought to abide by the rules and play our part in doing that.  Others, of course, have similar responsibilities and we must not be left standing in the wreckage of United Nations, saying that we are the Casabianca of the whole outfit, that everybody else can get off the boat and go anywhere they like to safety.  Our loyalty does not necessarily mean that we stand on the wreck there to be consumed in its last stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got a responsibility <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Congo and elsewhere of seeing what changes take place from the time we give approval to the Government to do a particular thing.  If the Government are satisfied that it is necessary to replace the troops in the Congo by other troops from here, well and good.  I travel that far with them.  I do not see in the circumstances just at the moment why we <Col N="1202" /> should change our line of policy in that respect but I think the Opposition is morally obliged to say to the Government, &ldquo;If, however, you are going to send to the Congo in changed circumstances two or three times more troops than you got authority from us to send in the first instance, you must come back to the Dáil and tell us what the changed circumstances are.&rdquo;  That is not unreasonable and that is necessary if you are to carry the goodwill of the House with the Government in an effort to fulfil our obligations under the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The Korean business and American &gt;-participation in Korea changed an American Government and caused considerable bitterness.  I should not like to see grow up in this country a group, party or section, or whatever you like to call it, demanding that you take back the people from the Congo. It would be a bad business for the Government, a bad business nationally and internationally.  There is a great deal to be said for the Government carrying the House with it in what it does.</P>
    <P>If, however, we should take the line of substantially extending the number of troops used overseas without the obligation to come to the House and to explain the circumstances which necessitate these changes, the Opposition would be entitled to feel aggrieved by that change of policy on the part of the Government but I would not accuse the Government of any &ldquo;smart alecking&rdquo; in doing that.  If we pass this section, the law would permit them.  There would be nothing immoral or illegal or unparliamentary so far as the Government is concerned. It would mean that the Opposition would have forfeited their right to a close appraisal of the change in the circumstances as compared with the circumstances when the Government got the authority in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I do not want to emphasise any disagreement with the Government in their approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied if the Government keep within the limits of the contingents they sent out in the first instance but I do not want a contingent of <Col N="1203" /> 2,500 to be reinforced by another 3,000.  If the Government could do that &mdash;as they are legally entitled to do under this Bill &mdash; they would be departing from the circumstances which induced the House in the first place to send a contingent of 2,500.  If the Taoiseach is prepared to say that we shall not increase the number of our troops over and above the original contingent, whether that is in one or in two parts.  I would be quite satisfied. I would ask him to give us that assurance and to say that he would consult with the leaders of the different Parties and give them an opportunity of debating the matter if they wish to do so.  I should not be advising the Government to take these safeguards which would enable them to carry the House and the country with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that in my view a Government coming here with a resolution under this Bill should be very frank with the House and try to define the limits of the commitment into which they were proposing to enter.  As regards the Congo, I mentioned that we have already made it clear to the United Nations that, as from January next, our commitments in the Congo must be limited to one battalion and that we are unable to go beyond that, not because we think the situation may not require more United Nations troops but because our resources do not permit of it.  The United Nations have been so aware for many months past.</P>
      <P>May I point out, however, that the term battalion is somewhat elastic. When we decided to send the 32nd Battalion to the Congo, the Government consulted the Army Command as to what number would constitute a properly integrated, effective battalion with all the necessary components in it.  It worked out at about one hundred more than we had first assumed.  I have informed the Dáil that we have told the United Nations that our commitment in respect of the Congo force must be restricted to one battalion as from January.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6 &mdash; The Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following section after section 8:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;8A.&mdash;(1)  A Dáil elector shall be entered in the postal voters list for his constituency if he is&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a member of the Garda Síochána, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> (b)  a whole time member of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where, not later than the last day for making claims referred to in Rule 9 of the First Schedule to this Act, an elector who is a whole time member of the Defence Forces furnishes a statement of the place in which, but for his service, he would be ordinarily resident on the qualifying date to the registration officer for the registration area in which that place is situate, the statement shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be accepted as a correct statement and he shall be registered in the constituency in which that place is situate.</P>
    <P>(3) (a)  In this section &ldquo;a whole time member of the Defence Forces&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a member of the Permanent Defence Force, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  an officer of the Reserve Defence Force employed continuously on military service or duty during a period during which a proclamation authorising the calling out of reservists on permanent service is in force, or during a period during which reservists are called out on permanent service under section 88 of the Defence Act, 1954, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  a reservist called out on permanent service.</P>
    <P>(b)  In the foregoing paragraph &ldquo;the Permanent Defence Force,&rdquo;&ldquo;officer,&rdquo;&ldquo;the Reserve Defence Force,&rdquo;&ldquo;proclamation authorising the calling out of reservists on permanent service&rdquo; and &ldquo;reservist&rdquo; have the same meanings respectively as they have in the Defence Act, 1954.&rdquo;'</P>
    <P>This is a tidying-up amendment.  It omits the reference contained in the section of the Bill to temporary absence which, if retained, would throw doubts on the discretion of a registration officer to register persons who are ordinarily resident if they should be temporarily absent from home.  It is in order to remedy that, that I wish the House to agree to this amendment. <Col N="1206" /> Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>This really is a drafting amendment. Under Section 9 the Minister should have been given power to direct the manner and the order in which postal voters' lists are to be arranged.  Under Rule 3 of the First Schedule to the 1923 Act, which the amendment proposes to repeal, it is required that the list be made up according to polling districts. It is felt that that requirement may not, in fact, always be the best method and it is because of that that we have brought in this amendment.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Amendment of Military Pensions Legislation&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>In view of the facts that a large number of persons at present in receipt of Military Service Pensions receive less than £1 per week, that the services of these people played no small part in the foundation of the State and that their numbers are now appreciably reduced by the effluxion of time, Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that the past services <Col N="1207" /> of these people should be more generously recognised and calls upon the Government to introduce forthwith amending legislation to ensure a reasonable standard of living for them in their declining years.&mdash; (Deputy Tierney.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little I want to add to what has been said and to what I have already said in support of this motion.  That section of our community which has to rely on military service pensions is a section to whch the State owes a great deal.  It is a section which has not had in recent years the measure of recognition it ought to have had from the authorities.  We recognise these people as requiring a measure of assistance but we have closed our eyes to the fact that the assistance given in the past has been consistently minimised and reduced by the rising cost of living.  It is worthy of note that in the last few days it has become apparent that, under the present Administration, the cost of living has risen by four points in the past twelve months.  If we take 1957 as an example, the impact of the consistently rising cost of living, due to Government policy, has reduced the real value of pensions and has increased the burden which people in receipt of such assistance have to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tierney's motion pinpoints a very real grievance suffered by a needy section of the community, a section to which both the House and the State owe a duty.  It is only reasonable now that the Government should be asked to introduce forthwith amending legislation to ensure to these people a reasonable standard of living. I suggest the proper course would be to tie the measure of assistance thought appropriate to the changes in money values brought about by the cost of living.  If an increase of £1 or 30/- is thought desirable now it should be tied to the present cost of living so that, if the cost of living continues to rise, as presumably it will until the present Government is put out of office, pensions will be adjusted <i>pro rata.</i>  If, of course, there should be a fall in the cost of living, pensions will have to suffer an adjustment accordingly. <Col N="1208" /> In these terms, I support the motion proposed by Deputy Tierney.</P>

      <P>Aontaim go h-iomlán leis an dtairiscint seo. Mothaím go mbeidh an Dáil buíoch don Teachta Ó Tighearnaigh a thug an rud seo fé díospóireacht.  Cuireadh fáilte roimh an dtairiscint ó gach taobh den Tigh agus is cómhartha é sin go bhfuiltear toilteanach rud éigin do dhéanamh ar son na bhfear a dhein a gcuid go fonnmhar chun saoirse na h-Éireann a bhaint amach.

      <P>I sympathise with this motion. Those people who got trifling pensions years ago are needier to-day than they have ever been.  The numbers are gradually diminishing, but age is increasing the hardships on those who survive.  It is time that there was a revision of the law relating to pensions.</P>
      <P>My main purpose in speaking on this motion is to bring one case to the notice of the Minister.  A friend of mine has been in Saint Bricin's hospital since last June.  He was wounded in 1920 or 1921 while serving with the column in North Tipperary. Because he was on the run, there was no possibility of his getting the medical and hospital treatment he should have got.  In 1922 he joined the Army. After serving for a few months he was forced to leave because of physical incapacity. Ever since, year after year, he has been up for treatment for boils which break all over his system.  His entire constitution was affected by the wound in his foot.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations he is precluded from a full disability pension. There is not a doctor in the country who would not certify him as fully incapacitated.  Under the regulations he is precluded from benefit.  He was the breadwinner of his family.  His livelihood was completely cut off.  In a case like that there surely should be more generous treatment from the State he helped to create.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I think it is my duty to thank the various Deputies on all sides of the House who supported this motion.  I may say that, with the possible exception of one Deputy, they gave me credit for bringing the motion into this House with the intention of trying to remedy a wrong that has been done to a section of our own people down through the years.  I can honestly say that I have dealt with a large number of these grievances and complaints from people representing the Old I.R.A. and I am glad to see Deputies from both sides of the House stand up here, trying to force the Government to do justice to the people who made it possible for me and for everybody else here to represent the Irish people in an Irish Parliament.</P>
      <P>I had no political motive or aim in putting down this motion.  I thought that by putting it down in one name only nobody could say that it was brought in for a political motive.  I am very glad that the majority of the Deputies here have recognised that and have spoken in favour of giving an increase to the people for whom I speak.  Many Deputies are under the impression that because so many Old I.R.A. men are in such poor circumstances they qualify for the special allowances and that there is no need to give them any further consideration. I confined the wording of my motion so that it related only to the lower grades, the people who are getting less than £1 a week.  A number of Deputies will be surprised to learn that a big number of Old I.R.A. men are drawing 2/7d., 3/6d. and 5/6d. a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must congratulate those who gave the first increase to the Old I.R.A. They gave the people in receipt of less than £100 a year an increase of 50 per cent.  The present Government <Col N="1210" /> gave them increases of 6 per cent. and 11 per cent., so that from the Pensions Act of 1934 to the present day these people have got a total increase of 61 per cent.</P>
    <P>Any person reading that a section of the community had got an increase of 61 per cent. would assume that they were not doing too badly but the majority of the people for whom I speak are drawing roughly about £10 a year.  That is worth about £3.14.0. at the present time.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question put down last week, the Minister for Finance stated that £1 in actual cash was now worth 7/5d.  The increases that have been given to those Old I.R.A. men have brought the £10 pension up to £16.10.0. a year, the cash value of which is now £6.3.9d.  Instead of bringing up the pension of the people who made it possible for this House to function, we have reduced them as compared with the amount first given to them when the pensions were voted in 1924 and 1934.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the Minister's reply to my statement in moving the motion that the people who did not apply for a military service pension until 1934 did not qualify under the 1934 Act.  I am not saying that the Minister was deliberately misleading the House but I want to make it quite clear that the vast majority of Old I.R.A. men who took the Republican side and did not apply under the 1924 Act were not qualified under the 1934 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>But when the Minister's predecessor brought in the 1934 Act, he deliberately excluded his own people from qualifying under the 1924 Act.  I want that down on the records of the House.  The Minister at that time, by one stroke of the pen, could have qualified the men who then applied under the 1934 Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  But was it not within the power of the Minister who drafted the 1934 Act to make these people qualify under the 1924 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>But he did not.  He deliberately did not include his own group of people who did not apply or did not qualify, whichever way the Minister wants to put it, until 1934. However, it was quite within the then Minister's power and it is within this Minister's power to qualify those people.  The figures in this respect are very small but these people have lost the benefit of 10 years, not due to the present Minister but to his predecessor.</P>
      <P>I must give credit to the Minister who introduced these special allowances which have helped and are helping many needy Old I.R.A. men, but I wonder does the Minister really understand what a person has to do to qualify for a special allowance.  To qualify for a special allowance an Old I.R.A. man holding a medal, bar or certificate, let him be one of the best this country ever produced, must prove that he is destitute; he must get a medical certificate to show that he is incapable of doing any work for at least twelve months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  While I praise the introduction of the special allowance, there are so many strings attached to it that it is degrading for an Old I.R.A. man to have to apply for it.  These special allowances have relieved a great deal of hardship.  I have heard Deputies say here that there were no Old I.R.A. men in bad circumstances, that none of them was in county homes.  Someone made the mistake of using the phrase &ldquo;poor house&rdquo;.  We have no poor houses; we have the same houses but we call them county homes and we have quite a few Old I.R.A. men in these places.  Not so long ago a 1916 man died in St. Kevin's in very poor circumstances.  I believe that this special allowance was brought in to help such people.</P>
      <P>I am making this case on behalf of the people who made it possible for each and every one of us to sit in this House.  The Minister should accept this motion because even though the necessity for the operation of the Army Service Pensions Act is diminishing there are still people drawing benefit under it.  Most of the surviving Old I.R.A. men are now well over 70 and even the Fianna would be over 60. Taking the law of averages I believe in ten years' time the cost to the State in respect of these people will be very small.</P>
      <P>I tabled this motion as a non-Party one and I was gratified to see that in the main it has been treated as such. I gathered from the Minister for Defence that he did not want this motion pressed to a division.  Why he should take this line I cannot understand. When a motion is put before the House it is generally to test the feeling of the House on a particular matter.  This can only be done effectively by a vote.  Almost everyone who has spoken has supported the motion to some degree.  Some cavilled at the wording be offered no amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I receive from the Minister an assurance that he proposes to accept the terms of this motion in full or in a form acceptable to these people on <Col N="1213" /> whose behalf I have spoken, I am prepared to withdraw it.  Failing that, I propose to put the question to the House and have the result recorded in the Official Report.  Thus the members of Dáil Éireann will indicate by their votes whether they have been giving lip service to these people or not. <Col N="1214" /> Those who do not take part in the Division 1 will safely leave to the sound judgment of the electorate who will be called upon in the near future to pass judgment on their activities over the last few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in view of the insecurity of employment at the Arigna mines and the failure of private enterprise to fully develop them and so provide a stable industry, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that steps should be taken by the Government for the fullest utilisation of the resources of these mines under the auspices of Bord na Móna or of a separate semi-State body.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The motion is self-explanatory and is one that should meet with the approval of the majority of the members of this House.  There is not the slightest doubt that there are tremendous resources in the Arigna area in coal deposits and other minerals.  The tragic fact is that since we achieved political freedom in 26 of our counties no effort whatever has been made to develop these natural resources and thereby give first-class employment and provide further fuel requirements from home resources.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that in recent weeks the Minister who is responsible for fuel has announced that investigations are being made at the moment into the possibility of using the large deposits of what is known as crow coal in the Arigna area.  However late that development, it is one that we all welcome.  It is regrettable that we have had to wait 40 years before an attempt on these lines was made.</P>
      <P>This same Minister, who made a pronouncement in the last two days in this connection, sought to suggest to the public that great efforts were being made in the country generally with regard to the utilisation of native fuel with particular reference to coal deposits, that the output had increased in a number of mines and that the number of people employed had increased.</P>

    <P>It is only fair that we should have the views of an expert on that statement of the Minister for Transport and Power.  I should like to quote statements made by Mr. Murrough O'Brien, Director of the Geological <Col N="1216" /> Survey of Ireland, a man who is an expert in that field, who knows his job, who is qualified to talk on it accurately and who has no political axe to grind.  In 1958, in the course of an interview with the editor of the magazine <i>Development</i>, he was asked for his views on mineral deposits in Ireland in general.  One of the questions he was asked was in connection with the increase of the output from our mines in comparison with the increase that has taken place in other countries similarly placed.  The other countries mentioned in the question&mdash; I hope the House notes this &mdash; are Portugal, Morocco, South Korea and the territories formerly known as Indo-China.  Those countries, according to Mr. O'Brien, are the only four in the world with more anthracite than soft coal.  They are in the same position as Ireland in that regard.  He says these countries are finding ways and means of using their coal in industry.</P>
    <P>For example, in South Korea coal output has jumped at the rate of 20 per cent. per annum.  Taking the four countries together, the annual average increase of coal output was estimated at 12 per cent.  That may not be a big increase to people like the Minister, who thinks of jet planes and such things, but we must remember that those countries can be genuinely described as poor and under-developed, lacking the knowhow and experience.</P>
    <P>He was asked how that increase in the four countries compared with the increase in production here.  This is the expert talking: &ldquo;Not so favourably for us.  Our output is going up at barely half those rates and has returned to figures not greatly in excess of our early 19th century production.&rdquo; That is the opinion of a man who is in charge of the Geological Office.  There is no doubt whatever that as a nation we have not faced up to the problem involved in applying new techniques to the development and expansion of the coal industry.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Brien said in the same interview that Ireland's mineral resources were, in the middle of the last century, worked very fully according to the <Col N="1217" /> means available at that time but that, for all practical purposes, since the introduction of new techniques in other countries we have made little or no effort to take advantage of them in order to increase output from our coal mines.  The Minister may say he does not agree with the remarks of that individual but if he has other figures or information which contradict the view of that expert I think he should put them before the House.</P>
    <P>We have blamed our next door neighbour, a nation known as our ancient enemy, for many of the ills that beset us over the years.  How can we blame them for the negligence that we have shown in the development of our native industry, particularly our coal mining industry, since native Government was established here.  The undeveloped area to which I referred in this motion extends into three counties &mdash; Sligo, Leitrim and north Roscommon&mdash;and I suppose the fact that it does extend into three counties has led to the position where it was not the responsibility of any Government, where it was nobody's baby.  However, let us hope that a new day has dawned for that area.  In case any member of the House does not believe there has been considerable neglect of the area over the years, I want to put on record the written evidence over the past ten years with regard to the Arigna area and the position there since 1950.</P>
    <P>I cannot go back much further unless I refer briefly to 1948 when I was elected to the House for the first time.  In that year, Deputy Mrs. Reynolds asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he was aware that a great amount of uneasiness existed in Sligo, Leitrim and north Roscommon because of the closing down of many coal mines and the reduction of the number of people employed in a number of others.  The then Minister, Deputy Morrissey, said the problem of the disposal of coal output in the areas was under examination by the Department and at that time their officials were undertaking a local investigation.  That answer was given again in 1949 and in 1950 and has been repeated each year for the past 12 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> On March 9th, 1950, I asked a question of the Minister for industry and Commerce on the same lines and Deputy Morrissey replied that he had received representations on behalf of some of the owners in the Arigna area to the effect that they were finding it difficult to dispose of their output. Again in 1950 there was another question, this time by Deputy Hickey from Cork, in which he asked a number of questions about the coal mining industry in Slieveardagh, Arigna and Castlecomer.  The reply of the Minister was that the mines were in private ownership and that he could not do anything about it.  The situation got so bad that I asked a question at the end of 1950 as to the possibility of setting up a generating station in Arigna to appropriate the coal output and Deputy Cosgrave replied that the Electricity Supply Board had considered the matter.  That was away back in 1950.</P>
    <P>In 1951 there were more queries, followed by still more queries in 1952. In 1952 the Minister was back again on the position in Arigna; he stated that the purchase and sale of Arigna coal was a commercial matter best dealt with by direct contact with the interests involved.  He disclaimed responsibility for finding a market; he disclaimed any responsibility for ensuring security of employment for the workers there.  He stated it was a matter for the companies concerned to get a market, if they could; he was under no responsibility, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, for ensuring that a market was got.</P>
    <P>In 1953 the Minister was questioned once more on the question of coal generally by Deputy O.J. Flanagan. The Minister replied that the marketing of the output of the producers &ldquo;is not one of my functions.&rdquo;  He said that, in the belief that a solution for this marketing problem could be found by the combined efforts of the producers and distributors, meetings between them had been arranged through the instrumentality of his Department: &ldquo;I am satisfied,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that only in this way can a satisfactory solution be found.&rdquo;  That was in 1953, and we are still awaiting the <Col N="1219" /> solution of the problem of the development of the Arigna Mines and the sale of the coal from those mines.</P>
    <P>Again, in December, 1953, Deputy Gilbride asked the Minister a question with regard to employment in the Arigna Colliery.  The Minister pointed out that, in recent years, the Sugar Company had been buying Arigna coal and he understood they were prepared to continue purchasing Arigna coal provided the price, etc., was suitable. He went on to say that, if it was a fact that some of the Arigna workings coal could not be produced for sale at an economic price, it was for the interests concerned to consider what reorganisation or other changes might be required to rectify the situation. These people were sent from Billy to Jack with regard to the sale of their coal and with regard to the necessary capital and everything else, to finance their development.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House with too many quotations but I should like to refer to one question in 1954 when Deputy J. Lynch was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister.  I asked him in 1954 what steps he was going to take to ensure that the welfare of the workers would be safeguarded. He told me the Minister was making every effort to encourage State-sponsored companies to use the coal but, at the same time, he could not advance the interests of one mining company as against the other.  At that stage it was beginning to dawn on the Government that it was essential that they should accept responsibility for the sale of Arigna coal.</P>
    <P>On 3rd March last the question again arose here.  There was no market for the coal produced and a number of the miners were laid off.  The Government was asked to take some action to put the industry on its feet. I pointed out to the Minister on 3rd March that a number of colliery workers had been laid off and others were likely to be laid off; a number of men had left the locality and gone to England over the years because of lack of employment.  The Minister gave what was, in my opinion, a completely <Col N="1220" /> inaccurate reply.  There were three points: first, preference was given by State and semi-State bodies to the purchase of coal from Arigna; secondly, there was no drop in employment; and, thirdly, most of the coal produced in Arigna was absorbed in the power station.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first point, a number of State and so-called semi-State bodies had undoubtedly taken a certain percentage of Arigna coal, but these companies had to be kept under pressure before they would live up to their responsibilities in this regard. In 1958 one company &mdash; some may not regard it as a State or semi-State sponsored body, but I believe it is &mdash; ceased to take Arigna coal.  I refer to Cement Limited.  In December, 1958, one of the suppliers of coal to Cement Limited received a communication from that company announcing that as from 1st January no more Arigna coal would be needed. That was a bombshell.</P>
    <P>As a result of that communication a number of men were laid off as from 1st January.  The reason Cement Limited no longer required Arigna coal in 1958 was that the National Coal Board in Britain had decided to make coal available at a reduced price.  As a result of that decision an Irish Company decided to close down a mine in Arigna; they were going to take subsidised British coal.  That should not be allowed in any civilised community.  First of all, the notice was insufficient.  Permitting subsidised British coal to throw Irish miners out of employment is something no Government should tolerate and the Government at the time should have taken steps to ensure Irish workers were protected and that this industry, which was just getting on its feet, was protected to such an extent as would keep them in business.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody here will suggest that the E.S.B. is not a State-sponsored company.  In 1958 the E.S.B. refused to take coal from a number of producers in Arigna.  Again, the significant feature was that that was the time when the National Coal Board made the glad announcement <Col N="1221" /> of a substantial reduction in the price of coal.  The E.S.B., a State company, took advantage of this to the detriment of a native industry.  A number of us, at that stage, met responsible officials of the Department and emphasised to them the necessity of urging that the E.S.B. be directed to continue taking supplies from Arigna.  The E.S.B. very nicely agreed that they were prepared to take supplies of a certain amount of Arigna coal if the price was right.</P>
    <P>One of the figures quoted was £4 6s. a ton delivered to Ringsend. When one realises that the price of coal delivered into the station near Arigna itself was in the region of £3 14s. a ton, that left only 16/- a ton more for the coal to be delivered at Ringsend.  It was an impossibility at that price for any producer in Arigna to supply the requirements of the E.S.B. and, as a result, the E.S.B. can say that they were prepared to take the coal.  The Sugar Company, the E.S.B. and Cement Limited have ensured that they will cash in on the cheap, subsidised British coal and to hell with the producer in Arigna, as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1960, after more pressure had been brought to bear, the private secretary of the present Minister sent a letter to the producers in the Arigna area in which he stated that the Minister was aware, from other inquiries which he had made, that at least one big undertaking in the country was willing to purchase native coal in quantity at prices related to import prices.  Imagine that announcement coming from this gentleman who pretends he has an interest in the Arigna mines.  When his private secretary was writing that letter, the Minister knew that the coal available at the pit-head in Britain was subsidised to the tune of 35/- a ton.  How could the producers in Arigna compete with such a product coming into the country?  It was an absolute impossibility.</P>
    <P>The position at that time was, and is at the moment, that coal produced in Wales was imported here to the Twenty-Six Counties and it was found a profitable business to re-export <Col N="1222" /> to the Six Counties.  People were making money re-exporting British coal to the Six Counties.  While all this was going on, the fathers of families, the breadwinners of the Arigna area, were leaving the country week after week to work in the British coal mines because the Government considered they were not in a position to compete against the subsidised product coming in from abroad.  So much for the preference the Minister said he was giving to Arigna coal.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that there was no increase in unemployment, that the figures of the unemployed at the labour exchange at Carrick-on-Shannon showed a drop. The very same week the local paper in the area published a statement pointing out that a large number of men had been put out of work and had left the locality to go to England. It would be very hard to find the names of those men in the labour exchange as being unemployed when they had left the country.</P>
    <P>It is no use trying to tell the people in the Arigna area that the figures for unemployment are less than they were 12 months ago.  It is tragic for the people in the area to have to leave it but it is nothing less than criminal for the Minister to come into this House and suggest that there is no change in the situation and that there is less unemployment. You might say it is true that there are fewer unemployed registered but that is so because they have been running out of the locality for months past to work in England.</P>
    <P>The third point made by the Minister was that much of the coal produced in the Arigna area was absorbed by the power station.  The figure, so far as the power station is concerned, is that it consumes 45,000 tons a year. It is beyond dispute that any company in the area, and there are at least eight producers there, could produce 45,000 tons a year, but there is no market for their production.  If the power station consumes 45,000 tons a year, it is extraordinary to find that, out of those eight companies, one company alone has the monopoly of supplying 35,000 tons a year.</P>
    <P>I want to remind Deputies that in <Col N="1223" /> 1954 the Minister said to me that it was not his intention to help one coal producer more than another.  He went on to assure me that there would be no such thing as preference or favouritism. Yet, we have the situation in the Arigna area that one company is supplying 35,000 tons out of a total of 45,000 tons a year to the generating station.  The E.S.B., in giving that contract to this company, never asked for a public tender, never even inquired about competition but gave the contract to this company.  Furthermore &mdash; and I should like the Minister to check the accuracy of this &mdash; I am informed that this company secured the right to supply 35,000 tons to the generating station for the next 25 years.  I sought to establish the accuracy of that through a Parliamentary Question but I was ruled out of order: the question was one for the administration of the E.S.B. and consequently could not be the subject of a Dáil question.  However, it is the belief in that locality that such is the position.</P>
    <P>That raises a very important issue in this House.  If one company can get a firm supply into the generating station of 35,000 tons a year for a number of years while there is no market available for the other seven producers is it not logical to assume that it is only a matter of time until those other producers go out of business?  If they are blocked as far as the E.S.B., the Sugar Company and Cement Ltd., are concerned, it is only a matter of time until they go out of business.</P>
    <P>What will happen then?  Shall we not reach the extraordinary situation that one company will have a complete monopoly of the coal mining industry in the Arigna area?  I wonder was it ever intended by this House that the State would set up a generating station owned by the public, run at public expense, and that one private company would still have a monopoly of supplying a State concern.  That is what it will come to if the present situation is allowed to develop.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell me if it is lawful for the E.S.B. to take a supply of coal without asking for a public <Col N="1224" /> tender?  If there are eight people in a locality prepared to supply a county council institution, those eight people must be given a chance through two advertisements in the newspapers asking for tenders and for competition.  It is mandatory that all suppliers be given an opportunity of quoting their price and it is up to the institution or the local authority concerned to decide who will get the right of supplying the commodity.</P>
    <P>The E.S.B. are making no effort in Arigna to ensure that there is competition for supply.  It seems that these agreements are made privately.  One of the arguments put forward is that this company is the biggest producer; they have been sending coal to Dublin and elsewhere over the years and on that basis the E.S.B. consider they can make a firm contract with them.  I do not care what private companies do. That is their business, but when the State is involved through a State company like the E.S.B. this House has a duty to the public to ensure that there is fair play for the community as a whole and that there is fair play for all the producers in the Arigna area.  I shall not go any further at this stage because I might say too much, as far as the Minister is concerned. I want to keep this debate on a proper level and I do not want to have to suggest that there is an ulterior motive behind the apparent favouritism to one producer in the Arigna area.</P>

      <P>To sum up very briefly I would say to the Minister that Bord na Móna have done a tremendous job with regard to the development of bogs and with regard to the welfare of workers.  There is nothing illogical in suggesting at this stage that an industry like the coal industry which has been neglected for so long in the Arigna area should be handed over to a body like Bord na Móna.  With the experience and technical advice available to Bord na Móna and the first-class organisation they have for distribution, and so forth, they would be <Col N="1225" /> best able to put this industry on its feet, to give continuity of employment and ensure a supply of fuel from home sources.  It is on that basis I ask the House to accept the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be much opportunity for me at this stage to make a proper statement on the position of the Arigna coal mines. The only thing, I think, I should do at the present moment is to rebut the suggestion that no progress is being made whatever in the development of our native coal resources in recent years.  The total production of coal from all resources was 120,000 tons in the pre-war period, and in 1959 it reached 201,000 tons.  During all that period it had to compete under the Anglo-Irish Agreement with duty free coal.</P>
      <P>The level of Arigna production pre-war was running at 20,000 to 30,000 tons and in 1959 the production had reached 64,000 tons.  In the case of the anthracite mines the corresponding figures were 100,000 tons and 140,000 tons.  Several new mines have commenced operations in the last 20 years, including some in the anthracite area, and a new company has been formed recently to mine Arigna coal.  Evidently the people who formed the company have hopes of being able to dispose of the production in spite of the difficulties through which the industry is passing at the moment.  That indicates that we have made progress.  One might argue that we could have made more, but it does show a very significant increase in the production of our native coal &mdash; again, as I have said, during a period when.  we have been subjected for a considerable time to intense competition from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> I should make it clear at this point that under the Anglo-Irish Agreement it is impossible for the Government to impose a tariff on coal coming from Great Britain.  It is one of the key factors of the Agreement and the maintenance of the arrangement relates to other privileges we have in the English market which are absolutely vital to our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>How can they compete with subsidised coal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just made the point that these are facts that no Government are able to override unless they mind to alter the fundamental terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The Agreement was recently amended; that provision remains in it and is considered one of the key points from the British point of view, just as we regard the export to Great Britain of our cattle as one of the most important elements of our side of the Agreement.</P>
