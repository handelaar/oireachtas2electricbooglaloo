      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has received a copy of a resolution passed recently at a meeting of the Mallow Urban Council on the alarming number of unemployed persons in Mallow town; and, if so, what action he intends to take on this matter.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I have received a copy of the resolution referred to in Question No. 2, which relates to industrial grants for Mallow.  As the House is aware, the Industrial Grants Act, 1959, enables An Foras Tionscal to make substantial grants in aid of industrial development in areas to which the Undeveloped Areas Acts, 1952 and 1957, do not apply.</P>
      <P>Full consideration will be given by An Foras Tionscal to any application for assistance, in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Grants Act, that may be made in respect of any industrial enterprise proposed to be established in the Mallow area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> As the Deputies are no doubt aware, there is in the Mallow district a good deal of seasonal employment in agriculture and in the Beet Factory.  Unemployment in the district is normally at its peak in January when agricultural employment is at a minimum and the beet campaign has finished.  During January of this year, the weekly Live Register totals at Mallow Branch Employment Office have been from 35 to 155 lower than at the corresponding dates last year.  The Branch Employment Office records indicate that from the beginning of February there is a progressive decline in the Live Register as more work becomes available on farms.  So far this year a similar reduction has been shown, the Live Register total on 13th instant being 58 lower than on 30th January.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach why he declined to receive a deputation consisting of all members of the Dáil and Seanad from the Shannon valley area for the purpose of discussing ways and means of relieving flooding in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement that I declined to receive the deputation referred to in the Deputy's question is inaccurate.  Since the Office immediately concerned with the problem of flooding in the Shannon valley is the Office of Public Works, I arranged that the deputation would be received by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, to whom the duties relating to the administration of the Office are assigned.  Deputy K.P. Egan, who had conveyed the request to me, was notified accordingly, and the deputation was received by the Parliamentary Secretary on the 10th instant.  A very full discussion of the matter took place, and I have no reason to doubt that the members of the deputation, generally, were satisfied with the arrangements made for their reception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Taoiseach was requested to <Col N="381" /> receive the deputation so that he himself might be made personally familiar with the hardships suffered by people in the Shannon Valley?  Does he not agree that he showed a complete lack of regard for the farming community, especially for those in the Shannon Valley area, by suggesting that it was sufficient for the purpose that they be received by a Parliamentary Secretary who is not a member of the Cabinet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of the members of the deputation were quite happy to have the opportunity of discussing the problems associated with Shannon flooding with the Department of the Government directly responsible for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is in a position to state the outcome of the recent trade talks with the British Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether during his recent discussions in London he proposed to the British Government that Irish agricultural products should be linked to British guaranteed prices with the condition that goods at present imported by this country from the Continent would instead be purchased from Britain; and, if so, if he will make a full statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting with British Ministers which took place in London on the 12th instant did not conclude the discussions on trade matters between the two Governments.  As was stated in the communiqué issued after the meeting, the discussions were brought <Col N="382" /> a stage further on that occasion, and it was arranged that, having regard to the trade possibilities indicated by the discussions, the joint committee of officials should meet later this month to formulate detailed proposals, related to the Trade Agreements between the two countries, for consideration by Ministers.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I am not prepared to state the nature of the proposals made by us to the British Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say what were the proposals which were rejected by the British Government and to which he referred at the Press Conference subsequent to the meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is desirable that I should, at this stage, disclose any proposals that we made during the course of the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating that, can the Taoiseach say what specific items are to be considered by the officials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be at liberty to say that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the discussions be resumed by the officials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that it is desirable that the people should know what is our policy in respect of trade <i>vis-á-vis</i> Great Britain would the Taoiseach consider taking the public into his confidence by indicating what proposals exactly were made to the British Government, what proposals were rejected by them and for what reasons, so that at least they will have an informed view of what our trade position is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that the discussions with the British Government on trade matters are not yet concluded and I do not think it is in our interest that I should, at this stage, publicise proposals which were discussed during the course of these talks.  At some stage the House should get, and I shall be prepared to see they do have, an opportunity for a full debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="383" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the necessity for prudence in discussions of this kind but it is a bit bewildering to the public to be told by means of a statement which I think was issued by the Taoiseach himself that certain proposals submitted to the British Government were unacceptable and then to leave the members of the public asking themselves what were these proposals which were unacceptable.  If at this stage they were told nothing we could understand and would wait till the end of the discussions but to be told that certain proposals were unacceptable and then to be told: &ldquo;you cannot know what was unacceptable&rdquo; is bewildering to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say when he considers the discussions may conclude?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While it would be difficult to say when the immediate talks may end, the Deputy will appreciate that in any case the term &ldquo;conclude&rdquo; is rather inapplicable in that connection.  Matters affecting trade between the two countries are continuously the subject of discussion and this committee of officials which was set up last July is intended to be a permanent medium for the exchange of views.  I should think, however, that we should, at some date next month, have completed the consideration of specific proposals which are now being discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it expected that these proposals will result in a modification of existing agreements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I contemplate that an agreement supplementary to the existing agreement may emerge from these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether for the purpose of obtaining a favourable link in relation to agricultural prices, our Government were prepared to suggest to the British Government that the policy of protection of industries here would be altered so that British industrialists would have a chance of coming into our market?  Was that one of the <Col N="384" /> points of discussion between our Government and the British representatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said I do not think it is in this country's interest that I should at this stage disclose proposals that were discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach talks of discussions reaching a certain stage next month, does he mean he visualises that next month he will be in a position to make a full disclosure of the position to the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very likely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say whether the British Government have also decided to release for publication the proposals which were the subject of discussion and which were turned down; and if they have not and if they subsequently announce the conditions which prove unacceptable to them, would the Taoiseach still feel bound to retain that information in confidence and not give it to our own people?  Supposing the British people are given this information next week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a hypothetical question.  The Deputy will appreciate that the discussions are still taking place; what benefits if any we may hope to get for this country as a result of them are still not determined. It would clearly be undesirable that I should, at this stage, minimise any prospects that may exist in that regard, however remote they may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said certain things had been turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says the discussions will continue.  Are they continuing about the questions that have been turned down?  Does the Taoiseach hope that certain amended proposals will be accepted by the British?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain specific proposals which were discussed at Ministerial level last week, are now <Col N="385" /> being examined in greater detail by the committee of officials.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Brady</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will state for the most recent twelve months for which figures are available the total cost of implementing the sections of the Health Act, 1953, which make provision for the supply of medicines to holders of general medical service cards, including overheads, administrative expenses, and salaries and wages paid to personnel but excluding salaries paid to medical officers; and if he will state the number of general medical cards in force during the same period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the information sought relates to the cost of medicines supplied as part of the general medical services provided under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
      <P>The expenditure on medicines and medical and surgical appliances provided at dispensaries in respect of the year ended 31st March, 1959, as shown in accounts furnished by local authorities to my Department, was £276,400, and the number of general medical service cards in force as at the last day of each quarter during the year 1958/59 averaged 274,824.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be possible without very extensive and costly enquiries to <Col N="391" /> obtain particulars of expenditure on medicines as distinct from medical and surgical appliances.  Expenditure on appliances, dressings, etc. is included in the same category as medicines in the local accounts and to obtain a figure for medicines only it would be necessary to ask each local authority to examine in detail the accounts for each dispensary.</P>
    <P>The ascertainment of the amount of overhead and administration costs would be even more difficult and would involve considerable arbitrary apportionments of costs common to groups of services.  Overhead costs would include rent, upkeep of dispensaries, heating, lighting and caretakers' services.  The element of these costs which would be appropriate merely to the provision of medicines rather than the provision of the doctors' services would be a matter of conjecture in each case.  Administrative expenses in relation to the provision of medicines would include salaries of office workers dealing with ordering of supplies, payment of accounts, etc. and also the associated printing, stationery, telephone, etc. costs.  Without special detailed enquiry into the accounts of each local authority, these expenses could not be estimated.  The salaries of the officers dispensing the medicines would be clearly ascertainable where pharmacists are employed; but in small dispensaries the handling of the medicines is part of the work of the doctors.</P>

    <P> (1)  This service is a continuing one while a child remains at school.  Consequently, a child who is not examined or treated in a particular year may have been examined or treated in the preceding year and may be again examined and, if necessary, treated in a succeeding year.  The figures in the table should be read in the light of this.</P>
    <P>(2)  Treatment figures include some children referred from child welfare clinics.  There are approximately 60,000 children attending such clinics but the bulk of these are infants who would not normally be referred for dental services.</P>
    <P>(3)  Most of the whole-time dentists provide services for the lower income group in addition. </P>

      <P>The total amounts paid under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts to the leader of the largest Opposition Party and of the second largest Opposition Party are £19,459 and £8,318 respectively.  The information sought at (2) and (3) of the question is to be found in the Finance Accounts published in respect of each of the financial years 1938-39 to 1958-59, inclusive.  For the current financial year to 31st January, 1960, £860 has been paid to the leader of the largest Opposition Party in the form of £579 to Deputy Mulcahy and £281 to Deputy Dillon; £538 was paid to Deputy Norton, the leader of the second largest Opposition Party.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say that these amounts are made available under a statute passed here in order to enable the Leaders of Parties in Opposition to provide clerical and secretarial assistance so that the work of the Opposition Parties may be carried on?  Is the Minister aware that representations have been made in this House to the Government and sympathetically received, I thought, that, in order that the work of this House may be carried on in a more satisfactory and effective way, these allowances ought to be increased so that there would be some kind of suitable or semi-adequate secretarial machinery available to carry on the Opposition side of the work here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that these payments were made under statute to enable Leaders of the Opposition Parties to equip themselves to carry out their duties here properly, that is, for clerical assistance, and so on.  It is also true that representations were made to me by the principal Opposition Party that the amount is inadequate. That is under consideration.</P>

      <P>The Lee catchment area has been investigated for the purposes of a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, but further study, including examination of the results of a flood relief scheme being undertaken by the Tralee Urban District Council, is necessary before the matter can be brought to a conclusion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals for intermediate river drainage are intended to cover independent catchment areas which were considered too small or not of sufficient importance to be included in the main programme for drainage work under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  Preliminary inspections in four areas have been commenced: Kilcoole, Co. Wicklow; Ouvane, Co. Cork; Duff, Counties Leitrim and Sligo; and Glen, Co. Donegal.</P>

      <P>As the reply is rather long and contains a number of figures and lists I propose with the permission of <Col N="402" /> the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to circulate the desired information in the official Report.</P>
      <P>The total number of scholarships awarded in respect of the academic year 1959/60 is 40, of which 7 were awarded to American lecturers, 3 to American students, 2 to Irish lecturers and 28 to Irish students including 1 specialist grant and 13 &ldquo;Travel Only&rdquo; grants, the recipients of which had made their own arrangements for study and maintenance in the U.S.A.</P>
      <P>The scholarships awarded to American lecturers and students cover American History, Anthropology, Chemistry, Comparative Philology, Drama, Economics, History, Literature, Theoretical Mathematics.  The particular fields of study of the Irish recipients of scholarships and grants are American Studies, Economics and Management, Medicine, Pure and Applied Science and Theatre Arts.</P>
      <P>The American lecturers and students have been availing themselves of the scholarships awarded to them at the University Colleges of Cork, Dublin and Galway, and at Trinity College, Dublin.  The Irish recipient of the specialist grant has attended courses at a number of different centres.  The Irish lecturers and students have gone to the Catholic University of Washington, Columbia, University, Fordham University, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Michigan State University, Stanford University, Syracuse University, Wharton School of Finance, Philadelphia, and Yale University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the year 1959/60 has not yet ended it is not possible to give at this stage the total expenditure in respect of the awards made by An Bord Scoláireachtaí Cómalairte in respect of the academic year 1959/60.  It is estimated, however, to amount to approximately £27,000.  It should be mentioned at the same time that, as I informed the Deputy in reply to a previous question on the 11th June last, the awards of An Bord do not normally cover maintenance and tuition fees in the U.S.A. of Irish recipients, such costs being borne by the American Universities in which the holders are placed.  In the case of the American <Col N="403" /> lecturers and students who come to this country, on the other hand, the awards made by An Bord cover, not only fares, but also maintenance and tuition fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether any steps can be taken by way of freight subsidy or otherwise to reduce the cost of homegrown barley to the farmers of North Monaghan, whose costs of production are seriously increased by the obligation to use barley derived from sources as far away from them as County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the arrangements made for the marketing of home-grown barley of the 1959 crop I am satisfied that the millers and compounders catering for the feeders in North Monaghan made every effort to secure their requirements of feeding barley from the nearest and cheapest source.  As evidence of this there is the fact that the prices of pig foods in North Monaghan are in line with the prices for similar feeding stuffs throughout the country.  In the circumstances it is not proposed to introduce special facilities for that area as suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister received representation from these areas that the burden of extra costs in respect of foodstuffs for pigs constitutes a difficulty for small producers in these areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, quite a usual thing for the Minister to receive representations in all kinds of matters, but whether I have received representations in this case or not I cannot say.  I have to be guided by the facts as I see them.  The facts as I see them in regard to Monaghan are these.  The wholesale price delivered of pig meals of different kinds is, in fact, more favourable than in many other parts of the country and as favourable as the best.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the cost of straight barley meal in that area is relatively high?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Not according to my information. The figures are as follows. Barley meal, Monaghan, £26 10s. delivered wholesale; Dublin, £26 ex-mill; Cork, £26 ex-mill; Waterford, £26 ex-mill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree it is remarkable that flake barley meal is selling at the same price in Cork, where it is grown, as it is selling in North Monaghan whither it has to be drawn from Cork in many cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be inclined to agree with that entirely.  There are very keen business people in the Northern part of the country.  They have not to go South for all their requirements. As a result of the scheme designed for the disposal of the barley crop last year, I believe they were enabled to put themselves in a position to compete on more favourable terms. I am delighted these people have shown they are capable of doing so.</P>

      <P>Following approaches from the Ballinode Guild of Muintir na Tíre and Monaghan County Council the site of the proposed airstrip in Monaghan Parish has been inspected by Technical Officers of my Department.  The interests concerned with this development have been informed of the results of the inspection and of the works which they would have to carry out to meet safety requirements before a licence for regular operations could be granted. I understand that the Minister for Local Government has sanctioned expenditure by the Local Authority for the purposes of an engineering survey of the site.</P>
      <P>The project relates to a private airstrip and my statutory functions are confined to the licensing provisions under the Air Navigation Regulations. I am concerned, nevertheless, to encourage enterprise for the carriage by air of perishable and speciality produce and the promoters can be assured of such technical assistance as my Department is in a position to give.</P>

      <P>While appreciating the Minister's desire to give all the technical assistance possible, does there not come a time when the local people ought to be told whether this project is to go forward or not?  The present position is that the parish council and other local persons are concerned to see this realised and are organising groups to use the facilities.  Is there not some stage at which they ought to be told by the Minister for Transport and Power, as the co-ordinating authority of Government action in matters of this kind, what the prospects are of the strip in fact being used?</P>

An engineering survey is now being carried out by the local authority but I have not had the report from the local authority.

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 30, 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>No duty or levy is payable on imports of unrefined sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> The acreage of beet which can be contracted for is governed by the requirements of the home market for sugar.  These requirements are known and the existing factories are capable of meeting them.  Exports of sugar and sugar goods can be facilitated only on the basis of imports of raw sugar for refining.</P>
    <P>Yields of beet per acre have been increasing and consequently the total acreage required has declined.  Applications for contracts from regular and satisfactory growers exceed the acreage required and rationing is therefore necessary.  This rationing is, I understand, arranged in accordance with an agreement approved by the growers' elected representatives.  I do not propose to interfere in the matter which is one of day-to-day administration by the Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate how serious this has been for small farmers, particularly when the acreage has been reduced so much?  Have the Sugar Company any alternative proposals in order to allow these people to get a return such as they have been getting over a period of ten or 20 years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it seems the more these small farmers produce, the less hope there is of getting an extended beet contract next year or even maintaining what they have? Greater production has put them into this position then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the total applications this year to the Sugar Company from regular and satisfactory growers amount to 96,000 acres which would supply the sugar at present being got by the importation of cane sugar?  All that is required is an extension of the factories. In view of the requests to the agricultural community to increase production, does the Minister not consider it ridiculous that we should import £2,000,000 worth of cane sugar a year?</P>

A certain amount of sugar is used by manufacturers of sugar products for the export markets.  If these manufacturers based their manufacturing costs on Irish sugar, they would not be able to export to these markets.  Therefore, there is no suggestion that an increased acreage of beet to produce sugar at present prices would ensure that that increased amount of sugar could be taken up in this country.</P>

      <P>The issue and the time and manner of issue of these forms are matters for the registration officer, who is the person responsible under the Electoral Act, 1923, for the compilation of the register of electors.  It is not the normal practice to issue these forms with rates demand notes in June each year.  I understand that this procedure is peculiar to County Kerry because of the unusual method by which the Kerry County Council collects the rates.  It would be open to the registration officer for County Kerry, with the concurrence of the county council, to submit a proposal for the separate issue of registration forms in September.  If such a proposal were to be made, I would be prepared to support an application to the Minister for Finance for sanction to any excess expenditure involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the procedure which it is proposed to adopt here will involve the inclusion, for the purpose of calculating the unladen weight, of a receptacle or container.  Representations have been <Col N="420" /> made, I think, to Deputies on all sides, on behalf of furniture removers and people engaged in business of that sort who have to use special equipment&mdash; containers or slide-in equipment on vans.  They will be liable to have this equipment weighed, although it is a normal and necessary requirement that they should have these attachments and in fact it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to carry furniture or other household commodities which the furniture remover in the course of his business carries from time to time, unless this equipment is provided.</P>
      <P>This section, as I understand it, involves the owner of a lorry or truck in weighing the attachment which is part of the necessary equipment of that lorry or truck.  So far as I can gather, in Britain these attachments are not included in the unladen weight. When the Financial Resolution was before the House in December the Minister stated that he would consider the question of the furniture removers who had problems peculiar to their business and I would be glad to know what is their position now under the Bill.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the containers, lift-vans and so forth, all these attachments must be weighed.  On that occasion I referred to horse-boxes. Generally, horse-boxes are part of the basic structure of the lorries but in certain cases horse-box attachments can be fitted and detached as the occasion requires.  If a particular lorry is so fitted out that it can be used as a horse-box on one occasion and then with the box part detached, used as an ordinary lorry, is the owner obliged to weigh that attachment as part of the unladen weight?  Undoubtedly, it would be quite impossible to use it as a horse-box unless the particular attachment was used.  The same is true of furniture vans.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister what the position is under the present proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's general queries on behalf of those for whom a case for special concessions was made &mdash; notably, the furniture removers&mdash;their vehicles are not excluded <Col N="421" /> from the provisions of this measure.  In other words, they will pay tax on containers such as those about which the Deputy has been talking.</P>
      <P>In regard to that aspect of the matter might I refer to what I said on the Second Reading of the Bill about going some little way to meet some of the cases that have been made and about which we already had certain approaches and representations?  While I still say that attachments such as those about which the Deputy has talked as necessary to carry a load are included within the terms of the tax laid down in this Bill, I already indicated on the Second Reading of the Bill that I was looking into this question of containers and similar additions used for only part of the year, as distinct from occasional use during the entire course of the year. What I have in mind is the extension to regulations made in 1958 enabling refunds of duty to be given in certain cases.  Subject to specified conditions, a refund may be made where the licence is surrendered and the vehicle is exported, stolen or broken up or the owner, because of illness, can no longer use the vehicle.</P>
      <P>These regulations would now be extended to a case where the owner of a vehicle satisfies a licencing authority that his vehicle will not be used with the container etc., for the remainder of the year.  The refund would relate to the amount of tax attributable to the container for the remainder of the licensing period.  As the owner would have paid the higher rate only from the period when he started to use the container the net effect would be that duty would be payable in respect of the container only for part of the year. While details of the regulations have not been finally settled I should say they will probably be subject to the same limitations which affect the existing provisions for refunds; in other words, they will generally be tied in with them.  That is not quite an answer to the Deputy's case but I have made the distinction and that is as far as it is possible to go in an effort to meet any unusual types of cases under this head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where containers of any kind are <Col N="422" /> used only for a part of the tax year, a refund under the various conditions can and will be made available where it is found to the satisfaction of the licensing authority that such is the case. However, in so far as the occasional use of any container fixed for the purpose of carrying goods on any vehicle is concerned, it is not possible to bring in any regulations which would, while exempting such people, not create a situation of negativing the whole idea in the Bill before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this question I wish to bring to the attention of the House.  I may be wrong but I do not think I am.  A man buys a lorry with a carrying capacity of 5 tons and he pays the tax appropriate to that carrying capacity.  It then transpires that the quality of the merchandise he has to carry is such that containers are required to hold the merchandise on the lorry and he puts on a container which weighs 10 cwt.  He thereby reduces the carrying capacity of his lorry for merchandise from 5 tons to four and a half tons.  Is that not so?  But the net result of paragraph (iv), subsection (2) of Section 2 is that the lorry which is now carrying less than its capacity load of merchandise has to be taxed at a higher rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Road Transport Act he gets 7 cwt., that is to say, his licence to operate as a licensed haulier is extended by 7 cwt. but he <Col N="424" /> does not get that for the purpose of tax.  He still has to pay extra tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in laden weight means you pay extra tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If I have a 5-ton lorry, I get that weighed with all its normal attachments to it and I can now carry five tons of merchandise, but the merchandise is such that I must put a receptacle on to keep the merchandise on the lorry.  It is now provided that if I put on that receptacle to keep my merchandise on the lorry, I am liable to be taxed at a higher rate because I carry a receptacle on my lorry.  Therefore, as a result of reducing the carrying capacity of my lorry, by virtue of the quality of merchandise I have to carry, I am actually making myself liable for a higher rate of tax.  I do not think that is fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is simply designed to keep the merchandise from falling off the truck.  It seems to me that they would have paid enough for that by paying the tax for the lorry in full and by reducing the carrying capacity of the lorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary lorryman's problem is to get traffic for his lorry, not tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is Deputy Norton's view, I can see his approach to this matter but I think a great many people in this country are being placed in the unfair position that they have to pay tax for putting a receptacle on the taxable part of the lorry, at the same time reducing the carrying capacity of the lorry.  I do not think that that can be defended on any of the grounds put forward by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the suggestion about making special plans for furniture removers and other people who have trucks with containers on them, I should like to point out that furniture and other containers were probably taxable before this Finance Bill came into this House at all.  That fact cannot be lessened by virtue of the practice that had grown up where <Col N="425" /> such containers on these trucks were not taxed in recent years.  If we were to exclude such containers as those on furniture vans or other vehicles there are many other types of containers that would have to be excluded also.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Dillon's suggestion about the effect of this particular section I think that, theoretically, his summing up would be a fair exemplification of what is contained in the section but it does not follow that what he has said is quite so.  The addition of a container, say one of ten cwts. as the Deputy suggests, has the effect of reducing the carrying capacity of a lorry by half a ton.  He suggests that if the carrying capacity is five tons it is reduced to four and a half tons.</P>
      <P>A five ton truck, as we all know, usually carries from seven to ten tons. These containers are put on to enable the truck to carry more of the particular line of goods that the man is accustomed to carry and not to carry less.  Basically these trucks and all such vehicles are taxed on their unladen weight and if the unladen weight is increased, logically the amount of tax must be increased.  If the owner adds half a ton to the unladen weight then the tax goes up accordingly.  But those who put containers on their trucks do not find themselves with additional tax and less carrying capacity.  They put on the containers to carry more of the goods in which they trade and it is quite obvious that those who put on those containers know pretty well the load of goods they can carry and they put them on only because they are an economic proposition from their point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to the meaning of paragraph (b) of subsection (4) of Section 2 which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything so placed is excepted from the foregoing paragraph if in relation to no journey are goods or burden of any other description <Col N="426" /> both loaded into and unloaded from it without its being removed from the vehicle.</P>
    <P>Does that exempt the kind of carrier which is in use for the transport of carcase meat or fowl?  I mean the kind of thing that is brought into a factory, filled with a load of carcase meat and fowl and driven to its destination where the load is taken off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exempted.  In reply to Deputy Norton's question, the small truck would be one of three to six cwts. with the creels added which is the common practice in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that. We have the small truck, the medium truck and the large truck.  I take it that these will be the two or three ton truck, the five to seven ton truck and the ten ton truck which would include creels for the carrying of turf, cattle or sheep.  The small truck would be from three to six cwts.  The next one would be the more common one of from five to seven tons which would carry creels weighing about an additional ten cwts. so that they could be used for the transport of turf or cattle.</P>

There are two separate and distinct issues but this Bill applies to everybody who operates a lorry for the carriage of his own goods.  Leave out the licensed haulier altogether.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the Deputy's view but there are people in the country who are not licensed hauliers but who operate lorries for the prosecution of their legitimate business.  They are being covered here. As the Minister told us, between them and the licensed hauliers, they are to pay £100,000 per annum more tax. That is what the Minister expects to clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want is an equitable arrangement.  It appears to me that the net result of this Bill is that those who operate lorries in this country in all categories in the course of trade will pay £100,000 more per annum than they are paying at present. That is a formidable burden to put upon them bearing in mind that, in the last analysis, the people who must pay for this are the consumers or else the farmers who are producing for export.  The transport costs will certainly be passed on to somebody. They do not stop dead at the man who operates the lorry.  It is either the consumer or the producer who has to carry that cost in the last analysis. They are carrying enough already without a further imposition.</P>

      <P>There is one point that requires clarification.  In subsection (1) (c) (ii), there is an obligation on a lorry driver in certain circumstances to carry a member of the Garda Síochána to the weighbridge in the vehicle.  Who insures the member of the Garda Síochána on that journey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have legislation pending which will look after insurance cover by the State for State employees in the execution of their various duties such as this might fall into.  It is intended that the matter raised by the Deputy will be one case that will be covered by this legislation which we hope to introduce in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for his information.  On the assumption that this Bill is passed and becomes an Act of this House, this obligation immediately devolves on lorry drivers.  I can appreciate that in some subsequent legislation the Minister might protect a member of the Garda Síochána by providing that if he is injured in the course of duty, he is entitled to appropriate compensation. However, can we set aside his right to sue a lorry owner on whose lorry he was travelling if he is in a position to allege gross negligence <Col N="430" /> against the lorry driver?  If it is proposed in some future legislation to say that the member of the Garda Síochána will have the right to have his compensation measured by a jury and awarded to him against the lorry owner, leaving the lorry owner the right against the Exchequer to cover, then I think this thing is adequately covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not quite sure when replying to Deputy Dillon's first point.  There is a provision in the present Road Traffic Act, 1933, requiring a Garda to be carried in such circumstances.  There is no breach of the compulsory insurance law arising as from that obligation under the 1933 Road Traffic Act. Passengers need not be covered in such cases.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of any compensation that might be payable, the State would in such an instance as that quoted by the Deputy undoubtedly cover the costs of any such compensation that may or should arise from any accident or injury to a member of the Garda Síochána while performing a duty such as outlined in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to raise logic-chopping problems for the Minister because it is not possible always to be prepared for every question but I think he ought to look into this.  You may have an insurance policy which protects you if it is comprehensive against all consequences of an accident, including third party liability. But it also contains a proviso that you are not to violate any of the provisions in the policy, and one of the provisos may be that if a lorry is covered you are not to carry passengers.  Does a statutory obligation of this kind, which conflicts with that condition, preserve the validity of the policy, its terms notwithstanding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand myself how the owner of the lorry can rest content with the statement of the Minister for Local Government in Dáil Éireann that the Government doubtless would make itself liable for any damages awarded against him.  He is entitled to a more specific statement than that&mdash;<Col N="431" /> (1) what is the actual liability of the lorry owner to the member of the Garda Síochána and, (2) whether, if there is a condition in his comprehensive policy of insurance that he shall not carry a passenger, is a subsequent statutory duty to carry a member of the Garda Síochána, which is enforced by a member, something which would render his comprehensive policy invalid?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to that, the statutory obligation does overrule any such clause that might be inserted in the terms of insurance, and the insurance companies in this country, in consultation with our people, have agreed that that is so.  Therefore, in view of that agreement, that cannot really arise.</P>

      <P>Suppose, as Deputy Dillon said, the insurance policy prevented the owner from carrying passengers, whether paying or otherwise, and then, for the purposes of this Bill, suppose he takes on a Guard and takes him to the weighbridge. Suppose he meets with an accident, either through the fault of the driver of the lorry or the fault of another lorry driver who runs into the lorry conveying the Guard. Has the Guard a right of action against the lorry driver of the lorry on which he is travelling even though the policy says the driver should not carry any passengers, or has he a right of action against the driver of the other lorry which ran into the lorry carrying the Guard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We may congratulate ourselves that no member of the Garda Síochána was injured in accidents heretofore.  However, speaking for myself, more than 50 years have passed and I have not yet been knocked down by a motor car and I trust I shall not be knocked down tonight. In respect of the Minister, more than 40 years have passed and he has not been knocked down but we should not accept that consoling doctrine and leave a manifest flaw in legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not press the Minister but it might be well to omit paragraph (ii) until the remedial legislation he has in mind is being enacted.  Possibly this obligation may be reduced in the remedial legislation.  I think it is a hardship to legislate here and put a statutory duty on a lorry owner or any section of the community to do something which leaves him liable to a very heavy damages burden in certain eventualities on no better grounds than that it has not happened heretofore. The Deputy is familiar, I think, with the history of a certain railway company which plied in Donegal.  They came to the conclusion that they had been paying workmen's compensation, insurance for a generation and never had an accident.  Solemnly, by decision of the board, they refused to renew their workmen's compensation, and within three months they had about seven accidents, which remained a burden upon them for the remainder of the lives of the persons who had suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, I think, is the whole theory of insurance: you may have your premium for twenty years without ever having a claim, but that is in anticipation of the average experience that if you have no claim for twenty years you may get five claims in one year. On this simple proposition the whole principle of insurance is built.  I think we are cheerfully proceeding to ignore that fundamental principle in enacting paragraph (ii) without the remedial legislation which the Minister envisages. I suggest a much more appropriate procedure would be to drop paragraph (ii) and bring it back into <Col N="434" /> the remedial legislation if and when that is ready for enactment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the Guard feels that this person is driving a lorry overweight and takes it to the weighbridge? The lorry owner has a policy of insurance which prevents him from carrying passengers.  In fact, he does not carry passengers when he uses the lorry.  In this case, however, a Guard comes on the lorry.  They meet with an accident.  The Guard decides to go to the owner of the lorry for compensation. The case comes before the court.  The court makes an award in favour of the Guard.  The insurance company say: &ldquo;We are not paying because our policy of insurance prohibits you from carrying a passenger. That means that you should drive the lorry yourself, that nobody else should be there with you.  We are not paying.&rdquo;  The lorry owner is then faced with paying £2,000 compensation. He cannot pay it.  What happens the Guard then?  Does the State step in and say &ldquo;We will honour that and pay&rdquo; or will the Guard have to initiate a separate action against the State in order to get paid?  Could I get clear on that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall put a point to the Minister in order to get some clarification of it.  A Guard meets a lorry on the road, which he reasonably suspects of being overweight, and he directs the driver of the lorry to go to the nearest weighbridge, where ever it is, and directs him also to carry him, the Guard, to that weighbridge. On the journey, from the point where he stopped the lorry to the weighbridge, the lorry is involved <Col N="435" /> in an accident.  Is that lorry at that point of time under the control of the Guard or is it still under the control of the owner of the vehicle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy elaborate a little further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall travel the whole distance with the Minister. What I am interested in is this: if the effect of the statutory duty that is imposed by Section 3 means that the vehicle is under the control of the Guard when it is being driven to the weighbridge, then, in respect of any cyclist, shall we say, on the road who is knocked down, the cyclist's claim would be, not against the owner of the vehicle but against the Guard who is carrying out his duty and, therefore, against the State.  I do not think in this case it would be against the State.  I think the person concerned has just the same rights against the owner of the vehicle as if the Guard had not given any statutory direction under Section 3.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton will remember as well as I do the Pearson case between Naas and Kilcullen, in which an Army vehicle was involved.  In that case the Guards asked a man who was ploughing in a field to come out and take his horses for the purpose of disentangling two vehicles and pulling one of them out of the ditch. While that person was doing the job the Guards had asked him to do, as a good citizen, he was mown down&mdash; that is the only word you can use&mdash; by an Army vehicle that was being driven on an unauthorised journey. The result was that that man, who had very, very serious injuries, had no claim against anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to ensure that the same thing cannot happen in this case, where a person is carrying out a statutory duty that is put on him.  The case that I had in mind is something like this.  The person who normally drives a lorry takes out a lorry without the connivance and without the instruction of the owner of the lorry. He is an unauthorised driver.  When he is such an unauthorised driver, the owner is not covered by any insurance <Col N="436" /> and there is no insurance policy to indemnify the cyclist whom that man knocks down on the road.  That man is going along the road in a lorry and a Guard meets him and orders him to go to the weighbridge.  He is not covered by insurance.  The Minister says, and I think he is right, that though he is carrying out the State's instructions, he is probably not covered by the State and, therefore, if he does any damage in the course of the journey that he is bound to do, under this section, whether he is insured or not, the effect of it is that anybody who is injured has no redress.</P>
    <P>The effect of this section as it is drawn is that if a Guard finds a person driving a vehicle which he suspects is overweight, it does not matter whether that person has a driving licence, it does not matter whether that person is covered by insurance or not, that person must bring the lorry to the weighbridge.  It is bad enough that he was operating before that time without proper insurance cover but this section extends it and there must be some protection to ensure that we do not have a repetition of the case to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the first point was, in the event of the driver being legitimately driving the truck at a particular time and being stopped by a Guard who orders him to proceed to the weighbridge, which may not be distant more than five miles away, and carry the Guard with him, as to whether it was the State that was then in control of the truck or the driver. The answer there is: &ldquo;the driver&rdquo;. In the case that the Deputy further outlines of the uninsured vehicle being on the road, having been stolen, picked up, taken unauthorised, or otherwise, obviously if that vehicle was uninsured from the time the driver had taken it out and uninsured when the Guard had stopped it, it would continue to be uninsured after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is, is it not wrong to make the driver go a further distance when it is uninsured?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. As anybody knows who has been stopped by a Guard, if you bring his gaze upon you, it is common practice <Col N="437" /> that you are put through the hook on all the various items that should be properly attended to, which might include asking for your insurance, your driving licence, and this, that, and the other thing.  It might well be that before the Guard got around to the stage of directing the driver to take him to the nearest weighbridge, he would have discovered that the driver in question was not an authorised driver and in that case that he was not insured, and that he had no driver's licence, no tax certificate, or anything.  In that event I doubt if the Guard would proceed with the question of weighing the truck when he could throw the book at the driver in these other respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says it might well be that the Guard will find out these things.  It might well be that the Guard would not find out these things.  The Minister is well aware that a driver has three days in which to produce the certificate of insurance.  It depends whether you take that as inclusive or exclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of driver we are visualising, such as in the Thomastown-Kilcullen case, is not the sort of person who will say straight out to the Guard: &ldquo;I am not insured.  I have no licence.&rdquo;  He will chance his arm and say: &ldquo;I will produce my insurance certificate in three days,&rdquo; or he will produce a certificate of insurance which shows that he is covered if he is driving on authorised business and will lie to prove that he is on authorised business so that no Guard using the utmost discretion and the most searching enquiry could find out the facts without a check back with the owner of the vehicle to see whether the person was driving the vehicle within the authorised provisions of the certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the point the Deputy is making but what does he suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will have to be a liability upon the State, with a right of indemnity over against the person who was driving, rightly or wrongly, at the particular time.  If <Col N="438" /> the State steps in and, in the public good, directs that a person should do a particular job, the primary liability must be on the State to compensate anybody who is hurt by that job, the State, of course, having the right of reimbursement from the wrongdoer who has caused the trouble.  That is the natural sequence of it and I think there will be very grave difficulties otherwise.  It would be all right if a Guard could ascertain on the spot but he cannot ascertain on the spot.  It should be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point referred to by Deputy Sweetman is something which is generally unusual and that there is only about one chance in the thousand that such a case would turn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had lost two legs, as happened in the case I am thinking of, he would feel sore about it no matter how unusual it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is only one chance in a thousand.  Where I think there would be a case under Section 3 is where a Garda proceeds to enforce the Act and requires the vehicle-owner to go to a weighbridge to have the vehicle weighed and if there is an accident in the course of the journey. I think it is very unfair to impose any liability on the truck-owner in that connection.  I wonder if the Minister could provide for this point in the Bill or even if it could be done through the Garda regulations?  Could it be provided that the Garda, because he is travelling on a truck in the course of his duty, would be exempt from liability on the truck owner?  Certainly, the liability is on the State as the Garda is in the course of carrying out his duties.  Also, you will have truck-owners who will not have passenger insurance cover.  Quite a large number of trucks do not carry passengers and one can see the notice on the windscreen: &ldquo;No passengers.&rdquo; That is a case which would certainly impose a very grave responsibility on truck owners.  If an accident did <Col N="439" /> happen and a Garda was injured in the accident it would be most unfair to expect the truck-owner to accept that liability and if there is any doubt about that I think some arrangement should be made here to define where the liability lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that in Section 3 the Minister is facing great difficulties with these legal points raised on this side of the House but, looking further into Section 3, I cannot see why it is necessary to have the first half of that section included.  In the second half of the section it is possible for the authorities to have the lorry weighed at any time if they give seven days' notice.  Why must you include this portion where a Garda can hold up a lorry and ask the driver to go to a weighbridge at short notice?</P>
      <P>I have listened to all the arguments on this side of the House and to the Minister's reply and there really is not a satisfactory answer.  It boils down to this: if you give the Garda authority to hold up the lorry and the lorry is only covered by third-party insurance and an accident happens, it means that, as the law stands at the moment, the lorry-owner has the liability.  The Minister has told us that.  He has told us that for the last 27 years the law stands as it is going to be effected in this Bill.  What is the point, therefore, in introducing the first half of the section to enable a Garda to do things that he apparently can do already?  It seems we are giving him almost mandatory power now to do them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The Deputy has completely misunderstood this. What I have said is that there is a provision in the Road Traffic Act of 1933 which parallels the provision here of a Garda being carried on a truck to a weighbridge.  There is a parallel standing for 27 years in the Road Traffic Act.  I am merely pointing out that while that is so, none of the things envisaged under this provision has happened for 27 years under the similar provision in the Road Traffic Act.  The Road Traffic Act <Col N="440" /> provision does not deal with this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say that a Garda has already the right under a previous Act to hold up a vehicle of some sort, even though it is not a lorry, and take it for some specific purpose either to the barracks or to a weighbridge?  Have the Garda those powers already or have they not &mdash;that is what I am not clear on?  The other query I want to make is why is it necessary to have the first half of the section?  Why is it necessary to introduce into legislation the provision whereby a Garda can hold up a fully-laden lorry and take it five miles to the nearest weighbridge&mdash;it says without undue inconvenience&mdash;when the second half of the section enables the licensing authority to have the lorry weighed, and the container along with it, any time they wish by giving seven days' notice?  Why is it necessary to bring the Garda into it at all and cause all this confusion which is even more confounded because nobody really knows who is standing over the insurance?  Would the Minister consider deleting the first part of the section and relying on the second part which will give him everything he is looking for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could, I think it would be useful to me as well as to the House.  If we could keep separate references to insurance, and references to the unladen weight, there might be less confusion, but the reason for what the Deputy describes as the first half of Section 3 is that the tax is based on the highest overall weight used on any occasion.  I think the Deputy will agree that the best check on such weight is an on-the-spot check while the vehicle is in use and might be suspected by the Garda of carrying a container or additions that put it over the weight for which it was originally taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first instance, the Garda must suspect that is so.  It does not mean that he pulls in the driver just because he does not like the colour of the truck or the colour of the driver's hair.  It is laid down that he must &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; that the vehicle is in fact operating at <Col N="441" /> a higher unladen weight than that for which it is taxed.  That being so, there is no parallel whatever in saying that the second part only of the section is quite adequate.  It is not quite adequate. If an owner is given seven days' notice after having been observed with what appeared to be a greater unladen weight than that for which the vehicle is taxed, it is quite likely that the additions would be removed inside the seven days and that when the truck turned up to be weighed it would be under the unladen weight that was actually used on the day in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is a simpler way of dealing with this matter.  I am trying to stress the grave inconvenience that will be caused if a lorry can be stopped at any moment, taken to the weighbridge and unloaded. The Minister is a rural Deputy as I am, and he should know the great inconvenience that would be caused in a case like that.  Surely there is an easier way of dealing with this matter than to introduce legislation such as this.  Any Guard looking for promotion is naturally going to pull up lorries and cause tremendous inconvenience. Would it not be better to leave it to the local authority to collect the money?  They have the full force of State authority behind them in the ordinary way and I cannot see the necessity for special legislation such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is not suggesting that Gardaí have so little to occupy them in rural areas that they will stand on the roadway and pull up trucks that may be passing without any regard as to why they are pulling them up, that they will have the time to proceed with these trucks anything up to 5 miles away, the time to unload whatever little may be on the truck, have the truck weighed and then have whatever was on it put back on again, and then be driven back 4 or 5 miles to the point at which he had first been lifted all because he wishes to be promoted, without there being in his mind a belief from the very outset that this truck owner was contravening the <Col N="442" /> law?  That is not very realistic and it is from my rural experience, if you like, that I say that.  The suggestion should not go out from this House that a loaded truck will be taken along, its entire load taken off and put on again.</P>

      <P>I am putting the case to the Minister that I consider this section unnecessary and the Minister has not justified it.  The only answer he has made to me is that it may be possible for a lorry owner to conceal the part.  This provision is such that it may cause grave inconvenience to every lorry driver in Ireland. His reply is that I am suggesting the Guards are going to waste time pulling up lorries.  If this Bill is passed it is mandatory on every Guard, if he suspects a lorry has not been properly weighed, to stop it.  Reference is made in this provision to &ldquo;undue inconvenience.&rdquo; The Minister might like to tell the House what &ldquo;undue inconvenience&rdquo; means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to quote this: Section 3 (1) says:</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a member of the Garda Síochána observes a vehicle on any occasion on a public road,</P>
      <P>(b)  the member suspects that the weight unladen of the vehicle is such that use of the vehicle constitutes an offence under section 2 of the Principal Act, and</P>
      <P>(c)  the vehicle either has no load or has a load which can be unloaded without undue inconvenience,</P>
      <P>The reason I am reading this is that the Minister's reply to me suggested the Guards would be there making a nuisance of themselves pulling up lorries with practically nothing in them.  This Section gives a Guard the right to stop a lorry fully laden and request the driver to unload it 5 miles away and re-load the lorry again. Perhaps the Minister would like to indicate how long it would take the lorry driver to unload and re-load the lorry.  If that is not undue inconvenience I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the instructions which will be issued to the Gardaí and to any of the officers <Col N="444" /> of the local authorities who will be concerned with these matters, it will specifically be pointed out to them that no stupid interpretation of the law such as we have now had at this stage could be perpetrated on the public.  When we are talking about a lorry that can, without undue inconvenience, be unloaded we will be indicating it will be a sack or two, and it will not be possible for those who want to evade the law if we did not have this part of the section included in the law, to say that because they had two sacks on the truck they were under undue inconvenience and therefore did not come within the law.  It is really to deal with this situation, without trying to make use of loose wording, that this wording was brought in. Specific instructions will go out to the Gardaí and to the officers of the local authority, lest they should misread the provisions of this section or part of the section, as the Deputy fears they will.  I have no such fears but the instructions will allay any fears the Deputy or any other Deputies may have and there will not be this idea of causing this nuisance suggested by the Deputy, that every lorry owner in the country would be pulled up for the mere fun of it, be brought five miles away, have the load taken off, the lorry weighed and reloaded.  That just could not happen and I would ask the Deputy to accept that will be the position in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the Minister's explanation. It is quite different from the original explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to sub-section (3) as regards additions to vehicles such as a body, a part, a fitting, or a receptacle.  The Minister did take some cognisance of the point I made on the Second Stage of the Bill in connection with the types of vehicles that were obliged to carry receptacles or fittings for certain casual or occasional work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not commit himself very much but he did at least accept that there might be a case for some of those vehicles in so far as it would be possible for them to <Col N="445" /> operate on a differential rate of tax. At the outset I thought that the section was to some extent meeting the position but I do not think he is going far enough.  It was suggested that an owner might tax a vehicle if it was not carrying the receptacle for the first quarter at the unladen weight of the vehicle and if he carried the receptacle for the second or third quarter, he would pay the appropriate rate of tax and then, if he was not using the receptacle for all the year for which he had paid the additional tax, he could make an application for a refund.  However, if a vehicle owner were to tax his vehicle in that way, it would cost him a greater amount of tax because it costs a few pounds more to tax a vehicle by the quarter than to tax it for the full year.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not making provision by way of amendment for these eventualities but if he considers that it can be dealt with without an alteration in the Bill I am happy.  I suggest that the remedy he proposes does not meet the case fully.  If a vehicle owner were using a container for one month, it would be reasonable to expect him to tax it for a quarter and, if he did not use it for nine months of the year, he should be entitled to disregard the receptacle and reweigh the vehicle without it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am in order in replying to the Deputy, I would like to say that we have gone further than he realises.  If, in the second or third quarter of the year, a particular container which was not necessary were being used on a truck and which was not used for the other nine months, then the additional tax in respect only of the quarter in respect of which the truck is used with the container would be chargeable.  The tax for the year would be taken from the owner but it would be rebated in accordance with the use of the container.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to put down an amendment to subsection 4. The Minister knows I have very strong views on it but I was rather puzzled by the drafting of the section. The receptacle is defined in subsection (2) of Section 2 as being one of <Col N="446" /> the additions to the vehicle.  Subsection (2) is the effective provision which carries through the principle of the Bill.  I cannot understand why, that being so, and the receptacle being defined in subsection (2) as being one of the additions, the receptacle itself is not also defined in subsection (4) instead of being generally defined as a sort of by-pass in the enforcement section. It seems to me to be an unusual drafting and I felt that perhaps there might be such a definition somewhere else in the Bill.  It is most unusual to have a definition in an enforcement section and not in the main carrying section of the Bill. The Minister will see that subsection 3 of Section 3 follows out subsection 2 of Section 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection 3 of Section 3 follows virtually entirely subsection 2 of Section 2 but subsection 4 of Section 3 does not at all follow subsection 4 of Section 2.  I cannot understand the drafting at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite agree that something is omitted from one section that is included in another but I do agree that it does appear strange that almost the same clauses and wording should be used in two separate sections where one would suffice.  The necessity for the repetition is in the drafting because some of the clauses used in Section 2 are unavoidable in Section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Under paragraph (b) of subsection 4 of Section 2, it says that anything so placed is excepted from the foregoing paragraph. That exception is not in the enforcement subsection 4.  Where are the definitions?  As I read subsection 4 of Section 3, it is the same as Section 2 subsection 4 (a) but I cannot find where subsection 4 (b) is covered in subsection 4 of Section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a reason for this repetition and possibly the reason is explained in the proviso in Section 2, subsection 4 (b) regarding receptacles since it is for the vehicle owner to prove that any such receptacle should <Col N="447" /> not be included in the unladen weight and, pending such proof, the owner should pay the weight of the vehicle and the receptacle for use on a particular occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I am to take it this way&mdash;that the Minister's explanation of the wording of subsection 4 of Section 3 is that anything on the lorry must be weighed and, notwithstanding the weight, it is deemed to be an exception and the owner can then come in and contest the weight by saying that it was not the true weight because there was on the lorry something to which subsection 4 (b) applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That generally I think is the position, namely, that it is for the owner to prove in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, surely there must be some method by which an agreed weight, there and then on the spot, for contested articles can be arrived at?  If the position is that the whole lorry is taken in and weighed and the owner says: &ldquo;I challenge that part of it,&rdquo; there should be some provision whereby, on demand, the member of the Garda Síochána who brings it in for weighing must weigh any particular article so that they will have an agreed weight for that and then they can argue it before the District Justice.  Otherwise, a great deal of unnecessary time and money will be spent in arguing.</P>

      <P>In page 12, before section 16, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>16.&mdash;(1)  In this section &ldquo;appointing local authority&rdquo; means, in relation to a health authority, a local authority appointing members of the health authority.</P>
      <P>(2)  On the establishment of a health authority established by this Act, the following property namely:</P>
      <P> (a)  all property, whether real or personal (including choses-in-action) which, immediately before the establishment, was vested in or belonged to or was held in trust for an appointing local authority and was property which was solely for the purposes of services to be transferred on the establishment to the health authority, and</P>
      <P>(b)  all other property, whether real or personal (including choses-in-action), which, immediately before the establishment, was vested in or belonged to or was held in trust for an appointing local authority and stood designated by that authority as property to be transferred to the health authority,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and all rights, powers and privileges relating to or connected with any <Col N="450" /> such property, shall, without any conveyance or assignment but subject where necessary to transfer in the books of any bank, corporation, or company, become and be vested in or the property of or held in trust for (as the case may require) the health authority for all the estate, term, or interest for which the same immediately before the establishment was vested in or belonged to or was held in trust for the appointing local authority, but subject to all trusts and equities affecting the same and then subsisting and capable of being performed.</P>
    <P>(3)  All property transferred by subsection (2) of this section to a health authority established by this Act which, immediately before the establishment, was standing in the books of any bank or was registered in the books of any bank, corporation, or company in the name of an appointing local authority shall, upon the request of the health authority made at any time after the establishment, be transferred in such books by such bank, corporation or company into the name of the health authority.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every chose-in-action transferred by subsection (2) of this section to a health authority established by this Act may, after the establishment, be sued upon, recovered, or enforced by the health authority in their own name and it shall not be necessary for the health authority to give notice to the person bound by such chose-in-action of the transfer effected by that subsection.</P>
    <P>(5)  After the establishment of a health authority established by this Act, every bond, guarantee, or other security of a continuing character made or given by an appointing local authority to another person, or by any person to an appointing local authority, which was in force immediately before the establishment and which related solely to services to be transferred on the establishment to the health authority, and every contract or agreement in writing made between an appointing <Col N="451" /> local authority and another person which was not fully executed and completed before the establishment and which related solely to services to be transferred on the establishment to the health authority shall be construed and have effect as if the name of the health authority were substituted therein for the name of the appointing local authority, and such security, contract or agreement shall be enforceable by or against the health authority accordingly.</P>
    <P>(6)  After the establishment of a health authority established by this Act, every rule and regulation lawfully made by an appointing local authority which was in force immediately before the establishment and which related solely to services to be transferred on the establishment to the health authority shall, so far as it is not inconsistent with this Act, continue in force and have effect as a rule or regulation (as the case may be) made on the establishment by the health authority for the residue then unexpired of the period and in respect of the area for and in respect of which the same was actually made by the appointing local authority, and accordingly every such rule and regulation may be continued, varied or revoked, and penalties and forfeitures arising thereunder before or after the establishment may be recovered and enforced, by the health authority in the like manner and as fully as the same could have been continued, varied, revoked, recovered or enforced by the appointing local authority if this Act had not been passed.</P>
    <P>(7)  After the establishment of a health authority established by this Act, every resolution passed, order made, and notice served by an appointing local authority before the establishment the operation, effect or term of which had not ceased or expired before the establishment (being a resolution, order or notice relating solely to services to be transferred on the establishment to the health authority) shall, so far as it is not inconsistent with this Act, continue in force and have <Col N="452" /> effect as if it were a resolution passed, order made, or notice served by the health authority on the date on which the same was actually passed, made or served by the appointing local authority and as if the functions of the appointing local authority were, on the said date, performable by the health authority.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the transfer of property and, shall we say, the continuance of proceedings by those bodies which are to be dissolved under Section 15.  There appears to be, and in fact there is, a need to make the same provision in relation to bodies which are not to be dissolved as, for instance, Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council so as to provide that there would be a transfer of property from these bodies as well to the new health authority.</P>

      <P>They are really rather definition amendments in so far as they provide for a more specific definition of the officers and servants of the local authority appointing members of the health authority who will be transferred to the service of the latter authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16, as it stands, provides for the transfer of officers and servants engaged in the operation of services which, at its establishment, became transferred to the health authority. That has been found to be weak on two scores.  Firstly, some of the officers and servants&mdash;such as clerical officers and groundsmen, for instance, in a hospital&mdash;could not be regarded as being engaged in the operation of the services concerned.  Secondly, it makes no provision in relation to staff engaged part-time on the transfer of services and part-time on services which will remain with the appointing authority.  It is desired to make the section specific so that there will be a transfer of officers actually engaged in the services and of others who will be designated as the more appropriate to be transferred with the services on <Col N="454" /> which they have been engaged part-time or wholetime.  That is the purpose of the amendments 14, 15, 17, 18 and 19.  I suggest that if the House were to adopt those, we could come back to Deputy Corish's amendment No. 16, which relates to the point which most Deputies wish to raise.  It could also be raised on the section itself.</P>

It does seem to me that it is reasonable to expect that the personnel who have been working for these transferred bodies should be in the situation of not suffering in any way, either in salary, terms of employment, pensions or anything like that, because the State has decided that their employers shall be a different body in future from what it has been in the past.  I do not make the case at all that they should get any new rights but I do make the <Col N="458" /> case that their existing rights and privileges should not be in any way abridged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I also would like the Minister to give us his view of how Section 16, as amended, is likely to operate and the effect that it is likely to have on those officers who will be affected by it.  There is at the present moment a considerable amount of unease amongst these officers and anything the Minister can do here to clarify the situation from their point of view will be very welcome.</P>
      <P>The intention of the section is quite clear.  Once the Health Authority comes into being any officer in the service of the Dublin Corporation who is concerned at the moment with the operation of health services, indeed, concerned with officers who are concerned with the operation of the health services, will be, without any consultation, transferred to the new Authority.  This is a very important matter for such an officer as it will mean that the whole basis of his service and his career will be changed overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the House to consider for a moment the position of one of these officers.  As a young man leaving school he had a choice of careers open to him and for any one of a variety of reasons, through personal inclination or being attracted by the conditions of service, he chose to enter the Dublin Corporation and make his career in that service.  He sat for an open competitive examination and, being successful, took up his appointment with the Dublin Corporation, secure in the knowledge that this was his life's career.  If he was an ambitious young man, he probably went to the University and studied local government with particular reference to the unique history and development of Dublin Corporation. Now, after 10, 15 or maybe 20 years of service, he finds that he is to be transferred to an entirely new body and this transfer is to be carried out without reference to or consultation with him.  In other words, the assumption that he was entitled to <Col N="459" /> make when he went into the service of the Dublin Corporation is overnight to become invalid.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, there is an onus on this House and on the Minister to give a very great deal of consideration to the position of these officers.  The last occasion on which this sort of thing happened was when the electricity services which were operated by the Dublin Corporation were transferred in 1927 to the E.S.B. Any officer of the Corporation who had up till then been dealing with the electricity services was given the option of either remaining in the service of the Dublin Corporation or transferring to the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister that I am fully conscious of his difficulty in this matter.  I contemplated putting down an amendment which would do the same on this occasion as was done in 1927 when the electricity services were transferred, in other words, an amendment which would give to any officer an option either to remain in the Dublin Corporation or to transfer to the new Health Authority. I was prevented however from putting down such an amendment by the difficulty of the situation.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that you could not transfer all the services to the new body and leave in the Corporation all the officers who formerly had been dealing with those services.  The difficulty is to reconcile the requirements of the situation and the requirements of the new Health Authority with the onus which is on this House in matters of this sort to be fair to the individual officer concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not know what representations the Minister has received from the trade union which caters for these officers but I do know that they also are anxious about the situation.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the situation in particular which I should like to put to the Minister.  Dublin Corporation as a local authority has always been unique in that promotion in its service has always been from within its own ranks.  That has been the <Col N="460" /> position up to now.  It has given general satisfaction and has been responsible for a fairly high standard of morale in the Corporation service. Any post which became vacant in the service of the Dublin Corporation was not open under the Local Appointments Commission to the country at large.  The officers of the Dublin Corporation always maintained that posts open for promotion within the Corporation service should be confined to Corporation officials.  What will be the position of the officers of Dublin Corporation at present administering Health Services who transfer to the new Health Authority?</P>
    <P>If posts become vacant in the new Health Authority, will those posts be open to competition from the country as a whole or will they be confined to the officers of the Health Authority? If posts in the new Health Authority are thrown open for competition to officers throughout the country generally then a disservice will have been done to the Corporation officers who transfer because a right which they have at the moment will have been taken from them.  At the moment they have this right, as officers of Dublin Corporation; if that is not to be so in the future then there will be a definite loss of a privilege from their point of view and a definite worsening of their conditions of service.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made&mdash;I do not know whether it will commend itself to the Minister but I would like him to consider it&mdash;that for staff purposes, the new authority and the Dublin Corporation would be regarded as one unit and that officers of one body would be inter-transferable with officers of the other; in other words, if a post becomes vacant in the Dublin Corporation&mdash;it is very difficult to compete against these rival conversations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take it the other way.  As I was saying, the suggestion has been put forward that officers would be inter-transferable between the two bodies and that if a post became vacant in the health authority it would be open for competition to the officers of both&mdash;the Corporation and the health authority. I think that would be a reasonable suggestion and one which would go a long way to meet the grievance that an officer of the Corporation who is transferred to the new health authority might have.</P>
      <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that this is a very important matter.  It is essential that this new health authority should get off to a good start.  It will be involved in a great deal of complex administration. It will face a considerable number of problems particularly in its early stages and it is essential for the success of the whole concept that it should have a staff of officials who are satisfied with their conditions and have no reasonable grievances and whose morale and enthusiasm for their work will be high.  For that reason, I suggest that the Minister should go as far as he possibly can to try to ensure that the officers being transferred to the new authority will get every protection and every consideration, and, if he can at this stage, give any assurance or guarantee with regard to these officers when they transfer that would be very desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This section seems to me to cover practically the whole administration of the Bill and in the Explanatory Memorandum it says that the primary object of the Bill is to provide for more efficient and more economical administration. This section appears to deal with the arrangement that will be made for transferring officers from different existing departments into one unified section.  Primarily, it deals with the City of Dublin and the county and the other associated health bodies concerned in it, about which I do not know very much.  But I do know that if the object of the Bill is to be fulfilled, if it is to produce more efficiency <Col N="462" /> and economy, the natural inference is that it will do so by the centralisation of all these authorities into one single unit.</P>
      <P>If it is to achieve that object, obviously it will lead to the administration of those authorities with a lesser staff than heretofore.  That brings to light immediately the problem of those who are engaged in local authority work, those engaged in the Health Department and in Local Government as well.  That seems to suggest that, far from a simplification of the existing state of affairs, we are heading for a mass of intricacies and complications.  I might be quite wrong in that but, taking a detached view of the situation, that seems to be the obvious inference.</P>
      <P>It is easy to introduce a Bill and to say on paper that you are going to amalgamate five or six different groups; it is easy to say that you will run those groups from one centre and that you are going to save greatly and that everything will be conducted from a central office with less trouble and less expense that heretofore.  I think Deputy Haughey's speech was a most reasoned statement.  He was putting the case of a local authority he knows of.  They carry out certain functions and have certain staff employed and he is apprehensive that their position may be changed entirely.  Apart from Dublin, in Cork, Waterford, Limerick and in my own county, Wexford, and other rural parts where there is amalgamation, if there is to be a saving in health funds or even greater efficiency, one must conclude there will be redundant staff and therefore everybody must be apprehensive and must try to defend the rights of those employed by the State whether directly on Governmental level or whether employed by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable, therefore, that the Minister should make a full statement on this section giving us a general idea of the whole picture of administration under this new legislation.  If he can justify that picture, if he can show that there will be a reduction in <Col N="463" /> expenditure and that a reduction in personnel is required he must then show that under this section which deals directly with personnel, everybody who has been employed in Local Government or by the Health Department or the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;which comes into this also &mdash;or by the local authorities will be in the same position as they were before.  So far so good.  He should also state if the situation is likely to result in redundancy and I would like him, in that case, to assure the House that those concerned would be absorbed by some other Government service or that in the words of Deputy Corish's amendment they would be in no worse position than they were before.</P>
    <P>If I have spoken at some length it is because I want to get from the Minister a statement; the whole foundation of his argument is based on this section.  I am sure he will now give us a full and clear statement of where the economies will be and where the reduction of staff will come in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we must recognise this Section as a genuine attempt on the part of the Minister to safeguard the interests of officers who are transferred from a Board catering for a specific function in a local authority into an amalgamated authority. I think the Minister has set out to do that in a genuine way but I am wondering whether the situation is sufficiently watertight.</P>
      <P>Section 16 (1) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Upon the establishment of a health authority established by this Act, every officer (other than an Assistant County Manager or an Assistant City Manager) of each local authority appointing members of the Health Authority who, immediately before the establishment, was an officer engaged on the operation of services which, on the establishment, became transferred to the health authority, shall become an officer of the health authority and, for the purposes of any enactment relating to superannuation, his <Col N="464" /> office under the local authority shall be deemed not to have been abolished.</P>
    <P>I would direct the Minister's attention to the situation in Cork where you have three separate bodies, the Cork Sanatoria Board, the South Cork Board of Public Assistance and the Mental Hospital Board.  You will have officers of these authorities transferred to the main authority. Some of them are described as secretaries; some are described as accountants and some are described as chief clerks.  I recognise the Minister has made an effort in the section to protect them in so far as their rate of salary and superannuation are concerned but these people will carry with them descriptions of their offices into the new Authority and this Section does not make it clear what the effect of that will be.  For instance, there is a vacancy at the moment in the Board of Assistance for a secretary.  There is no secretary there.</P>
    <P>There is what might be described as the chief executive officer of the Cork Mental Hospital Board.  He is not described as a secretary; he is described as a chief clerk.  The Cork Sanatoria Board has a man who is chief executive officer and who has a post as secretary of the Board.  To pick out one of them, the secretary of the Sanatoria Board is being brought in under the section as an officer of the new health authority.  I appreciate the Minister is endeavouring to cover him as regards his salary and service with the Cork Sanatoria Board and for superannuation purposes.  What I want to stress is: what does the Minister visualise in relation to the description of his office?  He is described at the moment as secretary of the Sanatoria Board.  Will he be brought in and still described as Secretary of the new Authority or will he be described as secretary of a section of the new health authority?</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that a person who has attained a certain status with one Board or Committee of a health authority did so after many years of endeavour and after rightful recognition of his services and in the <Col N="465" /> ordinary course of promotion.  I am sure the Minister would wish to protect him, not alone as he has attempted to do under the Section, in regard to his salary, his service and his superannuation, but in regard to the description of his office.  This Section does not make that point quite clear and I should like to hear if the Minister has anything to say on that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot guarantee that every officer will be transferred with his existing title.  The only thing I can do is to try to ensure that his emoluments and his status are not worsened.  I cannot guarantee that he will be carried over as a secretary of this or that or as a chief officer. Coming down to brass tacks, does it matter very much what he is styled, if his right to superannuation and his emoluments are preserved?  Furthermore, I think a transferred officer's prospects of promotion may be enlarged. The matter of nomenclature is really trivial by comparison with the object of the Bill, and no Minister could possibly guarantee that when an existing body is being amalgamated with others the same title will be carried over.  It is not usual, even in business circles, that that should be done and it certainly could not be done in a local authority organisation which covers a multitude of activities.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I cannot give the Deputy any guarantee in that regard.  As the Deputy himself has already said I do not want to see any officer of an existing authority in any worse position than he is now and if he is entitled to opportunities and if he is fit to avail of larger opportunities of promotion I do not wish to deprive him of those in any way.  Beyond that I cannot go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the point made by Deputy Haughey, the answer is quite simple.  We have to carry on the health services.  We have to secure the unification of the staff.  We must allow for a greater degree of flexibility and interchange between the staffs of existing health authorities.  Therefore, we cannot agree that these services should be carried on in their present watertight compartments, because that is what it would mean.  If I were <Col N="466" /> to say promotion would be reserved in certain services to existing officers of Dublin Corporation or existing officers of the Dublin Board of Assistance, there would not be any use under such conditions in bringing in a Bill of this sort which is, in fact designed to bring about a situation in which the best of these people will become available for the administration of the health services. As well as that, if I were to accept the principle that people are going to preserve their existing positions in the administrative system of the Dublin Corporation or the Dublin Board of Assistance or of the South Cork Board of Assistance or the Cork Corporation I would have to say that a doctor who had been employed as a Medical Officer with the Dublin Corporation was in a position to stay there and hold the position in the Dublin Corporation and could not be transferred to a post which had been previously held by somebody in the Dublin County Council office.  I would have to do that also with nurses and with all the professional personnel of these services, and if I did that the whole purpose of the Bill would be defeated.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is, first of all, to enable all the people who are living in the communities in the cities and counties which are dealt with in the Bill to get the best of the services which are available in any one particular instance.  I think the whole community should get that.  That cannot be done unless you are prepared to have the whole personnel in the position that they may be directed to give their services in those offices for which they are best suited.  I do not think there is any real analogy between what is being done under this Bill and what was done in 1927.</P>
    <P>First of all, in 1927 people were being transferred from a local authority service such as the Dublin electricity supply undertaking to a national statutory undertaking.  They were being transferred to a new undertaking with a completely different code from that under which they had been working.  In the present case all the officers will still be under the Local Government code.  They will be entitled to whatever benefits are <Col N="467" /> reserved to them under the Local Government Acts of 1941 and 1955 and they will also be subject to all the obligations which those Acts impose on them.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1941 is very significant in that regard.  It does, by anticipation, cover the existing situation.  Section 5 of that Act as amended by Section 17 of the 1955 Act reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the appropriate Minister is satisfied that, on account of any alterations which have already occurred or are in contemplation, it is in the public interest that the holder of such office shall resign therefrom, then the appropriate Minister may require such holder to resign within a specified time, and if such holder fails to resign from such office, he may, by order, remove such holder from such office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There we have the existing situation. If the Minister is satisfied that it is appropriate that the holder of any office under the appointing authority should be required to resign because of changes which have already been made or are in contemplation, the Minister may call upon him to resign and may remove him from office.  We are, in fact, not treating the holders of offices in accordance with that section.  We are, in fact, ensuring that they will be transferred to a new authority with all the rights in regard to remuneration and superannuation already held by them.</P>
    <P>We must look at it from that point of view.  We are carrying through an operation which is designed for the benefit of the community as a whole. We are trying to do that without infringing the rights in any particular way of any particular individual.  I think that we must have regard, in a matter of this sort, to the larger interest of the community.  It may be that some individual will have to travel a few miles further to another office, but that is no great hardship in these days. It might happen that instead of dealing with citizens of Dublin City as an administrative area, he may have to deal with those of Dublin County but <Col N="468" /> that does not make any difference to him as long as he is capable of performing his functions with reasonable efficiency.  Then he is secure in his post and nobody can interfere with him.</P>
    <P>On the other question of trying to reserve opportunities for promotion to the servants of existing health authorities, and to the exclusion of all other servants of other health authorities who may become part of the unified body, I think we cannot do that.  We have to make up our minds that if we are to have unification it will not merely be unification in name; it must also mean that the staffs are to be unified and be treated on the principle that every man will have equal rights.  That will mean equal rights to ultimate promotion.</P>
    <P>I think that for any man of ambition or who has the necessary capacity, one of the results of unification will be that it will throw open greater opportunities to the men of talent and ability. Instead of being confined, as they are now, to the opportunities afforded to them by the existing smaller bodies, they will have a greater field for their activities, because the opportunities that will be open to them will be greater too.</P>
    <P>I think that, since the public interest demands it, this change should be made; and that as a result we are going to have greater opportunity for men of ability and talent who are prepared to work for promotion.  I do not think that we are justified in trying to reserve opportunities for promotion in that regard to people who are now in the service of any particular appointing authority.  It would be very short-sighted to do so, because one thing it would do would be to safeguard the existing status, rights and responsibilities of the mediocre individuals to the detriment of their more talented colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at once that I am fully conscious of the difficulties of the situation and that I support the Minister whole-heartedly in what he is trying to do to achieve uniformity with the consequent increased efficiency.  I just want to <Col N="469" /> clear up one or two little misapprehensions which have crept in.  I think the Minister does not quite understand my point.  I did not endeavour to suggest that when the new health authority comes into being promotion should be kept in water-tight compartments corresponding to the existing bodies which are being taken over.  There are two propositions. The first one is that the new health authority would be regarded, as the Minister says, as one organisation and that any promotion within that organisation would be from within its own ranks.</P>
      <P>In other words, if an appointment for, say, Secretary of the new organisation comes up, if a vacancy occurs for that position, it would be open only to persons already serving in its ranks.  Whether the staff came from the Dublin Corporation, the Dublin Board of Assistance, Grangegorman or any other body, in so far as the new health authority is concerned it would be regarded as self-contained.</P>
      <P>That suggestion would mean that any officer of the Dublin Corporation who would transfer to the new health authority would have the same position obtaining in the new health authority as already obtains in the service of the Dublin Corporation.  At the moment, if any vacancy occurs in the Dublin Corporation it is filled only from within the service of the Dublin Corporation itself.  I put it to the Minister for consideration that the same position should apply in the new health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another and a separate proposition which I put to the Minister is that the whole of the new health authority and the Dublin Corporation would be regarded as one unit for staff purposes. In other words, any member serving on the staff of the new health authority in Dublin could apply for any position which became vacant in the Dublin Corporation and any member of the staff of the Dublin Corporation would similarly be entitled to apply for a post becoming vacant in the new health authority.  That would give a good deal of flexibility and it might not be a bad thing administratively. <Col N="470" /> It would mean that an officer who has made the Dublin Corporation his career and is transferred to the new health authority would still have an opportunity, maybe at some time in the future, of transferring back to the service of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>We must reluctantly face up to the fact that there will be officers of the Dublin Corporation who do not want to leave the service of that body but who, because of the exigencies of the situation, may have to do so.  If you make the two bodies inter-transferable from the point of view of staff, such an officer at some future date may get back to his original service. I never meant to suggest that the officers of the existing authorities going into the new health authority would become self-contained units.  I do not think that would be practicable or feasible at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he could not see that any official would be hurt by leaving a smaller body and going into a greater one.  That may apply in the case of the other bodies which are being taken over but it does not apply to an officer of the Dublin Corporation who is transferred to the new health authority.  The Dublin Corporation is a greater organisation at the moment than the new health authority will be and, even when the present health services are taken from it, it will still be the greater body.  Therefore, an officer leaving the service of Dublin Corporation and going into the health authority, whatever about any other body, will undoubtedly be going from a greater to a lesser service.</P>
    <P>At present, any Dublin Corporation officer could become Dublin City Manager.  If he is transferred to the new health authority, as I see it, such an achievement on his part would be completely impossible.  The Minister also mentioned that, in the new health authority, there will be opportunities for men of capacity.  I should like to think that that is so and if it were so it would answer a lot of difficulties. Surely, the new health authority will take over from existing bodies a duplication of top echelon.  In other words, all these authorities have at the <Col N="471" /> moment chief executives.  If you take over four or five distinct authorities surely you must take over four or five sets of chief executives?  Therefore, at the top of the new health authority, there must be a surfeit of top managerial people.  I cannot see in those circumstances how the officers to be transferred will have more opportunities in the new service.</P>
    <P>I realise that the situation is very difficult.  It is very hard to see what the perfect solution is but I would like the Minister to think seriously about the suggestions I have put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that in any unification of services where you have an amalgamation of staffs you are bound to have certain difficulties.  I appreciate the difficulties of the Minister in this regard and I certainly do not want to make a difficult situation more difficult for him.  Deputy Haughey has pin-pointed a problem in relation to certain local authority officers and I trust the Minister will give further consideration to it.  I think I mentioned it to him elsewhere.</P>
      <P>You have a situation, as Deputy Haughey said, where people who entered the service of the local authority, be it a corporation or a county council, had local authority promotions at their feet provided they had the ability, energy and application to pursue these higher posts.  It is an injustice that a young man with perhaps one, two or three years' service with the local authority who happens on the appointed day to be attached to an office in the City Hall in Dublin or the City Hall in Cork, or county council offices elsewhere dealing with health services, must, with no option, be transferred to the service of the new health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that anybody who has undergone a competitive examination and was recruited to the service of a local authority on the understanding that he could pursue his work and his studies for promotion in various branches of that local authority has certain rights.  It is unjust to say to him: &ldquo;It happens to be the 29th February of this year&rdquo;&mdash;whatever the <Col N="472" /> operative date may be&mdash;&ldquo;and henceforth we are putting you into the new health authority&rdquo; where to my mind the opportunities for progress and promotion will be much less.  I do not know whether it would be feasible &mdash;I am not competent to judge&mdash;but the Minister should look at the suggestion that officers who find themselves in that position should be given the option of remaining with the authority which they joined and to which they were recruited after competitive examination or going on to the new health authority.  That suggestion may present difficulties that are not apparent to me.  I think it would be a just solution of the case. I would ask the Minister to have another look at it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister said regarding anomalies that may arise in recruiting people from different authorities into one major authority. It is quite true that three separate bodies may be amalgamated into one new health authority.  If three people come in from each of the separate authorities, each carrying the title of &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; or &ldquo;Accountant&rdquo; or some office of that description, you are bound to have an anomaly where the new health authority must appoint a Secretary and an Accountant.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister has come very far under this section at least to protect the salary scale, service and superannuation of all of them, no matter how they might be described, but I hope the Minister will approach the problem in this fashion&mdash;that where he can avoid these anomalies, he will do so.  If, for instance, one health authority amalgamates three former boards and only one person comes in holding the description of office of secretary and only one person comes in holding the description of office of accountant, the Minister will take the wise and prudent line-and perhaps the line of least resistance&mdash;of allowing that person to carry that description of his office into the new authority.</P>
    <P>I know there may be difficulties about that if you have two or three people endeavouring to carry their descriptions of office into the new authority.  While the Minister may <Col N="473" /> appreciate the anomalies that may arise, I hope he will be convinced in his own mind to take all possible steps to avoid them.  I do not wish to press the Minister unduly but if he wishes to comment on the situation, I should like to hear from him.  If not, I am prepared to wait until the Report Stage when he might give the matter further consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, any Minister, either I, my predecessor or my successor, whoever he may be, wants to bring changes of this sort about with the least possible inconvenience or hardship to any existing officer.  I should like to do that but I cannot guarantee that any officer will be transferred with all the conditions that he thinks are appropriate to himself.  That just cannot be done.  We shall try to be reasonable about it.  I hope the Deputy will take that as being my general approach to it.  If he thinks there is any little aspect of the matter that should be dealt with by legislation if he puts down an amendment to that effect for Report Stage I shall be prepared to consider it.  But I think the Deputy will find when he comes to consider all the implications of any text he may wish to embody in the Bill, that there has to be some degree of flexibility and that he will not be able to go very much further than I have gone in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the position in which officers have been placed under Section 17 of the 1955 Act.  That is the position of every officer of a local authority in relation to changes made or in contemplation. The position of the officers of the existing health authorities, which are being dealt with by the Bill, in relation to their duties, is as laid down in Section 10 of the Local Government Act of 1941, which says:</P>
      <P>Every officer appointed shall perform such duties as such local authority may from time to time assign to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in fact, when officers are being transferred to the service of a Health Authority by an appointing body&mdash;because that is what will be <Col N="474" /> done under this Bill&mdash;they are being transferred and assigned to their duties in accordance with Section 10 of the Act of 1941.</P>
    <P>Now in relation to the points that have been raised by Deputy Haughey. When he asks me to try to confine promotions and appointments to the new Dublin Health Authority I have to say that we are trying to do the reverse.  The whole purpose indeed of all local government legislation in relation to officers since the State came into existence has been to break down the water-tight compartments which exist between one local authority and another, whether that local authority happens to be the Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation or a County Council.</P>
    <P>One of the original objectives of the whole Sinn Féin policy was to try to create interchangeability as between officers of one local authority and another so that an officer of ability, whether he was recruited to, say, Leitrim County Council or Dublin Corporation, might aspire to the highest and most responsible position in the local government administration. If you look at the whole <i>corpus</i> of local government law you will I see running through it this idea of having the more responsible jobs thrown open to the competition of everybody.  We have it in relation to the Dublin City Manager and in relation to the vacancies which arise for county medical officers and others.  These positions are thrown open to public competition so that the citizens of the cities and counties will have the services of the best men available to them.</P>
    <P>We do not confine this question of public competition for appointments under the Local Appointments Commission even to the top posts.  Only the other day there came before me in the ordinary course the names of those people who had been recommended by the Local Appointments Commission for appointment as health inspectors in the City of Dublin.  Some of these people were not born in the City of Dublin and were not serving officers under Dublin Corporation.  They came from other places.  In the same way some people born in Dublin have <Col N="475" /> been appointed health inspectors under county councils somewhere down the country.  That is the sort of flexibility we are trying to achieve in our health services and in our local government services.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, it would not be possible.  It would be running against the tide.  It would be turning our backs on the objectives which have been pursued by every Government since the foundation of this State if we were to accept the principle that promotion under the new authority must be reserved to the persons who had the good fortune to be in the service of one or other of the appointing bodies.  We cannot have that.  I think we have got to make up our minds that it is contrary to the general trend of public opinion.  We have got to make it quite clear that the Dublin Health Authority will have to follow the good example of the County Council and try to get the best men wherever they are serving.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other point has been raised in the course of the discussion on this section, but if there is any other point where there is weakness in the section, and if any Deputy wishes to put down an amendment on the Report Stage to remedy it, I promise to consider the amendment. When I see its text and see precisely what the Deputy putting down the amendment has in mind, I shall try to meet his point of view.  But I want to make it quite clear that I shall not turn back the clock and revert to the situation which existed before 1918.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one question. The Minister has made his policy of flexibility quite clear.  May I ask the Minister if an officer of the new health authority will be able to apply for appointments which become vacant in Dublin Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If that means that these appointments are going to be filled through the Local Appointments Commission, he would; but, if it means that he is going to ask to be re-transferred from the service of the health authority&mdash;put it this way&mdash;if he has <Col N="476" /> been transferred from the service of the Dublin Corporation to the service of the health authority and then wishes to be re-transferred back&mdash;is that what the Deputy has in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  My point is that at the moment promotion in the Dublin Corporation is within its own ranks.  If that situation still applies then the flexibility which the Minister requires will not come about because an officer of the health authority will not be able to apply for a post becoming vacant in the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Here I am in this difficulty.  If the Dublin Corporation decide that an officer of theirs who has been transferred to the health authority will be entitled to be considered for promotion, which might arise on the local government side&mdash;it could not be on the health side&mdash;in relation to what would be described normally as a local government administrative or executive post then, of course, I would have to consider what my attitude would be in relation to that for this reason, that the transfer back of an officer from service of the Health Authority to the service of the Dublin Corporation might create some administrative difficulties for the Health Authority but I will think over that.  I cannot see it getting to the position that this sort of re-transfer would become automatic.  I think there would have to be at least the consent of the Ministers involved, and I am not so certain, having regard to the views which have been expressed to me by the representatives of the local government officials, that they would welcome that sort of exchange. However, I will consider the position and see what can be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter in connection with that which I should like to have explained by the Minister. At present there are a city health authority in Cork, a county health service, sanatoria committee, mental hospital committee, South Cork Board of Assistance.  There are five different secretaries.  They are in charge. None of those will get the job as secretary of the health service.  The <Col N="477" /> Minister has stated previously that those men would not be lowered in their positions.  They will be made lower in their positions if there is a secretary put over them by the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
      <P>There is a secretary of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance, a Secretary of the County Sanatoria Committee, a Secretary of the Mental Hospital Committee, a Secretary of Cork Health Services and a Secretary of the County Health Service.  That makes five.  Is the job to be confined to the five or will we get someone else from Donegal?</P>

I should like to give the Deputy the explanation he asks; but surely he does not expect me to carry in my head full particulars of the status, emoluments, duties and responsibilities of those five officers to whom he has referred.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  After all, I just do not carry the whole Organisation and personnel of the health services in my head, so I do not know.  What I do hope for is that by the effluxion of time all these problems which Deputy Corry has put to me will be solved.  We are already in a fair way to solving them in relation to the Chief Medical Officer for Cork City and County.  We shall do so in the near future in the case of the Dublin Authority.  There are a number of these posts which, as I say, are falling vacant and we just do not have to fill them.</P>
      <P>That is how we deal with some of them.  We do not have to deal with people who have not been appointed or promoted.  But, nobody will be dealt with harshly.  That is all I can say.  He will carry over to the unified authority his emoluments, his superannuation rights, his prospects of promotion&mdash;in fact these may be improved if he is in fact suitable for promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to his title, I do not think it matters.  I think that is a label which can be quite readily changed.  That is my position in relation to all the personnel who will be affected by the Bill.  All I can say is that I am hoping.  As I have said at the outset, <Col N="479" /> my predecessor would not have dealt harshly with them; my successor I am sure will not deal harshly with them and neither shall I.  That is all I can say.</P>

      <P>Would it not be easier for the senior officer to take over than to have this kind of thing?

In County Limerick where we have a city medical officer and a county medical officer, under this section when the Bill is passed which one of these medical officers will be regarded as the one to advise the new Health Authority, or will they have equal functions in the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 15, before section 20, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;20.&mdash;(1)  A sanitary authority may, if at any time they are not satisfied with&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  the assignment of duties in relation to any of their functions to an officer or a class of officers to whom this section applies, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the performance of duties assigned in relation to any of their functions to an officer or a class of officers to whom this section applies,</P>
      <P>request the Minister to issue a direction to the health authority concerned to provide for a satisfactory assignment or satisfactory performance (as may be appropriate) of such duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  After considering a request under subsection (1) of this section and any representations made in relation to the request by the health authority concerned, the Minister may issue such direction (if any) as he thinks fit to the health authority in relation to the <Col N="481" /> assignment or performance of the duties referred to in the request, and the health authority shall forthwith comply with any such direction.</P>
    <P>(3)  This section applies to any officer under a health authority established by this Act who holds an office in relation to which the provisions of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 10 and section 20 of the Local Government Act, 1941, apply as if it were also an office under the sanitary authority of every sanitary district in the functional area of that health authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This arises, I think, out of a point which was made to me by a deputation from the city of Cork.  They expressed some doubt as to the degree of satisfaction which the municipal authority as the sanitary authority might secure from the services of officers of the new unified health authority.  The purpose of the amendment is to give the manager of a sanitary authority in any of the four areas in which health authorities are being set up by the Bill a right to appeal to the Minister if he is dissatisfied with the arrangements for the performance of the work of the sanitary authority by any of the officers concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this arises out of representations by a deputation from Cork Corporation.  The Corporation is concerned about some of the functions that are now performed by their health inspectors.  As I understand the situation the Cork Corporation have in their employment 13 or 14 Health Inspectors and Cork County Council for the vast area that it serves have something as low as four or five people.  We are concerned because under the new Health Authority the services of all the Health Inspectors will be amalgamated under the direction of whoever is the Chief Medical Officer of the new Authority.  If all these people are to be brought in together you have 18 or 19 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel that there is a need at the moment for the number of Health Inspectors that we have in Cork city <Col N="482" /> to perform the various functions placed on the Corporation under the various Health Acts.  We also have a suspicion or feeling that when this new authority is set up and when our 14 Health Inspectors are amalgamated with the four county health inspectors that we will end up by having very much less than 14 health inspectors in Cork to carry out all the functions that we desire to carry out, the services that are statutory obligations on the Corporation in relation to the housing Acts and to the sanitary Acts. We are wondering what the situation will be if Cork Corporation feels that the new health authority has not allocated to the city sufficient health inspectors to carry out these statutory duties.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment in a half-hearted manner attempts to deal with the situation.  Instead of stipulating that the Corporation should have at its disposal the number of health inspectors required to carry out these functions it simply says that if the sanitary authority&mdash;the Corporation will be a sanitary authority in this context&mdash;feels at any time aggrieved by the situation as to the assignment of duties or performance of duties they may request the Minister to issue directions to the parent body&mdash;to the health authority concerned&mdash;to provide for a satisfactory assignment or satisfactory performance of such duties.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there was no other course open to the Minister when he saw the flaw in the Bill as pointed out to him by the deputation.  He obviously accepted the Corporation's case and did realise that there was this flaw in the Bill as originally drafted and in this amendment he has made an effort to deal with that shortcoming.</P>
    <P>I am still convinced that he is not dealing with it adequately.  It would be open to any Minister from time to time to receive complaints from Cork Corporation as to the duties allocated by the parent health authority to their health inspectors in respect of Cork City and county.  I should have thought that the Minister would approach the problem in this manner: <Col N="483" /> that he would say: &ldquo;Here you have Cork Corporation, a sanitary authority. You have statutory obligations imposed on them by legislation passed in this House to carry out certain duties in respect of the Housing Acts and in respect of food and hygiene and one hundred and one other things.&rdquo; I hoped he would say to himself: &ldquo;Having placed that obligation on Cork Corporation I deem it would be necessary for that sanitary authority to have in its employment so many health inspectors.&rdquo;  I hoped he would have left to the Cork Corporation in their separate employment so many health inspectors to carry out these duties rather than throw us on the tender mercies of Deputy Corry and other members of the County Council who must then judge the obligations of the Cork Corporation in respect of the Acts I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would find an opportunity to have another look at that and to appreciate that this House has placed obligations on Cork Corporation to carry out the laws passed in this House and to study my submission that while the Corporation up to now have taken the necessary steps to carry out their obligations, that power is being filched from them in so far as the Cork City Manager or Chief Medical Officer in our health section will not have under his own direct control the health officers to carry out these obligations.  I am asking to have this matter looked into again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give Deputy Casey a definite guarantee in that regard that they will be looked after to the extent of 28 votes to 12.</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Casey not know that Deputy Corry's bark is very much worse than his bite? There is no man with a softer heart in this House than Deputy Corry and I am sure he will not treat Cork City in that rough and ready fashion, as he pretends he intends to do when he is speaking here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not easy to find a rigid line of demarcation and for the time being I <Col N="484" /> would suggest to Deputy Casey: let us try this.  If at the end of a period it is found not to work and can be shown not to have worked because of the intransigence of Deputy Corry, I am sure any Minister for Health would be prepared to amend it in order to safeguard the citizens of the City of Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that I have never heard any difference of opinion as regards the work of officials as between the city and the South Cork area during the 17 years I have been Chairman of the South Cork Board.  There has never been any difference of opinion whatever despite the fact that for every shilling being spent we were paying eight pence.  I challenge Deputy Casey to mention any instance in which there was a difference of opinion in that regard.  As regards Deputy Casey's objection, I suggest a very easy remedy.  If the Cork Corporation are prepared to pay for all the officials they want on that board, I am sure the county have no objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put this point to the Minister.  The Cork Corporation will have in its employ a chief medical officer who will have certain duties to perform and he will need a staff of health inspectors to perform those statutory duties.  It may well be, and I think it is almost inevitable, he will not be provided by the main Health Authority with sufficient staff to carry out these duties.  You will have the situation in Cork where, for instance, the housing department will not have officials to go around to examine the housing conditions of the people or the health department to inspect premises in relation to the food and hygiene regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister not worried at the situation that is bound to arise whereby you have an executive officer charged to carry out certain obligations and somebody else set up under this Bill with control of the staff which should be available to the first man to carry out these duties?  I do not think the Minister has met the situation.  He says that if the sanitary authority feel that the &ldquo;big <Col N="485" /> brother&rdquo; in the main health authority has not assigned a sufficient number of staff to them, they may appeal to the Minister.  The fact is that the City Medical Officer of Health may be charged in court with not performing the functions with which he is charged, while the Minister is considering an appeal from the Corporation as to the number of staff employed.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to raise a scare but I think I am right in saying the Minister is worried about the situation. He should have brought in a stronger amendment whereby he would stipulate in this Bill that it would be mandatory under the new Health Authority to assign a certain number of health inspectors to carry out the functions placed on the Cork Corporation by Acts of this House.  It is only fair to the Corporation, to the City Manager and the Chief Medical Officer in Cork City, if you put obligations on them, to give them the means of carrying them out. The means they have enjoyed up to now are being taken from them under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Casey's consideration of this section has been coloured by the sparring we have <Col N="486" /> listened to here.  It does not relate to Cork City and County only.  It is a section which is designed to be of general application and it is drafted in that form.  It would be I think very wrong for this House to specify by legislation the number of health inspectors or other inspectors who would be appointed by any one of&mdash; or in fact, as would be necessary to do if we accepted the principle&mdash;all the new unified health authorities.</P>
      <P>We must approach this in a way which will be of general application and it is with that objective that the section has been drafted in its present form.  Again, Deputy Casey is under a misapprehension.  There will be one chief medical officer who will have under his direction and supervision the health services for the whole of the City and County of Cork and who will be responsible, under the health authority, of course, for them.  He will be the top of the pinnacle and he will be responsible to all the members of that health authority, to those who are appointed by Cork Corporation as well as to those who are appointed by Cork County Council. If those who are appointed by the Corporation can move their body to make representations to the Minister that they are not getting a fair deal in relation to sanitary services which will still remain as the responsibility of the Cork Corporation, then I am sure the Minister for Health will be very sympathetic in considering their difficulties.</P>
      <P>There is no reason to anticipate that the citizens of Cork City will suffer in any way from the actions of the health authority.  On the question of food hygiene to which Deputy Casey has referred, they are the functions and remain the functions of the health authority and if there is any reason to feel that the officers of the Health Authorities are lax or not zealous in the fulfilment of their duties under the Acts relating to food, he will be able to have that situation remedied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene very briefly to say that it would be deplorable if anyone in this House or outside of it imagined that there is any kind of acrimony between the members of the <Col N="487" /> Cork Corporation and of Cork County Council where health services are concerned. I serve on three separate unified bodies in the county and, as Deputy Corry has already said, there is never any difference of opinion as between the county and the city. Nobody knows better than Deputy Casey that Deputy Corry's remarks have the support of a not very large minority of the county council.  Therefore I think it is waste of the time of this House to be debating these matters here.  I should like it to go from here that, as far as health is concerned, there is no limit to the co-operation that exists between members of the corporation and the county council and there is no need for any fears that the welfare of the people will suffer.</P>

For nine years I have been chairman of the joint body which deals with both city and county and I can challenge both Deputy Healy and Deputy Casey to mention one instance in which fair play was not given, despite the fact that I had the knowledge that for every shilling by which expenditure increased the county had to find 8d and the city 4d and in the division of that 1/- the city got 8d and the county only got 4d.  Still I acted fairly and when the new body is in operation I will continue to act fairly.</P>

      <P>Section 22, subsection (2) deals with the appointment of <Col N="489" /> members to the South Cork Charitable Infirmary and to the North Cork Infirmary and I should like the Minister to elucidate the matter further.  The section provides that the right of appointment of members of the joint management committee of these institutions shall now be held by the new Cork Health Authority. Up to now the combined committee of the North and South Infirmaries were appointed by Cork County Council, Cork Corporation and the trustees of these infirmaries.  Are we to take it that all the appointments, some of which are reserved for the trustees, are now to be given over to the new health authority or that the appointments which are now reserved to the new health authority are only those which Cork Corporation and Cork County Council made heretofore?</P>

Cork Corporation appoints eight members to the North infirmary and eight to the South infirmary while the County Council appoints eight to the North infirmary and nine to the South infirmary and in addition there are 12 other members of each of these bodies.  That position will remain unchanged except for the fact that henceforward the health authority, which will now become the contributing authority, will appoint the members in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister is satisfied regarding the whole position of the voluntary hospitals? We all know that the majority of these have changed over the years and, even prior to the enactment of our Health Acts, the Cork Charitable Infirmary and the North Infirmary were carrying out functions which they no longer do.  They are now largely able to make their claims on the local authority under the Health Acts for every patient who is treated in these institutions.  To my mind, it is important to continue the good work done by these institutions particularly by the voluntary members of the Board.  I think we have come to the stage at which we should realise that the voluntary aspect, as it was known in the past, of these charitable institutions has largely been removed by the Health Acts.  I do not know if the Minister is satisfied that he can now at this stage still allocate to the trustees of these institutions the appointment on the Board of such a large number of people <i>vis-a-vis</i> the number of people who are appointed by the local authorities who, in the main, are paying the bill of those institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am further worried about the situation whereby the Cork Health Authority, this new omnibus authority, will appoint their nominees directly to the management committees of this institution.  We all know that our health authority would have a preponderance of people from outside the Cork Corporation.  If these people so wished it&mdash;I do not think they would; I do not think the present members would, at any rate, but I am trying to look into the future&mdash;if the representatives of the Cork County Council at any future date wished it they could ensure that no member of the Corporation would be representative on the South or the North Infirmary.  I do not think there is any immediate danger of people like my friend, Deputy Corry, endeavouring to squeeze out the representatives of the Cork Corporation.  Legislation is bad which permits people to do something sinister <Col N="491" /> like that, if they wish to do so, and the Minister should have a look at it.</P>

      <P>Will you not have a rather awkward situation?  Who is to determine when a Wicklow representative may attend?  I think Deputy Everett's point is not when must they attend but when may they attend.  Can a situation arise in which an elected representative of the joint board, the Dublin and Wicklow Health Board, presents himself and is told by an officer of the Board &ldquo;We will not let you in&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the section now to refresh my memory of it. I do not think I was inaccurate in what I said to Deputy Everett.  It is subsection (4) of Section 2:</P>
      <P>The functional area of the Dublin Health Authority shall consist of the county borough of Dublin and the administrative county of Dublin, together with, with respect to functions related to the operation of services under the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945 to 1958, the administrative county of Wicklow.</P>
      <P>(5) (a) Three members of the council of the county of Wicklow shall be appointed by resolution by that council for the purposes of this subsection.</P>
      <P>Here is the relevant paragraph, paragraph (b) of subsection (5):</P>
      <P>Where the whole or part of a meeting of the Dublin Health Authority is occupied with business relating to the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945 to 1958, the persons appointed pursuant to this subsection shall, as respects the whole or the said part (as the case may be) of the meeting, be entitled to be present and to take part in discussions and to vote in like manner as if they were members of the Dublin Health Authority.</P>
      <P>I think it is quite clear.  As I said, when business in relation to the Mental Treatment Acts is under consideration, the representatives of Wicklow County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to create difficulties at this stage but I would <Col N="495" /> direct the Minister's attention to this matter.  The three members representative of Wicklow have an undoubted right to attend the meetings in certain circumstances.  If these members present themselves as desiring to attend a meeting and are informed by the clerk of the authority &ldquo;There is no business to-day for discussion under the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945 to 1958, and therefore your attendance is not required&rdquo;, are they not entitled to reply &ldquo;Is there not an item on the Agenda. &lsquo;Any other business&rsquo;?  We have come here to-day to raise a matter relative to the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945 to 1958, which is not specifically mentioned on the Agenda but which we desire to raise as a matter of other business.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not ask me how the health authority will conduct its business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that this is not a case of where the health authority, sitting in the discharge of its business, wants to make its own standing orders.  This is a case where there are representatives of Dublin City and County and three representatives of Wicklow.  We are declaring, by Statute of this House, that they have a limited right of participating in the proceedings.  As Deputy Everett says, the practice at present is that the body dealing with this matter meets monthly and the representatives of Wicklow attend monthly and, if there is anything on their minds, they can raise it.  Knowing that local representatives sometimes find certain subjects of intense interest to themselves, can the Minister not conceive of a situation in which the local representatives of Wicklow feel there is some grievance in relation to the mental hospital which they think requires urgent ventilation and they intend to come as a body to the meeting to raise this matter?  They are met by the Clerk who says: &ldquo;There is nothing on the agenda relating to the Mental Treatment Act.  I will not let you in.&rdquo;  They say: &ldquo;There is something on the agenda.  There is &lsquo;Other Business&rsquo;, and the purpose of our coming here is to raise with the authority an urgent matter relating to <Col N="496" /> the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945 to 1958, in their application to the people on whose behalf we speak.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am only putting this to the Minister in order to avoid trouble in the smooth working of these arrangements. Is it really necessary that you should exclude these three Wicklow representatives from a meeting of the joint body?  Presumably, if they have no interest in the proceedings because there is nothing coming up on the agenda relating to Wicklow, they will not come.  But, are you not creating unnecessary difficulty for yourself if you construct a situation in which three public representatives are liable to be challenged at the door by an officer of the authority itself when they believe they have a right to attend and he, interpreting the Statute, believes they have not?  Why should we not allow them to attend every meeting?  If they do not want to come, they need not attend.  If they do come and attempt to participate in the proceedings, they are a very small minority of the total membership and are not likely to do any serious harm.</P>

      <P>I will suggest to Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Opposition, that if he wishes to discuss this matter further, it would perhaps arise more appropriately on the First Schedule to the Bill, because that does provide for the calling of a meeting on request by three members of a health authority.  It also provides for giving three days' notice of any matter which it is proposed to raise at a meeting of the Authority.  I assume that in no circumstances would the three members for Wicklow turn up without having been given due notice and, therefore, the clerk could not inform them that there was no matter on the agenda relating to the Mental Treatment Acts.</P>

      <P>I am just thinking of my own experience on local authorities. A member of a local authority who feels he has some urgent business to do may feel it is desirable to turn up and clamour for admission. In general, it does not make for smooth working to make it, through a Statute of this House, not only a right of but a duty on a servant of the local authority to meet at the door a member of the local authority and forbid him to enter.  If the smooth working of the health authority requires it, perhaps it would be necessary to do it; but if it is not essential, then I do not think any member of the local authority should be turned away by the authority of this House by an officer of the local authority of which he is an elected member.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will raise that point on the First Schedule, which prescribes rules relating to membership and meetings of health authorities established under the Act, that would then, perhaps, get the discussion in its proper perspective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would turn to the Schedule which I mentioned, he will see there that, in fact, as there are three members from Wicklow on the Dublin Health Authority, they would be able to call a meeting themselves if the chairman did not do it.  We are really not discussing this in a very orderly fashion. We could deal with the whole question of meetings when we come to the First Schedule.  The First Schedule provides that the public health authority <Col N="498" /> will meet once a month for the transaction of business, and I am perfectly certain that if it is doing its business there will be some items on the agenda relating to mental treatment.</P>

      <P>The amendment I have now moved is to permit the Wicklow County Council, if it wishes to do so, to make its own arrangements for mental treatment.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I can, because they are only brought in because of the fact that we are absorbing the mental treatment services in Dublin and Wicklow into the Dublin Health Authority. Providentially, I think the Wicklow citizens do not constitute a very large proportion of the mental hospital patients in Grangegorman or elsewhere. We cannot give them equality of service in relation to other things to which they do not contribute.  They only contribute for the purposes of mental treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them would not be procedural.  Some of them are in relation to the responsibilities <Col N="499" /> and functions of the local committees to be established under Section 10 of the Act.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is this.  We take the view that in the modern conditions of legislation it is not unreasonable, where relatively insignificant regulations fall to be made by a Minister, under a Bill, that he should have recourse to the procedure envisaged in Section 23 of the Bill, but that where powers are conferred by a Bill on a Minister to make by regulation substantial amendments of the law or substantial additions to the law, it is more appropriate that these regulations should be the subject of positive conferring resolutions on the motion of the Minister in this House.  We would not demur to the procedure of Section 23 if the Minister says the regulations envisaged under this Act would be mainly procedural and of a minor character, but if they could be of a character materially modifying the present corpus of this Statute then we think he ought to bring them here and seek approval of the House on his own motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not suggested that we are going to amend this Act by regulation.  There is nothing of that sort in it.  But, when the Leader of the Opposition asks me if the regulations made will relate merely to procedural matters, I am bound to call his attention to the fact that under Section 10 we are setting up local committees which will have functions in relation to their local areas.  Some of these functions may, perhaps, relate, for instance, to the dispensary services and so on, so that one could not describe them as being procedural. But the regulations do not permit the Minister in any way to alter the substance&mdash;to put it that way&mdash;the substance or the corpus of the Health Acts under which we are now operating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have deliberately said that our view is that where regulations under statute are of a relatively insignificant character, in the light of modern legislation trends, it is reasonable to adopt the procedure of Section 23 but where the regulations which the Statute empowers the Minister to make impose a charge or enable him substantially to modify the legislation enacted by this House, he ought to come back to the House for its approval.</P>

      <P>We are a little bit at cross-purposes here.  Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5, which relate to the membership of the unified authorities to be established under the Act, also provide that the regulations which may be made under these sections shall not become operative until they have been laid before each House and a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  In regard to those under Section 10, to which I have already referred and those under Section 24, which is the next section we have to deal with, possibly, under that particular section, it is possible to make regulations in respect of any existing statute, order or regulation which is in force at the passing of the Act and such regulations would fall, under Section 23, to be laid before the House but would come into effect and be effective until such time as the House might within the prescribed period annul them by motion.  These are sections designed to fit this Act into the whole of the existing code.</P>

Limerick County Council had a deputation to the Minister and, if my information is correct, I think there would be two from each of the electoral divisions.  There are five electoral divisions and that would mean a membership of ten for the whole county of Limerick.  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider that in the light of the area in question and that he would give the same <i>pro rata</i> membership as he applies to Cork, three to each electoral division.  It is provided that the members shall be appointed successively and I would like to hear from the Minister what is meant by &ldquo;successively&rdquo;.  I would also ask the Minister to bear in mind the point about three members from each of the five electoral areas in the county.

      <P>My point is in relation to the amendment and to the Schedule.  Perhaps, the Chair will recollect the difficulty that arose previously about a Schedule to a Bill and while I do not anticipate that there will be a detailed discussion of this Schedule, I would not like it to be thought that the Schedule might be put into Committee as a whole.  Certainly, we would feel that if we did desire to discuss certain parts of the Schedule in detail, that right should be afforded to us and I merely raise that because, while I do not anticipate that there will be a full Committee discussion on the Schedule, I should not like it to be said later on that the Schedule of the Bill had been passed as an entire Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>It is paragraph (iii) of amendment No. 24, which reads:</P>
      <P>in the cases of the county of Limerick and the county of Waterford, for each county electoral area in the county, two members of the authority shall be appointed successively from among the county councillors elected for that area;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, you must turn to the procedure whereby the groups may come together and may say: these two members are in that group and they come from that <Col N="505" /> particular district.  When two members have been appointed for each county electoral area, there will then be five places to be filled on the Health Authority and these will be filled one after the other.  There will not be a bloc vote for the five places.  There will not be, should I say, a caucus arrangement covering the whole five places.  Instead, if a certain number can come together and say: &ldquo;We are filling one place and that is our man,&rdquo; he goes in automatically, but they have spent their votes.  Another group can then come along and do likewise until the five places are filled.  I am talking in terms of five.  That is the same thing as is done at present in forming Boards of Assistance and other bodies from county councils.  There is no departure from the existing practice so far as these are concerned, the only provision being that there shall be a definite number from each county electoral area.</P>

      <P>I take it we are not to accept this as a definitive ruling of a final character because I think it was an elaborate question which it would not be expedient to pursue now in connection with a Constitution Amendment Bill which was then before us.

      <P>In rule 2, page 21, line 16, to insert &ldquo;additional&rdquo; before &ldquo;members&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think this relates to the point made by Deputy Jones and that the amendment is designed to correct an error in drafting the provision to define the size of the group necessary to appoint an additional member without voting.  As it stands, the number is obtained by dividing the total number of councillors present by the total number of members, including those for county electoral areas, to be appointed.  As the size of the group is to be related to the number of members left to be appointed after the council area members have been appointed, this would not be correct and, under the provision as amended, the election in, say, Cork would work out as follows&mdash;I saw Deputy Corry rise and I hope I am anticipating him.</P>

      <P>Of the twenty-eight members to be appointed, twenty-one would first be appointed by the Council and then the remaining figure of seven would be divided into the total present, say, forty, out of a total county membership of forty-six. This would give a figure of six, ignoring fractions, and any six Councillors could thus nominate an additional member for appointment without voting.  Having done this the Councillors concerned would be excluded from having any further vote and those outside groups would then proceed to fill any vacancies left.</P>

      <P>In rule 2 page 21, before paragraph (2), to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In subparagraphs (b) to (e) of the foregoing paragraph, &lsquo;councillors&rsquo; and &lsquo;councillor&rsquo; do not, in relation to the council of the county of Dublin, include any councillor elected for the county electoral area which is coterminous with the borough of Dún Laoghaire&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the particular case of the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council which will appoint its own members to the Dublin Health Authority.  It is proposed under this amendment that the members of the Dublin County Council who have been elected to that body from Dún Laoghaire area will not participate in the election by the County Council of members to that Authority.  This is merely to preserve the principle of one man, one vote in relation to local authorities.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to Rule 6.  Rule 6 specifies <Col N="508" /> the procedure under which the county council can recall its members from the Dublin Health Authority and appoint new ones instead. Rule 7 provides that where a county council member has for a consecutive period of three months failed to attend a meeting of the Authority he may be replaced by the county council.  It is proposed that the county councillors for Dún Laoghaire will not participate in action under these rules.  They are not a county council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Schedule I should like the Minister to consider between now and the Report Stage, this problem.  The Wicklow local authority appoints three members to the health authority, admittedly for a restricted purpose, but the interpretation of that restricted purpose will have to be made ultimately by someone, if they are not to be permitted to participate in meetings in which that restricted purpose does not come up for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that that is an unworkable arrangement.  I see the Minister's point that he does not think it right that three representatives of the Wicklow County Council, with a very restricted purpose should as a result of that membership be allowed to participate in discussions relating to health matters affecting Dublin City and County.  However, the probability of their exercising any effective influence on decisions relating to Dublin City and County is remote in the extreme but there is a great probability <Col N="509" /> of a situation arising in which the three Wicklow representatives, feeling they ought to be entitled to come to the monthly meeting, would raise of their own initiative under the omnibus head which will appear on the agenda: &ldquo;Any other business&rdquo; some matter relative to the mental hospital treatment of patients from Wicklow.  The very fact that they have not the right to attend will beget a desire on the part of the public representatives to attend and make representations, and you are at once confronted with the awkward situation of a conflict between officers of the authority who have certain duties to discharge, and it will eventually be said: &ldquo;There is nothing on the agenda which entitles the Wicklow representatives to be here.&rdquo;  One of the Wicklow representatives says: &ldquo;Yes, there is.  &lsquo;Other Business,&rsquo; under which I want to raise the matter of the mental hospitals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Who will resolve that matter?  If it is resolved in a way which forbids the Wicklow representatives to enter the room and participate in the proceedings you may face the situation in which the validity of the whole proceedings of the health authority for that day are called in question. Is it not much simpler to say that the three Wicklow members will take their place <i>pari passu</i> with all the other members of the Authority?  It has to be borne in mind that the decisions of the Authority representatives of the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council which affect Wicklow interests will be voted upon and spoken upon by representatives of Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>Is there any outrage on procedure in making it possible for a public representative from Wicklow to speak or vote relative to a matter affecting Dublin city or county if it makes it procedurally very much more convenient for everybody?  It is highly unlikely that any Wicklow representative will concern himself in a matter which is purely of interest to the residents of Dublin city or county but if some Wicklow representative wanted to express an opinion or record a vote it is not likely that any irreparable <Col N="510" /> damage would be done.  Certainly my experience from serving on a local authority is that one of the most treasured rights of a member of a local council is, if he believes there is something wrong, to come to the monthly meeting and raise that matter at the meeting.  It is a great protection for the average person that, if there is something going wrong at the mental hospital or even if he thinks there is, he has a right to come to his representative and ask him to raise it at the next monthly meeting.  It is an un-desirable thing that a situation should arise that some routine complaint of that character would not be raised because a Wicklow representative would not be admitted and that three representatives from Wicklow could call a special meeting of the whole authority to raise some matter which if they had been allowed to raise it might have been disposed of in five minutes at the ordinary monthly meeting.</P>
    <P>I am not of opinion that any such matter of principle is here involved. I am solely concerned to suggest to the Minister that he is creating trouble for himself.  There will be a very much smoother operation if the Wicklow members are treated as being equals in all respects of the other members of the health authority.  If he seeks to put them in a different position they will surely resolve that at all costs. There will appear on the agenda some thing every month which will give them the right to be present because they will not want to occupy an inferior position in the health authority as representatives of the County Wicklow local authority.  Deputies who have experience of local authority work will confirm what I say.  I do not raise this matter on principle but purely as a matter of expediency to ensure the smooth working of this body.  The Minister would be well advised to consider what I am saying between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should certainly be glad to consider the point Deputy Dillon has made.  It is a point of some substance though I should have thought, having read the Schedule, that for the purpose of the Mental Treatment <Col N="511" /> Act the three Wicklow representatives of the health authority could summon a meeting for the purpose of considering any matter arising under the Mental Treatment Act.  There may be some doubt about that.  There could scarcely arise any question of excluding the members of the Wicklow County Council from a meeting.  They could quite reasonably be allowed to attend but not vote on any matter except a matter relating to the Mental Treatment Act.  There may be a point in what the Leader of the Opposition has raised, and I shall look into it to see if it is necessary to do anything about it.</P>

    <P>Tá súil agam gur cabhrach mar mhíniú ar an mBille an cur síos atá déanta agam air agus, le linn dom bheith ag críochnú, déanfaidh mé trácht ar aon phointí eile ar gá eolas nó míniú a thabhairt ina dtaobh.</P>
    <P>The Bill is mainly concerned with the grant of increases in wound, disability and married pensions and in certain allowances to dependants of deceased persons, payable under the Army Pensions Acts 1923 to 1959.  The increases are effective from 1st August, 1959, and in fact are being paid since that date on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions <Col N="515" /> passed in this House on 22nd July, 1959.</P>
    <P>The increases, which are dealt with in Sections 2 to 25 inclusive are. broadly in accordance with the increases for State pensioners, generally, authorised by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement in April, 1959.  Officer Pensioners whose pensions are related to their Army pay at the date of their discharge are receiving an increase of 6 per cent. if discharged before 1st September, 1949, and 4 per cent. if they were discharged on or after that date and before 1st April, 1950.  These dates, being associated with Army pay changes, are considered to be more appropriate qualifying dates than 1st November, 1948, and 1st November, 1952 the dates mentioned in the Budget Statement for other State pensioners.  The 6 per cent. and 4 per cent. increases mentioned are subject to the limitation, however, that they must not have the effect of increasing a pension beyond the amount which would be payable if the recipient had been discharged on 2nd November, 1952, with similar rank, service and degree of disablement. Other pensioners under the Acts, whose pensions are not related to Army pay are receiving an increase of 6 per cent.  In the case, however, of the widow of a Signatory of the 1916 Proclamation who did not receive an increase in her annual allowance when State pensions were increased in 1956, it was considered that the amount of the allowance payable to her under Part II of the Army Pensions Act, 1937, should be increased to the level which it would have reached if both the 1956 and 1959 increases applied (6 per cent. in each case).  Section 17 of the Bill provides accordingly.  The estimated annual cost of the increases provided in the Bill is £11,500.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is designed to remove a doubt which arose whether Section 2 of the Army Pensions Act, 1959, fully implemented the intention underlying that section&mdash;which was the removal from the Second and Third Schedules to the Act of 1923 of the dependency requirement in respect of the widows and children of deceased persons to <Col N="516" /> whom the Schedules applied.  One of the enabling Sections associated with these Schedules (Section 2 of the Army Pensions Act, 1946) was not cited in the 1959 amending provision and this is now being done&mdash;with effect from the date on which the Act of 1959 was passed.</P>
    <P>Section 27 enables the extended time limit afforded by Section 9 of the Act of 1959 to operate in respect of an application for an allowance under Part II of the Act of 1953 from a surviving relative of a deceased person with pre-Truce service who becomes entitled to the allowance after the death of the relative to whom it was first paid.  It was intended that the 1959 Act concession should have applied in such a case.</P>
    <P>Section 28 is designed to terminate the restriction imposed by Section 37 of the Army Pensions Act, 1953, on the increase of certain &ldquo;further&rdquo; or &ldquo;married&rdquo; pensions granted to persons discharged subsequent to the date (1st January, 1953) on which the restriction operated.  Such &ldquo;further&rdquo; or &ldquo;married&rdquo; pensions&mdash;where they formed part of disablement pensions which alone or when aggregated with Defence Force pensions exceeded £450 per annum&mdash;were prevented by the terms of Section 37 of the Act of 1953 from attracting the increases awarded in the Acts of 1953 and 1957.  The purpose of Section 28 of the Bill is to remove that restriction so that with effect from 1st August, 1959, the increases applicable to these &ldquo;further&rdquo; or &ldquo;married&rdquo; pensions will be enabled to take effect.</P>
    <P>I hope that the outline which I have given of the contents of the Bill will have proved informative and helpful and I will endeavour to deal, when I am concluding, with any points on which further information or explanation may be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, these increases are being paid and of course they are welcome to the recipients.  I am still disappointed that the Minister and the Government have not made some provision for a section of our people who, I think and have thought for a very long time, should be included and that is the widows of <Col N="517" /> people who had disability pensions due to disease&mdash;not wounds, because they are included.  There are some very hard and serious cases where the volunteer officer, N.C.O. or man contracted disease either pre-Truce or post-Truce or the disease was aggravated by service post-Truce in either forces&mdash;I will put it that way&mdash; either Executive Forces or the Defence Forces here.  They are excluded.  These widows do not come in at all under any of these Acts.</P>
      <P>For a very long time I have held the view that before we give any further increase in these pensions, we should first make provision for the widows of people who died from disease contracted on service.  The sum that is being paid here would go a very long distance to paying it.  Personally, I do not believe there is a single pensioner who has a wound pension and whose wife and family are included under the old scale who would say: &ldquo;No, we must get this increase and leave the others as they are.&rdquo;  I think they would voluntarily and gladly forego the increase in their pension to make provision for the widows of these people.  The Minister will find memoranda in the office dealing with that subject.  He should give it particular attention so that some provision will be made for them.</P>
      <P>I am personally aware and so, I am sure, is the Minister&mdash;at least if the Minister is not aware there are several officials in his Department who are&mdash; of very hard cases&mdash;that is the best word I can use&mdash;where widows and orphans are caused hardship because of the lack of provision in these various Acts.  I did say publicly that I had no intention, while Minister, of increasing any of the pensions until this provision would first be made.  I believe that was accepted by the recipients of disability pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has extended the time limit in respect of the 1916 signatories and I am glad of the other amendments made.  The Minister says that he hopes the statement he made will be helpful.  I do not think it is.  As I said, when this Estimate was going through, I think <Col N="518" /> the Minister in cases like this should, without naming anybody, give us examples of what it is intended to do so that every person would know what he is entitled to.  Perhaps I am guilty of the offence myself, but that does not make it any better.  When you get a statement that the Act is being amended and there is a reference to</P>
    <P>removal from the Second and Third Schedule to the Act of 1923 of the dependency requirements in respect of widows and children of deceased persons to whom the Schedule applied,</P>
    <P>what does that convey to the ordinary person?  To whom do these Acts apply?  The people do not know what they are entitled to or whether they should apply or not.  Does it become automatic for those who have it?  This practice of speaking by reference is not a satisfactory way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>I am always glad to welcome any extension of a time limit.  That is being done here in respect of one particular class.  It is right that it should be done, but I respectfully submit&mdash; every day the number of pensioners becomes fewer&mdash;the time limit should not apply at all.  My contention is that if you were entitled to a disability pension in 1923, in 1933, in 1943, in 1953, or in 1959, the fact that you did not apply for it prior to now should not debar you.  Yet it does.  The Minister can be satisfied beyond yea or nay that the person had a valid claim but, because one Act said the last date for application was such and such a time, he cannot get it.  We know there have been changing circumstances and changes of mind on the part of various people.  There were some people who had an objection to applying for pensions on the grounds that that was not what they fought for and so on. As a matter of fact, a former member of the Fianna Fáil Party has written a play which demonstrates that very fully.  I refer to the play <i>It Can't Go On Forever</i> by Mr. McCann.  One of the characters portrayed does not apply for his pension because it is against his principle and so on.  <i>Necessitas non habet legem.</i> But the time came when necessity <Col N="519" /> knew no law and he felt he could make his application.  But Mr. McCann did not point out that he would be late and could not make it then.  Mr. McCann should have stressed in the play that, because of the legislation we passed here, not-withstanding the record and the entitlement that person had to a military service pension, he cannot get it now because it is too late.</P>
    <P>I shall not deal with military service pensions now, but I shall deal with them at a later stage.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the whole question of the widows and orphans of officers, N.C.O.s and men who died or contracted disease or who had military service, that is, disability pensions.  The matter should now be examined.  For the few thousand pounds that would be involved, I think it would be a great step to take.  I appeal to the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party behind the Minister to support me in that plea. Justice would then be done.  It has never been done as far as those people are concerned.</P>
    <P>The payment of this increase is welcomed by every recipient.  They have, I suppose, the complaint that it is not more; but in the circumstances it is fairly generous and acceptable. But the other amendment would be one that would be welcomed by every section.  Those who will receive this increase would be well satisfied, I believe, if it were transferred to the others, if the Government felt they could not afford both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to compliment the Minister on bringing in this Bill and to thank him, on behalf of the people concerned, for doing so.  I would not like to follow Deputy MacEoin all through the speech he has made, but I think we would all have been very proud if either this Government or any of the past Governments could have seen their way to do what Deputy General MacEoin wants.  However, we have to be thankful for small mercies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing I thought the Minister might be able to do in this Bill and I am disappointed that he has <Col N="520" /> not done it.  Under these disability pensions and wound pensions there is still a marriage ban.  I think it is the only place where it still obtains.  If a man were in receipt of one of these pensions and got married subsequent to 1932 he is not entitled to a married allowance in contrast to a man who got married before 1932, whose wife and family are entitled to an allowance under the Bill.  A man who got married in December, 1932 is not entitled to a married allowance.  In many cases because of the disability they suffered these men were not in a position to get married earlier.  They now find themselves with families much younger than would normally be the case.  They are deprived of any allowance under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider that point.  There is no such ban in the case of disability allowances, in which case the wife is entitled to an allowance, irrespective of the date of marriage.  In regard to the pensions now under consideration unless the man married prior to 1932, he is not entitled to the married allowance.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider that matter and to accept an amendment.  I would thank the Minister for the length he has gone. It is much appreciated by the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The people to whom the Deputy refers were cases in which the percentage disability due to the disease was below 80 per cent. but above 50 per cent. and those people got the option of either accepting a final pension or waiting until such time as the degree of disability <Col N="521" /> might go above 80 per cent., when they would qualify for the ordinary disease pension.  They were given the choice and opted for the final pension, which does not carry a married pension. what Deputy MacEoin is asking for is that their original decision should now be ignored and that they should all be placed on the same basis.  That, obviously is a big decision to make now.  The fact is that it was their own choice at the time.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin also suggested that what we should have done was to give samples of the type of cases to which the Bill applies so that everybody would know what he was entitled to and whether he should apply.  Nobody has to apply for the increases that are being provided for in this amending Bill.  There would be some point if it were the 1959 Act but in this Bill it is merely a question of providing for percentage increases in pensions that are already being paid, and these increases are in fact being paid since 1st August, so that that suggestion would not apply in this case.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin also referred to the difficulty of understanding Section 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>All we are doing in Section 26 is removing a doubt which arose as to whether the Army Pensions Act, 1959, had done what we intended it to do.  The explanation was all given at that time.  Advertisements were inserted in the papers to notify the people concerned.  That was all done after the enactment of the Army Pensions Act, 1959, and it is just since then that some doubt has cropped up as to whether we effectively did what we set out to do in that Bill and this is merely a technical amendment to establish that position definitely, that we have in fact done what we intended to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty about having no closing date in connection with pensions which are granted for wounds or disease attributable to active service <Col N="522" /> should be fairly obvious.  It is the difficulty of establishing the medical fact as to whether the wound or disability is in fact due to that service. Obviously, it is very difficult to establish in the case of an application that would be made only now that the disability or disease or wound was in fact due to service or to something that happened 40 years ago.  Obviously, it is desirable, if not essential, that there should be a closing date.  As time goes on it will become more and more difficult&mdash;impossible, I would say&mdash;to establish that the disability was in fact due to service during that time, so that the case for a time limit is not just to cut anybody out but to try to arrange that these things could in fact be decided.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Gilbride's point in connection with the time limit that was imposed on marriages to qualify for the further married pension, the marriage had to have taken place before 10th December, 1932.  Deputy Gilbride argues that there should be no time limit in that case or that it should be extended. As I have already explained, it would be against all principles that a married element in the pension should be given in respect of a marriage contracted after the date of discharge from the forces in respect of disease or wound, or after the date on which the wound was incurred, but in this case the time limit was extended up to 9th December, 1932.  I do not know that it is reasonable to expect that it should be extended further but I will undertake to reconsider the matter, to look into it and to see if there is in fact any justification for extending that marriage date and, if it is decided to do so, a short amending Bill could be brought in but all the arguments that I used on the last occasion against that proposal still appear to apply.</P>
    <P>The analogy between special allowances and these Army pensions does not apply.  The special allowances do not continue after the person in receipt of them; they do not carry on to the widows and children, for one thing.  I do not think there are any other points that I should cover and since this is a Bill to implement the <Col N="523" /> increases given in the Budget I would ask the House to pass it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that it is reasonable that the special allowances are paid to a man when he gets married and that his wife is recognised as being a charge on him?  Does the Minister not consider that the philosophy of saying that because he got married after such a date, she married him with all his faults, that he was blemished when she got him, and that she knew it, is not sound?</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental concept in this type of legislation. There have been cases in other countries where extensions of the kind proposed gave rise to such things as deathbed marriages.  Obviously there has to be some date and the extension given in these cases was up to 1932 where the wound or disability was incurred in the 1916-1923 period, so that it was nine years after the occurrence of the disability that was fixed as the latest date for marriage.  That seems to be reasonable and while I undertake to reconsider the matter, I am not giving any promise as to whether the time might be extended or not.</P>

    <P>As Deputies will see, this is a short measure containing only two provisions. Section 1 is necessary in order to give statutory authority for increases in the pensions payable under the Military Service Pensions Acts 1924 to 1953 in respect of active service in the period 1916 to 1923.  The annual cost of the increases which were granted with effect from 1st August 1959, on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions passed in this House on 22nd July 1959, is estimated at £34,000 and the increases are in accordance with those for State pensioners, generally, authorised by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement in April 1959.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is designed to provide power to correct errors which were found to have been made by the Referee in setting out his findings in respect of two applications under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, for the grant of service certificates.  In the two cases (which are defined in the section by reference to the dates on which the applications were made, referred to the Referee and reported on) it transpired that the Referee, while intending to make affirmative reports which would have resulted in the award of certificates and pensions, did in fact sign negative reports.  Both cases were dealt with in the last week of the Referee's tenure of office.  The Referee had died before the errors were discovered and the proposal in the Bill is that the two errors should be corrected with the concurrence of two of the members of the Advisory Committee who assisted him in the investigation of the two cases.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, in the ordinary course of events, the system would have prevented such errors occurring and that they occurred solely as a result of a disturbance of the ordinary routine in the concluding stages of the Referee's work.  All the cases dealt with in the last six months of his tenure of office have been examined and it has been established that there were no other similar cases during that period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> I do not think that the Bill calls for any further comment, but I will be glad, in concluding, to deal with any points which Deputies may raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>While the recipients of these increases are, of course, glad to get them many of the increases are completely ridiculous.  A 6 per cent. increase on a military service pension of £9 distributed over twelve months comes to a princely figure.  I repeat what I said on the other Bill that if you added the £34,000 and the £11,500 involved in these two proposals, and transferred that sum to the widows of people who died from disease you would have done a great day's work.  I assert positively that I do not believe there is a single Old I.R.A. officer, N.C.O. or man who would begrudge that to see justice done.  To some people like myself, or to people like the Minister for Finance, the 6 per cent. is a substantial sum, £18 to £24 a year, but to the man on the £9 a year pension it is 8d. a month.  They are the majority.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to be careful in what he is doing in Section 2 of this Bill.  He tells us that the Referee made a negative report where he intended to make an affirmative report.  He is now taking power to amend that report.  Every Minister for Defence when he was challenged as to why a certain person did not get a military service pension&mdash;when the Deputy who was speaking knew that that person was entitled to it, that the reason he failed to get it was that he did not understand what were the qualifying factors through which he would be granted a pension&mdash;would reply that the decision of the referee was final and binding.  The Minister is now taking steps to alter that.</P>

      <Col N="527" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, being of opinion that it is not in the national interest that cross-Channel shipping should remain almost exclusively under foreign control, requests the Government to institute, as a matter of urgency, an investigation into the whole position with a view to securing that a substantial proportion of the cross-Channel trade shall be brought under Irish control.&mdash; (Deputy Russell.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very reasonable motion to bring before the House and I am glad the Minister has received it in a very reasonable fashion.  However, he pointed out the difficulties involved in getting into this business of cross-Channel trade.  No matter what line of business we go into we are bound to face difficulties. We faced difficulties in starting our air traffic which is a more modern system of traffic than shipping and we are all very pleased that our air companies have surmounted their difficulties in no uncertain fashion.  I have no doubt that if the same attention were paid to the shipping interests our shipping companies, backed by the Government, would be as successful as Aer Lingus and the other newly-formed air companies that are flying the Atlantic.</P>
      <P>It is important that greater national interest is taken in the volume of our exports to Britain and in transport to Britain because it is to England that we export most of our produce and the bulk of that produce is sent in ships.  I believe that for many years to come it will continue to go by ships in spite of very great competition from air services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an increasing volume of <Col N="528" /> tourist traffic going by air which I believe was responsible for the improvement in the service provided for the cross-Channel tourist trade.  It was very primitive up to two years ago. Our Irish tourists coming to and going from this country experienced great hardship on board some of these ships a couple of years ago.  I am glad that because of the competition from Aer Lingus there is a considerable improvement.  However, we should like to see greater improvement and I have no doubt that if we had an interest in cross-Channel shipping we would effect greater improvements thus helping the tourist industry which is of such great importance.</P>
    <P>We also export large quantities of agricultural produce and cattle and it is only right that we should have some say in that export trade.  Of course we import a great deal also and I would not claim that we should have all the say but we should have some say in that traffic.  Last year I understand we imported £1½ million of English machinery.  Let us hope that that large amount of machinery will be put to useful work, that it will be properly employed, because a great deal of it has been bought on the hire purchase system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on the Motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be a curtailment of our development in agriculture, there will be less shipping, fewer exports and fewer imports of machinery.  If we curtail our exports of agricultural produce we will import less machinery because we will not require it.  All that will need to be taken into consideration in exploring the possibility of developing the cross-Channel service.  I would be very sorry if we were compelled to reduce our exports for want of a market but let us hope that common sense will prevail on all sides and that instead of curtailing our activities in the export, and import markets we will be encouraged to increase them, thereby increasing the volume of our exports and imports and thus giving more employment to the ships in which we hope we will have a valuable interest <Col N="529" /> when this investigation has been carried out by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I understand there is a ban on container traffic at the port of Dublin. It is more detrimental to Dublin than it is to any other port in Ireland.  They are the sufferers as a result of that ban because it is responsible for diverting trade to other ports.  I hope the dockers in Dublin will see the light of day and realise they are only injuring themselves by turning trade away from their own port in imposing such a foolish ban.  This form of traffic gives very good service especially from Belfast to England.  There is no reason why it should not give good service here.  This trade should not be held up in any respect if it is to provide a better service for the people than we already have.</P>
      <P>The question of going into this shipping business and exploring its possibilities is one that we must consider very carefully.  I had the experience in Cork recently where a shipping company discontinued its service from Cork and the field is wide open now for this Government or any enterprising company to come along and provide a service which was in operation for a number of years.  I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the situation.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy want him to go into a business that does not pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated before the tribunal which inquired into these matters that many of the enterprises do not pay but they have kept going. Perhaps the time will come again when they will pay or perhaps the same thing will happen to some of the companies operating from Dublin if our imports and exports are reduced as a result of strong action taken by outside Governments.  Such strong action could have a wide influence on the shipping trade in this country in the near future.  We were all very sorry to see that shipping service from Cork discontinued and we hope that the same thing will not happen in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that there are periods when this country receives a setback.  That usually happens in <Col N="530" /> normal times when there is no war or danger of war and when the same demand for our products is not there. I have often heard it said in Cork that the best friends the farmers of Ireland ever had were the Kaiser, Hitler and Stalin because they made it possible for our farmers to get a ready market for all the produce they could get from the land.  In normal times the same opportunities are not there and we are only held as a spare wheel to fill the gap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir, may I ask why the Minister for Transport and Power is not present to deal with this matter?  Deputy MacEoin had to forgo a function in Athlone to-day in order to attend to the business of this House and it would not be fair if the Minister for Transport and Power has gone to Athlone and neglected the business of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Another important question is whether cross-Channel shipping will continue or not.  Are our goods to be transported by air or will a tunnel be constructed under the Irish Sea which might perhaps wipe out all shipping?  The time may come in our day when a connecting link between the two countries might <Col N="531" /> wipe out all shipping and our goods would be transported under the Irish Sea in safety from air or submarine attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seconding the motion, but I want to put those points before the people who are to investigate this matter of cross-Channel shipping: are ships to be the future method of transporting our imports and exports?  If they are, we should have a vital interest in that industry and that is why I second the motion which I consider to be one of vital importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is one which, to my mind, should be supported by everyone but there is underlying it another question.  What control have we got over imports and how can we ensure that they will be carried in our own vessels?  I had a funny experience in that matter last year.  One of our Irish coasters owned by a Cobh man was laid up.  He succeeded in getting the last quantity of foreign barley brought into this country and I was asked to find out the freight for him.  I was given the name of a joker in Dublin, who was a dummy for a gentleman in London, who had to go to his high priest on the Continent, who was at that time insisting that every ton of artificial fertiliser brought in here should be brought in in Dutch bottoms.</P>
      <P>That is the first matter we have to look after.  The second question is: Who is going to control it?  We have put some millions of money into Irish Shipping Limited and the Irish taxpayer is entitled, when his money is invested in that manner, to expect that those ships would be compelled, and I say compelled, to have their repairs and overhauls carried out in Irish dockyards where Irish dockyards are available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the advantages that should follow the owning of a merchant fleet by the Irish Republic is employment on repairs to and refitting of these vessels.  If that were done in our own country it would give employment to our own people.</P>

      <P>If we put up another Irish shipping company to deal with cross-Channel shipping will they also be allowed the same latitude as those at present operating the cross-Channel service from the Port of Cork?  They have earned their livelihood out of that port for the past 40 years.  Ship after ship comes twice or three times a week into Cork.  They get their trade there.  They get their livelihood out of the port.  Whenever any repairs or refitting are required, they pass down Rushbrooke Dockyard and sail over to John Bull.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, one of the advantages of possessing ships of our own to deal with cross-Channel trade or anything else is the amount of employment they will give to Irish people.  Others might not judge it in that way but I do.  It is a terrible thing that a large proportion <Col N="533" /> of Irish money is invested even in cross-Channel boats if those boats are to be sent over to Britain for repairs and refitting.  We are looking for employment in our own country for our own people.  I have given one instance of what happens.</P>
      <P>Where will we get the trade for those ships?  Will any Government insist that imports into this country from Britain will come in Irish bottoms?  If not, our Irish cross-Channel ships, owned by the Irish people, bought with money put up by the Irish people, will be like the case of the man who had the pluck to buy the ship in Cobh which is lying idle in the harbour while necessities for this country are imported in Dutch bottoms.  These are the things we must look at before we say either &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to a proposition of this size.  Will this Government insist on that or will we have, as I have seen year after year in the town of Cobh, the shipwrights and the shipbuilders going over to South Shields to repair Irish vessels?</P>
      <P>The question which arises and which strikes me in the first consideration of any proposal for the expenditure of Irish money on any project is: How many young Irishmen will that project keep at work in our own country?  I have seen what the foreign vessels are doing.  That is one thing in favour of Deputy Russell's motion.  I have seen them going there for refitting every year and employment was not given by the B. &amp; I. or any one of them in this country.  They might give sops to Dublin but the port where they are earning their livelihood is being ignored.  These are the matters which concern me in regard to any proposition of this type and these are the basic grounds on which I judge them.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the motion.  I think there is a better hope of ensuring that all that type of work is carried out in this country if the ship is owned by Irishmen.  I am afraid, from what I have seen in the past 12 months in regard to Irish Shipping that that is a forlorn hope.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the majority of Deputies will be only too anxious to support this motion.  However, support in this House for the motion is not sufficient.  The fact that the Government would seem to have accepted the principle of the motion is not sufficient if we take into consideration the views expressed by the Minister for Transport and Power when he addressed himself to this motion last week.</P>
      <P>It may be that the Government have decided that it would be advisable for the sake of peace in the House to appear to accept the motion but it would be desirable that the House and the country should know as soon as possible what actual steps are being taken to implement the suggestions in the motion.  The contribution last week from the Minister for Transport and Power was very enlightening, especially when he commented on our cross-Channel services with particular reference to the carrying of Irish people as tourists to and from Britain.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power referring to the possibility of an Irish company or an Irish group getting into the cross-Channel business pointed out as reported at column 191 of the Official Report of 10th instant: &ldquo;If we were to take part in carrying passengers we must be certain that we shall be able to generate more passenger traffic that does not exist now and not merely make passenger traffic generally more pleasant for the existing traffic.&rdquo;  That view is very enlightening.  It discloses the mentality of the Minister for Transport and Power towards people who have to travel between Ireland and Britain.  I refer specifically to our emigrants.  To the Minister for Transport and Power and others in this House our emigrants on their way back from Britain to spend a few weeks with their parents and relations are tourists.  They are also described as tourists by this statutory body known as Bord Fáilte.  Make no mistake about it, the biggest percentage of the people who travel on the cross-Channel shipping between here and Britain are Irish people passing to and fro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> Whether we describe them as emigrants or potential tourists, one thing we must bear in mind is that they are Irish people and are entitled to travel under conditions which any civilised person would expect.  For the last eight or 10 weeks we have had a wailing and whinging about the conditions under which horses were exported from this country.  I wonder how many people in this House realise that during the month of December and early in January the thousands and thousands of Irish men, women and children who wish to return to Ireland on their holidays are forced to travel under the most shocking circumstances, crowding and so forth, on these cross-Channel services?</P>
    <P>We very seldom hear any word of criticism by any crackpot society in this or any other country, any comment on or criticism of the conditions aboard some of these boats.  But, of course, these people are only human beings.  What is more, they are only Irish human beings and, as such, they are at the tail of the queue for any amenities that may be going.  If we show so little responsibility for ensuring that there is a livelihood for our people here, the least we might do is to insist that when they have to travel out of the country or come back home on holidays they get decent travelling conditions.  If we are not able to bring the pressure of public opinion to bear on the shipping companies which have the monopoly of that service at the moment, then we have a duty ourselves to enter into that field in some way or other and provide the services ourselves.</P>
    <P>We certainly cannot allow to go unchallenged a statement of an alleged responsible Minister like the present Minister for Transport and Power that we are not concerned with making conditions pleasant for those who travel at the moment and that our aim, if we go into cross-Channel shipping, must be to ensure that we get a greater number of people travelling.  He brushes aside as of no consequence the conditions under which our people travel at the moment.  There is not the slightest doubt that the Minister for <Col N="536" /> Transport and Power has never in his life crossed on any of those boats during the peak periods of travel between here and Britain.  He has not a clue about the conditions, and it is time it were forcibly brought home to him in this House that now that he has responsibility as a Minister he should take active and practical steps to put an end to the shameful conditions that take place during peak periods of travel.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the export of our livestock to Britain.  It is no harm for us to realise now and again that one of the key factors in Irish agriculture and industry and in our economy generally over the years has been lack of organisation in marketing arrangements.  All along the line we have been lost for proper marketing and praper organisation to reach the market.  Our principal export outside of human beings is livestock, and it is a fact that cannot be challenged that the arrangements for the export of our livestock do not lie in the hands of Irish men and women. They do not lie under the control of people in this country.  I may say without any great danger of being contradicted that the arrangements for the export of our livestock are the responsibility of people outside this country.  Even so far as our fairs and marts are concerned, the actual buyers come directly from across Channel, purchase and make the necessary shipping arrangements right through to the destination.</P>
    <P>In the livestock question alone we have shown no genius for organisation or that we have the ability, if the necessity arose, to provide alternative means of transport for one of our most vital commodities.  We could have a strangehold placed on us tomorrow morning by these cross-Channel agents, so far as livestock is concerned, and we have no answer.  We are completely at their mercy.  We have accepted that position for the past 40 years.  It is not for me to suggest to the Government how they could have tackled that problem. If I were to suggest that a levy or tax over the years would have made available at this stage sufficient funds to allow us purchase control of <Col N="537" /> existing companies or purchase docking facilities across Channel, it would be said I was suggesting that a tax should be put on the heads of all the cattle we export.</P>
    <P>What I am really trying to emphasise is that no efforts whatever were made to leave us in an independent position if any difficulties arose.  If the aim of this country is to make progress in the future&mdash;and the outlook for the next few years is anything but bright&mdash;and if we are not practically to disappear as a people, our agricultural economy will have to be dynamically expanded and our industrial programme, based on agriculture, will have to be thoroughly overhauled and expanded accordingly.  That will mean that we must, at the minimum, treble or quadruple our exports of agricultural products or products based on agriculture.</P>
    <P>Are we going to be in a position to meet our requirements and have our independence at the same time if and when we reach that stage of development? Judging by the facilities available at the present time, I do not think we shall.  According as we expand in industry and agriculture&mdash;the advance so far has been very limited&mdash;the Government must make the necessary arrangements in regard to shipping, for the purpose of exports.  Therefore, not only should the motion receive approval, but practical steps must be taken as a matter of urgency to implement the suggestions contained therein.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support the motion to a great extent.  When I read it this evening I did not intend to contribute to the debate but, having heard some of the speeches here to-night, I consider that it would be a shame not to comment on the motion and, perhaps, on some of the speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry wants to make sure that we have ships and that we would have the means to compel people who would be importing goods to this country to put their cargoes into those ships.  Does it ever strike Deputy Corry that the British, who buy our cattle, could retaliate and say: &ldquo;We want you to put the cattle into British <Col N="538" /> ships&rdquo;?  There should be a more realistic approach to the motion.  If it were possible for us to take over all the ships that, say, British Railways own, we should ask ourselves would they be a paying proposition or would we be taking on another C.I.E.?  It is not enough for us to have ships with the Irish flag on them, to have them leaving Irish ports for British ports with livestock or passengers.  What guarantee would we have that British Railways would meet us and provide the facilities to carry away the passengers and the livestock?  I have been over this course.  I have seen independent ships go into places where British Railways had control and British Railways' ships got the first of the wagons for the livestock and the first of the trains for their goods, and British Railways were right.  We deeply resent that they should do that but I know what we would do if we had the reins in our hands.</P>

      <P>If they are in competition and there are only sufficient buses to take half the passengers away, you can guess the half that will be taken, whether they be the passengers carried by B.O.A.C. or those carried by Aer Lingus.  I am in favour of this country having a certain number of ships, not for the purpose that Deputy Corry suggests, of trying to provide employment in the dockyards in Cobh, and not for the purpose suggested by Deputy Wycherley, of container traffic, but for the purpose of having a little orderly competition at times, for no other purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wycherley said here to-night that container traffic will not be handled at Dublin port.  It has been <Col N="539" /> suggested in the House and in the country that container traffic is the solution to all problems.  Container traffic is handled at the ports of Waterford and Rosslare.  If anyone wants to send goods in containers to any destination in Great Britain, the facilities are available.</P>
    <P>In regard to passenger traffic, there are passengers who come into Dublin and passengers who come into Rosslare from Fishguard.  Passengers used to come into the port of Waterford but that is no longer the case.  Gentlemen came over some time ago from Great Britain and told us that they were losing a great deal of money on the passenger traffic into Waterford and that if that traffic were abolished and the boats used for container traffic it might be possible to make the boats pay.  Waterford Harbour Commissioners and the Waterford Corporation met the representatives of British Railways.  I was a member of these two bodies that agreed to that.  I am very sorry that we did agree to it.  We agreed to it under pressure.  The pressure was this&mdash;they appeared to intend to take their traffic out of the port altogether.  The reason that they had used the port was that there was a British Act of Parliament that compelled the Great Western Railway to continue its service in Waterford, as a result of which the Great Western Railway was allowed to open Rosslare. The agreement was that they should have a daily service out of Waterford. They got out of the daily service owing to the fact that during the economic war there was nothing to carry in or out of the country and they were able to plead that they were losing so much money that a three-day service would be justified.  It was agreed that they could operate a three-day service.</P>
    <P>We come down to the present day. The Minister in charge at that time was the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is now the Taoiseach. Instead of the Minister standing over the Waterford Harbour Commissioners and the Waterford Corporation at that time and pointing out to British Railways that their action would be a breach of a British Act of Parliament, <Col N="540" /> he did what his successor, the Minister for Transport and Power, is doing tonight.  He was not so much interested.  We were left there.  It was that lack of support from the Government and from the Minister of the day that put British Railways in a position to abandon the passenger traffic.</P>
    <P>The Waterford port knows the value of the cross-Channel trade.  We do not talk about it as if it were stinking fish.  It is well that we have ships to take our produce away.  When a ship was taken from Cork recently, they were hoping somebody would put a ship back again, whether it would be the Government or somebody else.  When we have ships coming into our ports owned by British companies&mdash;not by Russians&mdash; by people who purchase most of our commodities from us we should be careful about what we do.  We have a reasonable balance of trade position with Britain now as we also had in the past, and if the Government could say our overall trading position was as good as it has been with Britain in the past few years we would be all right.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have shown a great preference here for Continental countries and are very anxious to do business with them even though we can only sell them £1 million or £2 million worth while we buy £10 million or £12 million worth from them.  When the final balance of trade figures are available at the end of this financial year it will be shown that Britain is the market we should look after.  If we are sending our commodities to Britain, I agree with Deputy Russell that we should, as he said, try to secure a substantial proportion of the cross-Channel trade.  I would be satisfied with even a reasonable proportion of it rather than a substantial proportion.  If we are going to sell most of our agricultural produce to Britain there should not be such great objection to sending it over in British ships.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to passenger services.  I have no brief for the B. &amp; I. or anybody else but their boats are under <Col N="541" /> great pressure in the summer season while in winter these enormous boats, costing up to £1 million, are lying up earning no money.  I should not like to see the Irish Government having to suffer that situation; that would not be to our advantage.  I am sure Ministers for Finance and Deputies are sufficiently shattered by the losses on C.I.E. without piling up more losses.  It is not true to say nothing was done by anybody to endeavour to provide boats to carry our produce to Great Britain. The Staffords of Wexford built fine ships before the War and they traded from Irish ports to Birkenhead, obviously because the cattle were destined for Birkenhead and actually going to market in Birkenhead.  They went also to Fishguard and other ports, but mainly to Birkenhead because if there were big offerings from the other shipping companies, say, the Great Western at the time, the Great Western waggons would be given to them.  So far as the Minister who is here in place of the Minister for Transport and Power is concerned, I need not dwell very much on that because he would know about it.</P>
    <P>A good deal of the overcrowding at Dún Laoghaire is due to the way traffic is routed from England.  If a passenger asks for a ticket to Ireland he is routed through Dublin, even though the boats are crammed and even though there may be room on the Rosslare or other boats.  I went to an office in London supported by funds from this House and I heard a man saying he wanted to go to Ireland.  He was routed through Dublin at a time when, perhaps, he had to stand all night.  It served him right when he did not look up his geography.  The clerk inside the counter, sent over from this country, was not serving this country or serving the other ports; he was just sending passengers into Dublin.</P>
    <P>This motion deserves the full consideration of the Minister.  He should be here and should see that the whole matter is investigated and a report made to the House.  The report might not be as rosy as many Deputies think but it should say whether the Government would be prepared to go into cross-Channel shipping in a reasonable <Col N="542" /> way so that they would be able, at times, to create competition in freight rates&mdash;something nobody mentioned tonight&mdash;and in order that we might have a portion of the pool of shipping.  I do not know who directs or looks after repairs to these boats but the fact that they would be under the control of the Irish Government is no guarantee that they would be refitted in Irish shipyards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying briefly to the debate and particularly to the remarks of the Minister for Transport and Power I am glad to learn that the Government have no opposition to my motion in principle.  This motion was originally put down about two years ago and I suggested that the substance of the motion received substantial support from the findings of the tribunal set up by the Minister's predecessor to inquire into cross-Channel freights.  Among recommendations made by that tribunal was the suggestion that this country should obtain an interest in cross-Channel shipping.  Two years ago the then Minister went even further by saying that some action in respect of the extension of Irish control of shipping was proceeding and that he did not intend that that action should be impeded in any way by the fact that the inquiry was taking place.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, in his contribution to this debate, gave no indication whatever that anything had been done over the past two-and-a-quarter years to substantiate the trenchant statement made by the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, in October, 1957.  At that time I certainly got the impression that the whole question of extending Irish control of cross-Channel passenger and goods traffic was receiving the active and positive attention of the Government.  As we have received no statement in this House during the past two years to indicate the outcome of these negotiations I for one must come to the conclusion that the whole matter was largely a blind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the fact that to take an <Col N="543" /> interest in the present shipping services would be a very difficult and possibly very expensive affair but, as the terms of my motion suggest, I thought it advisable in present circumstances that we, allegedly at least an independent economic unit, should have some measure of control over one of the life lines of traffic, our cross-Channel shipping service.  I suggested the matter was of such importance that the Government itself might institute an enquiry and report to this House in due course.  The Minister in the course of his contribution said:</P>
    <P>I see no purpose in investing money in any existing undertaking unless we can be sure that freight costs will come down.</P>
    <P>He went on to say then:</P>
    <P>If we were to take part in carrying passengers we must be certain that we generate more passenger traffic... not merely make passenger traffic generally more pleasant for the existing traffic.</P>
    <P>If that standard had been applied to a number of undertakings in which this country has invested substantial sums of money over the past 25 or 30 years, a lot of this investment would never have taken place.  I find it strange that the Government has not been activated to a greater extent in seeing in what way we could share in this enormous cross-Channel business which has been going on between the two countries since the middle of the last century.  It should not be forgotten that the concentration of the ownership of virtually the whole of the cross-Channel trade mainly in British hands is an evolution that has taken place over the past century.  During the last century there was a number of small Irish-owned cross-Channel shipping companies which operated from a number of the Irish ports particularly in the West of Ireland.  Due to changing circumstances such as the building of the railways and the development of larger British shipping interests these were either crushed out or bought out and the present system evolved where the entire control and carriage of cross-Channel trade is in the hands of <Col N="544" /> British-owned companies of which two, British Railways and Coast Lines own by far the substantial part.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Lynch it seems senseless to invest in an undertaking that is obviously losing money, and indeed the Minister in his statement made a somewhat similar point, that if we could not bring down the costs of cross-Channel trade we should not invest in it at all.  If we do not exercise some measure of control over this vital link, have we any assurance costs will not continue to go up as they have been going up particularly in recent years?  It is well to remember it was the increasing costs, eight increases in succession, that galvanised the previous Minister, Deputy Lemass, into instituting the enquiry into cross-Channel freight.  That enquiry has been made.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the motion to set up this tribunal the Minister promised us that when the facts were known action would be taken.  These facts have been known for the past nine months.  I should like some indication from the Minister as to what action he proposes to take.  As the Minister rightly said, we are living in an era of change and no change has been more rapid than that in transport.  Undoubtedly in a few years' time new methods of cross-Channel shipping services will be developed.  As an indication of the possible developments it is no harm to remember that a year or two ago a company in the Six Counties set up a cross-Channel ferry service which is now running very satisfactorily.  Another one was set up and was, within a short space of time, taken over by British Railways to ensure that its effective competition would be completely nullified.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can wait for the existing cross-Channel shipping companies to introduce new types of cross-Channel service which would compete and compete very severely with their own shipping lines.  It would be too much to hope that any service would deliberately underwrite an alternative service which would heavily reduce its income.  If this ferry service, which could be developed between Great Britain and Ireland, is to be established <Col N="545" /> and be run efficiently we must take the initiative.  The costs of providing a ferry service are far lower than the building of conventional cross-Channel liners, and the Government might at least investigate the cost of going into this trade.  The costs of acquiring the necessary facilities would be far lower than trying to establish the conventional type of liner, and if we could not link up with the British railways system on the other side we would be able to link up with the many road haulage contractors over there.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say: &ldquo;Let the British run the service as long as it does not pay,&rdquo; but it has happened in the past and it is not too ridiculous to imagine that it might happen in the future, that our interests and the interests of Britain might not be coincidental. In that case I should like some of the Deputies who advocate leaving things as they are to tell me whose interests would be served if the British interests clashed with ours and we were left completely at the mercy of British carriers.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes forgotten that the trade done on this cross-Channel route is very substantial.  The total trade over the past seven years in goods between Great Britain and Ireland has averaged in value between £170,000,000 and £180,000,000, and some million and a half passengers have travelled annually backwards and forward on this route.  This is a tremendous undertaking in which we should take a greater part and even if it does not show a direct profit, there certainly must be substantial indirect profits made by people who service these ships and the railways that tie up with the ships.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the percentage content of transport, particularly on the shipping routes, is about 10 per cent. of the total costs of the goods concerned.  If this is true there must be something between £15,000,000 and £17,000,000 paid from year to year to these carrier companies. Some of this money finds its way into repairs and maintenance almost entirely on the other side of the Channel.  If this country had some participating interest in these services <Col N="546" /> a good deal of that money would be spent on this side of the Channel.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest also that in any development of this nature there should be a joint operation between this State and the Six Counties.  We live in the one country and on both sides of the Border we have problems in common which should be an encouragement to Governments on both sides to join together and provide an efficient and up-to-date service between this country and Britain.  Whatever political developments take place, we must continue to trade with Great Britain, and I would like to think that that trade will be to the benefit of the people on both sides of the Channel.  If it is, one of the vital necessities for this country is that we should be able to provide a shipping service which will be cheap and efficient and available at all times, whether run at a profit or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That in view of the failure of the use of compulsion in regard to the language revival to appreciably further the objective of making the Irish language the spoken language of the people, and of the apparent growing disquiet and dissatisfaction among responsible authorities and among parents and pupils alike about compulsory methods, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should seek by means of a public referendum to ascertain whether a majority of the people would favour the replacement of compulsory methods, where used in the attempted revival of the language, by voluntary schemes for its encouragement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is moved in the earnest belief that even if we do not achieve our main objective of having the present methods of the attempted language revival altered, we shall have contributed something to the whole question of the revival because, by having this debate, Deputies will have an <Col N="547" /> opportunity of taking stock of what has been done, to see the position as it is, to justify the stands they have taken, to discuss the policies in which they believe and contribute, if we can, something towards changing the present system in whatever way we think it should be changed to further the revival of the language.  In doing that we shall have achieved something.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any doubts in the minds of Deputies that the language movement over the past 40 years and the methods used to further the revival have been a complete failure.  On all sides we have disquiet and dissatisfaction amongst people who are interested, amongst the responsible authorities, amongst the parents and the pupils, about compulsory methods.  I hope to be able to substantiate the points included in our motion&mdash;that there is disquiet and dissatisfaction on a very wide scale.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties which each incoming generation has to face is the attempt by their predecessors to impose their will on their successors. This happens in medicine, in architecture, in engineering and in most of the professions; it happens probably more than anywhere else in politics.  In saying that I wish to make it quite clear that I am fully conscious of the fact that the attempts made by our predecessors to revive the language were made with the express intention of trying to carry out what they believed to be a great ideal for our society.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that they must reconcile themselves to the fact that their 40 years of effort have been largely fruitless.  I do not believe that it is possible to revive the language in our present circumstances as the vernacular of the people.  I think the only thing that can be done is, possibly, to preserve it and perhaps extend it gradually in the future.  I get no particular satisfaction from the realisation that in the effort to achieve the main objectives of our predecessors&mdash;which, as I see them, were the end of Partition, the revival of the language and to create a prosperous society in which there would be social <Col N="548" /> justice for all&mdash;we have not been successful.  That is, to me, a sad thought.</P>
    <P>I believe that we have failed to achieve any one of these objectives and I believe that that failure, to a considerable extent, is due to the fact that these three factors were inevitably interwoven in many ways.  There was an economic factor in the question of the revival of the language and I think that these other political considerations which were not taken into account by our political leaders at the time, by the idealists who were anxious to achieve the most desirable objective of all, the creation of an Irish-speaking united Ireland, were the cause of our failure.  I think that one ideal conflicted with the other in the particular circumstances in which we found ourselves.  I think our leaders mistook the ideal for the reality.</P>
    <P>They forgot the fact that, as a result of occupation for some centuries, our people had become practically completely English-speaking. Their task therefore was a phenomenal one.  It was an almost impossible task and I do not think it was because of any particular lack of zeal on their part that they failed.  I think that, faced with the reality of trying to get 3,000,000 people who spoke English to conduct their business, their home affairs, their religious duties and their political activities through the medium of the Irish language, to expect them voluntarily to accept the upheaval in their private, personal and public lives which that would entail, was expecting too much.  They gave the majority of the people the credit for having their own ideas, for having their own sense of intense patriotism or nationalism or anything you like.  In that, I think they made grave miscalculations.</P>
    <P>I believe the people might voluntarily learn the language.  They decided they would not depend on this voluntary factor.  They were right there but they were wrong when they decided that the correct method was to try to compel the people by various ways&mdash;sanctions, bribes, outright compulsion&mdash;to learn the language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> In my view, no matter which way you tried in the then circumstances, the language could not have been revived as the vernacular of our people no matter who attempted it and no matter what methods they used.  To maintain and gradually to extend it was probably the only reasonably attainable objective.</P>
    <P>We must recall that at that time one-fourth of our people did not want even the physical unity of the country and still do not want it, with an English-speaking Ireland.  Of the three-quarters who did want physical unity, only a tiny minority of that three-quarters spoke fluent Irish. Therefore, that must be considered as one of the artificial impediments which those people who wanted to have a united Ireland were themselves attempting to create against the reality of reuniting the country.</P>
    <P>Whatever chance there was of our achieving unity with our Northern fellow-Irishmen in a united English-speaking Ireland, it seems transparently clear that there could be no hope whatsoever of achieving the unity of our country in a predominantly Irish-speaking society.</P>
    <P>It would seem reasonable for our fellow-Irishmen in the North to feel they would suffer ultimately the extinction of their cultures as they knew them by this preponderating part of the community speaking a language which they did not understand.  That, in association with their other objections on the religious grounds, seems to add to the difficulties of the ending of Partition.  Consequently, it does not seem that a sufficiently serious consideration was given to the whole matter at that time.</P>
    <P>It is conceivable that one might have had a predominantly Irish-speaking Republic in this part of the country but a united Irish-speaking society seems to be an unachievable objective.  It has been said, in regard to this question of 3,000,000 of our people speaking English, that that is one of the best arguments for compulsory methods for reviving the language, the idea being that because we learned English compulsorily we <Col N="550" /> would learn Irish compulsorily.</P>
    <P>The fallacy there lies in the fact that we learned English primarily because it meant an escape from poverty and depression, an opportunity to get out of the country and to get into a society in which it might be possible for us to earn a living at that time.  That pertains to quite a considerable extent still, to my knowledge of the Gaeltacht areas in the West of Ireland.  I know of many people whose attitude is: &ldquo;I want to learn English.  It is the only way I can get a job.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anybody who has read the figures &mdash;to which I shall refer later&mdash;of the depopulation of the Gaeltacht areas, particularly of the Western Gaeltacht, must have a certain sympathy with these people because they were not taught English so that they would be able to earn their living more easily in London where they have had to find work in the sewers, on road works, in underground tunnels, and in various other places as unskilled navvies and labourers.</P>
    <P>That is not fiction.  That is not a creation of my own imagination.  It has happened in the case of a man with whom I have very close association in relation to his son, a secondary schoolboy who knew no English in the Gaeltacht.  He went to London and, in order to start getting any kind of labouring work, he was humiliated to find he had to start learning English first.  His father is an enthusiast.  He is a member of the Gaeltacht and a great believer in the language.  He is very bitter because his son was placed in that position.</P>
    <P>It seems, therefore, that the economic factor enters into the question of the revival policy.  If some attempt had been made&mdash;I think that is the third factor&mdash;for the creation of prosperity, if some more effective attempt had been made to stem emigration, to provide employment on a large scale and to facilitate people to remain in rural Ireland and, in particular, in the Gaeltacht areas, it is conceivable that we might have been able to retain a greater pool of the spoken language and from that those of us who live on the East side might <Col N="551" /> gradually have been able to learn to speak the language.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry has given notice of his intention to raise the subject matter of two questions on the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this matter for the sake of those whom we must consider, after all, the backbone of the community, the ordinary small tillage farmers who, year by year are being gradually wiped out.  On the one hand we have appeals for increased production and, on the other hand, if we produce more we are either fined as in wheat or told that it is not wanted.  Last week I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce: &ldquo;If he will state (1) the total number of tons of sugar exported either as sugar chocolate crumb or other sweet products to Britain in 1959, (2) the total duty charged and the total levy paid to British customs in respect of such exports.&rdquo;  The Minister's reply to parts (1) and (2) was that the information was not available.  I cannot view a reply of that description with anything but amazement and sympathy, sympathy for a Department of State and a Minister who cannot find that much information&mdash; information that was available to me in ten minutes in the Sugar Company's office as a member of the Beet Growers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reply for the Minister's information to the two questions is as follows: &ldquo;the total number of tons exported was 34,000 tons; the levy and duty paid to Britain for the privilege of sending that in was £855,000. Part (3) of the Question was &ldquo;how the position in this regard compares with that relative to similar exports from Australia, South Africa, Jamaica and other countries to Britain&rdquo; and (4) &ldquo;whether these countries receive any special treatment which places them <Col N="552" /> in a better position in regard to exports of sugar or sugar goods than this country.&rdquo;  The Minister's reply was: &ldquo;As regards parts (3) and (4), Irish-manufactured sugar and goods containing sugar receive the same treatment on entering Britain as similar goods manufactured in countries of the British Commonwealth; but I understand that similar goods from the British Colonies receive somewhat more favourable treatment.&rdquo;  Again, I can only view with alarm the ignorance displayed in the Minister's Department in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can attribute the ignorance to me; I am quite happy to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that Commonwealth countries, Australia, for example, have special treatment with regard to a guaranteed market and price under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.  The Australians, I am sure, would be very annoyed to be called a colony.  They are receiving £54 a ton for their sugar as compared with our £40.  As I pointed out, between duty and levy we pay 22/6 on a 40/- article, that is over 52 or 53 per cent.</P>
      <P>Today I endeavoured to find out the position regarding the imports of biscuits, which contain large quantities of sugar, bakery products, syrup, molasses, glucose, sugar syrups and sugar preparations from Britain, and I asked the Minister if he intended to take any steps to place those two imports in the same position as exports of sugar and chocolate crumb have been placed by the British, which is a fair question.  In reply the Minister explained that Irish-manufactured sugar and goods containing sugar receive the same treatment on entering Britain as similar goods manufactured in countries of the British Commonwealth.  The only sugar more favourably treated on entering Britain was that produced in the British Colonies.  In the circumstances the question of taking action did not arise.  I also asked the Minister for Finance the position regarding the import&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That Question does not arise on the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I wish to use it in view of the Minister's statement here, in regard to our sugar getting the same treatment as similar goods manufactured in the British Commonwealth, that no occasion arises for any special duty on those.  If you take even one article, molasses, for example, it is imported into this country free of duty.  We pay over 50 per cent. on the molasses imported into Britain.  That is one example. It is a joke that we import molasses here for an Irish industry and at the same time have to export to Britain and pay over 50 per cent. on what we export.  The same applies to glucose which has only a 25 per cent. duty as compared with 52 per cent. on our exports of sugar and chocolate crumb.</P>
      <P>The whole of this can be met in one way.  The Minister in reply to me last week said that the import of sugar is engaged in only when Irish producers are not in a position to supply the beet.  That is at Column 25 of the Official Report of 10th February, 1960.  Today he told us something different. He told us that our price was too high for sugar and that cane sugar produced by the Cubans is cheaper than ours.  Naturally it is considering that the Jamaicans get £14 a ton more for their imports into Britain of sugar than what we get.</P>
      <P>It boils down to this.  You had for the past 12 months an import of some 64,000 tons of foreign sugar cane costing the people of this country £2,000,000 to import it.  You had an offer from old satisfactory growers of beet this year of 96,000 acres of which 66,000 acres was taken leaving 30,000 acres of beet which the small farmer was prepared to produce but had to be refused a market for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would more than cover the £2 million that we pay for foreign sugar and it would be £2 million in the pockets of our farmers.  My reason for raising the matter in this manner is to appeal to the Minister to take this question in hands.  Surely we are in a position to negotiate.  There is some <Col N="554" /> £3 million or £4 million worth of agricultural machinery imported into this country.  There we have a bargaining factor&mdash;something that we farmers are buying plus the duty in order to keep our Irish industries going here.  I object to no duty that is going to keep our Irish industries going but I object to differentiation as between one industry and another.  The Minister is very fond of making this statement: &ldquo;The Government is actively seeking access to foreign markets&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not exactly a quotation.  It is a Government statement. I suggest this is a case of that description.  This is a case where we have an opportunity.  The opportunity is there for us to put £2 million into the pockets of our handicapped farmers who provide the only outlet there is for agricultural labour today, namely, beet.  The opportunity is there and if I know the Minister he is a man who is prepared to take advantage of it.  The chance is there and if we get to work on it it will take very little effort.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the general manager of the Sugar Company&mdash;I questioned him on this&mdash;that expanding both in Thurles and Mallow would mean that he could take in an extra 500 tons of beet a day.  That would meet the whole question undoubtedly. What we are asking the Minister to do is to get rid of that £14 a ton differential which exists between Irish sugar and Irish sugar products going into Britain and the products of the Commonwealth countries. I suggest that we have bargaining power enough to get that.  If he does, it will mean a big chance in so far as the agricultural community is concerned.</P>

    <P>It was only in 1958 that I tramped every parish in the counties of Cork <Col N="555" /> and Kerry at the request and with the help and assistance of the Irish Sugar Company endeavouring to induce farmers to increase their acreage of beet.  Apparently, we were too successful. If this is not done, let me hear nobody in this House again from any Party of politicians talk about looking for more production from the farmers. The opportunity is there&mdash;it stares us in the face&mdash;to get rid of the import of sugar cane.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minister stating today that the reason for the import of sugar cane was that it would be more economic than the Irish sugar.  I remember only a few years ago&mdash;I think it would be about 1955&mdash;that we imported 75,000 tons of foreign sugar at £12 a ton higher than the best Irish sugar leaving the Irish factories. That could happen again in twelve months.  If God spares the Russian to start trouble it will be the only thing that will be any good for the farmers today.  It is a hard thing to say that we have to depend upon war or rumours of war to get a market for our produce.</P>
    <P>I want to be reasonable.  I think I made an honest case to the Minister on this matter&mdash;a case that can give him an opportunity of working.  In this matter I can guarantee him both the co-operation of the Beet Growers' Association and of the Irish Sugar Company because, thank God, there is one place where you can have co-operation.</P>
    <P>Statements were made here today in connection with the beet acreage given to the big growers.  I had a list of 85 beet growers in my district. Every case was enquired into and each one of them got an average normal acreage for the past three years.  They were not 20 acre growers or even ten acre growers but one and half acre and two acre growers.  I am prepared to hand the list to Deputy Corish if he wants it.  Let me hear no more talk about the big fellow being well looked after and that the small fellow is being let down.</P>

      <P>I can only say, with regard to the case Deputy Corry made, that it is very easy to make such a good case if one only uses the facts which suit it but, when he is replying to such a case, a Minister has to have regard to all the facts.  In the first instance, he accused me and my Department of ignorance because we did not go to the immense trouble involved in answering, not the question which he seems to have answered <Col N="557" /> today about the export of sugar, but the question he put down regarding the total number of tons of sugar, chocolate crumb and other products exported to Britain in 1959.  That information was not readily available to the Department and I did not consider it worthwhile to send officials looking for these figures which would occupy several hours of their time at considerable public expense.  However, Deputy Corry has done it for me.  He had gone to his friends in Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and got these figures.</P>

      <P>I shall go down to the Library and get them for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering what was the necessity for his raising the question with me when he could do that.  Again, I would like him to bring this matter back to a basis of reality.  The Irish Sugar Company produces sugar from home-grown beet and from raw sugar imported. The sugar they produce from home-grown beet costs a considerable amount more than the sugar they can produce from the imported raw commodity. The amount of beet they take is related to the amount of sugar required for the home market, and also to their existing capacity to produce sugar in their present factories.</P>
      <P>The raw sugar they import is processed and can be sold at a much cheaper price.  Sugar is consumed both by the ordinary public and by manufacturers of sugar products and if the manufacturers of sugar products had to pay a price based on the cost of beet they would not be able to compete in foreign markets.  If more home-grown beet were produced here, and if the sugar product producers were totally dependent on it, it would mean they would not be able to compete in foreign markets and possibly hundreds of people would be put out of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the levy imposed by the British Government on sugar imported into Britain.  That levy is roughly 16/4d. a cwt. and it applies to all sugar produced by this country, by other foreign countries, by commonwealth countries, by colonies and by the British themselves, <Col N="558" /> so the suggestion the Deputy has made that the 16/4d. a cwt. is an additional burden on the Irish producer is not correct.  It is a burden imposed by the British on all producers of sugar whether home producers, commonwealth producers or colonial producers and is used, as the Deputy says, to help maintain the guaranteed price paid to commonwealth producers.  That guaranteed price is the result of an agreement made between Britain and commonwealth countries and there is nothing we can do about it.  We cannot tell the British to break their agreement with commonwealth countries as far as sugar prices are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is also a rate of duty for sugar and sugar goods imported into England.  That rate is 11/8d. full, and 5/8d. a cwt. preferential, and we have the advantage of the preferential rate whether for sugar as such or for the sugar contained in sugar products. There is also a duty on colonial products of 2.47d. per cwt. so it is not true for the Deputy to say that Irish sugar suffers a disadvantage which is not shared by sugar producers in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>A guaranteed price of £54 a ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a guaranteed price for commonwealth sugar, up to a maximum amount of 525,000 tons. This arrangement was not a breach of our Trade Agreement with Britain. The Foreign Trade Committee, who are experts in this matter, advised one of my predecessors that it was not a breach of that Agreement so there was nothing he or I could do about it, and to suggest there is something I can do is not correct.  That arrangement which the British made with commonwealth sugar producers is not a breach of our Trade Agreement with Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish sugar factories have a certain output capacity and that output capacity is taken up by the amount of beet which produces the required amount of sugar for home consumption. The fact that the acreage has had to be reduced over the years has been caused by the greater productivity of Irish soil in the matter of beet production. <Col N="559" /> Figures supplied by the Irish Sugar Company show that 161,000 acres in 1946 produced the same quantity of sugar as 95,000 acres in 1947 and as 68,000 acres in 1959.  It was for that reason that the Irish Sugar Company had to ration beet acreage and that ration was based on a normal acreage turn-over&mdash;on the average grown in 1956, 1957 and 1958, an average that was unanimously agreed to by the representatives of the beet growers, of whom Deputy Corry is a very prominent member.  In fact, I think he is the chairman and in that context I repeat the word &ldquo;unanimously&rdquo;. To the extent that there is any complaint that the acreage of beet has been reduced to individual farmers it is caused by the greater productivity from Irish soil and a result of the agreement made unanimously with the Sugar Company by <Col N="560" /> the elected representatives of the beet growers themselves.</P>
    <P>If we wanted to use more sugar in this country there is an obvious way of doing it&mdash;rather, I should say, if we wanted to grow more beet for conversion into sugar.  Sugar beet growers get a guaranteed price for a certain acreage, an acreage sufficient to meet home demands for sugar but, if they wanted to produce more, then there would be an obligation on them to produce it at world prices so as to enable us to maintain our exports and to be competitive with those who export into Britain either sugar or sugar products.</P>
