      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 8 (Vote 43), 9 and 10.  If not already reached it is proposed to interrupt business at 2 p.m. to take No. 10, and when finished to resume the order.</P>
      <P>I should perhaps explain that this being the last day of the financial year, some complications may arise if Supplementary Estimate No. 43 is not passed today.  I am not quite sure what the position would be if it failed to pass today, and I propose to look into it.  It may be that the only practical course would be to move to sit late if the Estimate were not completed today.  However, I undertake to look into the matter and communicate with the Whips later.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for Grants to Universities and Colleges, including certain Grants-in-Aid.&rdquo;&mdash; (Minister for Education.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one final reference to the situation regarding the possibilities of integrating at some future stage Trinity College and the National University.  My comment arises as a result of a statement published on to-day's paper attributed to the Home Secretary in the House of Commons yesterday where, in a message to the Six County Government, he stated: &ldquo;Your Border is our Border and your soil is our soil.&rdquo;  If the speeches made in this House are correctly understood, it would appear that many Deputies who oppose the integration of these two Universities, even in 20, 30 or 40 years' time, believe that the Border around the Six Counties should be extended to include Trinity College as well.  I am sure Deputies reject and repudiate any such <Col N="1475" /> audacious claim on the part of Mr. Butler.</P>
      <P>We should also reject and repudiate the suggestion that Trinity College should now be regarded as outside the scope of Irish nationalism and Irish life.  That institution produced great patriots and great Irishmen in the past, irrespective of whatever mentality governed it.  I feel that, whether a decision is taken now or in the near future to integrate these two Universities, it will still produce its quota of great Irishmen for the benefit of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>I suggested last night it was my duty and the duty of every back-bencher to speak in this debate, if only for the purpose of arousing public interest in what I would describe as a <i>fait accompli.</i>  There is a dangerous apathy outside the House, a feeling of &ldquo;I-could-not-care-less&rdquo; as far as this measure is concerned.  That is a sad commentary on the public outlook and it bodes ill for the country.  But even worse is the subdued atmosphere among Deputies themselves.  When you meet them in the corridors, and discuss this matter with them they suggest &ldquo;What is the use of talking about it? It is all over.  The decision has been taken.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not repeat myself on that aspect of the matter except to say the Universities should be the home of democracy.  They should teach how precious democracy is.  That should be their aim.  Instead of that, from the example given by the authorities of the National University, it would appear that they have nothing but contempt for this democratic institution here when they presumed seven or eight years ago to go ahead with this scheme without the sanction of the people.  The proposals and plans outlined in the red Booklet produced by the University authorities are more like some obscure imagining of ancient Greek scholars than the product of modern alert minds.  In my opinion, the Minister acted first and then decided to think afterwards.  He should have given full consideration to the problem he mentioned in the course of his long and detailed speech <Col N="1476" /> as reported at Column 932 of the Official Debates, dealing with the five medical schools and the engineering schools.  He said:</P>
    <P>We could probably therefore do better and less expensively with a lesser number of medical and civil engineering schools, but the question would be which College or Colleges would be prepared to give up its school.</P>
    <P>He asked that question at the same time as he is giving authority to University College, Dublin, to remove itself, bag and baggage&mdash;every Faculty concerned&mdash;out to Belfield.</P>
    <P>Would it not be commonsense to decide now how many medical schools we need, how many engineering schools we need, and where we are to place them?  Having decided that on a rational basis, we could then decide whether or not University College, Dublin, needed the wide expanse at Belfield.  That would be the action of a Minister who had freedom of action but I believe the Minister is being used.  I have the greatest personal respect for the Minister but he is being used as a rubber stamp in this instance.</P>
    <P>At the same column in the Official Debates, the Minister is reported as referring to the position existing amongst architects.  He said that there is a certain amount of emigration amongst architects, of whom 25 or more are produced annually, about 20 from University College, Dublin, and five from Bolton Street College of Technology.  There is an admission that we have the University and Bolton Street producing architects and at the same time, we have the position that the Minister himself admits that there is a link between the vocational school system and the Universities.</P>
    <P>He referred to the fact that this was brought home to him as a result of what he described as a consultation held last November in Paris by O.E.E.C.  The excellent group of experts there pointed out to the Irish educational representatives that there was no opportunity in Ireland for the gifted technical student to obtain his University degree in the particular <Col N="1477" /> subject in which he was interested and the Irish Government were asked to remedy that position.</P>
    <P>Is it not the position to-day that a great proportion of our youth who are getting anything more than a primary education are getting it in our technical schools?  However, they will still be prevented from getting the opportunity of taking out their degrees, even if we give this money to U.C.D. to move out to Belfield.  There is no suggestion that provision will then be made for them as a result of the extra space available.  Only a few months ago, a motion was moved in this House calling on the Government to extend the school-leaving age so that our young people might get an opportunity of technical training, of an extended course in primary schools, or of a secondary education even in a limited way.  The Government accepted the principle of that and the Taoiseach himself came into this House and said they were in agreement with the proposal to provide further education for the youth but that they were up against big difficulties. I agree the difficulties are big and I do not suggest they can be solved overnight, but I think they should be first conquered as a priority measure, rather than that we should do what we are doing here to-day.  We are surmounting many difficulties in this field of education but we are ignoring the foundations.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the position with regard to University College, Galway.  I made a brief reference last night to the desirability of stopping the trek to Dublin by enlarging and improving the constituent Colleges in Cork and Galway. I understand that the Minister received a deputation yesterday from certain interests in Galway city and county in connection with an appeal for the Faculty of Agriculture in U.C.G.  This is the second deputation the Minister has received within the past three weeks and I think these deputations have not considered their cases properly before approaching the Minister.</P>
    <P>I believe that U.C.G. is at the disposal of all Connacht, portion of the <Col N="1478" /> southern counties and over as far as the midlands, and if any deputation is to be received by the Minister, it should be representative of all the counties of Connacht, and perhaps some of the Munster counties, so that the widest and strongest possible case will be made.  I take a very dim view of a few people setting themselves up in Galway city and county as the representatives of that entire province. It is only in their own minds that they are so representative.</P>
    <P>There is very strong criticism with regard to some of these people who will not consult the proper authorities and public bodies in the other counties concerned, but, in spite of all that, I support strongly the proposal to make a complete Faculty of Agriculture available in Galway.  At a time when agriculture is looked upon as our primary industry, such a proposal should receive the greatest possible consideration from the Government. We are lacking in graduates in horticulture, agriculture and various aspects of farming and the opportunity is ripe for the Minister to take action.  In my opinion, this subject should have been part of the examination prior to the decision which is the subject of this debate.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to pay a tribute to <i>Tuairim</i> for the very excellent booklet they produced and for the first-class help they gave Deputies in making available the fund of information which they took so much pains to gather.  It is an excellent production and one that should have helped Deputies on all sides of the House because it is non-political. Although the people who are identified with <i>Tuairim</i> have no association whatever with me and possibly look the other way politically, it does not take away from the fact that they have performed an excellent service for the community.  I join with other Deputies in condemning those who have suggested that the people who performed that service were nosey-parkers, busybodies sticking their noses into something that did not concern them.  Of course it concerns them.  They are the younger generation in this State.</P>
    <P>As has been suggested elsewhere, <Col N="1479" /> there is a fresh wind blowing in more places than in Africa.  I hope it blows much stronger than the wind blowing here and that it will blow many cobwebs out of the minds of people inside and outside this House.  I would prefer that it should blow the cobwebs from their minds than that the breeze would become so strong that it would blow these people out of existence.</P>
    <P>The discussion here has been on a non-Party basis and I cannot understand why a decision is not left to a free vote of the House.  I appeal finally to the Minister that the decision on this matter, which will affect every future generation, should be left to the consciences of each individual Deputy, that the Whips should be left off and that Deputies should express their belief as to the correct solution for this problem.  I would ask the Minister to consider that plea and, even at this late stage, allow a free vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have my few words on this matter, just as other Deputies have had theirs.  Up to the time that Deputy MacCarthy spoke I was quite satisfied that there was need for extra accommodation in University College, Dublin, but I do think that the suggestion that he made, that students in the various Faculties should be allowed to do their first year course in secondary schools, should be considered.  I do not know the amount of accommodation that would make available but I imagine that it would be a great deal.  The Commission, that we are told is to be set up, might very well consider that suggestion and it might possibly solve the question of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until I heard Deputy MacCarthy, I had been going on the assumption that a change was necessary.  I cannot see any case for it whatever.  I have read all the documents.  I have read the report of the Commission.  I have read the case made by the U.C.D. authorities. I have read the <i>Tuairim</i> Report. The case made against moving in the <i>Tuairim</i> Report is almost unanswerable. If the University authorities wished, they could easily build sufficient <Col N="1480" /> accommodation to provide for their immediate needs.  There is plenty of space available now that was not available when they were reporting. Even if Harcourt Street Station were not available they could easily get other places.  I cannot understand what objection there is to compulsory acquisition for a purpose like that.  I cannot see it.</P>
    <P>The first consideration ought to be the interests of the students.  That is being entirely neglected in all this matter.  A central city location is certainly the most suitable.  Whatever about people living in the Donnybrook area for whom the Belfield site might be all right, the big majority of students come from other parts of the city.  I have lived on the North side for years.  If my family had to go from the North side to Belfield, I do not know how many miles from the present college the journey would involve, but I imagine it would be five or six miles.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it.  Even if it is only two miles, it means more bus fares, more time spent in travelling, more expense generally, which would bear more and more heavily on the less well-off people.  I can see no case whatever for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering what has become of the plan that was suggested by the Government when I was a member of it.  I wonder were we driven away from our plans by the rotten propaganda of the Coalition when they spread the idea that we had decided to pull down half the city and build Government buildings around here, although they knew very well, and had a document to prove, that we had dropped that idea and had decided instead to shift Government Buildings out to the Phoenix Park, to a virgin site there owned by the Government and give back to the University the College that belongs to them, that is, the College of Science, which was <Col N="1481" /> built for the College of Science, and let this building that we are in go back to the Museum.  That was the Government plan and they ought to go ahead with it and let whatever extra University building is required be built around here to facilitate the students.</P>
    <P>I believe it would impose great hardship on students to have to travel out to Belfield.  One of the effects&mdash; it might not be a bad one&mdash;would be that Trinity College would be availed of to a greater extent.  It is in a very central situation.  Many persons will say: &ldquo;I am not going to send my child from Howth out to Stillorgan. There is a place half-way, in the middle of the city.  I shall send him there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall not make a long speech.  I never do.  I recommend the idea put forward by some Deputies that this new Commission which the Minister is about to set up should reexamine the whole case and particularly take notice of the suggestion made by Deputy MacCarthy, to see if it would be necessary to provide extra accommodation at all.  I have the feeling that others have, that this whole thing has been settled, that it is a <i>fait accompli</i> and that all we are being asked to do is to rubber stamp it.  That is my feeling, that some hugger-mugger has been going on.  It is a disgraceful thing if that is the case.  I do hope that the whole question now will be put before this new Commission and that the terms of reference will embrace the whole question of higher education, not merely the question of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Even on the question of accommodation the situation has completely changed from the time that the Commission sat because Harcourt Street Station, with its 4½ acres, is now available.  Apart from that, the case made by the <i>Tuairim</i> group for building on Iveagh Gardens is unanswerable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCarew" hpid="Mr. Carew Mr. Carew">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief. I understand the Taoiseach's reasons for desiring that this Estimate and other business be completed today.  I am not standing up here to criticise in any way how Dublin, Cork or <Col N="1482" /> Galway run their Universities.  It is very gratifying that there is increased demand for University education.  It is for the Dublin people to settle the question as to whether or not it is necessary to go out to Belfield or to allow the College to remain in Earlsfort Terrace.</P>
      <P>From my knowledge of Limerick students in Dublin, it would appear that the overcrowding in Earlsfort Terrace is a serious matter and that the accommodation for students in the city of Dublin is not alone becoming a matter of difficulty but is very expensive.  If the proposal to build a new College means that there will be accommodation for students near that College, it does appear to be very much in the economic interests of students.  I wish the project well and I congratulate the Minister on the full statement he has made on the position.  He has given us facts and figures which are gratifying in one way but not so gratifying in other ways.  However, it is information which we as public representatives are very glad to have.</P>
      <P>Cork University has been mentioned in the debate.  They are doing useful work from the point of view of agriculture and in many other ways.  As regards Galway, we in Limerick are very proud to have the University there for our students.  It is somewhat nearer than the University in Dublin.  I am not criticising the manner in which the Universities in Dublin, Galway and Cork manage their business.  We have admiration for all of them.  Limerick students have been attending all three Universities and many of them have also attended Trinity College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we appreciate all that good work, we are disappointed that some reference was not made either in the Report of the Commission or in the Minister's statement to the provision of a University College in Limerick, the third City in the State.  I know replies have been given in the Dáil to statements made by Deputy O'Malley on behalf of Limerick but we should like some concrete statement to the effect that some effort will be made in that <Col N="1483" /> direction.  I know the Minister would be anxious to help Limerick and that the Clare County Council and the people of Clare would welcome the provision of such a College for Limerick.  There are very close ties between Limerick and Clare, the Minister's constituency.  The Minister is doing very useful work, and I have every confidence in him as Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>I understand a sum of £7 million will be expended in connection with University education, and altogether a sum of £10 million, if Cork and Galway are included.  For about four or five years now, we in Limerick have been discussing this problem from every angle. I am Mayor of Limerick this year and I am sure previous Mayors have had experience of a committee in relation to colleges and schools, a committee composed of very responsible people, who issued a report asking the Government to give consideration to Limerick. That is why we are disappointed that the Commission in their Report did not mention Limerick.</P>
    <P>I do not have to tell anybody here of the grave difficulties involved in Limerick students coming to Dublin. We have excellent schools and colleges in Limerick and excellent students who obtain Leaving Certificates and whose parents are unable to further their education.  We know, and it is borne out by the Minister's statement, that 50 per cent. of those who pursue professional careers have to emigrate for a livelihood but a very large percentage of potential professional people could be educated in Limerick instead of having to go to foreign countries without any qualification whatever.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated he intends to set up a commission to inquire into the extension of University education.  Commissions are very slow-moving bodies.  It has taken some of the commissions set up many years to make their recommendations and then it all ended in a bottle of smoke.  I do not doubt the Minister will get the best people to inquire into this question but the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; does not sound well in Limerick. We had the Milk Costings Commission <Col N="1484" /> which took six years to report and ended in nothing.</P>
    <P>If, as the Minister stated, it will take 20 years to complete the University at Belfield, are we to wait for 20 years to make a start in Limerick, or are we to wait to consider other parts of the country?  It is my duty to speak on behalf of Limerick but other Deputies are entitled to make a case for their own areas.  It is purely on the economic issue that I am appealing to the Minister now.  The parents of many of the boys and girls in Limerick whom I know would like them to have a University education. Some of these students pursue teaching or go into religious Orders or go abroad.  If they go abroad with a University degree we know how welcome they are and how valuable and influential they can be.  If they go to other countries with a good education, they can hope to rise to the top of the profession they follow.  I should like the Minister, in his reply, to give us some idea of what is running through the Department's mind in regard to Limerick.  We are not looking for large buildings or expensive equipment.  If a start could be made on the provision of a constituent College of the University, we should be grateful.</P>
    <P>I do not think the argument is being made that if we started a constituent College in Limerick, it would starve Galway or Cork or interfere very much with them.  We all know that in every part of the country people are more and more inclined to give their children University education.  It is necessary. What has a professional man to leave if his children do not follow his own profession by getting a good education to arm them for the battle of life?  At one time University education was not required in business or industry but it is required today and the men and women who have it will get employment not alone at home but abroad. Our people in Limerick who cannot afford to send their children to Universities elsewhere have that consideration in mind.  That is why the committee of which I was chairman was formed and issued that report quite recently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> Another committee composed, not of heads of schools, but of people generally affected by this problem has started and their reports appear in the daily papers and will continue to appear until such time as some statement is made as to what the future holds for Limerick.  These people are concerned with the advancement of Limerick children.  I was very glad to see, in answer to a question by Deputy Russell yesterday, the Minister's assurance that he will meet that Limerick committee.  When he does, I believe he will be convinced that they have a very strong and sound claim. In conclusion, I wish the Minister every success in solving this complex problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>One needs to spend only a short time in this House to realise how far removed opinions here are from the viewpoint of the ordinary people.  When I look at this proposal to spend £7 or £8 million which is camouflaged here as a £10 Vote and think of what could be done with that money for the agricultural community and for the ordinary young men who want training for work&mdash;not for emigration&mdash;I wonder if we are doing the right thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest we should first examine the necessity for this move.  We have the statement of the Minister that 50 per cent. of those going to the Universities emigrate.  I do not object to any young men getting the best possible training before emigrating, but, as the Minister said, our main graduate export appears to be doctors from the five medical schools and civil engineers from the four engineering schools.  The National University produces annually 170 doctors and Trinity College, Dublin, about 60.  Of the 230, 100 emigrate. Of the civil engineers, 40 from U.C.D. and 15 from the Cork College, about 25 from Galway and 30 from T.C.D., it may be surmised that 50, or over half the total, emigrate.  It is for this purpose that £7 million is to be spent and while I am anxious to see any young man who must leave the country do so with the best possible qualifications we can give him, I suggest that the Minister should have a chat with the Minister for Justice and <Col N="1486" /> find out how many young men with University education are knocking at the door of the Garda Depot trying to get in to use their University education to see why Mary Moloney has no shoes on her donkey.</P>
    <P>Those are the things that should make us realise the situation.  There is another group coming in here to muddle us up so that their half-starved comrades outside can get plenty of work in the courts.  That is what all this University education is for.  If this higher education project is proceeded with, I suggest to the Minister that the education for our people should be of a type that will enable them to earn a livelihood in their own country. That is what is required.  Let the Minister enlarge the vocational and technical schools, spend money on them and give an opportunity to the young people so that when we start an industry here, we shall not find that 50 per cent. of the keymen in it are foreigners and that the only thing our people can do is to become hewers of wood and drawers of water for the foreigners who come here.</P>
    <P>I was very proud a few months ago when Rushbrooke Dockyard reached the stage when young men were required and when we found our youths so well qualified and with sufficient groundwork training that the dockyard authorities were able to take them out immediately to Holland to be trained as keymen and to come back as keymen in this industry instead of having 40 or 50 Dutchmen coming over to do the job.  That is where money is needed.  We give a doctor five or six years going to College and University and he gets a degree and then he spends five or six years more going around knocking at the doors of the Appointments Commission.  If his degree is high enough in a certain society, he will get a dispensary and about £700 or £800 a year&mdash;£15 a week.  There are men working in Cork to-day who walked out of the national school and who are earning more than £15 a week as ordinary lorry drivers.</P>
    <P>People talk about University education but the question is: what education can we provide for our people that will give them decent employment <Col N="1487" /> at home?  What training can we give them that will enable them to qualify to take up the posts we are creating in our new industries?  That is what we should consider instead of educating young men at the expense of the taxpayers when 50 per cent. of them emigrate.  Let us get down to the realism of this.  I thank God that I cleared out of school at the age of 13 and any other education I got, I got with Deputy G. Boland in the colleges of the jails of this and other countries.  I think the education I got there was a great deal better than the education I would get in a University to-day.  I challenge the Minister to bring in the Minister for Justice and let him tell us the number of University graduates who are trying to get jobs as Gardaí and the numbers who are queuing for very small jobs in the country.</P>
    <P>It is at these things one has to look in order to judge.  I have seen the situation in my own constituency.  If anyone ever had experience, I have had it.  There, you have the oil refinery, the sheet metal factory and the dockyard, all crying out for trained technical men.  Not half enough of those are turned out by our technical schools sufficiently well trained to fill the vacancies in these places.  One is faced, then, with the spectacle of foreigners coming in, trained in primary and technical schools abroad; it is they who are walking in from abroad filling the vacancies that exist.  Simultaneously, our University graduate is heading off with his bag on his back in search of a livelihood in some other country.</P>
    <P>Our educational system is all wrong, right from the ground floor up.  Here we are discussing moving University College to the outskirts of the city of Dublin.  I suggest to the Minister that one of his arguments in favour of keeping this project confined to Dublin is wrong.  He says that &ldquo;the sole source of the increasing pressure on University College, Dublin, is that College's own hinterland, that is, Dublin city and the area within 30 miles thereof.&rdquo;  He says the population is moving up to Dublin, and that is <Col N="1488" /> the reason for this project.  Obviously, the real reason is to increase the drift of the population into Dublin.  I suggest that he should increase the drift of the population out of Dublin.  The sooner people get rid of this &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; idea, the better it will be.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of space for expansion in Cork University.  It will be quite easy to cater for double the number if we proceed on the lines I have suggested.  There is plenty of room for expansion in Cork.  There are plenty of these leafy bowers about which Deputy Dillon spoke the other day.  If Deputy Dillon wants proof of that, he need only open the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and have a look at the pairs going into the Honan Chapel, as a result of the leafy bowers.  They hardly wait to get degrees before taking on these responsibilities.</P>

      <P>I do not know if that is the purpose for which Deputy Dillon wanted the leafy bowers.  Let us look at this issue in a realistic fashion.  Let us ask ourselves: What do our people want?  What type of education is required to fill the gaps that need to be filled, gaps which are at present filled by foreigners?  Let us fill those gaps first.  In that direction, there is ample scope for the Minister to use his energies and his ability in extending technical and vocational education to provide the young lad who leaves the national school with some place to which he can go in order to equip himself to take up a position.</P>
      <P>If anything would make one realise how far removed we are from the ordinary people it is listening to Deputy G. Boland talking here this morning about all the footwear his family needed travelling here in Dublin to a University.  I wonder would Deputy Boland take a ramble down to Roscommon.  If he did, he would find plenty of boreens and unfortunate children walking three and four miles to school every day, and it is a very dirty boreen they have to traverse on the way.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the House that the proposition <Col N="1489" /> put forward by the Minister and the Government is for the purpose of getting approval, in principle, of the transfer of University College from Earlsfort Terrace to Belfield.  It seems to me we have availed of this Supplementary Estimate to discuss every facet of education&mdash;University, secondary, primary and technical, and even the education Deputy Corry got in jails from Deputy G. Boland&mdash;but that is not the issue before the House.</P>
      <P>I am happy in one sense and slightly perturbed in another because we have a situation in which it is now clear that the Fianna Fáil Party are split from stem to stern on this issue.  However, I presume that the discipline, whether of the University or the jail, will prevail and the Deputies on the opposite benches who have spoken so vehemently against the proposal will vote for the proposition, should a vote take place.</P>
      <P>To come back to the position as I see it, judging by the speeches made, it is now abundantly clear that we have two choices.  We are in the happy position of being able to decide whether we shall remain in Earlsfort Terrace or go out to Belfield. That position is brought about because of the acquisition of Belfield in time.  Strange as it may seem, no attack has been made upon the wisdom of purchasing the land at Belfield because, of course, the truth of the matter is that, even if we did not change to Belfield, the Belfield property is a very valuable asset and an excellent investment.  It is worth considerably more now than it was when it was bought, and the wisdom of the University authorities and the Government at the time in buying the property is to be commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we go out there and have a spread building, as it is called, or whether we go up into the air at Earlsfort Terrace is now a matter for us to decide.  We are in the position that we can decide.  If we did not have the land at Belfield, then we would have no option but to stay where we are and go up into the air.  Having listened to everything to which one could listen, having read the reports, including the <i>Tuairim</i> report, and <Col N="1490" /> having listened to the speeches here, I am still not in a position to say which is the wiser course.  I believe, however, that a University should not be caged up in the centre of a city.  I saw the University at Madrid.  It is well out on the northern perimeter.  Other Universities I have seen are also well out on the outskirts.  It is true that there are a number of Universities inside city areas, but I do not know whether or not such a locale contributes towards work on the part of the students.</P>
    <P>One possibility that recommends Belfield to me is that it could be a residential University, with hostels for the students and a unity of control.  I do not subscribe to the view expressed by Deputy Corry that the students are educated blackguards.  They are the youth.  I suggest Belfield lends itself to the establishment of a residential University, and I agree with the assertion that it should not take 20 years to implement that proposal.  We should proceed much more rapidly than that. Of course I know the Minister for Finance, and the national purse, have always to be considered but if we can get £10,000,000 for aeroplanes, I do not see any reason why we cannot get £10,000,000 for the National University and speed up the work just as quickly as we speeded up the airlines or any other project.</P>
    <P>The House is now faced with the responsibility of coming to a decision in the matter of agreeing in principle with that proposition.  This is a formal occasion on which the House can approve or disapprove of the proposal. I think they should approve of it, and if there is a vote of the House, I shall vote for it because I think it is in the best interests of the University and of the education of the youths attending the University.  I might add that if I were asked at the moment to select a site for a University, I might select a different site altogether, but not for any of the reasons put forward so far by any speakers.  I would adopt that view purely from the defence point of view.  I shall not go into that matter now, because I do not think this is the right or the opportune time to do so.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that it <Col N="1491" /> appears we have a choice between leaving the University where it is or going out to Belfield.  Belfield is suitable in respect of at least 90 per cent. of our requirements, from my point of view.  There is a ten per cent. consideration which it would be wise to examine, and it might be no harm, indeed, if the Minister, before proceeding with the plans, referred the matter to his colleague, the Minister for Defence, to have a look at the problem that exists in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>By his very long and comprehensive statement in which he meant to be helpful and informative, the Minister has brought a lot of trouble on himself by widening the scope of the debate.  The Commission was set up for a specific purpose.  I know two of the personnel of that Commission and they are men in whom I have implicit faith, but there is this belief that the Commission, having examined this question and having done their best, realised at the time that there was an alternative to the Belfield site, but that there was a subconscious bias in favour of Belfield.</P>
      <P>We all appreciate our national University.  Many tributes were paid to it here and some Deputies went into its whole history.  That was utterly unnecessary.  National University holds a proud place in the hearts of our people, and the fact that the numbers of students have increased so greatly over the years is a tribute to the faith and the belief our people have in that University.  I cannot help recalling a late President of Cork University, Rev. Dr. O'Rahilly.  He did more to focus attention on the practical side of University life than any other man in this generation.  He pioneered the idea of going outside the walls of the University so that the University people would be able to impart education. He was the man who pioneered these courses and they have done more to enhance the reputation of the University in the minds of the people than anything else in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody grudges any money which is provided for University education but <Col N="1492" /> we must be practical and must realise our own limitations.  I am not completely convinced from the Report of the Commission and from the Minister's statement that the reconstruction which is considered necessary on the present site is entirely practical because of the cost involved.  That cost of reconstruction would be nearly as much as the cost of transferring the University out to the Belfield site.  I think we can dispense with that because it is impractical.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Belfield decision the right one in the end.  Has every other possibility been explored by the Commission, or was their decision influenced by the fact that this site was available?  That is what I should like to know.  There is also the question: if the Belfield site is eventually developed and hostels are erected, will they become so numerous and extensive that they will interfere with the constituent colleges of the University? Will the attraction be so great as to draw on the personnel of those who are at present forced to go to the Universities of Cork or Galway?  Those are points I have great doubts about, and they are points which should be carefully examined because the possibility is there that if these hostels are erected, they will eventually be detrimental to the smaller constiuent Colleges of the University.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered if there is any possibility of changing the Oireachtas from its present site and making the premises here&mdash;which would be more extensive than the site of the University&mdash;available to the University.  Their buildings and structure are sound, but what use could they be turned to if they became available for any general purpose?  Again, I shall lose faith completely if it takes 20 years in which to make a complete transfer of the University.  I do not think that is feasible and I do not think it will capture the imagination of the Irish people as a practical step.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy last evening made certain very helpful suggestions. I do not know if his proposal is entirely practical, but there is so much emphasis on vocational education today <Col N="1493" /> that perhaps the first year course could very well be in the vocational schools.  Again, I cannot help wondering whether between the University and the three constituent Colleges, there is that close co-ordination we would expect in our national University.  As a matter of fact, we have not that co-ordination at all amongst our systems of education.  We have systems competing one against the other, with no effort to co-ordinate for the sake of continuity and suitability. That is a very seriously felt want.</P>
    <P>I have no particular bias in favour of any particular college with regard to the National University.  I am naturally interested in Cork University. They have a site available there for extensions and, as Deputy MacCarthy says, it is true that they have two unsightly buildings right in the centre of the grounds.  If the money is made available right away they could well be replaced by more beautiful buildings more in keeping with the surroundings.</P>
    <P>Again, there is this point.  The agricultural students have to spend two years in Cork.  Why not transfer the whole Agricultural Faculty to Cork in order to relieve the congestion in Dublin?</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said here about the project for Limerick.  I am not convinced of its necessity.  So long as our present colleges are starved for finance, we must be reasonable and practicable.  Limerick is not so far away from Galway and East Limerick is as near to Cork as it is to Limerick itself.  That kind of propaganda does not weigh with me at all.  We have the Colleges there already.  Extensions to them are possible.  I believe that if the Colleges were allowed to carry out the extensions and if the Government were generous enough to provide the money, it would solve the problem for the specific Colleges mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am still dubious with regard to Dublin.  The <i>Tuairim</i> report has convinced me.  I have not read anything since that changes my mind on the subject.  It was unfortunate that the report was not available before the Commission reached its findings as it <Col N="1494" /> might have approached the whole question in a different atmosphere.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious that the University should be helped as generously as possible.  Let us, however, be assured that the most practical approach will be made and that there will be no unnecessary spending of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Trinity man, I feel that some reference will have to be made to the question of co-operation or amalgamation between Trinity and U.C.D.  I am very glad the Minister approached the matter as he did.  I cannot support Deputy Dr. Browne's remarks in that connection nor can I support the attitude of Deputy McGilligan.</P>
      <P>The Minister appeared to strike exactly the right note when he stated, as reported in the Official Debates, Volume 180, column 941, that there is a due place among us for all four Colleges.  That is striking exactly the right note.  It shows the contribution which is vital for the country simply by reason of the fact that there is not a false unity.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I would not and could not agree with Deputy McGilligan that there should be an effort to make a union between people between whom there can be no unity as he is reported as saying, in effect, at Column 1169 of the Official Debates, Volume 180.  That seems to be trying to promote disunity and that is far from my wishes in the matter and I think very far from the wishes of most people associated with Trinity College.</P>
      <P>I do not believe for a moment that Deputy Dr. Browne was right in saying that there is religious bigotry in the governing bodies of Trinity College and U.C.D.  I think the position is quite the reverse.  I think that, more and more, the governing bodies are coming to appreciate each other's position better and, as Deputy de Valera said, are always willing to cooperate in the use of equipment and I should hope also, subsequently, in the use of premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deprecate very strongly any effort to divide these two Colleges.  There is a different conception of education in <Col N="1495" /> the two Colleges.  I appreciate very much the way in which the Minister dealt with the matter.  Having said that, I should like to deal with the terms of the Commission's report as briefly as I can.</P>
    <P>I should accept the Commission's report very much more readily if they had stated categorically that there was only one solution of the accommodation problem in U.C.D.  In fact, however, on page 3 of that report, it is stated in effect, that other solutions might have presented themselves if the terms of reference had invited views upon co-ordination within the University or over a wider field.  They have made it perfectly clear that other solutions are possible.  I believe that is a fact.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Commission, with the greatest goodwill in the world, have misinterpreted the duty which was laid upon them.  I do not agree for a moment that they should have been influenced so much by their resistance to compulsory acquisition.  Neither do I believe that that is entirely the answer.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed to find that in recent years no effort appears to have been made to acquire property in the Earlsfort Terrace area.  I know that efforts were made previously but that was when the College was very restricted, so far as its overdraft was concerned.  I have not been able to find any evidence so far, and I believe none is available, that any effort was made in recent years to acquire other property in the area.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the <i>Tuairim</i> report to the effect that some of the schools in the area might very well be prepared to move out to Belfield or to other places outside the city where they would have playing-fields near them, schools such as Alexandra Schools and College, immediately opposite the U.C.D. buildings, or, for that matter. Wesley College on the South side of St. Stephen's Green.  I am not authorised in any way to speak on behalf of either of these two schools but I believe that the possibility of some negotiations with them and with <Col N="1496" /> other schools such as Loreto College and the Catholic University School in Leeson Street might have produced some helpful results.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed, too, that the Commission, and I am afraid the Minister to that extent appear to have been influenced so much by the comparison between Manchester.  Birmingham, Liverpool and Nottingham Universities who wish to move out of the city and virtually into the country area.  None of these cities is in any way comparable with Dublin.  The present situation of U.C.D. is very close to the cultural complex of a capital city.  It is located in an area which is not heavily built-up with industrial plant and equipment. Those features make an entirely different situation altogether.</P>
    <P>It was stated very clearly by the Commission that it was essential to maintain the unity of U.C.D.  I was greatly impressed by the revelation of Deputy de Valera yesterday of the amount of disunity by which U.C.D. has been hampered over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>I think U.C.D. has done an absolutely magnificent job in the face of almost insuperable obstacles.  I should hope that the mere distance of half a mile between the College of Science and Earlsfort Terrace would not be too great a burden to bear a little longer.  I think that efforts should be made and could still be made to explore the possibility of development on the Earlsfort Terrace site.</P>
    <P>The <i>Tuairim</i> report has put in a very good argument about the development of the Iveagh Gardens which deserves much further consideration. It is obvious that there is an open space there in the centre which would give enough light and air for a fairly high building.  I am impressed that so many of the Universities in Great Britain are building up to a very considerable height without any great difficulty being experienced in that regard.  I think we in this country are rather nervous about building up. Some consideration should have been given to that point by the Commission in their deliberations.  Sheffield goes up to 13 storeys; Southampton, 10; Birmingham, 7; Liverpool, 9; <Col N="1497" /> and Aberdeen has a 5-storey chemistry block.  Even Oxford and Cambridge have gone in for very high buildings. I feel we could do the same here.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that St. Stephen's Green would be depreciated in any way by high buildings on the south side.  Some of the buildings on the south side of St. Stephen's Green are very far from being architectural gems.  The attraction is that you could build up to a very considerable height and have the open space which is already provided free of charge by St. Stephen's Green.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with that to a certain extent and stated that the advice given to him was that building up tended to be uneconomic.  I am not fully in agreement with him there. Granted that the expense of building up is greater than building out, at the same time, the saving in upkeep subsequently would be very considerable.</P>
    <P>The <i>Tuairim</i> report itself was widely quoted and, I think, very properly quoted and should be further developed, but I am disturbed that a matter, which is of the greatest urgency, the erection of a new building which is obviously vitally necessary to U.C.D., will not tie in with the overall plan for the development of Belfield.</P>
    <P>At column 946 of the Official Debates, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The intention of the Government, if the Dáil passes the present Supplementary Estimate and thereby agrees in principle to the transfer to Belfield, is to relieve immediate pressure on University College by providing on the Belfield site, in such a way as to interfere as little as may be with potential alterations in the general lay-out, a building that will house the senior sections of the physics and chemistry departments.</P>
    <P>I am fully prepared to agree that this is a vital necessity for U.C.D.  All the arguments are in favour of that.  Here we are considering putting up a building which is to cost at least £250,000 and it is to be provided in such a way as to interfere as little as possible with the potential alterations in the general layout.  That seems to me to be a very <Col N="1498" /> curious way to approach a project costing £250,000.  This should be surely something permanent, something which will fit in with the overall plan but the Minister very wisely stated that it will not be the ideal.</P>
    <P>Further, I think the Minister was very courageous in stating that the entire transfer of the College would be limited to a period of, at the very least, 20 years.  He was criticised very much for that.  I cannot see any way in which that period could be reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not directing this to the Opposition for one moment.  I am fully prepared to admit that.  I think the Minister is perfectly right. This is an enormous project.  By the time the Faculties have settled on their precise requirements; by the time that has been passed by the governing body; by the time the specifications have been carefully drawn up and the tenders requested for detailed plans on a competitive basis from architects; by the time these plans have been submitted and adjudicated upon by an expert committee; by the time that has been reported to the governing body; and by the time the governing body has decided upon those plans and asked for a reduction in costs, perhaps, and so on, each block servicing each Faculty will take an enormous length of time to complete.</P>
      <P>I am not stating for a moment that there will be any avoidable delay.  I do not think there can be.  I am nervous that the present disunity in U.C.D. which has suffered and which has soldiered for so long will become vastly worse.  When this project starts in Belfield and the physics and chemistry departments are placed there, the students will find that the lectures will go on to 12.30 or 1 p.m.  What are they to do then?  They must get on the bus or their bicycles and bus or ride the whole way into town to get a meal and then go back to Belfield again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should imagine that very shortly an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement will have to <Col N="1499" /> be made for a canteen or some restaurant there.  At the same time, there will have to be some <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement about administration of such a big building.  I am afraid that these <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements will multiply and that the whole business will become bogged down.</P>
    <P>The attraction about building upon the Earlsfort Terrace site is that the tendency will be towards integration rather than the reverse.  I am not an expert in these matters but I had experience of some industrial building and I do know all the snags that may arise in regard to the preparation of plans and specifications, the consideration of the tenders and so on.  It is a long and wearisome business.  I should hope that even at this stage the Minister would try to assure himself that there is no possibility of an alternative to this enormous project at Belfield.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is satisfied that Belfield is genuinely the only alternative, then I think every effort will have to be made to do it in less than 20 years, although I do not think it will be possible. I should still hope that U.C.D. will be reconstituted in the city in a way which will be a credit to the city and of advantage to the economy in regard to public funds.  Abandoning the Earlsfort Terrace site and handing it over to the Board of Works for modification will take a tremendous amount of time and money.  That seems to be a long and wasteful process.  Adapting buildings always works out at double the cost anticipated.</P>
    <P>The Earlsfort Terrace site should be preserved for the purposes for which it was designed.  May I ask the Minister therefore&mdash;I possibly do not need to do so&mdash;even if this Supplementary Estimate is passed, not to go too quickly into taking a final decision if he can avoid it and to consider whether buildings may yet be acquired in the Earlsfort Terrace area by negotiation or direct approach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; at the same time, that leaves Earlsfort Terrace in the air. The property at Belfield is a much more realisable asset than the property at Earlsfort Terrace.  In very many ways, it was a very wise purchase.  The value of Belfield can only be increasing as time goes on, whereas Earlsfort Terrace is not an asset which is increasing in value and the only way in which you can use it is by very large scale modifications and adaptations.  I should hope, therefore, that efforts will be made to build whatever requires to be built immediately on the Iveagh Gardens site in such a way that the immediate needs of the science and chemistry departments of U.C.D. will be met and in such a way that the building can be extended upwards.  I hope that whatever decision is taken will be taken with resolution because the present situation of U.C.D. is very critical.  Whatever way it goes University College, Dublin, can be made a greater force in the life of the country than it has been up to now.  Whatever way the decision may go I feel that I would be failing in my public duty if I gave this project my unconditional approval. I still feel there is an alternative and I hope it will be found.  If it is not found and the Belfield project goes ahead may the scheme go on as quickly as possible; those who have responsibility for the designing of it and the approval of the expenditure will have my deepest sympathy.  It presents an enormous problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in the debate but, having heard two speakers from the Government benches, I consider that I should make some comment.  The Minister is being discouraged by members of his own Party as far as the expenditure is concerned.  I know we are not a rich country and I know that the people complain that they are over-taxed but I say to the Minister that he can take courage in his hands when he comes to the Government and to this House to look for money to build his University at Belfield.  I disagree with him in regard to the 20 years; I agree with many of those who say that 20 years should not be the target, that the period <Col N="1501" /> could be shortened, and that we should be capable of having the University built in practically half that time.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the £6½ million.  Votes went through this House covering a period of years, not as long as the period for which the Minister is budgeting, for more than £10,000,000 for arterial drainage.  The sum of £3½ million was mentioned a fortnight ago as being allotted to the Moy for drainage.  I consider that the building of a University in our capital city is a much more important work and that the Minister should not have, and will not have, any difficulty in getting his money.</P>
      <P>We had speeches here this morning, one from a former Fianna Fáil Minister and one from Deputy Corry, which I think were disgraceful.  We should grow up in this House.  People should not be mocked in this House because they have been to Universities, because they are scholars and enjoy the benefits of higher education. The youth of to-day should not be mocked and told that they will be turned into educated blackguards if they go to the University.  I would prefer to see them what Deputy Corry called &ldquo;educated blackguards&rdquo; than &ldquo;yahoos&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  When thinking it over, the thought occurred to me that perhaps his brief was too comprehensive, but he brought it in bravely and opened up the whole question for a complete debate.  No Deputy or no citizen of this State can say that this matter was not discussed fully and carefully examined by this House, if we except the two speeches which I heard this morning.  I feel I must comment on the contribution of a former Fianna Fáil Minister of State and I ask how did this country exist with such Ministers of State? That former Minister spoke about the University this morning.  He has been resident in Dublin for practically a lifetime and he did not know how far Belfield was from the city.  He said that up to the time that Deputy MacCarthy spoke, he agreed with this project.  He skimmed through <Col N="1502" /> some of the reports during the night and then he came in here to oppose it.  It would appear from his findings, or from the people to whom he spoke during the darkness of the night, that there was a lot of skullduggery in regard to going to Belfield.</P>
    <P>I was on the Governing Body of the National University and I can testify that a very short time after they bought Belfield they had an inquiry from very well-known and reputable estate agents in Dublin who were prepared to offer the authorities a substantial profit on Belfield.  The authorities who purchased Belfield had great foresight.  It is a good thing that a University can be established there and extended if the authorities want to extend it or adjusted if they want to adjust it.  The last word I have to say to the Minister is that when he leaves this House his policy should be to see that this project will at least be brought to a conclusion within 10 years.  Some of my colleagues have mentioned the desirability of providing opportunities for University education in other centres.  I shall similarly plead with the Minister in the near future with the backing of people from my own constituency of Waterford.  I am not bringing this matter before the Minister now because the present is not a suitable occasion. I wish the Minister every good luck and every success in this project.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Booth, I shall preface my remarks by saying that I shall be brief, but unlike him I shall make brevity the essence of what I have to say.  I congratulate the Minister and I urge him not to be dismayed by what Fianna Fáil have said this morning because, so sure as ever the whips crack, they will come in and rally round.  Let him not worry in the least.  I can assure him that on these benches we are behind him as we are behind all good projects such as this.  As an ex-student&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One thing is that we are permitted to change our minds. <Col N="1503" /> Deputies opposite are not, they have to keep behind the Whips.  As an ex-student of University College, Dublin, I should like to say how proud I am to hear that the Minister and the Governing Body of the College have taken the decision to move to Belfield. When I was there many years ago, longer than I like to remember, I appreciated the overcrowding of the College and I can imagine what it is to-day.  Even in those days the students of different Faculties did not know their colleagues in the Faculty. They were scattered throughout the city.  The Medical School was in Cecilia Street and the Science School in Government Buildings in Upper Merrion Street.  The Agricultural Faculty was in some other part of the city on the North side.</P>
      <P>If we are to transfer University College from Earlsfort Terrace to Belfield then we shall have a compact University College with all the Faculties gathered into one unit.  I was rather amused to hear Deputy Booth say that there would be difficulty in transporting students to and from the city for their lunch, or from Belfield to their lodging accommodation.  In a very short time that élite district of Donnybrook will become the home of the students and they will have no necessity to visit the centre of the city. We are inclined to forget that in the cities of Oxford and Cambridge the Universities there were not built in those towns.  The towns grew up about the Universities and that is what will happen in Belfield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy McGilligan I am completely against the amalgamation of the two Universities.  Suppose for a second we did agree and that all the other difficulties were ironed out, we would again have overcrowding in Trinity College and would be faced with this problem of farming out certain Faculties to other parts of the city and trying to procure accommodation for them.  I believe a very wise decision has been made.  I can appreciate the force of the observation of Deputy McGilligan when he says he is jealous that it is the Minister who has the opportunity of moving <Col N="1504" /> this token Vote for the purpose of providing moneys for the erection of a University at Belfield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>So many points have been raised during the debate that it is not easy to decide which call for a reply, and in what order.  I scarcely need to make clear again that the matter involved in the present token Supplementary Estimate is the seeking of approval of Dáil Éireann for the transfer of University College, Dublin, to the Belfield site.  While the provision of the new physics and chemistry building is in the nature of an emergency, its siting at Belfield is the first step in that transfer.  The issue, as I see it and as the Commission saw it, is not a choice between a site a Belfield and a site at Earlsfort Terrace.  It is a question of providing adequately for the needs of University College, Dublin, or of not doing so.</P>
      <P>There was some suggestion that there was an element of predetermination in this decision we seek from the Dáil.  The only record I can find in my Department or in any Department is a letter sent from my Department to the President of U.C.D. in March, 1953.  In the course of that letter the President of the College was told:</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for Education to refer to your request of the 9th February, 1953, to the Taoiseach for a capital endowment of £200,000 to meet the purchase price of certain properties in the Stillorgan area already acquired by the College and of such other parcels of land as will be acquired later by the College in that neighbourhood.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education desires me to inform you that the Minister for Finance will be prepared to consider providing in his next Budget for the endowment concerned, but on the condition that it be clearly understood that such provision must not be regarded as committing the Government in any way to any attitude of approval of the College proposals for new buildings or any action in respect thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> That was in 1953, and I think the suggestion was made here that the decision had already been made in the period from 1948 to 1951.</P>
    <P>If, as appears to be the case, Dáil Éireann will agree to the proposal I have brought here, I would ask all of those who, for one reason or another, opposed the transfer, and who I agree have by their opposition contributed to the clarifying of the problem in all our minds, to give their unstinted goodwill and co-operation to the implementing of the decision in regard to the largest Irish University Institution. In so doing they will be building not alone for to-day but for centuries ahead and co-operating, not in the achievement of an abstraction but in providing a very large part of the expert knowledge of all kinds that we all hope the continued progress of the country will require.</P>
    <P>On the question of how long it will take to provide the new buildings, I cannot say I am altogether displeased that my surmise of 20 years has elicited protests.  Any over-caution which may have lain in my surmise had at least the merit of bringing out that this House would be impatient of undue delay in the matter.  If that impatience results in the project being completed in half the time, nobody would be more pleased than I.</P>
    <P>I think my introductory speech covered, from my point of view at any rate, most of the points raised since, and many of the other points which have arisen in the course of this debate are matters which would be submitted to the new Commission that it is proposed to set up.  I should say that the Commission except in so far as it will be asked to examine or recommend on, claims for further constituent Colleges, will not be directly concerned with building problems, as the previous Commission has already made it clear beyond any doubt that all three Colleges suffer from lack of sufficient accommodation.  Any indirect concern which the new Commission will have with accommodation problems could only be in relation to possible recommendations as regards redistribution of Faculties and courses. In my introductory speech I made <Col N="1506" /> clear the principle which would govern any such recommendations as regard redistribution.</P>
    <P>I should like that there be no confusion about my attitude to the question of Trinity College.  If I may repeat what I said when introducing this Supplementary Estimate:</P>
    <P>I believe there is a place and a due place among us for all four Colleges.  Each of them, I believe, has its own appropriate part to play and its own contribution to make to the building of the nation.</P>
    <P>On the question of the new Commission I am not yet in a position to detail all the problems it may be asked to consider.  One of these, however, will undoubtedly be the question of the functions of higher technical schools and of the avoidance of needless duplication of public expenditure on professional courses in Universities and such schools.  Another will be the question of a further constituent College of the National University of Ireland.  An official announcement of the other problems to be submitted for consideration, will be made in due course.  Some Deputies seemed to think that the new Commission will take a very long time and instanced the previous Commission as having spent three and a half years at its labours.  In justice to the previous Commission I must again point out that they spent only one and a half years on their deliberations.  The question of a breakdown of the cost of the new College buildings was mentioned.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Minister?

With reference to the question <Col N="1507" /> of a breakdown of the costs of the new college buildings I would refer Deputies for an answer to that to the detailed analysis of this matter, on the basis of requirements in cubic feet, which was given on pages 36 and 37 of the Report of the Commission on accommodation needs.  Other points may have been raised but I believe they were covered in my introductory speech.  All in all, I think I have made clear to the Dáil what is involved in this token Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>Before section 11, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Act of 1927 is hereby amended by the deletion of section 17 and the substitution therefore of the following section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;17.&mdash;(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (4) of this section, a person who is found on any licensed premises during any time in which the sale of intoxicating liquor on such premises is prohibited by by this Act shall, unless he is either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the holder of the licence or the owner of the premises, or</P>
      <P>(b)  resident permanently or temporarily on the premises, or</P>
      <P>(c)  a person to whom intoxicating liquor may lawfully be sold or supplied on the premises at that time, or</P>
      <P>(d)  in the employment of the holder of the licence or of the owner of the premises and is on the premises in the ordinary course of such employment, or</P>
      <P>(e)  an officer of customs and excise in the course of his duty as an officer,</P>
      <P>be guilty of an offence under this subsection and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine of not less than one pound and not more than five pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where any business other than the sale of intoxicating liquor (in this subsection referred to as non-licensed business) is carried on in any licensed premises and the portion of the premises in which the non-licensed business is carried on is not structurally separated from the remainder of the premises, subsection (1) of this section shall not apply in relation to the premises during any time <Col N="1509" /> in which the premises are lawfully open for the carrying on of the non-licensed business.</P>
    <P>(3)  Subject to subsection (4) of this section, a person who consumes intoxicating liquor on any licensed premises during any time in which the sale of intoxicating liquor on such premises is prohibited by this Act shall, unless he is a person to whom intoxicating liquor may lawfully be sold or supplied on those premises at that time, be guilty of an offence under this subsection and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of not less than one pound and not more than five pounds.</P>
    <P>(4)  A person shall not be convicted of an offence under both subsection (1) and subsection (3) of this section in respect of the same occasion.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for a minimum fine of £1 on the customer who is convicted of an after-hours offence on licensed premises.  I have also tabled amendment No. 55 providing for compulsory endorsement of the licence for every offence after the first.  These two amendments are closely related, one providing for a minimum penalty for a customer and the other for what amounts to a minimum penalty for the licensee.  Both are being put forward in order to ensure that the provisions of the Bill, when it becomes law, will be observed.  I think, therefore, that it would be very difficult to discuss these two amendments separately without a great deal of overlapping, and accordingly I would suggest that we discuss them together, if the Chair and the House have no objection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the other amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It deals with the endorsement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, the purpose of amendment No. 31 is to provide for a minimum fine of £1 on the customer and the purpose of amendment No. 55 is to provide for a compulsory endorsement of a <Col N="1510" /> licence for each offence after the first. The provision for the minimum fine is, of course, new.  The existing law provides for a maximum fine of £5 and the maximum is not being altered. Neither is it proposed to alter the existing law whereby it is not open to the court to apply the Probation Act to these offences.  That provision is contained in Section 35 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1927.</P>
      <P>The offence with which a customer is usually charged is that of being illegally on the premises, and it is to that offence that the minimum penalties are usually attached.  There are circumstances, however, in which it is not unlawful to be on licensed premises during prohibited hours and in these particular circumstances it is necessary to attach the penalty to the actual consumption of drink&mdash;I mean, of course, illegal consumption, and it is for this reason we have sub-section (3) of the amendment which deals with that situation.</P>
      <P>The two most common examples of circumstances in which members of the public may lawfully be on licensed premises during prohibited hours are first, mixed businesses between 9 o'clock in the morning and the general opening hours for licensed premises, to which Section 8 of the Bill refers, and second, licensed hotels.  For obvious reasons it is not an offence to be in a hotel during prohibited hours.  In these cases, as I said, the minimum penalty will be incurred by anybody found drinking illegally.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the question of compulsory endorsements.  Compulsory endorsements were introduced in an Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1924 and three years later, in an Act of 1927, the provision was modified to permit the District Court not to endorse, where for special reasons, stated in the order, it was made a special order against endorsement on the grounds that the offence, in the circumstances, was trivial.  By an act of 1943 the courts were given complete discretion and the same Act wiped out all endorsements then existing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the second amendment now proposes is that, first of all, all endorsements in existence when the <Col N="1511" /> Bill becomes law will be wiped out, and secondly, that the first offence committed after the passing of the Bill will not be an endorsable offence but that every offence after that will have to be endorsed.  On the other hand, however, it proposes to reduce the effective life of an endorsement as follows: the first endorsement to be effective for two years as compared with five years at present, the second endorsement to be effective for four years as compared with seven years at present, and the third and subsequent endorsements to be effective for six years, as compared with ten years at present.  We are, of course, proposing to continue the existing provision whereby a licence becomes forfeit if at any one time there are three live endorsements on it.  That, in fact, is the whole point of the endorsement procedure.</P>
    <P>In view of all that has been said here about enforcement, the difficulties of enforcement up to now, the danger that even the new hours proposed in the Bill will still not be observed by some publicans and some patrons unless special measures are taken to ensure that penalties are heavy, I do not think it necessary for me to say very much in support of the amendment.  I have already made it clear, and the Taoiseach when speaking here on Second Reading made it clear, that the Government are serious in saying that when the Oireachtas has approved of a new set of opening hours, these hours will be enforced as far as it is possible for the Government to see to it that they are enforced.</P>
    <P>Deputies on both sides of the House have expressed doubts as to whether full and effective enforcement is possible. Reference was made to the pressure put on publicans by a small section of the drinking public who appear not to enjoy a drink unless it is illegal.  Some Deputies went so far as to suggest that is should be open to the publican to walk out from behind the counter and place all responsibility on the customer.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken note of the criticism and suggestions offered <Col N="1512" /> and they accept that in many cases the customer is to blame.  The amendment, therefore, proposes a minimum penalty of £1 on the customer.  I might well have suggested an even stiffer penalty for repeated offences but the difficulty of keeping records and making them available to every district office or Garda station would not be feasible.  I think, idea would not be feasible.  I think, however, that a £1 minimum fine will be effective, especially as it will be open to the court to make it higher.</P>
    <P>As far as endorsement is concerned, the Government came to the conclusion that it is a more effective deterrent than any monetary penalty and will be a weapon in the hands of publicans who want to resist pressure to serve drink during illegal hours.  It is proposed in the amendment that after the Bill becomes law such publicans will be given one chance and that, after that, endorsement will be compulsory.  This will, I hope, go a long way to ensure that, if a customer is turned away by one publican, he will not be admitted by another publican down the road.  If it puts an end to the situation in which publicans are afraid to refuse customers lest they may transfer their custom to publicans who are more willing to take risks, we shall, I think, have done a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the second amendment, amendment No. 55, this is an amendment which permits a district justice to impose a nominal penalty in the case of a first offence on a publican but compulsory endorsement in the case of a second offence.  I do not agree with the principle of endorsement at all.  My reason for not agreeing with it is this. Take a small town or village where there is a fairly well-off publican and another man who is just struggling along.  In the case of the well-to-do publican, if his licence is endorsed and he is caught a third time there is the danger of a second endorsement, all he does is to transfer the licence to some member of his family and the endorsements are automatically wiped out and he starts afresh, whereas the poor unfortunate neighbour who may <Col N="1513" /> not be so well-off and may not be doing the same amount of business cannot afford the finance to give himself a second opportunity by transferring the licence to some member of his family or to some nominee.  In that way endorsements are not equitable in so far as publicans are concerned.</P>
      <P>I often thought, and I would suggest it to the Minister now, that a much more equitable punishment is the suspension of the licence.  Take a very well established licensed business in a town. A fine of £10, £15 or £20 means nothing to them whereas a fine of £10 on some unfortunate neighbour who is just making ends meet means a considerable amount.  Unfortunately, justices do not usually discriminate or, if they do, sometimes they discriminate in favour of the well-to-do publican. If the licence was suspended for seven days, ten day or two weeks, it would hit both publicans equally because each would be prevented from doing the business which he would usually have attached to his premises and if a well-to-do publican had his licence suspended for ten days he certainly would think twice before permitting a second offence to be committed on his premises.  That arrangement would be in keeping with the offence and with the type of business done on the premises. By transferring the licence to a nominee, he can evade a succession of endorsements and the fear of losing his licence.  That is a matter to which the Minister should give careful consideration.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first amendment, that is, an amendment to impose a penalty on a person found drinking on the premises during prohibited hours, I know that the Minister has stated that it is not permissible for a district justice to apply the Probation Act for such offences as the law stands but that is not true.  All over the country the Probation Act is being applied in these cases and no later than last week I was present in court when the Probation Act was applied to 25 men found on the premises and the publican was fined 10/-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might elicit some useful information if we put down a question to find <Col N="1514" /> out on how many occasions the Probation Act has been applied over the past number of years in regard to licensing prosecutions.  I do not think it would be fair to put the question down to find the number of cases in which it has been applied during the past 12 months because I think district justices have been anticipating this Bill and, rightly so, are being more lenient.  However, I am in full agreement with the Minister when he says that there should be a minimum penalty on persons found drinking on licensed premises during prohibited hours because too often a publican finds himself in trouble simply because he does not want to refuse a good customer or a good neighbour and permits him to have a drink.  This might be a deterrent to a customer getting a publican into trouble.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister does make provision for the fact that people may be legitimately on licensed premises during prohibited hours and that the minimum penalty of £1 will not apply to merely being on the premises during prohibited hours but to the consumption of drink on the premises during prohibited hours.  I do not know if the Minister has looked into the question of the penalty for consumption of drink in hotel premises during prohibited hours.  My recollection of the law is that one cannot be fined or prosecuted for being on hotel premises during prohibited hours, that even if one is consuming intoxicating liquor the offence is one of aiding and abetting.  If the Minister is now to impose a minimum penalty of a pound for consuming drink during prohibited hours he should go further and impose a minimum penalty of a pound for aiding and abetting a publican in a breach of the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  That would put all such breaches of the law in the same category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Donnell, almost all the points he raised were considered by the Government and were turned down in favour of the section which is in the Bill.  If we are in earnest, and I am sure we are in earnest, in trying to get the law recognised and respected, we believe this is one way in which we can get that respect.  I do not think it is very drastic.  It will at least ensure that publicans will take the necessary action to clear their premises and make sure nobody will be on the premises during the prohibited hours. Publicans will be in a position to point out to their customers the penalties that are likely to be imposed on them by reason of the fact that customers may be anxious to get extra drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that what we are doing in the Bill is fair and just to all concerned.  In the first instance, all endorsements are wiped out completely and note will not be taken of a first endorsement.  It is the second and subsequent endorsements which will count.  If, for instance, in the two-year period a licensee was remiss enough to allow people to remain on the premises on three occasions and that on these three occasions in the period of two years an endorsement was imposed for each offence, then that person would lose <Col N="1516" /> his licence.  Against that, having had one endorsement during the period of two years and not having had another during that period, that first endorsement also goes by the board and he is in the clear again.  However, should he offend once more it will be taken into consideration; he will then be in the four-year period and the same applies again.  If he has three endorsements during that second period it is just too bad for him.</P>
    <P>In regard to the inquiry made by Deputy Coogan, any employees of the publican are entitled to be on the premises doing their normal business after hours.  On the point raised by Deputy Dillon, that is, if tradesmen of some description are found in the public house during closed hours doing legitimate work, I would be inclined to say these men would not be liable to prosecution.</P>

      <P>I shall have the point clarified but from my own personal knowledge I can say that publicans and such people who have to work within the licensed premises have been doing that for years and years and no one has ever attempted to suggest they should be prosecuted.  In fact, they have not been prosecuted and I doubt very much if any tradesman carrying out a legitimate task in circumstances such as we are discussing would be prosecuted.</P>

      <P>The Minister has put his finger upon the weakness in <Col N="1517" /> this provision.  He says that enforcement of the Act will be done as far as possible and in the next breath he has told us it has been a well-known fact that E.S.B. workers, and others, not being employees of the licensed trade have been on licensed premises after hours working under contract. He tells us they are exempt, but the Bill does not say so.  You are asking the Guards to decide whether a person working on the premises is or is not a person, within the meaning of the Act, who is entitled to be there.</P>
      <P>Endorsement is a very severe penalty and I am inclined to think that the suggestion of Deputy O'Donnell is much preferable, that the licence be suspended for a number of days.  However, if the present endorsement proposal will ensure the enforcement of the law, perhaps it is justified, but I do not know that it will be because, as Deputy O'Donnell pointed out, a wealthy or fairly well-off licensee can transfer the licence to another member of the family and the endorsement goes, whereas a poorer person has to stay on whether he likes it or not.  I suggest that the Minister should look into the question of persons being on the premises who are not employees but who are there upon what might be regarded as reasonable business. Deputy Coogan put his finger on the point when he asked that if a Deputy were a publican and his constituents called to see him, were they committing an offence?  It certainly seems as if Deputy Corry would be prevented from having his Fianna Fáil Club meeting on licensed premises and I think we should not take away that right from Deputy Corry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the suggestion to endorse the licence but one thing that worries me is the point raised by Deputy O'Donnell when he said that an endorsement could be removed by the licensee disposing of the licence to a member of his family or some other person during the currency of the endorsement. If that position is allowed to obtain under the new legislation very little value can be attached to endorsement at all.  I understood that the <Col N="1518" /> new legislation was so framed as to have the endorsement attached to the licence whether it was transferred or not during the period of the endorsement. If that is not so, I suggest that the Minister might consider introducing on Report Stage an amendment providing for this contingency.  There is no use in endorsing a licence if the licensee can eliminate that endorsement merely by transferring the licence to a member of his family or to an immediate friend.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has taken his courage in his hands in regard to the fines to be imposed on persons found on licensed premises during prohibited hours.  By and large, I find this proposal has the approval of publicans.  I think Deputy O'Donnell described it very accurately in saying that publicans were more or less obliged to play up to customers heretofore and had little or no excuse that would be acceptable to the customer for refusing to supply drink during prohibited hours.  This gives the publican a very good excuse in that connection because, apart from the licence being endorsed, the customer will incur a fine that might make his drink very dear.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on the whole principle of endorsement and whether some arrangement can be made to provide that if an endorsement is imposed it will have some salutary effect.</P>

      <P>In connection with Deputy O'Donnell's suggestion that licences might be suspended, the point to be remembered is that if the licence is suspended for any length of time the employees will lose work during that period.  They will be punished as well as the licensee. Personally, I would favour endorsement as against suspension of the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards employees on the premises&mdash;I mean people doing some casual work for the publican&mdash;during closed hours I should like to put one consideration before the House.  The Gardaí may prosecute the publican and the justice may dismiss the case because the person on the premises is an employee but the publican may <Col N="1519" /> still have to pay the legal costs of £3 or £4.  That is not fair.  I wonder could the position be clarified so that a person legitimately engaged in work on behalf of the publican would not be prosecuted, or have the matter clarified so that it would be clear to the Gardaí that they should not prosecute in these circumstances.  If a publican commits no offence it is unfair in a sense that he should have to pay legal costs.</P>

Personally, I think the persons the Deputy has in mind are actually covered by (d) that is, if such a person is employed by the holder of the licence or the owner of the premises and is on the premises in the ordinary course of such employment.  I imagine that the people the Deputy has in mind are the employees of the contractor and that they would be held to be in the constructive employment of the owner of the premises or the holder of the licence.  From the point of view of clarification this can be considered and if necessary a subsection such as the Deputy suggests can be inserted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point made by Deputy Moloney I think the law provides that it must be a <i>bona fide</i> sale and not just a transfer within the family.  From experience, I am convinced that the one thing that will ensure enforcement of this law is the provision for endorsement.  Endorsement of a licence has always been regarded by those concerned as being a very serious thing and that in fact is why district justices were so slow in recent times to endorse.  It was <Col N="1520" /> found, therefore, in recent times that only an infinitesimal number of endorsements were imposed by district justices.</P>
      <P>Over a period covering a year or two, I think the number was three.  The reason for that is very obvious.  District justices, appreciating what a very dangerous thing it was for them to endorse the publican's licence from the point of view of the publican's livelihood, were most reluctant to impose such a penalty.  That is why, in order to give effect to the provision in this Bill and make the law enforceable, that discretion is taken out of the hands of the district justice.  In future, after the first offence endorsement will automatically follow.  If this section goes through, and the penalty of endorsement is imposed, nobody in this House need worry about the enforcement of the law.  This is one thing which will ensure enforcement of the laws as far as publicans are concerned because no publican will risk his livelihood by flouting the law as heretofore.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell suggested that it would be better to close down the premises altogether than to have endorsement of the licence.  I do not think that would be a practical solution; I do not think it would be workable. It would be impossible in the general run of cases in the country where mixed trading is carried on. Even if the court had power to suspend the operation of that part of the business devoted to the sale of intoxicating liquor, the public generally would still have the right to go into that part of the shop trading in groceries, or whatever it may be, and the court's ruling might be very largely ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, I would consider it a far more drastic penalty to suspend completely the operations of the licensed part of the premises.  Indeed, so drastic is the penalty proposed by the Deputy, that district justices would be just as reluctant to impose it as they have been in the past to endorse licences.  I could never visualise a district justice closing down a man's bar for a couple of days, or a week, <Col N="1521" /> as the case may be, appreciating the financial strain that might impose on him.  It would be tantamount to depriving the publican of his livelihood.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell's suggestion might possibly give rise to Constitutional difficulties.  I do not know that it would be open to this House to legislate for the purpose of depriving a man of his legitimate livelihood. But, from any point of view, the suggestion is not practicable. Different suggestions have been made, too, as to the penalties that should be imposed on those found on licensed premises after hours.  The £1 penalty is as near as the Government can get, remembering the different types involved. The suggestion has been made that those found on licensed premises are really to blame for the breach of the law.  A penalty of £1 may seem small to combat the danger of such branches; it may be small in relation to some people, but it would be a very considerable sum to a labouring man, for instance.  The court, of course, will not be prevented, where circumstances warrant it, from increasing the penalty to £5.</P>
    <P>We must aim at reasonableness.  I think the provisions here are as near as we can get to achieving that aim. I am satisfied from past experience that the most effective method of ensuring enforcement of the law is the fear of endorsement.  In future, the publican will be put on notice after the first offence.  He will have full warning that the next time he offends within the two year period the court will have no choice except to impose endorsement.  That will have a very salutary effect in ensuring enforcement of the hours laid down by the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 1 to 4, inclusive, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>In order to explain why I am moving this amendment, I must refer to the section itself: why it has been introduced and what it seeks to achieve.</P>
      <P>As the House is well aware, it is an acknowledged fact that the number of public houses in the State is far in excess of the reasonable needs of the public.  In the Act of 1927, and effort was made, by providing a compensation scheme, to reduce the number, but the scheme proved too costly and had to be abandoned.</P>
      <P>Not only are there too many public houses in the State as a whole, but there are also too many in almost every parish in the State, certainly in almost every town and village.  There are, however, exceptions to this.  In certain places, there is no public house for many miles.  The Licensing Commission referred to this&mdash;paragraph 32, page 16, of the Report&mdash;and recommended a special provision be made to enable a licence to be granted in such an area.  The Commission recommended that the provision should be that a licence could be granted in a rural area in substitution for two existing licences in the same or an adjoining District Court district.</P>
      <P>The Government accepted this recommendation, principally, I may say, because of representations received down the years that the absence of reasonable facilities to obtain a drink legitimately, apart from being unfair to people concerned, leads to social evils, not only by creating a demand for unlicensed sales at all hours of the day or night&mdash;shebeening, in short&mdash; but also by encouraging illicit distillation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the Commission recommended that two existing <Col N="1523" /> licences should be abolished, no doubt to put a curb on the number of applications as well as to help to reduce the total number of licences.  In recommending that they should be abolished in the same or an adjoining district court district, it is quite clear that they were following the precedent set by the existing provisions in the licensing code, whereby a seven-day licence may be transferred to premises with a six-day licence in the same or an adjoining District Court district.  Actually, as I have explained in connection with arguments about the six-day licences, the region comprising a District Court district and the adjoining districts is quite extensive and may well be 50 miles or more across, though of course it would not be so extensive where the district is on the coast.  At any rate, it is, in fact, an arbitrary concept and since I undertook on Second Reading to move an amendment to abolish it as far as six-day licences are concerned, I am proposing that we should do likewise in this section &mdash; though, needless to say, acceptance of this amendment in no way commits the House as to what should be done in relation to six-day licences.</P>
    <P>In moving this amendment to extend to the whole State the area within which the existing licences may be extinguished, I am, of course, saying, by implication, that I cannot accept the amendments in the name of Deputy Declan Costello, who seeks to restrict rather than expand what is now in the Bill.  He seeks to specify the same or an adjoining District Court area.  This, however, is obviously too small a region in which to look for two existing licences for cancellation, especially in the very places where the new licence is most needed&mdash;places in rural Ireland where there is no licensed premises for mile after mile.</P>
    <P>Since my amendment is not in direct conflict with Deputy Belton's amendment, I do not wish to anticipate what he proposes to say, but perhaps I may say this.  If I correctly understood what Deputy Belton said on Second Reading, he wishes to provide that a new <Col N="1524" /> licence shall not be granted in an urban area unless the applicant extinguishes two existing licences.  If that is what he has in mind, his amendment would not achieve it.  New licences in urban areas are granted under Section 4 of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, and that section continues in force.  Under that section, one existing licence must be extinguished and a 25 per cent. increase in population in the parish as compared with 1901, must be proved.</P>
    <P>The effect of Deputy Belton's amendment is to leave the 1902 provision untouched and to add a new provision whereby any person could get a new licence in any urban area, without proving any increase in population, simply by extinguishing two existing licences, subject, of course, to the standard requirements about suitability of premises and so on.  If that is not the Deputy's intention, I suggest that he should reconsider the form of the amendment and put down another on Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is purely a drafting amendment which the draftsman considers to be <Col N="1525" /> an improvement on the existing draft. Paragraph (e) in the Bill as it stands says that if either of the existing premises were premises to which paragraph (1) of Section 2 of the Act of 1902 applied, that paragraph shall, upon the grant of the new licence, cease to apply to them.  That has been a standard formula up to now.  It is proposed, however, in Section 19 of the Bill to amend paragraph (1) of Section 2 of the Act of 1902, and the wording of paragraph (e), lines 45 to 49, is not quite suited to the amended version.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  If, on the hearing of an application for the grant of a certificate entitling the applicant to receive a seven-day <Col N="1528" /> licence in respect of any premises, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the applicant is at the date of the said application the holder of a six-day licence in respect of the said premises, it shall not be open to the Court to refuse the said application.</P>
    <P>(2) For the purposes of this section, the District Court shall be the appropriate Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is moved by those of us who have some knowledge of the conditions in rural Ireland.  So far, we have not pressed any amendment on the Government very strongly.  It has largely been a matter of discussion between us as to what was best to do, save in respect of the issue of principle that arises about extended hours. But here is something which, in our judgment, is a very vital matter which affects the very existence of a number of small independent publicans mainly in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to say in my considered judgment that if the terms of the Bill remain unaltered, a great number of these small publicans will be driven out of business.  In this country, there are 10,543 seven-day licences and 1,424 six-day licences.  Those six-day licences are pretty evenly distributed over the Twenty-Six Counties.  However, in respect of the counties of Mayo and Monaghan, there is the quite unusual number of 418 six-day licences in Mayo and 104 in Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The problem is this: Under the licensing law as it has existed up to now, the six-day licensee was in the same position on a Sunday or St. Patrick's Day as the seven-day licensee except that a seven-day licence holder could open his door to a traveller under the <i>bona fide</i> law.  I believe the Minister for Lands understands this situation because he is familiar with rural conditions.  I am not altogether sure that the Minister for Justice does, because the conditions to which I propose to refer are quite unknown in the cities and larger centres of urban population.</P>
    <P>In a small country town, every publican has his own customers and, as to 85 per cent. of his trade, it is a regular <Col N="1529" /> trade.  He will have, perhaps, 15 per cent. of casual callers but he lives on his regular trade.  Under the law as it has stood up to the present, when those regular customers, who were people ordinarily resident in the immediate vicinity of the town where the publican had his house, came to town on Sunday to attend Mass, or to attend some function in the town, they might stable their horse and cart or might leave their parcels in the house where they habitually dealt.</P>
    <P>The plain truth, as we all know, is that there was very little enforcement of the existing law on Sunday. Therefore, after Mass and in the evening, local people went into the public house to which they were accustomed to go.  Under the law as it is proposed to revise it here, we have announced our intention of strict enforcement. If there were no change in the law, then there would be no facility on a Sunday for anybody from the immediate locality in any public house in the town or village where he regularly went.  He would not be admitted to any public house. Therefore, the six-day licence man and the seven-day licence man would be <i>ex aequo.</i></P>
    <P>Under the law as we propose to amend it, the seven-day licence man will be open after Mass and will again be opened for four hours in the evening. The six-day licence man will not be allowed to open at all.  A strict watch will be kept upon his premises to see that he does not open or admit anybody.  Now, what will the situation be?</P>
    <P>If there is one day of the week on which all his regular customers are likely to come to town, it is Sunday. They are now in the position that if they want the accommodation which they were accustomed to get, they are definitely excluded from the house they normally frequent but are perfectly free to use the premises of any seven-day licensed trader.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister grasps that these are people who come in from an area of one or two miles round the town.  They are the regulars, not <i>bona fide</i> travellers.  They went illegally into both types of houses and therefore it was tolerated. Nobody was at a disadvantage.  Now, we have resolved to tolerate that no more for the six-day licensee while the seven-day man may open from 12.30 to 2 p.m. and from 5 to 9 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation hereafter will be that the seven-day man may now open his door legally after that last Mass and after the football match, or whatever else is going on in town, whereas the six-day man may not open at all and will be strictly supervised to see that he does not.  If I were arguing only the loss of 52 days' trade to the small publican, I would be arguing a very good case, but that is not the case I am making.  The case I am making is that the man who wants to park his horse and cart, the young man or woman who wants to park a bicycle, the elderly woman who wants to leave in her basket or reticule or umbrella while going to Mass, the people who want a house of call where they can leave a message or call for one now find that on Sunday they cannot go into the house where they habitually went. So she goes to one of the houses that are available, the seven-day licence house.  The loss of trade involved in that isolated transaction to the six-day licence owner is insignificant but what is disastrous to him is that if a <Col N="1531" /> person gets into the habit of availing of the facilities of a seven-day licence house on a Sunday in a country town, he cannot do that.  The gradual build up of that will be that the six-day man will see a high proportion of his very limited group of customers frequenting more and more his rivals' houses.</P>
    <P>I am speaking mainly on behalf of a group of publicans in county Mayo and county Monaghan.  The Minister for Lands must know that a very large number of these six-day houses, certainly in Mayo, if he does not know Monaghan, are small family businesses. They are very near the border line between survival and collapse.  I doubt if the bulk of these publicans are getting an agricultural labourer's wage out of their establishments.</P>
    <P>They must pay the licence duty. They must keep the houses in a reasonable state of repair to cater for their customers.  They must work very long hours and at the end of all that, they have very little left, but they do manage to rear families.  If you took the licence away from them and made it impossible for them to do the little bit of trade they do, not only would they lose the business but they would lose their homes.  They would not be able to live in their houses if they had not a bit of income coming in.</P>
    <P>What I am apprehensive of is that this House will inadvertently do something that is irrevocable to 1,424 families or, let me put it, 1,000 families. Say that 424 of the six-day houses will get on in any case.  I know some six-day licence houses to which this legislation would not do any injury at all.  There are 1,000 small families represented by nobody because they are not influential.  They cannot give a subscription to any political Party because they have not got it to give. They are not of very great concern to an organised body whose membership is, in fact, 12,000.  Of those 12,000, I am now speaking for 1,000 of the poorest.  Practically every one of them is a family house supporting a family. I often marvel myself &mdash; and I know whereof I speak because I represent one county mentioned and I do business <Col N="1532" /> in the other&mdash;how they do survive, but they do.  I say with the fullest sense of responsibility that unless their case is met, the great majority of the 1,000 families on whose behalf I now speak will be driven out of business.  They will not only lose their business but they will also lose their homes because they cannot maintain their homes if they have no other source of income.</P>
    <P>They are mostly people who are not versatile in the matter of earning their living.  They are not the kind of people who are at the time of life when they can readily go out and look for alternative work.  They are used to that business and for most of them to turn their hands to something else is just not possible.</P>
    <P>I observe that the Minister has some proposal here to suggest that if a six-day licence holder purchases another six-day licence, by suppressing the two six-day licences, he can have for himself a seven-day licence.  It just leaves me speechless to imagine that such a proposal is conceived to be a remedy for these 1,000 people. I ask the Minister for Lands&mdash;he must know many of them&mdash;how many of these licensees could conceivably assemble the money to purchase another six-day licence?</P>
    <P>There are only 1,424 six-day licences in the whole country.  Picture a town in county Mayo where 418 licences of this character are at present established. Picture a small town in county Mayo where there are 8, 10 or 12 licences and this Sword of Damocles is suddenly hanging over the heads of them all.  The poorest widow-woman amongst them is concerned to preserve her trade.  She is told that the way to do so is to buy another six-day licence. As certainly as I am standing here, I am convinced that the only neighbour whose licence she can buy out is a neighbour who intends to emigrate or clear out because the surrender of the six-day licence will render the continued maintenance of his home impossible.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, take the case of eight licencees in that small town.  It becomes a matter of desperately hanging on to see who will pay the <Col N="1533" /> highest price.  The best they can hope to do is that the better off of them will succeed in buying out the smaller ones as they collapse.  They will hang on in the hope of survival but the free access to the seven-day licence on Sunday and the absolute prohibition of the six-day licence on Sunday will gradually operate to grind some of them to the point where they will no longer be able to pay the licence fee and will be forced to sell out to some relatively well-to-do neighbour at some very small figure. I do not believe that there will be any six day licence people in the district in a financial position to pay any substantial sum for it.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the House this: In the name of common-sense, why are we doing it?  If the Minister were confronted with a situation in which I was asking him to add 7,000 licensees to an already impossible number, I could understand his saying: &ldquo;I simply cannot do it without disrupting the whole Garda Síochána and creating an impossible situation,&rdquo; but I am asking it on behalf of 1,424 licensees out of 12,000. Of those 1,424, I am prepared to concede that there will be about 400 mixed businesses with six-day licences who will not open on a Sunday, never did and do not want to, so that, in effect, what I am asking for is that 1,000 families in this country will be allowed to survive in the very modest circumstances which they at present enjoy.  Does any Deputy seriously contend that would create any insuperable administrative problem or damage anybody?</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is a single, decent seven-day licence man in the whole of Ireland who would wish to see his small six-day neighbour wiped out.  I am certain that in the county of Monaghan, or Mayo, there are no such people.  There may be some avaricious exceptions who say: &ldquo;Oh, I have a seven-day licence and I object to anyone else getting that accommodation where I have a vested interest,&rdquo; but their number is insignificant. As opposed to that, we are in danger of wiping out of existence 1,000 mostly relatively poor families. Surely the sensible thing to do here <Col N="1534" /> would be to wipe out the distinction between the six-day and the seven-day licences and let these small people carry on.  All that is involved is simply to say that on Sundays they will be entitled to open from 12.30 to 2 and from 5 to 9 and let their customers, if they want to, leave their baskets, their umbrellas, their horses and carts, or their bicycles, as they have been in the habit of doing.</P>
    <P>The thing seems so clear to me, and I know there are Deputies on all sides of the House familiar with the conditions to which I refer and who feel with me in this.  It is a source of astonishment to me why the Minister can be persuaded to this.  I myself went on the deputation&mdash;which is a practice I do not ordinarily engage in&mdash;to the Minister for Justice and discussed this matter with him.  The Minister, I must say, listened to the men who related their circumstances to him and that, I think, was the entire basis of their case.  All we want to do is to give them the right to survive.  I know a great many of them myself and I was in a position to certify from my own knowledge and considered judgment that if they were not given this facility, they would be wiped out.</P>
    <P>What argument is there for refusing it to them?  All they are asking is to be in the same position as the seven-day licence man in respect of their customers.  I think there is a lot of confusion in the House about that.  We took a policy decision, with the consent of the vast majority of the Deputies, to wipe out the <i>bona fide</i> trade and to put an end to this whole business of people travelling to drink, which was always illegal actually but which was done under the cloak of the <i>bona fide</i> which allowed people to drink to travel.  We wiped that out, and considered that equity and expediency directed that should be done, and when we wiped that business out, then the seven-day men and the six-day men in rural Ireland were all on the same basis.  They could not open their doors to anyone on a Sunday.  Is that not so?  But then for some utterly incomprehensible and mysterious reason, in the knowledge that there are 10,543 seven-day and 1,425 six-day licences we went on to say we shall <Col N="1535" /> let 10,543 publicans open from 12.30 to 2, and from 5 to 9 on Sundays, but will not allow 1,425 to open at all.</P>
    <P>When we realise that the 1,425 for whom we are not providing the new facility&mdash;which we are giving to the 10,543&mdash;are the poorest of the publicans, the family houses that are just able to carry on and keep a family going, I simply cannot understand the mentality which would make such a proposal.  I still cherish what is perhaps an illusion that if the Minister for Justice fully appreciated what he is being asked to do, he would resolve with me not to do it.  I know of no argument that can be advanced which carries real weight for the course proposed in the Bill.  I think every argument of justice, equity and charity&mdash; which after all still continue to bind us in this House&mdash;imposes on us the duty of giving these people the right to survive.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for one jot or tittle more than we are proposing, by legislation, to give to the 10,543 seven-day men.  I think people have lost sight of the fact that when we did away with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, all these publicans were <i>ex aequo</i> on Sundays.  Now we are making concessions to 10,500 of them which will operate to ruin 1,000 and I do not believe that the majority of Deputies want to do that.  I would urge the Minister to create a dynamic precedent in this House by saying that in light of the arguments I have pressed upon him, he proposes to change his mind.  Such a declaration on his part would do credit to himself and would redound to the usefulness of this House as a place where rational argument can still be made to prevail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the House has decided that public houses can be opened on Sundays&mdash;at least as far as the Committee Stage is concerned they have made that decision; whether or not it will be changed on the Report and subsequent Stages I do not know but I doubt that it will be&mdash;and Sunday drinking allowed to the extent of 5½ hours, I want to support, as strongly as I can, the amendment in the names <Col N="1536" /> of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Lindsay. I should like to stress, as Deputy Dillon did in the concluding part of his speech, that this amendment is not designed to confer any particular advantage on those who now hold six-day licences.  All that it is designed to do is to ensure that this House will not inflict what, in my opinion, will be a very grave injury on those people who at the present time hold six-day licences.</P>
      <P>It would be true for me to say that up to this the vast majority of people, the vast majority of the drinking public, in an urban area anyway, and I am sure the same can be said for rural areas, could not say whether a particular licensed premises was a six-or seven-day licence house because they were all regarded as being one and the same.  The very fact that this legislation has been brought in by the Minister is a recognition by him that the licensing laws as they have existed for so many years were not taken seriously either by the public or, in many cases, by the enforcing authorities. We should ask ourselves in what conditions and circumstances were these people originally granted their six-day licences.  I could not attempt to answer that in detail but I do not think there was any particular reason for giving a person in Mayo, Monaghan or Wexford, a licence to sell for six days.</P>
      <P>Somebody suggested to me that licences were given out by Justices of the Peace, resident magistrates, or some legal gentlemen, and that they gave them out sometimes in accordance with their political beliefs and sometimes in accordance with their religious beliefs.  There never seemed to be any justification for drawing a distinction by giving one a six-day licence and another a seven-day licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will be a very serious matter for the 1,424 six-day licence holders in the country.  I thought Deputy Dillon made an admirable case and I should like to reinforce that case from my own knowledge of six-day licence holders in the urban area I know.  It may mean that the 12 or <Col N="1537" /> 14&mdash;I forget exactly how many&mdash;six-day licence holders in Wexford town will lose their business entirely.  I believe it will.  The man who usually drinks in a six-day public house, and who will now be allowed to drink in a seven-day house, will naturally not continue to have his drink in the six-day house.  He will go instead to some seven-day house.  People who drink have the habit of going to the one public house.  Therefore, the man who had been in the habit of frequenting a six-day house but who transfers now to a seven-day house will continue to drink habitually there.  That will be very serious for the six-day licence holders.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that, though they all may not be forced to close up entirely, the majority of them will lose a substantial amount of business.</P>
    <P>Many of these licensed premises do not deal entirely in liquor; a big number are grocery shops as well. There is the danger that if Mr. X, the head of the household, chooses as his place to drink a licensed premises which is also a grocery shop, in many cases Mrs. X will transfer her custom there for the purchase of groceries as well.  For that reason, the Minister should reconsider this.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty of a Minister who is asked by the Opposition to take a certain course or to change his mind.  I know the Minister has already expressed certain views on this matter on the Second Stage and he probably has expressed his views to the many deputations he saw in the past few months.  But, even if he has his mind made up, I beg of him not to commit himself too far if he rejects this amendment.  I am not saying the Minister does not appreciate the difficulty in which these 1,400 people find themselves.  The Report Stage of Bills was introduced to enable members of the House, and especially the Minister in charge of a Bill, to have second thoughts.  If the Minister commits himself definitely, I know how difficult it will be for him to change his mind on Report Stage.  Therefore, I think it would be useful for him to listen to the arguments put forward by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Lindsay <Col N="1538" /> and other Deputies who may wish to speak and at least not to make up his mind definitely until Report Stage.</P>
    <P>There is another very serious aspect for these people.  As I said, up to this, there has not been much difference between a six-day house and a seven-day house and, so far as I am aware, there has not been any difference in the valuation of these premises.  There is no indication that their vaulation will be changed downwards if this amendment or a similar one is not accepted by the Minister. Therefore, it will mean that people who will lose a certain amount of business will still have to bear the same sort of expense as the seven-day house which will have an increased share of business.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that the six-day men can become seven-day licence holders by acquiring another six-day licence.  There is too much of the dog-eat-dog element in that sort of suggestion.  One can visualise a situation in a place like Mayo, which seems to have a tremendous number of six-day premises, in which they will be watching one another.  Mrs. Murphy will be watching Mrs. Doyle to see how her business is going, to see if she is coming to the end of her tether and if it is an opportune time to try to acquire her licence.  Apart from anything else, it will mean a lot of bad feeling in places where there are a great number of six-day licence holders.  I know that in one street in one town in my constituency there are ten or 12 six-day licence holders.  If this amendment is not accepted, they will be watching one another for the next three or four years, trying to starve one another out, as it were, in order to get the six-day licence relinquished so that another seven-day licence may be obtained.</P>
    <P>I would again appeal to the Minister to reconsider this whole position. I appreciate that his general viewpoint is&mdash;and I think it is the viewpoint of the House also&mdash;that in many areas we have too many public houses. I appreciate any effort on his part to reduce the number, but I do not think this is the way to do it.  I believe that under the new licensing laws, <Col N="1539" /> the public themselves will determine how many public houses we shall have.  In future, competition will determine what public houses will survive. We merely ask in respect of this minority that in the initial stages, they should not be put at such a serious disadvantage as this Bill proposes to put them.  Therefore, I believe the Minister should accept this amendment, or, if he likes, should bring in a similar amendment.  As I said, this amendment is to ensure, not that an advantage will be conferred on these 1,400 people but that an injustice will not be perpetrated on them and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to think that the main object of this Bill was primarily two-fold, namely, uniformity and enforceability.  If anything were ever aimed at helping the achievement of those things, this amendment in the name of Deputy Dillon and myself is so designed.  I should like to hear what the violent argument is that will be offered&mdash;maybe it will not&mdash; against what we seek to achieve.  All we are seeking to achieve is that these 1,424 families, or so many of them as would wish to do so, may be able to avail of the powers we should like to have established through this amendment. It is in those circumstances that I want to add my word to those already so forcibly and so admirably expressed by both Deputy Dillon and Deputy Corish.  Some people are inclined to think that six-day licence holders enjoy some sort of universal advantage by way of easier licence duty, by reason of the fact that they are six-day licences.  That, of course, is not so.</P>

    <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present session to enable an authority to be established for the <Col N="1540" /> purpose of providing a national television and sound broadcasting service, to amend and extend the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 and 1956, and to provide for matters connected with the matters aforesaid, it is expedient to authorise:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the payment to Radio Éireann out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas in respect of each of the five consecutive financial years beginning with that in which the day appointed to be the establishement day for the purposes of such Act by order of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs under such Act occurs of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an amount equal to the total of the receipts in that year in respect of broadcasting licence fees less any expenses certified by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as having been incurred by him in that year in relation to the collection of those fees and in respect of the performances of his functions under sections 12 and 12A of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 in relation to interfering with or injuriously affecting wireless telegraphy apparatus for receiving only, and</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ascertain from the Minister what is the basis for the proposed cost of the television service.  As I understand it, this Money Resolution provides for payment of certain sums to the new Authority made up of the receipts from broadcasting licence fees less any expenses incurred by the Minister and, under (b) 1 of the Resolution, such further sums not to exceed £500,000, and under (b) 2, an amount not exceeding £2,000,000 in the aggregate for capital purposes.  One of the difficulties in dealing with this matter is that apparently the Government have changed their minds since the original Commission was established.  The terms of reference of the Commission contained the following:</P>
      <P>On the basis that no charge shall fall on the Exchequer, either on capital or on current account...</P>
      <P>As I understand it this money resolution involves a charge in respect of both capital and current account and, in the course of the Commission's Report, reference is made to the cost involved.  Certain figures are quoted in Chapter 3, dealing with an estimated basis of a certain number of television licences, and on that basis they estimated that in the third year of operation there will be a net licence revenue of £330,000.  In addition to that there will be revenue from advertising of £350,000 making a total of £680,000 and on the other side total expenditure is estimated at £650,000.</P>
      <P>I refer to these figures because in the minority report signed by four members, Eoin Ó hAodha, Síle Ní Chinnéide, Michael Gibbons and Roger McHugh, at paragraph 23 on page 64, particulars are given of the cost of B.B.C. programmes per hour, exclusive of engineering and other costs, and these figures indicate that for the year 1956-57 the cost per hour was £1,538 and for 1957-58 it was £1,730 per hour. The paragraph goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In short, B.B.C. expenditure on programming per hour last year was nine times the amount which those <Col N="1542" /> applicants propose to spend on Irish Television programmes.</P>
    <P>That was in the year 1957-58.</P>
    <P>It rose in one year by approximately the total amount per hour which these applicants propose to spend on Irish television programmes.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, and the change which it proposes in the method of establishing a television service, the figures may not, to some extent, give a valid basis of comparison because the interests concerned who submitted schemes are replaced by an Authority which will be established directly by the Government but, at any rate, they give us a reasonable indication of the very high costs involved. For that reason I believe that the figures quoted in paragraph 23 are a much closer approximation of the cost of a comparable programme which the Irish television service will be expected to provide, if it is expected to compete with other programmes.  The last sentence in that paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>An Irish T/V service will be in competition with both B.B.C. and I.T.V. programmes.</P>
    <P>I raise this because from experience I believe it is difficult, once the State establishes a service or undertaking, to limit expenditure or to prevent it from being discontinued if it founders financially.  On this occasion, at any rate, it can proceed cautiously in the knowledge that experience elsewhere shows that expenditure rises rapidly and tends to rise continuously in order to provide anything like a service which is considered acceptable by the public.</P>
    <P>Quite recently a letter appeared in the daily Press from Mr. Maurice Gorham, who is the former Director of Radio Éireann and it contained this interesting paragraph:</P>
    <P>...from my experience of directing television in England, I knew the difficulties of running a good service even in a country with far greater financial resources than those we have here.  As director of broadcasting in Ireland I knew that <Col N="1543" /> Radio Éireann was still lacking in the resources it needed to do its job and cover the country, which it has never had the money to do. And putting the two things together, I doubted the possibility of having a good combined service on the terms proposed.</P>
    <P>That is an interesting commentary and one which deserves due consideration, being made by a person who has experience over a number of years of Radio Éireann and who also had television experience in England.  Even as recently as early this week Mr. Aneurin Bevan, in an interview published in a number of papers, including the London <i>Times</i>, commented on the fact that he was appalled by the appallingly low standard of the programmes with which television viewers were presented in Britain.  He went on to say that he did not regard himself as an expert but nevertheless it is an interesting commentary.</P>
    <P>It does not automatically follow because a programme costs a lot of money that it will, for that reason, be better than one which costs less but, taking into account the figures contained in the Minority Report which I have quoted, the opinion expressed after the number of years experience which Mr. Gorham had and the commentary on the standard of programmes expressed by Mr. Bevan, it is significant that a country which has far greater financial resources and a much bigger pool of viewers to draw upon has up to the present found expenditure rising and that, despite the resources and the large number of viewers, the cost has continued to increase.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that we should get from the Minister a clear indication of the basis on which the Government have decided that it will be necessary to provide only a sum of £500,000 in addition to the receipts from licence fees for the next five years, the implication being that after that a charge will not fall on the Exchequer.  That, I believe, is one of these pious hope resolutions.  Similar phrases are contained in a number of Acts but experience <Col N="1544" /> shows that, with very few exceptions, the hopes are not realised.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Report of the Television Commission that no adequate assessment of the basis of cost was made.  In fact, the terms of reference of the Commission expressly directed them to operate on the basis that no charge should fall on the Exchequer either on capital or current account.  The paragraph I have quoted and the figures contained in chapter 3 are, to a very considerable extent, vitiated by the figures quoted from paragraph 23, page 64, of the Minority Report.</P>
    <P>When a measure of this sort is introduced we should have an accurate and as full as possible assessment of the likely charge which will fall on the Exchequer.  In one significant remark in chapter 3 the implication is that no matter how the charges are made, whether through licences or otherwise, the cost will be borne by the Irish public, who will either have to pay more for a licence or for advertisements.</P>
    <P>Experience elsewhere has shown that the interests most adversely affected by television are the cinemas. In Britain there was a very considerable drop in cinema attendances. Evidence was given at the Commission here that in the case of an important group of Irish cinemas attendances had already fallen by 20 per cent. as compared with 1956.  It was only 18 months or two years after 1956 that that considerable drop took place. Press advertising is also likely to be affected.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether consideration will be given to the position of cinema authorities, that any portion of the tax will be remitted or whether, in the case of the Press, the question of remitting the five per cent. tax will be considered.  In any event, the general indications are that the cinemas and the Press are the interests likely to suffer most.  The cinemas and the daily, provincial and weekly newspapers give considerable employment and I would be interested to get from the Minister an indication of the basis on which it has been decided that the <Col N="1545" /> costs envisaged in this Money Resolution have been worked out because, on the facts as published in the Commission's Report and on evidence available elsewhere, it is difficult to believe that it will be possible to run a service which would be regarded as satisfactory on the basis set out in this Resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reecho the views expressed by Deputy Cosgrave suggesting that there should be some very much more accurate estimate of what the possible annual burden on the Exchequer will be because what this House is only too prone to forget at this stage of our deliberations is that whatever the protestations of the Minister for the time being may be, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Treasury will be the first target of attack if the programmes do not give universal satisfaction.</P>
      <P>I am bound to say that when I see unfavourable comparisons made between Radio Éireann and foreign stations and it is said that the material broadcast by Radio Éireann lacks entertainment interest, I often wonder if similar criteria are used to judge the foreign entertainment.  I do not care to single out a particular foreign station but I know that Radio Luxembourg is extremely popular in this country.  To describe the material which it disseminates as being stimulating or remarkable, I think, would be excessively complimentary, to say the least.  There is a continued dissemination of advertising programmes on Radio Luxembourg and I often have to make the choice between Radio Luxembourg and Radio Éireann in the middle of the day.  My son likes Radio Luxembourg; I like Radio Éireann but, then, I must admit that Radio Luxembourg usually has Elvis the Pelvis, and Radio Éireann has not.  I am not at all sure the comparison is unfavourable to Radio Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, with that in mind, the Minister already has experience of the extreme degree of criticism to which he is anually exposed.  When we have so responsible and prudent a critic as Mr. Gorham assigning the <Col N="1546" /> reason why programmes on Radio Éireann have failed to be all people would wish, that Radio Éireann never had sufficient resources, that if they had more money, more equipment and better premises they might have done better, I do not doubt that in some degree that is true.</P>
    <P>However, I venture to say that 90 per cent. of the populace and 90 per cent. of Deputies here, in the event of our television programmes failing to please, will not compare what is being disseminated by Independent Television or by B.B.C. Television with what we have.  They will simply say: &ldquo;The programmes are dull, dreary and lack variety.  Why do they not get more money?  What is wrong is they have not enough to provide the kind of fare we expect to see.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By the time these complaints are made there will have been a very large capital investment in television sets throughout the country, and you have a very powerful vested interest here clamouring for more money to meet this service.  It may be unpopular to say it but still it is true that more and more money will be needed from the Exchequer to meet this service which will be a service for a section of the people the cost of which will be a charge upon us all.</P>
    <P>I do not think this House has received at any stage of these discussions anything approximating to a responsible estimate of what the cost of this service will be.  I do not want to sound a spoil-sport or to suggest that it is fated to be a heavy burden but I am bound in conscience to say I think our approach to the whole problem is improvident.  We are embarking upon a liability the scope of which we have no real knowledge and we are not confined to the actual cost of the distribution equipment. We are inviting our people to make a very large capital investment at the rate of about £80 a set for the purpose of receiving programmes we shall distribute. When that investment is made no Government here will be able to say if the burden proves to be financially intolerable: &ldquo;Scrap your sets.  You will get no more reception.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are entering upon an irrevocable <Col N="1547" /> commitment and if I were the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I would feel extremely uncomfortable if I were not honestly in a position to give the Dáil and the Government a more accurate estimate of the ultimate liability, founded on much more substantial material than has been provided to them by anybody.  I am conscious of the fact that he has told us there are parts of the Report on Television which he has not thought it right to communicate to the public. This published report is only partial. There may be facts and evidence in his possession which give him a clearer picture than we have received but, if there are, I do not think he has a right to keep that confidential.</P>
    <P>I freely admit there may have been people who made information available to him on the condition that its source would not be revealed and if its nature is such that it cannot be published without indicating the source, then I admit the Minister is constrained to silence.  However, I cannot but imagine that if he has material giving him an accurate or approximately accurate prognosis of what the ultimate liability of the Exchequer will be, he could give that to us in such a form that its source would not be readily detected and I think the House would be quite prepared to received it from him on his personal assurance that it accurately corresponded with the evidence presented to him.</P>
    <P>There is one detail to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention. I put down an amendment and the reason I am raising it on the Money Resolution is that I apprehend that the Money Resolution might require some amendment if my amendment were to be permitted.  In Section 15 of the Bill there is a pension scheme envisaged.  All I want to do is to provide that the fullest discretion will be preserved in preparing a pension scheme.  Subsection (4) says the Minister for Finance reserves the right to approve or reject any scheme submitted to him, and therefore the Minister's authority to insist on a prudent scheme is fully preserved.  All <Col N="1548" /> I want to suggest is that the Minister and the Authority should have preserved to them the statutory right to consider either a contributory or a non-contributory scheme.  It may be they will decide the contributory scheme is the right scheme but I am informed the preparation of a pension scheme of this kind is a highly specialised business and the Minister ought to retain a discretion to consider any form of scheme even if he has to say firmly to the Authority: &ldquo;I shall not approve any scheme but a contributory scheme.&rdquo;  Then if the Authority came back and said: &ldquo;We should like to lay before you a non-contributory scheme which we think has advantages the contributory scheme would not have,&rdquo; the Minister would be free to say to them: &ldquo;I shall listen to you but I warn you it will take a good deal of arguing to change my mind.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Last July when the Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting came before the House some of us raised certain questions in relation to television.  Nine months have gone since that time and so far absolutely nothing has occurred to make me change the views I expressed then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time the Minister indicated &mdash;and I do not quarrel with him for doing it at that time&mdash;that he did not <Col N="1549" /> think the time was ripe to discuss the points of view in relation to television which had been put up by various Deputies.  The fact is, however, that in no public statement outside the Oireachtas or in the other House or this House has the Minister taken anybody into his confidence as to the reasons which prompted him to come to this decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dismissed, without bothering to controvert, the suggestions that have been put forward from many sides that the costing estimates which were included in the majority report were unrealistic and unlikely in our circumstances to work out in practice.  I am interested in this now only from the point of view on which Deputy Cosgrave and Dillon have just spoken&mdash;interested, as I said last July, from the point of view of someone who once had the responsibility of looking after the national purse.  Perhaps soon that responsibility will devolve again on somebody from these benches.</P>
    <P>Once the television service is set up and brought into operation it will be virtually impossible for any Government ever to discontinue it when it becomes an accepted fact.  No matter what Government is in power, no matter what the service may cost, the Government will have to provide the wherewithal to run it because the public taste will have been whetted. No Government will be able to stop or discontinue it.  Therefore, before we set it up we should have it crystal clear in our minds that the basis on which we are setting it up is a sound one and one likely to succeed.</P>
    <P>The Majority Report at paragraph 36 given us the Commission's view that the annual running cost would be of the order of £650,000. That is based on an estimate of £300,000 for servicing capital and £350,000 for annual running costs.  On all the information that has been given to the public by the Minister or anybody else I consider those figures utterly and completely unrealistic. They are nonsensical in so far as the information given to the public would enable one to judge.  I know that there are some confidential documents which were given to the Minister and which <Col N="1550" /> have not been disclosed.  In regard to those, I wholeheartedly support the appeal made by Deputy Dillon that the Minister himself should make a summary without disclosing the confidential elements of the proposals and that he should give in his summary sufficient information to enable the House to form a judgment.</P>
    <P>We must realise that in regard to an Irish television service we are caught in a circle.  We have the B.B.C. service capable of being received over a very large part of the State; we have the Ulster commercial service likewise capable of being received over a large portion of the State.  Both services can be received reasonably well in the part of the State that is most heavily populated and most likely to attract the greatest number of viewers.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I admit that at one stage I said that I would not have television in my house and I was then faced with the alternative, whether to be able to keep my children in my own house or have them trotting down to somebody else's house each time there was something they wanted to see on television.  I came to the conclusion that it was better to have them under my own supervision at home and have a television set in my own house.  I have had it only since we discussed this last July but in consequence I have a little more personal experience of this since then.  In Kill, we get at night perfectly good reception both from Ulster commercial television and the B.B.C. transmission.  In day-time it is, perhaps, not quite so good but it is reasonably good.  It was good enough to enable us to see that we had lost our money on the Grand National.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, in the situation that in Dublin, and in the line running out across the midlands until we get to Athlone and then going up diagonally north-west, in all that area, even with the present standard of technical development, we can get good B.B.C. and good commercial television reception.  As long as that is the case, unless an Irish television service can produce something that will not merely compete with those but will be more attractive to an <Col N="1551" /> Irish viewer, the people will not tune in to the Irish service&mdash;whether &ldquo;tune in&rdquo; or &ldquo;look at&rdquo; is the correct phrase does not matter.  People will not look at an Irish T.V. programme unless they feel that for them it is better than the B.B.C. or U.T.V. If they do not tune in to the Irish programme they will not become viewers and, if there are no viewers, the receipts from the commercial end of the authority will go down.  If commercial receipts diminish we shall not be able to provide as good a programme as we could otherwise provide. We are caught in the middle of a circle.  If our programme is not as good as, or even slightly better, than the other two, considered from the point of view of our own people, we shall not have viewers.  Without viewers we shall not get commercial receipts and without those we shall not be able to afford to put on a good programme.  If we are to spend money on putting on good programmes we must try to get it back.</P>
    <P>I fail to see how, by and large, it will be possible to provide an Irish television service that will appeal on a basis of £350,000 for running costs when one compares that with the cost of the B.B.C. programmes which are set out in paragraph 23 of the Minority Report on page 64.  As far as I can work it out the Majority Report estimate of costs works out at something less than half&mdash;nearer to one-third&mdash;of the B.B.C. figures.  One has to take into account in comparing hour by hour figures in Britain&mdash;as is done in paragraph 23&mdash;the fact that their transmision is for a greater number of hours than, perhaps, our transmission would be.  If we are to be able to carry on an Irish television service on the figures we had in the Majority Report I think we can only do it on the old canned basis&mdash;as I said last July&mdash;which, I may say in passing, was taken up and misquoted in the Seanad by the Minister without mentioning my name when he was obviously referring to what I said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was &ldquo;old canned.&rdquo;  If you try to run the service on the basis of the Majority Report estimate, it will not be a service of currently recorded material. It will only be a service of &ldquo;old canned films,&rdquo; re-issues of material that has already been used in Canada, America, and elsewhere.  Perhaps the best analogy is to say that we will be in the position of &ldquo;second run&rdquo; picture houses.  If the television service is to be run on that basis, it will not attract viewers. If it does not attract viewers, nobody will bother to advertise.  If nobody bothers, or if not a sufficient number bother, to advertise, then the result will come home to whoever happens to sit in the seat of the Minister for Finance in this House.  That is why I want the House and the country to realise that, in taking these decisions to set up this service, without any proper explanation to the country or to the Oireachtas of how the two very different estimates of costs are reconciled, we are inevitably taking a decision which will, at some stage, react on the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>In relation to the fixed grant that will be made to meet capital cost, I do not suggest that the estimates on which that is based are wrong.  I do not know enough to be able to offer any opinion but I am quite certain that the servicing of the capital cost, the interest and the annuity to meet the sinking fund, on the published material will not be there; and, if there is material which is unpublished which shows that it will be there, then the House and the country has a right to have such unpublished material disclosed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It stands to reasons that the steady programme viewer will look for the best.  The best that a person here can get will be, without question, something that is occasionally of real interest to an Irish viewer and of no interest whatsoever to a viewer in Britain.  I do not want to use the words <Col N="1553" />&ldquo;intrinsic merit&rdquo;, but regardless of the &ldquo;technical merit&rdquo; of the two programmes, the Irish viewer will look at the programme which is of interest to him, and that will only be a very trifling part of the whole programme broadcast during the hours set out.  If the viewer plumps for some other programme, you will not get commercials to sponsor programmes.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has a duty to make clear to all of us the exact basis on which he, with his confidential knowledge&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; purely in the sense that the knowledge is not disclosed generally&mdash; has seen fit to jettison the comparison of costs with other established television services.  On what grounds does he accept the running basis included in paragraph 36?  Until such time as he explains that in detail, and with conviction, as far as I am concerned, I personally shall continue to believe that, though the intention may be to set this up without its being a charge on the taxpayer, so surely as we are sitting here, the taxpayer will ultimately have to foot the bill to keep the service going.  Once it is set up, it will be impossible for any Government ever to close it down again.</P>
    <P>This, therefore, is the time to consider clearly the basis on which it is to be set up.  My firm conviction is that no television service set up here will be able to operate on its own revenue receipts because our population is too small and too sparse.  It is inevitable, therefore, that if we are to depend on it alone, there will have to be annual contributions from the Exchequer.  That is not the basis on which it is put before us, but, in reality, it is the basis on which it should be judged, with all the information that has so far been published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave is under a misapprehension in relation to this Money Resolution.  I gathered from his speech that he thinks the grant of £500,000 is a grant to the television service as distinct from the broadcasting service which the Authority will operate.  This grant of £500,000, payable over the five-year period, is a grant towards sound broadcasting only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1554" /> It is to be used for sound broadcasting only.  I have already explained that the sound broadcasting service is financed out of three services to the extent of £130,000 per annum.  The new Authority will be obliged to reimburse the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and whatever other Departments may be involved, from the date of its establishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House will permit me, in a few sentences, I shall explain the whole thing.  There is a capital advance of £2,000,000 and £1¼ million of that amount will cover the physical assets, that is, the new studios, the five transmitters, sites, roads, etc. There will be £250,000 for working capital and for initial losses for the first year or so.  Further, £500,000 capital is being made available to the Authority, and it is expected that the Authority will utilise that £500,000 for the provision of, say, V.H.F. network, or for making further capital available for new headquarters or new studios for sound broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, and I am advised, that £500,000 would not cover the cost of providing V.H.F. service and new studios for sound broadcasting, but it would cover the provision for the V.H.F. network all right.  Having settled that, I am of the opinion myself, and I have been advised, that so far as the capital required for the initiation <Col N="1555" /> of the service and for the physical assets of the new Authority is concerned, that is a liberal estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Television Commission had certain estimates and £1¼ million is the most liberal of the estimates before them.  I am quite satisfied that £1¼ million will be sufficient. There is a sum of £250,000 for working capital.  There may be greater losses in the first year or so than we anticipate, but nevertheless I am satisfied that the capital provision for the new Authority is sufficient.</P>
      <P>So far as the financial prospects of the new Authority are concerned, I dealt in some detail with that matter in my Second Reading speech, and I pointed out that the licence fee would enable the Authority to meet its obligations in regard to these capital commitments.  We expect it will do so.  I have no reason to doubt from the advice I have got from my advisers in the Department that it will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only matter on which it is necessary to approach the question of the financial prospects with caution is, as has already been pointed out by Deputies on the opposite side, with regard to the income from commercial advertisements.  We cannot be so sure about that matter and it is true, of course, that if the viewing public is not sufficiently large, the advertising firms will not be too anxious to advertise on a service that is not looked at to the same extent as some of our competitors.  Nevertheless, the fact is that in Radio Éireann, at the moment, we have a large number of commercial firms taking advantage of the time allotted for commercial broadcasting, and we have a fairly large number of applications in the Department from interested people <Col N="1556" /> who wish to avail of our television service for the same purpose.  If we get the support of the commercial firms, and if they use the service to the extent to which we hope they will use it, I have no reason to doubt that this service will pay its way within a very short number of years.</P>
    <P>I am supported in that belief by 15 members of the Television Commission. As I have said, we must approach this matter with caution.  I have already gone into detail on the question of the estimated income of the Authority from advertising.  I have already compared the charges for advertising which obtain in the Ulster Television Service with what the Authority can charge here, and I have indicated that the income from commercial advertising revenue will undoubtedly reach the figure of £250,000 per year.</P>
    <P>The other side of the question then is: what would it cost to programme the television service?  The Television Commission have indicated&mdash;they have not said so in their Report&mdash;that £600 per hour would be sufficient to provide Irish produced programmes&mdash;that would be for sports or any other programmes provided in the country itself &mdash;and that £100 per hour would be a liberal sum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the course of my remarks on the occasion mentioned I referred to attacks on the language policy from various sources, including some of those mentioned in the Deputy's question. Evidence of these attacks is available in the daily and weekly <Col N="1560" /> papers.  As I stated on the same occasion, I believe it is necessary that the organisations interested in promoting the language should realise that this opposition to the national policy in regard to the language exists and that, therefore, a greater effort than ever before is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before progress was reported, I was pointing out that the Commission estimated an annual cost of £350,000 a year.  They made no subdivision of that £350,000 as between live programmes and filmed programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But they did.  They said 25 per cent. live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1563" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of the cost.  It is understood that the cost would be £600 an hour for live programmes and about £100 an hour for films or telerecorded programmes. The cost of the service will depend on the amount of Irish-produced programmes the Authority will use.  In this connection, it is well to note that the B.B.C. and other large organisation who engage top stars pay fabulous fees to the people who come along to their service.</P>
      <P>I feel we can provide a television service with less expensive features than the British Television service without sacrificing good quality or reducing the appeal of our programmes to the Irish public.  It is true that in the past we have heard a good deal of criticism of our sound broadcasting service.  I have great respect for the opinion expressed by the Director of that service who recently tendered his resignation, Mr. Maurice Gorham.  My attention has been drawn to that fact by one of the speakers in this debate.  His expressed doubts on the financial success of the television service have also been brought to my notice.  In presenting this case to the House, I have taken cognisance of Mr. Gorham's opinion.</P>
      <P>When one is tendered an opinion, one must go further than that when one is the Minister charged with the responsibility of introducing this service, a service in which we have not any practical experience.  I realise my responsibility in initiating this service. I keep in mind my responsibility in regard to the possibility of this service becoming a charge on the Exchequer.  I am convinced that that will not be so.  I am convinced this service can be maintained and operated without becoming an ultimate charge on the Exchequer.  I am convinced the service can be made pay for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to confidential documents supplied by contracting firms or groups when it was originally understood that the television service here would be operated by a private group and not by the method envisaged in this Bill.  These documents <Col N="1564" /> were submitted on a confidential basis.  The originators of the documents pointed out that their tenders were confidential and should not be made known to the public.  I must respect that contractual obligation. Nevertheless, several of them were satisfied&mdash;people with practical experience in this field&mdash;that they could operate a television service in Ireland without a licence fee.</P>
    <P>If people in private enterprise could operate an Irish television service without a licence fee, a public authority, set up by the authority of this Oireachtas, must be capable of operating a television service here when they will be in receipt of the licence fee, which is no small amount.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I know that the public authority will not be in the same position as a private group to make a television service more remunerative to themselves or to the State.  Nevertheless, even though they have certain national obligations imposed on them in this measure, with the income from the licence fee and the income which we hope they will get from their commercial advertising, the Authority will be enabled to make the service pay its way and redeem the capital invested in it.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there were any other points raised in this debate to which it is necessary for me to reply at the moment.  I think I have covered the questions I was asked.  In so far as the question in regard to superannuation addresed to me by Deputy Dillon is concerned, the amendment to Section 15, I do not think that matter comes up for any amendment on this money Resolution.  I have high hopes that we shall be able to get an agreed scheme.  As I indicated to the Deputy, in that event, I shall be putting down an amendment to Section 15 myself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>There were at least three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought there were two.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There was at least one service that was going to get money somewhere else.  There was another proposal which was, in my view, not a proposal for any purpose except looking ahead to shut a back door on a raid on British commercial television rates, if I may put it that way; otherwise, if they had not got control, the British commercial rate receipts might be tempted away.  Those are the only two I know of.  There may be a third.  That is the type of information that could have been given without any disclosure of confidence. The Minister must keep anything that was put to him confidentially in confidence.  I know something about some of those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am completely bemused by his figures.  I understand that the figures he gave us now are the same as those <Col N="1566" /> in paragraph 43 of the main Report. I think they are based on £600 an hour. As an average cost, the estimates in paragraph 43 of the main report are £600 an hour.  Unless I misheard, that is what the Minister said.  If they run to £600 an hour, how does the Minister propose that by and large one week with another over the whole year a £600 an hour programme will compete with a £1,800 an hour programme?</P>
    <P>It can only be for one of two reasons: that people will look at the Irish programme, no matter what it is, just because it is the Irish programme&mdash;and I do not accept that&mdash; or that the British are throwing away £1,200 an hour on their programmes. I do not think that is likely, either. They may be slightly more lavish than they need but they are certainly not going to be lavish to that extent. These are the only two reasons.  If the Minister was right in saying that this estimate is based on an average&mdash; I think it is; I think his calculations from what one heard were correct&mdash; then it seems to me that the comparison is quite nonsensical.</P>
    <P>There is another point which the Minister has not taken into account in the figures he gave us in relation to the Authority as a whole, that is, that it is undeniable and it is accepted in both the Majority and Minority Reports that the establishment of an Irish commercial television service is going to draw some revenue away from sound broadcasting in Radio Éireann.  Will the Authority have to meet that drain?  I see the Minister shaking his head but it is accepted in the Report that it is inevitable. Whether it can be filled up in another way is another question.</P>
    <P>The Minister said a second ago that when he came to this House he gave some figures in respect of the finances in that regard.  I have here his speech on 24th February.  There is no detailed break-down at all to show why he maintains that a £600 an hour performance will be able to compete day in day out, week in week out, and month in month out with a £1,800 an hour performance.  It may be that is so&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but there must be <Col N="1567" /> some very special reason why it is able to do so.  I think the House should be taken into the confidence of the Minister.  It should be told what is this great secret which enables one to compete with something which costs three times as much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to accept the argument now advanced by Deputy Sweetman, we would not attempt anything in this country because we are a small country and because we are not in the same financial position to provide television programmes as the BBC or ITV.</P>

      <P>This Authority will provide a service that will compare favourably&mdash;and, perhaps, more than favourably&mdash;with the programmes provided by similar services in other parts of the world.  In other small countries, the native service is quite capable of providing a programme for its people which is in keeping with the traditions of the people.  I think that the public authority envisaged in this Bill will be in a position, within its resources, to provide an Irish service.</P>
      <P>The more expensive features, as I have pointed out, provided in a British programme may not be provided here. We could not afford to provide them. We could not afford to pay the fees the B.B.C. pay for top artists and for studio equipment and such factors which go to make their spectacular shows.  Nevertheless, we can provide a live show which will be looked at and listened to by our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the forecast made by Deputy Sweetman that this service will have a detrimental effect on sound broadcasting and on the income which that service is already obtaining from the fees paid to it by commercial firms for broadcasting time, I want to point out to Deputy Sweetman, and to the House, that Radio Éireann up to now have been restricted to Irish firms only in regard to the people they could permit to broadcast on their <Col N="1568" /> service.  That restriction is being removed now.</P>

      <P>No, it has nothing at all to do with the withdrawal of the Hospital Sweeps.  It has nothing at all to do with that matter.

      <P>Have I correctly taken up the Minister as saying that the estimate of £350,000 running cost is based on an average of £600 an hour? The Minority Report suggests something entirely different.  The Minority Report suggests that three of the proposals were for very much smaller figures and that is why I suggested that they were merely blocking the back doors, if these figures are correct. I do not want to misquote the Minister <Col N="1569" /> I only want to get the position clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  What I said was that a live, Irish-produced programme would cost £600 an hour and the tape recorded or filmed programme would cost £100 an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it comes to a question of the proportion which one has to the other, but the basis of the Majority Report of the Commission is on a basis of 25 per cent. live material.  Therefore, I presume that means on the Minister's figure of £600, or for 25 per cent. of the programme £100 and something else for the remaining 75 per cent.  Is that right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept 50 per cent. as costing at this stage £600 and 50 per cent. at £100 an hour?  I think it would work out at every two hours broadcasting costing £350 an hour.  Would that not be the mathematical difference?  How are we to have programmes which cost only £350 an hour competing with programmes which are received here, costing £1,800 an hour?  That is an average for the B.B.C.; it is not a maximum.  It is an average B.B.C. figure.  Why, in those circumstances, will people look at it for the whole time?  Unless they look at it for the whole time, the commercial results will be disastrous.  Why would they look at it?  The answer is quite simple, that we are taking on, in this way, more than we can chew.  What we should do is to make certain that sufficient income will go into the Authority from the beginning, to give the Authority the chance of producing programmes that will compete and then it will get the commercial receipts <Col N="1570" /> because it will have the viewers.  But in this way the Authority are going into the ring to fight for viewers with their hands tied behind their backs. When we are sending them in that way, the result, in the last analysis, will be that the Minister for Finance of the day will have to make good the difference.</P>
      <P>There were other suggestions which the Minister has thought fit not to accept.  That is his responsibility, but as surely as we are considering this today, it will not be possible to get commercial advertisers, hard-headed commercial advertisers, to accept the programme of the type we are considering and vie with the other one. You will get them for peak times, say, between 6.30 and 7, or 10 and 10.30, whatever the best times are for the average person&mdash;I am not an average person; I look at it perhaps at queer times&mdash;but you will not get them at the other periods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, it is appropriate to discuss on this section the policy or outlook which will govern the members appointed to the Authority who will be charged with the responsibility of running the new service to cover both sound and television broadcasting.  On that, I should like to get some indication from the Minister as to what he has in mind.</P>
      <P>One of the unsatisfactory features of the manner in which legislation has been introduced and indeed the policy behind it&mdash;I know that to some extent the Minister inherited this&mdash;is the change of outlook.  When the Commission was established, it was decided, according to the terms of reference, that no charge would fall on the Exchequer. Subsequently, that Commission reported and the Government decided to introduce the present measure.</P>
      <P>About the same time, they appointed advisers to the Minister and since then structural work has been proceeding in regard to equipment such as transmitters and so on.  But it is difficult to ascertain from all these various developments&mdash;the establishment of the Commission, the decision to establish an Authority as envisaged in this legislation and the appointment of advisers to assist the Minister in the course of the preparation of this legislation and so on&mdash;what actually is the Government's policy on the type of service it is expected to provide for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me while there are many advantages which may flow from the establishment of a television service, there are also serious dangers and drawbacks involved and the consequences of such a service may be such as would make it necessary to provide certain definite safeguards.  It is only in comparatively recent years that television has developed to the stage we know to-day.  Whether it is in the United States, where it has been in existence for a number of years, on the Continent or in Britain, up to the <Col N="1572" /> present, we have not felt anything like the full impact of it.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to certain dangerous consequences. I quoted earlier the remarks made this week by one viewer who did not profess to be an expert.  Nevertheless, one would regard him as a person having some experience of general conditions.  Mr. Bevan, who had time to view television, said he was appalled at the generally low standard.  Leaving aside entirely whether a person likes a particular type of broadcast, whether he is interested in drama or music or other matters of that sort, Mr. Bevan was appalled by the low standard.  No matter what service is established here, this country will, because of its proximity, be exposed to a considerable extent to the influence of what he has described as, and what I think a lot of people would agree with him is a standard other than that to which this country could hope to aspire.  Quite recently, when a youth was charged with murder in Britain, he said he had viewed similar happenings on television and that he had got the idea from plays, shows or films which had been shown on television.</P>
    <P>I mention this merely to emphasise a fact which I believe the Government and the House should be cognisant of, that is, the vital importance of having on this Authority people of the highest integrity and people who are capable of differentiating between what should be provided in a television service and what should not.  There are sufficient problems confronting the youth of the country, as well as youth generally, without putting forward on a national service of any sort ideas which are not only contrary to their interests but contrary to the interests of humanity.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I believe the greatest possible care should be exercised in the choice of the members of this Authority. The Minister in the course of his observations in the Seanad very properly said it was not proposed to appoint a censor, that the matter would be left to the good sense and discretion of the Authority and those appointed by it.  That seems a reasonable approach on the assumption that the persons appointed are persons of <Col N="1573" /> integrity, persons in whose judgment the House and the country can have confidence.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this matter to which I think attention should be drawn at present.  From time to time, criticism has been expressed of views which were given over Radio Éireann&mdash;and there may be criticism in the future of views given over the television service&mdash;on the ground that they were political views or expressed an opinion on matters which could give rise to controversy.  I do not object to controversy and I do not object to a conflict of views, but I think that if controversial matters are to be discussed, both sides of the question should be given and that an adequate opportunity should be afforded to opinions on both sides.  It is quite improper, and indeed a great abuse of a public service, that a particular viewpoint on any matter, whether a matter of current political or economic interest, but particularly political, or even events within living memory, should be put forward without other views being given.</P>
    <P>If you have a round table discussion or a debate, then the team or panel or whatever it is described as should represent different views in order to give a balanced presentation to the listener and to the country.  If, on the other hand, it is a review of a book, a story or an historical talk and only one particular view can be expressed at one time, then on another occasion, without an unreasonable gap in time, a contrary view, if there is one, should be afforded full opportunity.</P>
    <P>I believe that support for this Authority and its acceptance by the public as a genuine effort to provide an Irish television service of a high standard will inevitably depend on the capacity, ability and standing of the persons appointed to this Authority. Their standing in the community, and acceptance by the community as people of standing, will be sustained and justified if in the establishment of this Authority there is a recognition that the Government have attempted to appoint people&mdash;as they are entitled to, some of whom, if necessary a majority, would reflect their own <Col N="1574" /> political viewpoint&mdash;who will be people of integrity, of capacity and of ability, and that their interest is to give the country the best possible service without any political or other bias. That is the most likely bias, though some views were expressed elsewhere that there might be a need for certain viewpoints to be represented on the Authority.  I do not accept that because since this State was established there has been universal recognition, implemented in practice, that all are equal before the law.</P>
    <P>So far as any danger of political impressions, or any dangers of the other aspects I have mentioned, are concerned, I believe it is important to have an Authority in which the country will have confidence, knowing that the members are anxious to provide a service that will measure up to the high standards and the high ideals which we believe should inspire our sound and television broadcasting service.  In that way we can be assured that no programme or broadcast will be permitted on that service unless it accords with the high standards which we believe our Christian heritage and civilisation make it incumbent upon us to uphold, and nothing but that which we believe is appropriate for all sections of the community should be portrayed by the television Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed my opinion as to the type of people who should find their way on to this Authority and I may point out that this section authorises the Government to make the appointments.  Therefore, there is a serious obligation on the Government to make certain, as far as they possibly can, that the proper people will find seats on the Authority. I fully agree with the statement that has been made by Deputy Cosgrave that the appointments should not be made on a political basis; neither hould the members of the Authority be representative of any particular sectional interests.  They should be Irish people with a deep and broad knowledge of Irish life.  They should be people in whom we would have confidence as persons conversant with the effect that a television service will <Col N="1575" /> have on the minds of the public, young and old.  I am fully convinced that unless we obtain people of a very high standard with a very good knowledge of Irish life, capable of applying their minds in a business way to the operation of the service, people who are fully conversant with our heritage, both national and Christian, we shall not get from the Authority the service that we desire.</P>
      <P>The policy to be pursued by this Authority is laid down in a broad sort of way in other sections of the Bill.  I do not propose to go into that matter at the moment.  It is true that censorship is not provided for in the Bill because we place the matter entirely in the hands of the Authority but, of course, they will have a liaison with the Film Censor and, in the last analysis, the public will be the censors. If it should happen that there be a television show that would not measure up to our standards, it would be necessary for the Minister, or the Government, to take immediate cognisance of that, and for the Authority itself to take cognisance of it and do something about it to make certain there would not be a repetition of shows that were sub-standard, so far as our ideas of good shows are concerned.</P>

      <P>It could be a motion. Once the Government are responsible for the appointment of the members of the Authority, I do not see how they could shed any responsibility in that particular matter.  There is one matter I forgot to mention in relation to the candid expression of opinion given by the Leader of the main Opposition Party in so far as Government responsibility in the making of appointments is concerned.  I was pressed in the Seanad to consult with the Opposition Parties so that we could get general agreement on the personnel of the Authority.  I resisted the suggestions put to me and I want to say that I am grateful for the candid expression of opinion, made by the Leader of the main Opposition Party, which confirmed my own view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister was right in resisting that suggestion, not merely in the national interests but in the interests of all the political Parties in this House because, once it came about that the political Parties were entitled to make nominations to this Television Authority, every Party in the country would be scalded with about 20 fellows claiming to have super-national qualifications to be members of it.  If a Party had a right to make only one nomination, and 40 people sought its support, it would have the remaining 39 howling after it for what they would call their gross and ignominious betrayal.  That method of appointment would make no appeal to intelligent people and I think the Minister is right in resisting that suggestion.</P>
      <P>I should like to get one piece of information from the Minister.  I gather the four members of the Authority have been provisionally appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that needs clarification.  I have always a good deal of sympathy with a Minister trying to give as much information as he can.  Sometimes all the implications of a question addressed to him do not immediately present themselves to him when he proceeds to deal with it off the cuff.  I understood Deputy Dr. Browne to inquire whether individual items of a programme could be raised by way of question and answer in this House and was the Minister prepared to accept responsibility.  I understood the Minister's reply at least to imply that that was so.  I am not quite sure that the Minister meant to imply that that was so.  I can imagine that a very strange situation would arise if you establish an independent Authority to operate Radio Eireann and if, by question and answer, every item of a programme could with propriety be raised here by way of Parliamentary question and answer.  I can well imagine the situation arising in which a motion could be put down calling for the resignation of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for cause stated and time being provided to discuss that.  That is clearly within the Parliamentary competence of any responsible Deputy of the House and, in certain circumstances, Government time would be provided and, in other circumstances, Private Members' time would be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, let us be clear on this.  If I hear <Col N="1578" /> a book review on the radio that I do not like or that I think is tendentious, is it proposed that I should be entitled to ask the Minister a Parliamentary question as to whether he does not think the book review in question was tendentious and what steps he proposes to take in regard to it?  I very much doubt if that is in the best interests of the proper administration of this service and I should like to be clear in my mind what the intention is.  I rather imagine that we desire this Authority to have a certain quasi-autonomy while retaining in the Oireachtas the ultimate right to determine major issues of policy but that, in setting up the Authority, by implication, we divest ourselves of the claim to deal in detail with each programme by way of Parliamentary question and answer as we are entitled to deal with the day-to-day administration of the Minister's Department by Parliamentary question and answer.  That is a distinction that I want to make.  Does the Minister make that distinction because, if so, I think he has created ambiguity in his desire promptly to answer the question put to him by Deputy Dr. Browne?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want any doubt to exist in regard to this matter. When Deputy Dr. Browne asked the question, I assumed he was making reference to a programme that would be regarded by the people as generally objectionable.  I was not dealing with any particular item in a programme, in a different class of a programme. Take a situation in which you would have a general objection expressed, say, at county council meetings or at other meetings at which our people come together, similar to a situation which developed recently as a result of a programme from another broadcasting service.  If such an objectionable programme were put out by our broadcasting service and our people took grave exception to it and so <Col N="1579" /> expressed themselves, I think it would be very hard for a Minister to resist a discussion on the matter in this House, a matter that was of vital interest and which so affected the moral standards of our people.  It is true that the Authority will be an autonomous Authority and that the Minister will not have any interference whatsoever with the day-to-day programmes of that Authority but we have an overriding responsibility to our people in the matter referred to by Deputy Dr. Browne.  I think I would be failing in my duty to the House and to the country if I gave any type of answer other than the answer I have given to Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked the question yesterday the point I was interested in was the ability of the public to apply pressure to the Minister&mdash;that is all&mdash;and the facility of doing that through a Deputy in the House.  On the general principle, this has been very valuable in years gone by in relation to Radio Éireann.  It is a tribute to Deputies that they never abused their right to inquire into things they disliked, a tendentious review of a book, and so on.  They have never abused that right.  In view of the fact that this is a very considerable extension and that television is a tremendous propaganda and educational medium, I just wonder if it is a pity that we should have deprived ourselves of that right and if it would have been wiser, in view of the experimental nature of the type of television Authority we are establishing&mdash; a commercial type&mdash;to retain that right here and to be in a position to apply pressure on the Minister directly in the form of Parliamentary question. I cannot see why we have departed from that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the analogy that Deputy de Valera draws between the State company and this Authority, and the acknowledged difficulty of trying to run a State Corporation subject to daily interference from the Dáil, everybody knows that that is true but, in view of our experience and the experience in other countries, America in particular, and even in the UTV <Col N="1580" /> recently, of the possibilities, of the deterioration in standards and the poor, bad standards, under the commercial type of television service, it would seem to me that it would be wiser to retain a greater measure of control in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously, if it were left to Deputies in the Government Benches, to put down critical questions or contentious questions in the House, understandably we would have a very equable time all the time.  We cannot accept that, because we have a most conscientious Minister just at the moment in charge of the Department, we shall always have such a Minister.  Therefore, I think the responsibility of maintaining the standard of the service should be vested in the whole lot of us so that our accumulated standards may achieve the high level of television service that we all have in mind.</P>

      <P>This is new.  I do not think the same sentence is used in any other Bill.  We regard this Authority in a different manner from other semi-state authorities because of the special position in regard to the service it will provide.  If a member is removed from that Authority there will certainly be public notice and the matter may be raised in the House.  The Government appoints the member to the Authority and under Section 6 the Government may at any time remove that member from the Authority. Therefore any Deputy is free to raise the question of his removal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Governments do queer things sometimes, regardless of who is in Government.  I am very glad to hear the Minister say he regards this Authority as being different from other State authorities. The Minister has completely delivered himself into our hands in relation to Section 8 because his defence in relation to Section 8 is that Section 8 is the clause that went into all such Acts. However, we shall come to Section 8 in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Section 6, the Minister should consider adding that where a member of the Authority is removed the Government must state the reason, if so requested by the person removed. It does seem unfair that a man could <Col N="1583" /> be sacked without being told, of right, why he was being sacked.  There ought to be a provision that if the person concerned wants the reason the Government should so furnish him with the reason.  It then becomes a matter for the person concerned whether he wishes to publish the correspondence or not.  Otherwise Governments&mdash;I am using the word in the plural, not in relation to any particular Government, no matter how much I may think that Government may misbehave itself&mdash;are in a position of appalling power over the individual members of the Authority who may differ genuinely and in a <i>bona fide</i> manner from them.  If they can be just removed without any notification or without publication of the reason, then it puts the members of the Authority in the position of being merely puppets.  Having regard to the very special nature of this Authority I can see the Minister's reason for wanting to have some power to that effect, but if the Government may remove a member they should state the reason. That gives a person acting on the Authority a status and a stature he would not have otherwise and it equally preserves the right and the power of the Government to deal with a difficult situation.</P>

      <P>Let us assume these are full-blooded individuals who will have a political viewpoint and who may be tempted to express an opinion during an election and let us say their arguments are favourable to the Government in power.  If there is a change of Government is it not possible they will get the sack as do certain people from time to time when Governments change?  I shall not mention names.  A judge was sacked recently because he expressed some opinions in favour of the Republic.  A man may express a viewpoint politically and be victimised afterwards.  It is my opinion that only in consultation with somebody else should the Government have power to remove a member.  To say that a political group without anyone else's concurrence should decide that someone ought to be sacked is most arbitrary and could be used in the most arbitrary manner.  We do not know what the future holds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

He has told us that four people are to be offered posts on this Authority but the Tánaiste and Minister for Health would not be elected without the activities of one of these people who is his mainstay. Surely the Minister is not going to muzzle his colleague's mainstay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>In Section 4, which we have been discussing, it is laid down that members of the Authority who are nominated as candidates for either House, or who are, for the time being under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas, entitled to sit therein, will cease to be members of this Authority.  That is what is provided in the Bill and that is the position in regard to people in political Parties who happen to be members of the Authority.  Power to remove a member from the Authority is a matter to which I have given a fair amount of consideration. No Government will dismiss a member of the Authority save for a <Col N="1585" /> very grave reason.  It may be said that certain people were dismissed or were replaced on other authorities but arbitrarily to dismiss a member of this Authority is a different matter.  It is not a thing that will be lightly undertaken by the Government.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of making speeches and the reason for a person's dismissal from the Authority there are two ways of looking at it.  It could be that it would not be in the public interest to disclose the reason at that particular time and, as I have already said, any Deputy is entitled to put down a question on the matter.  If the Minister of the day feels it would not be in the public interest to give the reason he can say so or he can give the reason if he deems it advisable to do so.  Furthermore, the member of the Authority if he wishes can himself give the reason or what he thinks is the reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kind of insidious propaganda that is being spread about by people who detest Parliamentary democracy&mdash;really by people who hate freedom.  I am a little shocked to hear a Minister in an Irish Government say, even by inadvertence, that participation in politics obviously disqualifies a man from being a member of the Authority controlling radio and television.  Why should it?  A man participating in politics&mdash;is he not perfectly well able to take a strong view and yet discharge his duty on an Authority of this kind faithfully?  I hope I shall not shock people if I say that I like people who have political convictions; I am getting a bit sick of the hurlers on the ditch who are seeking in this country to elect themselves into a kind of superior body of men and, because they are afraid of the dust of <Col N="1587" /> the arena of public life, they set their gross forms upon the ditch to inform all those who are engaged in the active work of public life of what they should or should not be doing, always provided that the hurlers on the ditch are not required to shed their perspiration nor to receive any of the dust back.</P>
      <P>My reaction to these people is to desist from the battle sufficiently long to eliminate them from the ditch and then to return to the work that those of us who have reached this House and our friends outside who are associated with us in public life are doing in the service of our country.  I have had occasion to refer to this in connection with other Bills.  I do not know the source of this poisonous doctrine; I am reluctant to locate it in the bureaucracy but there is a danger that every Minister will be told: &ldquo;You cannot have politicians there&rdquo;.

      <P>I might quarrel with him if he were.  He may be utterly daft.  To my way of thinking, he certainly is; but, so long as he feels he has a public duty to sustain the daft doctrines of the Tánaiste, and has the courage to come out in public and nail his flag to the mast, I have a great deal more respect for him than I have for the noodie-nawdies who are afraid to nail their flag to any mast and who spend their lives sitting on it for fear anybody might discover where it was ultimately going to be nailed.</P>
      <P>What shocks me a little is that the Minister seems to have put himself in a position of extreme difficulty by an affirmation which I do not think he meant to make.  Certain it is that, if his criterion is to be strictly applied, one of the persons whom he himself has told us he intends to invite on to this Authority is already disqualified. I do not think he ought to be disqualified.  If he is fit to go on this Authority and if he discharges his duties conscientiously, the fact that he is the Tánaiste's right and left hand and right and left foot makes him no worse, in my opinion.  I should like the Minister to clarify this matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the House to pause here and think.  I do not think political affiliations&mdash;well known, notorious&mdash;should <Col N="1589" /> necessarily disqualify a person from a post of this kind.  I see in America, with edification, prominent members of the Republican Party and prominent members of the Democratic Party sitting down in joint consultation on works of public service analogous to this.  It is a source of satisfaction in the United States of America that a Democratic President will ask a prominent Republican to share in public work of this kind side by side with prominent members of the Democratic Party.  I think it is true that in Great Britain at the present time one sees prominent figures in the Conservative Party collaborating with prominent members of the Socialist Party on bodies of this kind.</P>
    <P>Far from thinking it undesirable, I think it is quite admirable.  I go further: I think you will find it extremely difficult to find anybody who has no political convictions fit to go on a body like this.  If the Minister's criterion is to be applied, we might finish up with a collection of milk-and-water old &ldquo;doodies&rdquo;, who are not fit to do anything.  I do not necessarily say they must all be politicians.  There may be distinguished scientists and distinguished scholars, who are not in the ordinary current of politics, who would adorn a body of this kind.</P>
    <P>I reject most emphatically the suggestion that, because a man plays a dignified part in the public life of his country, he is to be excluded from this body.  I am prepared to accept that, if the role he plays in public life involves membership of this House or of the Seanad, which is to be the ultimate authority to control the Authority set up under this Bill, he should not, I think, be a member of both, though I am not sure that that rule applies in Great Britain.  I think in England they have members of the House of Commons and members of the House of Lords on bodies like the B.B.C.  But the fact that they do it in England is no reason why we should do it here. and I would be prepared to go so far with the Minister.</P>
    <P>We have certain functions.  We are members of the Oireachtas.  We have functions we can probably discharge <Col N="1590" /> as members of the Oireachtas and it may, on the whole, be best that those of us who are charged with responsibility of membership of the Oireachtas should not ordinarily be members of what is a subsidiary body.  I hope the Minister will clarify his position in this matter.  Mark you, I think the House should feel indebted to the Minister in that he has tried freely and frankly to give us, at the shortest possible notice, any information we asked for in the course of this debate.  As he knows in his long experience of parliamentary procedure and, as we know, trick questions can be formulated which often elicit an answer which goes perhaps somewhat further than the Minister would go, had his answer been prepared for him by a wily old civil servant who knows the ropes and has had time to measure them all.</P>
    <P>Leaving that question to one side, I want now to return to the matter of the removal of a member of this body.  Is there any Deputy on either side of this House who likes a section which reads: &ldquo;The Government may at any time remove a member of the Authority from office&rdquo;&mdash;full stop?  I do not think that is a proviso that will commend itself to Deputies on either side of this House.</P>

      <P>I think the section ought to provide: &ldquo;The Government may at any time remove a member of the Authority from office for cause stated or for a reason indicated to the member of the Authority in writing&rdquo; or something of that kind.  I want to make it quite clear to the Minister that I am not trying to force him into a position, the full implications of which are not clear.  I think that, if you concede that, you are conceding something that flows from it, that is, if the Government have a statutory duty to refrain from removing a member from the Authority without cause, if they in fact have a duty to show cause, that would confer upon this dismissed member of the Authority the right to go to the High Court to demonstrate that the cause alleged was not valid. Whether his remedy would be in damages or by way of injunction, I am <Col N="1591" /> not sufficiently versed in the law to say, but do you not think that he ought to have that right?  Do you not think a person ought to be protected from arbitrary dismissal?</P>
      <P>I think it is one of the good things about modern democratic society that the trade union movement makes it impossible today for an employer to dismiss an employee, except under certain circumstances.  You cannot dismiss a member of a trade union in Ireland, without stating the reason, full stop.  The reason must be stated. I have had a long experience as an employer of dealing with both men and women, unorganised and organised, and I am prepared to say, after that experience as an employer, that it is a good thing for an employer to have present to his mind the fact that, if he attempts to act arbitrarily in respect of labour, there is a power in existence which requires him to show cause.  Is not that much more important in the case of the individual <i>versus</i> the Executive?  Is it not the whole tendency of our law to create the situation in which there shall exist in this community no arbitrary authority from which there is no appeal to an independent tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from the actual loss of office, picture the reaction on a man or woman, presumably of distinction, who has been appointed to this board, and has accepted appointment, and a notice appears in the papers: &ldquo;Mr. or Mrs. So-and-So has been removed from the Authority, full stop.&rdquo;  Surely that person should have a right to a remedy.  Surely that person should have the right to try out the imputation of unsuitability.  If there is genuine difference, and the member is convinced that his continued membership of the Authority is no longer practicable, that he cannot fall in with the general policy being adopted by the Authority, the ordinary course would be for the Minister to see that person and say: &ldquo;Look, we are reaching a situation that is impossible.  Here is the difficulty.  I want to part good friends, but it is quite clear we cannot continue to collaborate.  I suggest you should resign.&rdquo;  If the person feels that is reasonable and sensible, and that his <Col N="1592" /> conscientious convictions do not permit him to collaborate any longer with the Authority on the policy they are pursuing, he or she will resign.  No trouble arises in that way.  Suppose he says: &ldquo;I cannot do it.  I accepted certain responsibilities and I believe I am faithfully discharging the responsibilities which I undertook.  I believe it would be wrong to renege upon them.&rdquo; The Minister says: &ldquo;I respect and admire your convictions but I also have my duty and it is to remove you from the Authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it the view of this House that a person in that position should not have the right to say to the Minister: &ldquo;For what cause?&rdquo;  I think he should.  If it is manifest that the Minister has acted in an arbitrary and unreasonable way, that person should have the right to go to the courts and make the case before an independent judiciary that he was faithfully discharging the duties he undertook to discharge, and that there was nothing on his record to disqualify him from membership of the Authority which was not there present and well known to the Minister when he first appointed him.</P>
    <P>This is my last word on the matter. On its merits, I think the case I am making is strong.  I implore Deputies to remember&mdash;and the Minister agrees with me&mdash;that there is probably no precedent for this section in its precise form.  There may be, but it is contrary to the general principle.  I want to warn the House that I have seen many of these precedents established. They are nearly always slipped into Bills that do not matter.  They pass, and then they turn up in some very vital context, and the Minister rambles in with four or five precedents and says: &ldquo;You were a member of this House when this other Bill was passed and you never objected to it.&rdquo;  You even find you did not.  In fact, you did not because the principle was first established in connection with an insignificant body which nobody cared about, and which nobody could foresee would ever give rise to any difficulty of substance.</P>
    <P>Therefore, first, because I believe this principle in itself is wrong and, secondly, because I believe it is establishing a precedent on an important <Col N="1593" /> occasion which will certainly be quoted hereafter to justify a similar procedure, I advise the House to join with me in pressing on the Minister now the necessity of an insertion to the effect that removal from the Authority can only be for case stated, or for reason shown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Dillon and other Deputies have stated with regard to this section.  The Minister has said that it is unique and, in my view, it is very dangerous to put such a section into a Bill of this kind.  In the first place, it appears, and should appear to any reasonable Deputy, that a section of this kind, misused as it may be, must destroy any suggested independence of the Television Authority.  From the policy enshrined in the Bill, it appeared that subject to the Charter contained in the Bill, the Television Authority would be an independent Authority.  That may be desirable, and it is certainly understandable, but if we provide that a Government may remove any member of the Authority and need not state the reason, the effect, in my view, is to destroy the independence it was intended to give.</P>
      <P>The effect of this section could easily be to make the Authority, or certain members of the Authority, servile to the Government.  I do not think that is a good policy.  Certainly, since this State was formed, a number of different authorities and boards have been set up to run great projects under the benediction of this Parliament and in relation to none of those authorities or boards has a section of this kind appeared.</P>
      <P>This policy is wrong and I do not think the Minister has so far adduced any reasons in support of it.  The Minister said&mdash;and we could all accept this&mdash;that no Government will dismiss a member of the Authority, except for a grave reason.  I am inclined to agree with the Minister that that is possibly so, but since the Government would have a grave reason I cannot see any way in which it would be undesirable at least to indicate it to the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> It is important that if a person is removed from office here in this House, where we represent the people, that reason should be examined and criticised, if necessary, but as the section stands at the moment if a Parliamentary Question were asked as to why a person was removed by the Government, the Minister would be perfectly entitled to say: &ldquo;I shall not give any reason.&rdquo;  That would be wrong, and it would be quite wrong that such a removal should take place and that as we are after all representing the people in this Parliament the general public, through this House, should not be entitled to pass judgment on the action of the Government in removing such person.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister after the Committee of this House has finished with this section to consider it between now and Report Stage. He could provide some safeguards which would ensure that no arbitrary action could be taken by the Government. I do not suggest that the section should contain what is usual in measures of this kind: that a person can be removed only for a specific stated reason such as misconduct, insolvency or matters of that kind.  I do not think it is necessary to go so far.  The person may be removed for some reason quite conformable with his character and outlook but his removal may be a matter of policy, so far as the Government are concerned. Whatever the reason may be, it should be stated and it should be possible to consider in this House whether or not the reason is, in fact, a good one, and, arising from a discussion here, for the people outside to come to their own view about it. As the section stands, it is a bad section.  It is the first section of this kind in a Bill of this kind in the history of this House and certainly it should be resisted.  I recommend the Minister very earnestly to consider this matter further between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it might not be advisable for the Minister to have to give reasons.

      <P>With regard to Deputy Sherwin's point about participation in political organisations, I do not think I have any real necessity to correct anything I said.  I pointed out that Section 4 restricted membership in so far as the persons to be appointed members of the Authority would become candidates in elections.  Then I proceeded to deal in a general way with membership of the Authority in relation to persons who engaged in public controversy in a very big way. There are extremes in everything.  It is easy to go to the other extreme and say that nobody with any connection with political Parties should be members of this Authority.  That is not the position at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent members of the Authority from being members of any political Party.  Neither is there anything to prevent them from taking an active part in political Parties. The Government will have to bear in mind that in Section 18 the Authority is obliged to maintain impartiality in the presentation of news and public discussion.  I subscribe to <Col N="1596" /> the view that it is proper for every citizen to take an active part in the political life of the country and, in their simple way in their own localities, to be active members of political organisations and to express themselves as such to their neighbours and anybody else when the needs be.</P>
    <P>I think the country would be very much better off if we had very many more people taking an active part in our political organisations.</P>
    <P>As regards this Section 6 which was drafted so as to read: &ldquo;The Government may at any time remove a member of the Authority from office,&rdquo; I have now been advised&mdash;even though I have been forewarned by Deputy Dillon in connection with precedents&mdash; that in the case of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Gaeltarra Éireann and Bord Fáilte members may be removed without cause stated but with the difference that in the cases I have mentioned the appointments are made by the Minister, while in this case the appointments are made by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government felt at the time the appointments section was being put into the Bill that it would give an added importance to the Authority by reserving to the Government the power to appoint its members.  This is a new venture.  It is an Authority charged with the provision for the people of a television service.  It was felt that the Government should have this authority to remove a member. I do not think that that will make the Authority in any way inferior. Neither do I think it will leave the Authority under any obligation to the Government, that it will make the Authority or the members of it just puppets of the Government.  I entirely disagree with that viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Power is taken in the Bill to remove a member from office.  I have said, and it has been conceded by Deputy O'Higgins, that a member will not be removed except for a very grave reason.  Who can envisage a situation in which the Government would remove nine members, one after the other, by the use of this Section 6?</P>

I want to ensure that in 20 or 30 years' time, if the Statute is still on the Book, that obligation will continue to lie on the Government of the day.

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if in relation to the National Farm Survey, 1957-58 (east and midland region) in respect of (a) 50-100 acre farms (b) 100-200 acre farms and (c) over 200 acre farms he will state (1) the total number of hired workers, living in and living out, entering into hired labour expenses in each size group, (2) the number of farms in each size group, (3) the average number of man-weeks work for hired labour in each size group, and (4) if piece work is appreciable, the approximate extent of piece work.</P>

      <P>In the 1957-58 National Farm Survey, there were 158 farms included in the 50-100 acre size group, 105 farms in the 100-200 acre size group and 65 farms in the over 200 acre size group in the East and Midland region.  The average hired labour per farm, expressed in man-weeks, was 21, 54 and 172 in these size groups, respectively.  The basic records are not in such a form as would permit of the extraction of the data required concerning the total number of hired workers in respect of whom hired labour expenses were incurred. Examination of the individual records shows that piece work was not appreciable.</P>
