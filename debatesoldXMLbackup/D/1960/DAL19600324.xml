    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £13,130 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for the Expenses of Prisons, St. Patrick's, and the Maintenance of Prisoners confined in District Mental Hospitals (17 &amp; 18 Vict., c. 76; 34 &amp; 35 Vict., c. 112, sec. 6; 40 &amp; 41 Vict., c. 49; 47 &amp; 48 Vict., c. 36; 61 &amp; 62 Vict., c. 60; 1 Edw. 7, c. 17, sec. 3; 8 Edw. 7, c. 59; 4 &amp; 5 Geo. 5, c. 58; and No. 9 of 1956).</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is due mainly to the number of prisoners in custody being somewhat higher than expected and to pay increases secured by prison officers under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.  The increase in prison population has made it necessary to recruit some additional staff and has also necessitated increased expenditure under the headings of victualling and escort and conveyance.  There is an increase of £1,310 in the expenditure for the maintenance of prisoners confined in district mental hospitals and it is expected that the receipts from prison manufactures will be £2,150 less than estimated.  The total additional sum required is £13,130.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I heard the Minister say there was an increase in expenditure for maintenance amounting to £1,300 odd; yet the figure on the Estimate appears to be £1,280. Is there some discrepancy there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary Sum not exceeding £800 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1960, for the Expenses of the Maintenance, etc., of Patients in Dundrum Asylum (8 and 9 Vict., C. 107; and No. 19 of 1945).</P>
      <P>The need for this Supplementary arises from the granting of improved basic scales of pay to the attendant staff at Dundrum Asylum following negotiations at conciliation level within the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.  The revised scales of pay are the same as those for comparable grades within the prison service which were granted following an Arbitrators' award also under the scheme for Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is calculated that the cost of these increases for the current year will amount to £1,100.  There are, however, savings of the order of £200 ordinarily available on the Salary Subhead of the <Col N="1056" /> Vote and, in addition, it is possible to take credit for a further saving of £100 on another subhead thus reducing the additional sum required to one of £800.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the increases in pay which give rise to this Supplementary Estimate relate only to the basic scales of the attendants in the Asylum.  The Supplementary Estimate does not include anything in respect of the general cost-of-living increases granted with effect from the 15th December, 1959, to the Civil Service. The additional expenditure involved in meeting this latter increase in respect of the staffs of the Dundrum Asylum has been included in the general Supplementary Vote for Increases in Remuneration which was passed by the House on the 2nd of this month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather puzzled by the Minister's reference to the increased cost of living adjustment of September, 1959, inasmuch as the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and himself have been loudly proclaiming that there is not any increase in the cost of living.  The Minister has revealed the fact that for some reason best known to themselves, they found it wise, on the basis of negotiation, and without going to arbitration, to arrange for a wide scale adjustment of salary scales which does not seem to chime with their claim that the cost of living has not increased. Perhaps the Minister will explain this discrepancy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no discrepancy. The cost of living increases relate to a decision which was arrived at very early last year.  The present Supplementary Estimate, and that is the only thing we are entitled to discuss, arises not out of any readjustment of scales in respect of the cost of living&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You said they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. Perhaps the Deputy did not follow what I did say, which was that the need for the Supplementary Estimate which we are discussing arises out of a revision of the basic rates of pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> We are improving the scales, not in relation to the cost of living, but in relation to the value of the services rendered.  I merely, for the information of the House, mentioned the fact that another Supplementary Estimate had covered the general increase granted to the Civil Service relating to the outside trend of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wanted was a clarification of what the Minister was saying.  I think he told the truth this morning.</P>

      <P>I do not know, a Cheann Comhairle, whether you are aware that during your absence there was considerable difficulty on procedure in regard to the amendments.  Consultations were held between the central office, the Minister and myself with a desire to facilitate procedure.  Certain procedure was worked out as a result of which I have an Order Paper here with notes by the central office.  I am advised that there would be a division on amendment No. 1 which would govern certain other matters.  I am advised that there would be a division on amendment No. 2 which would govern certain other matters and that amendment No. 3, unless amendment No. 2 was carried, would be put.  I submit that amendment No. 3 should now be put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in any difficulty.  The amendment does not stand in my name at all.  I am simply here trying to carry out an agreement which, after consultation, I entered into with the Ceann Comhairle to help him in disposing of a number of very <Col N="1061" /> complicated amendments.  I have here in my hand an Order Paper noted on behalf, so far as I am aware, of the Ceann Comhairle, indicating how the divisions are to be taken.  I certainly was left under the impression that certain consequences would follow from the decisions on amendments Nos. 1 and 2, that there would then be a decision on No. 3 and that various other amendments would be governed by the decisions taken as we went along.  It was clearly indicated that amendment No. 3 would be accorded a separate division.  I do not know if Deputy Russell was consulted in this matter.  The amendment stands in his name.  That is what I was informed and I think we ought to be able to divide upon it now.  Is there any procedural method whereby, by agreement, we can divide?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I suggest, Sir, that we put the amendment down for Report Stage, if that would be acceptable to Deputy Russell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather at sea about this whole procedure.  I was not consulted, although the amendment stands in my name.  It does seem right and reasonable that the House should have an opportunity of deciding whether or not they want the closing hour amended to 11 o'clock.  I am aware that there is a large body of opinion, I might say on both sides of the House, that would favour that amendment as a reasonable compromise.  The Minister himself indicated two or three weeks ago that he would consult his colleagues in the Government with a view to accepting my amendment.  Of course, if the Minister accepted the amendment now, it would overcome all these difficulties.  I suggest that it is a very important amendment and one that would carry a good deal of support and that certainly should be put to the House, if the Minister does not see his way to accept it.  In the interests of unanimity, and in the interests of the Bill as a whole, I would urge the Minister to accept it <Col N="1062" /> even at this stage because it would help the carrying out of the intentions of the Bill if he did so.</P>

      <P>The procedure by which a question is put in the form in which it has been put, &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo; is one which encourages anybody who wants to make any change in the Bill to vote against the motion.  By a big majority, the House has voted in favour of the Bill as it is.  That does not preclude the possibility of an alternative proposal being submitted to the House on Report Stage.  It would seem to me to be asking the House to stultify itself now, the House having decided to retain the Bill as it is, to ask the House to make any change in the Bill prior to Report Stage.</P>

We have tried to meet the Minister, although he did not seem to think so last night, by discussing all these together and then taking divisions without separate subsequent discussions. <Col N="1064" /> That is what we are now doing. There has been some misunderstanding and I see the difficulty for all concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete from and including &ldquo;if&rdquo; in line 20 down to and including &ldquo;or&rdquo; in line 23.</P>
      <P>As the law stands there is a closing hour between 2.30 and 3.30 p.m. in the four county boroughs.  I can speak with intimate knowledge only of the position in Limerick.  The position in Dublin, Cork and Waterford may be different but in Limerick a large proportion of the licensed vintners are also grocers and carry on a considerable business in this section of their trade.  At present, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays, the publicans in Limerick may, between 2.30 and 3.30 p.m. serve customers coming in from the country areas to do marketing and shopping in Limerick.  If and when this measure is enacted they will be prohibited from serving anybody between 2.30 and 3.30 p.m. irrespective of whence they come.</P>
      <P>These restrictions will not apply outside the county boroughs and it will be possible in places as large as Galway, Sligo, Clonmel and, I think, Dún Laoghaire and other large urban centres to serve customers between these hours.  I appreciate that the Minister makes provision in his amendment to allow customers to be served with non-intoxicating liquids or goods during these prohibited hours but this would be a cause of more confusion than assistance.  Therefore in accordance with the general principle which appears to permeate this Bill of effecting a degree of rationalisation throughout the State between the urban and rural areas, there should be no restriction on the sale of drink between the opening hour in the morning and the closing hour at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the earlier discussion on this Bill Deputy Dillon advocated that the ideal thing would be to have a certain number of hours for drinking whether it be up to 11 or 12 at night and that there would be no restriction.  The effect of that in time would be that <Col N="1069" /> people would not take advantage of these longer hours.  I think it is correct to state that where you have restrictions the tendency is to break those restrictions, and the sweetest drink is the one just before or after hours.  In prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor between 2.30 and 3.30 p.m. in the four county boroughs the Minister is in effect encouraging the person who likes a drink within the prohibited hours.  This Bill provides an opportunity to rationalise the procedure so as to allow the public, be they tourist or local, to take an alcoholic drink between the hours of 10.30 in the morning and 11 or 11.30 at night.  I do not believe it would be abused.  Instances were given here of centres where there are virtually no restrictions, where you can drink 24 hours a day, and the records show there are fewer instances of excessive drinking there than in the areas where restrictions apply.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am associated with the position in Limerick and I know that the Limerick traders, of whom, I understand, over 50 per cent. engage in other business besides the sale of intoxicating liquor, will suffer a severe loss if the new proposals come into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCarew" hpid="Mr. Carew Mr. Carew">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>For the same reasons as Deputy Russell, I seek the abolition of this closing between 2.30 and 3.30 p.m. It very seriously affects Limerick city.  Limerick city is a market city and it has fairs, auction marts and so forth, and there are a considerable number of traders to whom the 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. closing hour has been a source of irritation.  I might say that a violation of the law has taken place because a man may have one part of his shop for the sale of groceries and provisions and another part for a bar and he has to clear the entire premises of people if he has not already made provision for the division of the bar from the grocery part of his premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider abolishing this closing hour seeing that so much latitude is being afforded in the Bill to the drinking public.  It is unfair that it should operate in the four county boroughs.  I cannot speak for Dublin or Cork&mdash;it may suit them.  I <Col N="1070" /> think a good percentage of the traders in Dublin are wholly engaged in the sale of intoxicating liquor, whereas in Limerick approximately 50 per cent. engage in mixed business.  The licensed traders in Limerick hold strong views on this point.  They feel that its abolition would help the smooth running of their business.  From experience, on market days, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, when we have fairs, auctions and marts, this hour has caused these traders some inconvenience and I ask the Minister to consider its abolition in Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>A situation has arisen in Cork where a number of traders serve a snack meal during that hour and I wonder if the new regulations will interfere with that or prevent them from carrying on that trade which they have developed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">

      <P>In Dublin city, the majority of the houses are trade union houses and if we do away with this hour's closing, it will necessitate practically every publican seeking additional staff.  I do not know whether from the publican's point of view that is a bad thing; from another point of view, it might be a good thing.  Certain publicans have assured me that occasionally, after weddings and such functions, people may come in with a few drinks on them and it is a good opportunity to clear the house at that time when the law says they must close.  They feel generally that this hour is economically suitable for the publican and at the same time, helps to enable the house to be run more efficiently.</P>

      <P>This feature of the licensing laws was introduced as far back as 1927.  It has been regarded by almost all shades of opinion as being one of the most valuable features of the licensing laws inasmuch as it brought about a break in drinking.  Without this closing, certain individuals&mdash;I do not suggest that everybody indulges in it&mdash;could go into these licensed premises in the early morning and continue drinking without cessation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> I cannot see any merit at all in the suggestion made by Deputy Russell in this respect, because he must be fully aware, as I am, that this has operated for over 30 years in Limerick.  It is something that is now so well established that I doubt very much if any business people are concerned about the matter at all.  We must realise that it is only for one hour and that it gives a break to the publicans and to their assistants, as well as to the ordinary public.  I cannot see any great inconvenience being caused either to the publican or to his customers in the closing of the premises for one hour and I would not be prepared to accept an amendment that would bring about an abolition of the closing for one hour which is provided for in the licensing laws.  It would be a retrograde step and one that would not commend itself, I think, to the vast majority in the House or to the vast majority of people outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to oppose the amendment.  I do so on the specific ground that this closing hour during the afternoon has two effects: one, it means that during that hour there is a cessation of drinking in public houses and people cannot go in in the morning and stay there all day; and secondly, it makes it possible for the publican with staff to fix reasonable working hours and conditions for them and allows him to have a change of staff, if necessary.  Another point is that in the case of the family publican who may not have staff it provides an opportunity of having a midday break.  Surely such people are entitled to a break as well as everybody else.</P>
      <P>If this amendment were accepted by the Minister&mdash;and I am glad to see that he is not prepared to accept it&mdash;it would mean that in cases where no staff are employed, or very little staff, the circumstances of the people would be materially worsened.  For these reasons, I feel that the amendment has no merit whatsoever and should not be supported.</P>

      <P>I have very little to <Col N="1072" /> say about this amendment except that I agree with Deputy MacCarthy in his suggestion that the modern trend in licensed houses is to serve food.  Many people consider that a 2.30 to 3.30 p.m. closing hour is slightly too early and I would agree with that because many people go to lunch around 2 o'clock.  These traders in the city and in populated areas who at the moment are serving snacks and meals will agree with me that the closing hour would be slightly too early at 2.30.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the purpose of this closing hour, when it was brought in in 1927, was to prevent the all-day sitter staying in the pub.  If that is its purpose, I do not think the timing of it really matters much so long as it is there. This hour was very acceptable to the licensed trade pre-war because they availed of it to allow their staffs to go home to lunch, but, in 1939, when war broke out and when the Gas Company and the E.S.B. had to curtail their services, staffs were permitted to go off earlier for lunch so that they could avail of &ldquo;the glimmer.&rdquo;  That system has been carried on still and the licensed trade no longer avail of the 2.30 p.m.-3.30 p.m. period for staff lunches.  If the closed period were postponed until 3.30 p.m. I should feel inclined to suggest that another half-hour could be added to the closing period and that the public houses should close from 3.30 p.m. to 5 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Russell and Deputy Carew said in relation to this in Limerick where there are licensed houses doing mixed trading. On market days and fair days&mdash;not so much fair days in Limerick, I agree&mdash;the business of these people would be greatly affected by closing for such an unusual hour as 2.30 p.m.-3.30 p.m. In England, where they observe strict licensing laws, it is possible to go into a licensed house during the closed period and buy goods other than intoxicating liquor.  On Second Reading, it was suggested that the doors of licensed houses should be opened rather than closed at such times.  I suggest that where mixed <Col N="1073" /> trading is carried on, doors should be left wide open and if the licensee is caught serving intoxicating liquor during the closed period, heavy penalties should be imposed on him but he should be enabled to carry on his ordinary business such as drapery, grocery or selling soft goods.  I agree with the suggestion that the closing period is most acceptable to the public and to the trade but the Minister should consider having the closed period a little later in the day.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any great principle involved in this amendment but I am personally against closing from 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. chiefly because I think the Garda will not be able to enforce it.  We all know that as it applies now, it is not enforced.  Very many people in Cork, and perhaps in Dublin as well, are quite unaware that the law now states that public houses must be closed from half-past two to half-past three. I do not think the Minister is being very realistic when he suggests that on occasions where you have big gatherings in Cork city, say, that it will be possible to close from half-past two to half-past three.  Take the days during the annual Summer Show in Cork.  Thousands of people pour into the city and between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m., immediately after lunch, is the time when the visiting farmers like to chat with the labourers whom they meet and in the ordinary way they go to a public house for a drink. It cannot be seriously suggested that the Garda can be expected to raid public houses between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. on occasions like that.  There would be very serious difficulties in endeavouring to enforce the law at such times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly in the case of workers such as dockers who get a break, not at any particular hour, but when a cargo is unloaded or at some stage of the unloading, to have a drink, is it suggested that arrangements which are working in the docks&mdash;in Cork, at any rate&mdash;can no longer be continued, and that if, in the normal course, their break comes between 2.30 and 3.30 p.m., these men doing heavy manual work will not be able to enjoy the <Col N="1074" /> facilities now available to them to have a drink before resuming work?  Many other people employed on the railway and in the Post Office and similar jobs very often end their day's work at 1.30 p.m., 2 p.m., 2.30 p.m. or 3 p.m., having started early in the morning.  I think they are entitled to the facility of having a drink on the way home.  Many of them do not come out again for the night.  Because of that, I think there is no justification for the suggested closing in the county boroughs and I am in favour of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Could I ask for a word of clarification?  Does this section not mean that if you have a mixed business, grocery, hardware, bar and drapery, during this hour, you may not serve drink in the bar department of your premises but you are entitled to carry on your general business of grocery, drapery, or boots or whatever commodity you are selling on the premises? Certainly, so far as rural Ireland is concerned, although the opening hour in the morning may be fixed at 10 or 10.30, you would open your general business premises and sell drapery or soft goods&mdash;as Deputy Belton described them&mdash;but you may not sell anything out of the bar until the real opening hour comes.  Does the same rule not apply in a general business where there is a bar department? It is not suggested that a firm like Clerys, if it had a bar department, would have to close its doors in the middle of the day to conform with this?  They would simply be precluded from opening the bar&mdash;is that not so?</P>

Because of business and other reasons, few have any great need to go to a public house at that time.  I suggest that so far as Dublin city and county are concerned, there should be no change.</P>

      <P>When the Deputy has considered what I have to say, he may change his mind on the matter.  This matter was carefully considered back in 1927 when it was first introduced.  It was held then, and has been held since, to be a very worthy proposition and is officially regarded as desirable in the county boroughs.  Nothing has occurred since to suggest it has not proved its worth. In the Report of the reconstituted Intoxicating Liquor Commission, 1929, it is stated in regard to this point:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After careful consideration we are fully satisfied that no case has been made for the abolition of the closing period between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. in the afternoons on weekdays in County Boroughs.  Although our sittings were open to the public, no one came forward save interested parties to complain of any inconvenience caused thereby, and we are satisfied that the object for which we made our original recommendation when the Commission sat in 1925, namely, the prevention of excessive drinking by persons who remain in public houses for long <Col N="1076" /> periods, has been substantially obtained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that many people ignored that Commission at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been the general experience of the Garda and others concerned with the problem since.  It is true that this period of closing is completely dead as far as the shop is concerned.  You cannot keep open for the sale of, shall we say, groceries at the same time as the sale of liquor.  Where a joint business is being carried on, they must close completely for that hour.  I think that was largely the reason why this law was not generally extended throughout the country, because so many shops in the country towns and rural areas carry on a mixed business.</P>
      <P>A point made by Deputy Russell and others which requires an answer is the suggestion that licensing facilities should be available on the occasion of markets, fairs, cattle marts or anything of that nature.  The answer to that is that under the existing law it is open to the people concerned to apply to the courts for a special exemption in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not abolished under the Schedule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The position under the law, which is being re-enacted here, is that a general exemption order can apply to any hour of the day or night, except between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m.  Therefore, in special cases, such as the case I mentioned last night of fishermen arriving home outside the ordinary licensing laws, the courts have power to make special provision.  My answer to the mover of the amendment is that if there is a particular case in Limerick city, the case of public houses beside a cattle market or something like that, if that exists in Limerick or any other county borough, the people concerned can come to the courts and if they have a justifiable case, the power is there for the courts to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all these circumstances, I do not see the necessity for an amendment <Col N="1077" /> such as this.  In order to try to preserve some uniformity, such as we have set out to do, what applies in one county borough should apply in the other county boroughs.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  In view of the existing provision at law, I see no reasonable case made for amending this law which has been undoubtedly accepted and is now, and has been for a very long number of years, well established. The official view still is that it is a good thing in the county boroughs, where you have a large number of industrial workers, to have this break during which they must go and have a meal.</P>

      <P>We are led to believe that when the public houses are closed from 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. the men who have been in them take no drink. That is not a fact.  The clubs are open during that hour and all the fellows we should like to see going home and having their dinner retire to the clubs instead.  I should like to know from the Minister if the law applies to clubs. If we are to have uniformity, let it apply to the clubs also.  I do not take a drink but I did at one time.  During that hour I just left the public house with my pals and retired to the club. The club was usually full and you did not have to be a member of the club, either.  This is a point the Minister should bear in mind.</P>
      <P>Many people in business in a small way, people such as travellers and those who work in their own time, if they are fond of a drink, tend to have a day's session of drinking.  It was to curtail this business of a session, to induce people to go home to their dinner when they might sober up, that the hour's break was introduced.  But as I say, thousands of people, when they are in the mood, meet their pals, retire from the public house to the club at 2.30 and come back to the public house again at 3.30.  I agree with the closing hour from 2.30 to 3.30 because I think we should try to break people off this session habit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Sherwin in his remarks about clubs.  One of the very strong <Col N="1078" /> recommendations made by the Intoxicating Liquor Commission was that clubs should be on the same basis as public houses.  In paragraph 23 of their report, they state:</P>
      <P>The 1925 Commission recommended that the hours of sale in clubs should be kept the same as in public houses and we see no reason to depart from that recommendation.</P>
      <P>That recommendation has not been put into effect since the 1925 Act.  I have an amendment later on in which I endeavour to secure the same treatment for public houses and clubs, so far as inspection is concerned.  I can assure the Minister that the majority of the Commission felt very strongly on the question of distinction as between clubs and public houses, and there is no reason whatsoever why special privileges should be granted to certain elements of the community who formed themselves into clubs mainly for the purpose of drinking.  In no circumstances should that be tolerated.</P>
      <P>There is another amendment to be introduced which seeks to ensure that an ordinary member of the Garda Síochána will be entitled to carry out an inspection of clubs, in the same way as is done at the moment in respect of public houses, and if that is adopted, I do not see why the same hours should not apply.  At this stage, I strongly urge the Minister to ensure that clubs will close for the period concerned.</P>
      <P>I believe the hours should be from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. but I do not suppose that at this stage there is much hope of getting the Minister to alter the Bill.  I agree with Deputy Belton that from 2.30 to 3.30 is a little too early and I think it would be more suitable all round if the break were from 3 p.m. onwards.  I should like to know if the Minister has finally decided in his own mind on 2.30 to 3.30 or is he prepared to give further consideration to altering that to 3 p.m. or 3.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>As a rural Deputy, I want to give a neutral view on this point.  I think the Minister for Lands has answered all the arguments in that <Col N="1079" /> the court has special powers to grant exemptions in justifiable cases.  I do not think it is right for a Deputy from Dublin to suggest that 3.30 to 5.30 should be the closing hours.  Surely all tradesmen in Dublin finish work at 5 o'clock and how would they get a drink at 5.30?  A Cork Deputy suggested that the dockers have a break at 2.30, but I think the dockers in Cork resume work at 2 o'clock.  Surely they do not get a break at 2.30?  If a referendum were held on this matter I think the hours proposed here of 2.30 to 3.30 would be accepted by a large majority.</P>

      <P>The fact that certain legislation was introduced in 1927 and has been in existence for more than 30 years is not a completely convincing argument that we should not look at it now, because, in effect, we are having a look at all the licensing laws passed over the past 30 odd years.  We have decided that certain changes are desirable and the effect of this new Bill is to make such changes as the Minister and the Dáil may think fit.  If it is so desirable to have a closing hour between 2.30 and 3.30 in the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, why does the same argument not apply to centres like Galway, Sligo, Dún Laoghaire and elsewhere?  If there is a danger of excessive drinking during this hour, does the same danger not apply to those other urban centres, or are the people in them to be taken as of a weaker calibre than their counterparts in other urban centres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When these laws were introduced in 1927, the price of drink was substantially lower than it is today, and I doubt if any of us now know of the fervent drinker who is prepared to go into a publichouse at opening time, and spend the whole day in it unless he is thrown out during the closing hour. That position may have existed 30 odd years ago, but as far as I know it does <Col N="1080" /> not exist today.  There is, of course, a problem in regard to the question of trade union labour and I agree with the point made by Deputy Lemass that that may involve the question of staffs, but other business houses can stay open.  To my knowledge, with certain few exceptions, all other business houses open between the hours of 2.30 to 3.30 for general business and seem to be able to make the necessary arrangements with their staffs.</P>
    <P>In his interjection a few minutes ago, the Minister rather gave the impression that this amendment was put down thoughtlessly, without any consideration for the interested parties. I should like to assure him on behalf of Deputy Carew and myself that we certainly did not put it down without consultation with the licensing trade in Limerick, and it was their feeling, after reading and studying the Bill, that there were certain disparities in it. If I understand the position correctly, a special exemption is for a special occasion, and the argument put forward on this matter in Limerick was that there are occasions like weekly markets on certain days of the week, and I assume these would not be regarded as special occasions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands referred to the fact that sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander in four county boroughs but I do not see why the sauce should be confined to those four county boroughs.  Surely if the sauce is good for the goose in four county boroughs, it should be good for the geese outside those four county boroughs; otherwise, they will be segregated as a special breed apart from the rest.</P>
    <P>One question which the Minister might answer some time is that covered in the point made by Deputy Dillon. Can mixed trading houses keep their doors open during the split hour, for the sale of goods and non-intoxicating liquors?  It might be a help to have an answer to that question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the further point made by Deputy Russell in connection with his amendment, he refers to a comparison between the licensed houses covered in the Bill and other businesses in the city areas.  I wonder <Col N="1081" /> has he forgotten that in regard to other businesses in urban areas, they close their doors at 5.30 or 6 o'clock in the evening, and to make a comparison between them and public houses is hardly relevant.  This proposal to continue the closing hours is of great value to the staffs and to those who employ them.  Possibly it is also of value to the publicans whose businesses are small and who do not have staffs.</P>
      <P>Comment was made by another Deputy as to the hardship falling on workers who happen to be doing shift work if the closing hour of 2.30 to 3.30 is applied.  The general position of workers on shift work is that they change shifts at fairly regular hours. Twelve o'clock is normal for one type of shift.  Another shift is the 2 o'clock change-over; another type may be 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  Workers proceeding to work or leaving off work at these regular and recognised negotiated shift-hours have an opportunity of getting some little refreshment, if they so desire, before going to work or on leaving off work.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands referred to exemptions.  We know that in the dock areas there are numbers of workers employed and applications for exemptions in these areas have always been granted.  Some of us might think that Justices are a little too facile in granting such applications; such applications, are, of course, granted on the merits.  That particular type of worker then is not affected.  Deputy McQuillan's suggestion to extend the closing to 5 o'clock appears to me to run completely counter to the point of view expressed that these houses should provide some opportunity for refreshment where tourists are concerned. It would be in the afternoon, after 3 o'clock, that these people would normally require some kind of refreshment.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress again that closing at these hours is of great value to the general public, to the staffs employed and even in the case of the family business.  I join with the Minister in the view that it would be a retrograde step for the House to accept Deputy Russell's amendment.</P>

      <P>The alleged object of this legislation is to provide a licensing code which will be enforced.  I recoil with peculiar horror from enacting legislation here which we, the legislators, do not ourselves fully understand. I am not familiar with the differences referred to by Deputy Corry, Deputy Russell and other Deputies who have spoken on this matter, because they relate to county boroughs.  I gather that the impression amongst these Deputies from county boroughs is that the law at present allows a mixed trading house to open for trading other than licensed trading during the closed hour.  Deputy Russell believes that even during the closed hour a person, who hitherto was known as a <i>bona fide</i> traveller, can get a drink during the closed hour. Now the Minister tells us that this section does nothing but re-enact the existing law.  I think we should be as clear as crystal on this matter.  If this section does nothing but re-enact the existing law, that is one thing.  If we are changing the law, we are entitled to be told very explicitly by the Minister what the change is.</P>

      <P>We are changing the law only to the extent that <i>bona fide</i> privileges will be abolished.  If premises were licensed as <i>bona fide</i> premises, naturally they would be entitled to remain open.  While a grocer and publican combined can at the moment sell groceries between 9 a.m. and 10.30 p.m., which is the opening hour for the licensed trade, he cannot sell groceries during the closed hour.  If he were allowed to do so now we would be negativing what we are trying to do here and also the practice established since 1927.  We would be permitting the all-round-the-clock drinker to remain on the premises.  That was the practice that the 1927 Act was aimed to stop.</P>

    <P>I believe the hour of 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. was specially devised after a considerable amount of cogitation. The idea was to permit a worker to get a drink during the recognised lunch-time.  Instead of prohibiting him from that facility during 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. it was decided to close between <Col N="1084" /> 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m.  That hour may seem peculiar to some people, but that was the purpose behind the provision at the, time it was enacted. It would be a decidedly retrograde step to go back now on something that has produced such valuable results over the years.  I cannot see much force in the argument adduced by Deputy Russell.  This particular law has operated in Limerick for 30 years.  It was recommended by the Commission and its re-enactment here seems to be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>What I think is in the mind of a number of Deputies, because a number of them have referred to the fact, is that even during this hour, people were able to get drink.  I do not know whether that is true.  I hope it is not, but if there were any truth in it at all, it simply means that there is a fear now that when this Bill becomes an Act, the law will be rigidly enforced and that custom, if it was a custom, will be carried on no longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point here.  I agree with him about the closing hour but I think we have inadvertently done more than we need to do.  In the process of abolishing the <i>bona fide</i> trade, we have overlooked the fact that in the county boroughs like Limerick&mdash;and I am picking this up only from what the Minister told me&mdash;where there was a mixed house, a shoe shop and a public house attached&mdash;the Minister for Justice would be amazed at the number of such establishments there are in the county boroughs: a draper's shop with bar attached or a grocer's shop with a bar attached&mdash;it is now no longer open to that mixed shop to let its country customer in during the hour; and instead of simply closing the door, what we are doing now is closing the shop.  Anyone trading in rural Ireland will tell you that you have a drapery customer and that customer deals as to 90 per cent. of his requirements with you, but if that customer comes in from the country on the bus &mdash;in a surprising number of country areas, the bus comes in about 2 o'clock <Col N="1085" /> and returns about 3.30&mdash;she will rush around to do the shopping.  That is the general thing you will see any market day in Clonmel, Nenagh, Tipperary or Cork.  We are now closing shops during the very hour when a great many of these mixed shops do the bulk of their trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that in a county borough like Limerick or Waterford, conditions are very similar to Clonmel.  You do get a number of country customers coming in the middle of the day on the bus and they go home on the bus.  Heretofore, as I understand the situation, they could go to their draper or grocer or boot factor and even if he had a bar, if they came from the country, they would be let in to get their requirements and be sent on their way.  Now the door is locked and they cannot get in for anything, so they will be driven into another drapery shop.  Anybody with any experience of rural trade will realise what that means in rural Ireland. Nobody is astonished in Dublin to see a customer calling to four or five shops before she is suited, but in rural Ireland it amounts to a tacit declaration of war to go into a rival business establishment.  You raise your eyebrows if you see your regular customer in a rival's establishment.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of very great significance. What I am afraid of is that, without realising it, we are legislating to make it impossible for a mixed trader's regular customers to deal with him for anything between 2.30 and 3.30, and I do not think that is what we mean to do.  What we mean to do is to enforce the law of non-trading in the licensed trade in every licensed house, whether it is a mixed house or not, but we do not want to forbid a draper from selling drapery, the boot shop from selling boots or the grocer from selling groceries, to his customers during that hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who knows rural Ireland will appreciate that the application of this law is a good thing in the city and I would support the Minister in his <Col N="1086" /> view that it ought to be maintained, but once we have abolished the <i>bona fide</i> trade&mdash;and we were right to abolish it&mdash;have we considered the full implications of the enforcement of this hour on mixed traders in county boroughs outside Dublin?  I am not sure of the position in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know but I do not imagine the problem would apply so acutely there.  The specific problem I have in mind is the mixed trading shop in a city like Limerick or Waterford. Inadvertently, we may do them very serious injury which we do not intend to do, and we ought to be able to find a way of avoiding that.  We do allow a mixed trading house to sell other merchandise in the rural parts of Ireland during certain closing hours for licensed trade and they are required to keep the bar closed.  I know how difficult it is to introduce an arrangement of that kind into a county borough like Limerick or Waterford.  You must think of a man trying to live, and if the bulk of his country customers are coming in on the bus between 2.30 and 3 p.m. and going home with their parcels at 3.30 p.m. on the bus, you ought to consider carefully if you are wronging him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I think, is starting on a wrong assumption created through a misunderstanding.  Whatever the practice may have been in Limerick or Galway, as Deputy Cosgrave suggested, the law was that the closing hour of 2.30 to 3.30 p.m. was a completely closed hour even in a mixed business for all purposes except <i>bona fide</i> drinkers, so that the man in the county borough with a licensed premises and a mixed business had to close his door and could not sell either the half lb. of tea or the pint of stout to anybody within a radius of three miles.  That was the position and that was the law.  Here that is being continued with the only consequential result of the removal of the <i>bona fide</i> man's rights.  The <i>bona fide</i> man is out now, too, during this hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not operating to <Col N="1087" /> prevent the country customer coming into Limerick, of which the Minister is well aware, because he comes into Castlebar as well as to Limerick? Does it prevent him going into the premises at all during that hour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that if the country customer has to go in the closing hour, he can have his drink on the way in, if he is so anxious about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot get into the shop in Limerick.  It is now closed, because we have abolished the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  Heretofore, he could get in because he got in as a <i>bona fide</i> and could get everything from drink to groceries, drapery or anything else. There was nothing illegal about it. But now when we abolish the <i>bona fide</i> trade, we are not only closing the mixed trading house to the residents of the city&mdash;and they do not frequent it during this hour&mdash;but to the country customers who come in on the bus and plan to go home with their parcels on the bus after an hour's or two hours' delay in the city.  They are now precluded from getting in at all to the premises.  We are doing that inadvertently.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will look at subsection (2) of Section 4, he will see that, under paragraphs (a) and (b), all the facilities any person would require in respect of ordering any type of goods he desires to have can be secured through the medium of the telephone, telegraph, letter or any other such method.  I suggest that that covers the point which the Deputy may have in mind, that the trader cannot do his business.  He can, if he desires, accept any order coming over the phone or by message and deliver it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see the point that one solitary hour will make all the difference, having regard to all the hours available to a man to drink.  I cannot see how it will affect any individual. Surely we have not reached the stage where we must have continuous drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing that any man ought to be allowed to have a drink at all.  What I am arguing is that he ought to be allowed to have access to a shop.  Leave the men out of it altogether.  It is the woman I am thinking of who comes into town to buy a shirt or a singlet or a pair of socks or a pair of insoles.  She comes in to the draper's shop where she deals and, as the law stands at present, she finds the shop door closed.  She knocks on the door and is asked &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; She replies &ldquo;I am from Croom&rdquo; and the shop door is opened to her.  That woman never thought of a drink but she bought her shirt or her singlet or her pair of insoles and went out of the shop as dry as she came into it, got on her bus and went home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the advantage a mixed trader enjoyed in a town like Limerick but now we have abolished the right of that woman to come in.  Now she cannot get into that shop at all and she goes to the draper next door; she buys the singlet, the shin or the insoles and, to the horror of the draper with whom she has been dealing, he discovers that she goes into the house next door the next time she comes into town perhaps because she likes the assistant there better than the one who has been serving her in his house.  It is access to the mixed house that is involved in this matter.  It is a matter of trying to solve an administrative restriction that I think has arisen without any of us being really aware of it. I am not accusing the Minister of being an irresponsible enemy of the <Col N="1089" /> mixed trader.  I am drawing his attention to what is happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Dillon has clouded his own case by the use of too many words.  At the moment the position is that we have a provision by which a shop which is doing a mixed trade in drink and other goods, we will say drapery, is open in its entirety to the <i>bona fide</i> traveller.  That is the present position.  Therefore, at the moment, when a woman comes in from the country to one of these shops she can ignore the fact that it is also a licensed premises and she can walk into the shop which is automatically open to her.</P>
      <P>The difficulty which seems to have arisen is that we are completely closing the <i>bona fide</i> trade and, when this alteration is made in the law, it will mean the closing of all premises for all purposes.  That is Deputy Dillon's point.  In other words, what is necessary here, and I am going further than Deputy Dillon, is a positive amendment to the effect that for general purposes the house can continue to be open but for the sale of drink it cannot open during that hour.  Is that not what we want to provide for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only suggesting that the concrete way to deal with this is that the section as it stands is acceptable.  What is required is an additional section enabling the other business, which has nothing to do with drink, to continue.  We want an addition to the section providing that where some other business is carried on at the moment nothing in this section will operate to prevent the opening of the premises for that purpose and, at the same time, providing for the implemenation of the law regarding drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add one word to that.  I think that <Col N="1090" /> there is a misunderstanding in the suggestion that the one hour does not matter.  As far as the people who come into town in buses are concerned it does matter.  Deputy Dillon has pointed out that the whole schedule of such people is covered by the buses, by the hours at which they arrive in the town and by the hours at which they leave. I would make the reasonable suggestion that an amendment or a proviso would meet this point and I submit to the Minister that the point should be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that Deputy Dillon has been arguing this point rather with his tongue in his cheek.  He realises very well that the effect of his suggestion is to give a legal defence to a man who wants to drink during the hour so that he can continue to drink to his heart's content.  He has it as an excuse, when the Gardaí come in to inspect the premises, that he has come in to buy a shirt or a pair of insoles. There is a sensible way for the licensee to deal with the matter.  All he has to do is to erect a partition or something like it dividing the bar from the rest of the mixed business.</P>
      <P>At the moment that partition is there in many houses and where it is not it could be put up at very little expense.  There is no merit in the argument that any hardship will be created for anybody in the county boroughs by this section.  All we are doing is saying that this hour which was a closing for all purposes, except for <i>bona fide</i> drinkers in the county boroughs until now, as a result of the disappearance of the <i>bona fide</i> trade will be a complete closing.  I do not know what the Deputy's experience is but I know a number of towns in the west of Ireland where the practice appears to be more and more, particularly in the larger premises, to close down at lunch hour, in the different types of businesses and not in the pubs alone.  That, I assume, is dictated by staff and similar considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see the picture which Deputy Dillon paints of people in mixed businesses losing by virtue of the fact that their premises are closed during this hour.  For the past 30 <Col N="1091" /> years in Limerick or in any county borough, the lady who wanted to buy insoles had to go to the trouble of hammering at the door to get into the mixed premises, because, under the law as it exists at present, that door was closed.  If she were prepared to hammer at the outside door to get in during the hour because she was so taken with the insoles exposed for sale by Pat Brown or whoever he may be, I think she would be prepared to wait there until the hour of 3.30 until the premises were open for general business.</P>
    <P>To amend this, in my view, would be absurd from a logical point of view.  It may be argued logically that there may be a case for doing away with this altogether.  That is one argument I could understand, but not the idea of providing what I call an excuse for being on a licensed premises, that having purchased an insole, to use Deputy Dillon's illustration, if a Garda comes in and finds me getting a drink wrongfully, I can produce my insole and say: &ldquo;This is my purpose in being on the premises.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it should be applicable to all or not at all.  If there are merits in it, I cannot see why it is right to apply it in the city of Limerick or Waterford and not in Dún Laoghaire. There is the question of trading.  The Minister for Lands will appreciate that in Limerick and places like Waterford, a number of the publicans are of the first generation and their relatives trade with them, or relatives are employed by the public houses.  There is that association.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 26, to delete &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;seven&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to try to find more suitable hours than those suggested for the second opening on Sunday.  The suggested hours are far more ridiculous than the existing hours of 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.  The existing hours were considered to interfere <Col N="1093" /> with tea time, or meal times, but the suggested hours of 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. for Sunday opening are utterly ridiculous when the Minister realises that in the city of Dublin, or in any licensed house that gives employment, 50 per cent. of the staff are at work.  I am sure every Deputy will agree with me when I suggest it is absolutely inhuman to expect a member of a staff to have his tea before he comes back to work at 5 p.m., and equally inhuman to expect him to wait until 9.30 p.m. or 10 p.m. before having his evening meal when he gets home from work.  Considering that the employer has only 50 per cent. of his staff working on Sunday, where will he get staff or relief for the men who will require to go to their meals during that trading period?</P>
    <P>I visualise certain objections to the alternatives suggested in this amendment. Let us consider the traders who trade in the vicinity of major sporting venues.  In the city of Dublin, there are licensed traders in the vicinity of Croke Park, or Dalymount Park, who feel they are legitimately required to open their house at 5 p.m. on Sundays. The same problem arises in Limerick, Cork, Galway and Thurles.  I suggest that in such cases it might be possible to grant a special exemption order.  I do not think any abuses have arisen where special exemption orders have been granted before opening time. Abuses have arisen only where they were granted after closing time.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is that the mainstay of the licensed trade, the ordinary working-man, is used to a pint or two each night, six nights a week.  He avails of the last hour's trading which at the moment is from 9.30 to 10.30 in summer or from 9 to 10 in winter.  Under the proposal in this Bill, those facilities will not be given to the ordinary customer on a Sunday night.  In other words, certain facilities are given to him on six nights a week but he is deprived of them on Sundays.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, instead of 5 to 9, 7 to 10 or even 8 to 10 would be more acceptable to the trade in general and far more acceptable to the consumer. The hours suggested at the <Col N="1094" /> moment are giving us five and a half hours' trading on Sunday as against the three and a half hours' trading we have at the moment.  As a person interested in the trade, I am not suggesting that the existing hours of trading should be increased.  I am suggesting that more suitable hours of trading should be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>I think that the most suitable hours of trading on Sundays would be 12.30 to 2 p.m. for the first opening, which have been agreed, and, for the second opening, 7 to 10 p.m., as I have suggested in this amendment.  I think the employer, the worker and the consumer would be more satisfied if those hours were applied.</P>
    <P>We must consider the people working at the business, the employee and the employer.  If trading is not carried out between 2 to 7 p.m. it enables the employee or the employer to take part in any sport he wishes, to go to see a football or a hurling match, to stay at home with his wife and family, to bring them to the seaside or to go to the pictures.</P>
    <P>The suggested closing period in this Bill of from 2 to 5 p.m. does not give a man time for anything.  It is completely and utterly a ridiculous closing period.  The Minister should give really serious consideration to the suggestion that the second opening period should be from 7 to 10 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Really, amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15 hang together. Deputy Belton raises the general question of the opening hours in the afternoon on Sundays and on St. Patrick's Day.  I have an amendment here in the same terms as an amendment proposed by Deputies Norton and Larkin substituting, in effect, the hour of seven all the year round as a closing hour instead of 8 or 9 in the Summer as suggested in the Bill.  That case was made to me by a group of trade union representatives who discussed this matter with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case they made carried great weight with me.  They said that many of their members are married men and that their circumstances are very similar to those of a married publican who employs nobody at all but runs <Col N="1095" /> the house himself.  Take a married man with a young family.  He has a long working day every day of the week.  Then comes Sunday or St. Patrick's Day.  This Bill proposes that he should work on the Sunday morning, get his lunch and then be back to work in the evening from 5 until 8 o'clock in winter or 9 o'clock in summer.</P>
    <P>They put it to me that that is really a proposal that he should never see his family at all because in any well-conducted house young children are in bed by 9 o'clock and a man is at least entitled to a Sunday or a holiday such as St. Patrick's Day when he would be able to get home and have some time in his family circle.  I feel there is a lot of force in that case.</P>
    <P>While I think it is desirable and necessary that people engaged in the retail distributive trade should cater reasonably for their customers I feel that if people are free to get drink up to 7 o'clock on a Sunday night or on St. Patrick's Day night they are doing all right.  If we abolish all closing hours, for which I think a strong case can be made, then it is up to the individual publicans themselves, the trade unions and the employees of the publicans to make what arrangements they like with no statutory hours fixed at all.</P>
    <P>It is then a matter for the trade unions to champion the case of their men with the employers and to settle satisfactory hours.  Where, by statute, we are fixing opening hours, for reasons into which we have already gone, to become virtually obligatory on all publicans, considering the intensely competitive nature of the trade, I think that to compel even the individual publican but more so the employee, for instance the young married man, to work until 9 o'clock in the evening on Sundays and holidays is excessive more especially when we bear in mind that what we are prescribing here are not the working hours but the opening hours.</P>
    <P>When you finish in a bar at 9 o'clock at night you cannot simply close the door and go home.  There is a good deal of consequential work which must be done and which means that the bar will not be vacated until about 9.40 <Col N="1096" /> p.m. so that the employee does not get home until 10 o'clock at the earliest. I think that is excessive.  There is a strong case, on humanitarian grounds, for providing that the hour in the evening should be changed to 7 all the year round, thus allowing those working in this trade to have some family life of their own.</P>
    <P>Let us not in this House become too detached from the ordinary domestic problems of our neighbours.  People who have to earn their living are entitled to some consideration outside the strictly economic aspect of their life. There is such a thing as a domestic life.  While it is no part of the duty of this Oireachtas to regulate that, we certainly ought to try to take precautions to ensure that our legislation will not operate virtually to obliterate them.</P>

      <P>In view of the difficulty we already had this morning when it came to deciding on some amendments, I submit that this amendment deals only with the opening hours, whereas the other amendments deal specifically with another aspect of the matter, the closing hours.

      <P>I have since confirmed that this arrangement made with the central office before Christmas was discussed formally with the Labour Party and with myself.  I refused to consent to it except subject to the agreement of the Labour Party and that agreement was procured at that time.

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is how you rule, we must accept your ruling.  I do not know to what extent Deputy Dillon's statement is correct.  As far as I am concerned, my name is down to an amendment and I was not made aware of any arrangement or agreement as to how it should be dealt with. I do not, of course, challenge the accuracy of Deputy Dillon's recollection as to what arrangement he has made, but, in view of the fact that it was announced, I think on the very first day this Bill came before the House, that the Labour Party had decided to have a free vote on the matter, it is inconceivable that any arrangement has been made with the Labour Party in the absence of consultation with those who have amendments down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the difficulty we are in, of <Col N="1098" /> course, in dealing with this matter is that in amendment No. 13 there is a proposal to have later opening hours on a Sunday and, in amendment No. 14, a proposal to have later closing hours, whereas in amendment No. 15, in the names of Deputy Dillon, Deputy Norton and myself, there is a proposal to have earlier closing hours, in complete contradiction to the other two amendments.  Consequently, we find great difficulty in accepting the procedure as being the best in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>However, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has ruled that they should be discussed together and that in certain circumstances, when the motion is moved and put, if No. 14 is defeated, No. 15 also goes.  That is depriving the movers of amendment No. 15 of the right to have a decision taken on an important aspect of this matter.</P>
    <P>In the amendment in the name of Deputy Belton, it is proposed that the opening hour provided in the Bill, five o'clock, be changed to seven o'clock. Personally, I suppose the best way to deal with opening hours on Sundays, having regard to all the circumstances, would be to have only one opening session, namely, the earlier opening session and to let the day be recognised as the day it is, a day of rest.  However, that amendment was knocked down but Deputy Belton is proposing that the opening hour be seven o'clock on Sunday evening.  This proposal would be generally repugnant to those who are compelled to earn their livelihood working in a public house as members of the staff or, in a great measure, to those who have to earn their livelihood by running public houses.  It means that on this one day of the week, reasonable relaxation and reasonable enjoyment, in the company of their families, would be prejudiced and curtailed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton makes an argument in favour of the seven o'clock opening hour, that it would be a hardship on staff to start work at 5 o'clock and to continue until 8 or 9 p.m.  I agree that such hours would impose severe hardship on staffs and would mean difficulties, embarrassment and inconvenience <Col N="1099" /> for their families but the position would not be quite so bad if the hours were changed from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. to from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., that at 7 p.m. the public houses would close, the owners could get a meal and have a few hours with their families before retiring to bed and in the case of the staff, the assistants could complete their normal duty of cleaning up and seeing that the premises were ready for the following morning and the porters could complete their work in the cellar and could leave their places of employment, under the best circumstances possible, by 7.30 and in the worst circumstances by about 8 p.m., which would mean that they would have some time for themselves on a Sunday evening.  Those without domestic responsibilities and who were not married would have an opportunity of having the evenings to themselves. Those who were married would have an opportunity of spending the evening with their families.  This would apply equally in the case where there was no staff.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 14, Deputy Belton, having proposed to shove back the opening hours to 7 o'clock in the evening, then proposes to extend the closing hours from 9 o'clock until 10 o'clock.  The mover of this amendment appears to be more interested in having the public houses open for an increased sale of liquor than in the public or of the staffs in those houses or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this House could accept as a reasonable suggestion that public houses should be opened every Sunday evening until 10 o'clock.  Down the years, a lot has been said on all sides of the House about the value of family life and the value of the Irish way of life.  I am beginning to think that was completely meaningless if at this stage it is proposed to open the public houses until 10 o'clock on a Sunday evening.</P>
    <P>I always subscribed to the view&mdash;I subscribe to it today&mdash;that people are entitled to normal relaxation and to normal refreshment, if they feel like indulging in any form of liquid refreshment. <Col N="1100" /> I subscribe very strongly to the view that workers are entitled to rest. They are entitled to know that there is a reasonable closing hour, a reasonable hour for finishing work and that they can then have their own enjoyment and enjoy the society of their friends and families.</P>
    <P>By the carrying of certain decisions in this House, we have, in fact, extended the hours of drinking until late at night on six days of the week.  We have the situation that the Minister proposes: &ldquo;To extend those hours also on Sunday.&rdquo;  If the Minister is satisfied to grant those hours until 9 o'clock, Deputy Belton wants to extend them even further.  On this matter I would submit that the hours mentioned in the amendment in my name, from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., are reasonable hours for a Sunday evening.  That two hour period affords those who wish to take a drink an opportunity of doing so.  It will also afford the people employed in the sale and the service of drink to the public some break&mdash;possibly not as long as I would personally wish&mdash;on a Sunday afternoon, and, what is very important, indeed, to me, a complete break on Sunday evening after the public houses close at 7 o'clock.</P>
    <P>Why should we in this House take the view, in the absence of any substantial demand, that these hours should be enforced on publicans and on those who work in public houses? It is easy enough to say as Deputy Dillon said.  He said that one way to solve the problem was to have no fixed hours or statutory hours and then competition would regulate the matter, but here, again, we are dealing not just with the question of the supply of goods in a case where a person goes into a shop for the purpose of buying a length of tweed or purchasing cigarettes or matches.  He generally knows, when he goes in, what he wants to buy.  In most cases, he comes out with what he goes in for.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a product which of its very nature very often means that the person who goes in in the first place to have a bottle of stout by the time he comes out, has indulged in a <Col N="1101" /> wide variety of liquors.  In many cases, the person has gone in merely to buy one or two bottles of stout or, perhaps, a half glass of whiskey, a drop of sherry or whatever it is.  That is his intention but in a very large percentage of cases, he does not leave when he has had that bottle of stout.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a product which has this effect.  If you go into a drapery shop at 5.25&mdash;the matter of drapery was referred to so often in the discussion this morning that I cannot help referring to it&mdash;to purchase a pair of socks or a pair of insoles and the assistant says: &ldquo;We are closing up now; would you mind placing your order quickly?&rdquo;, you would take the pair of socks, pay for them and leave because the shop is closing.  You never, in any circumstances, feel that it is your duty to remonstrate with the assistant and say: &ldquo;Look, you have no right to put me out now.&rdquo;  We recognise the assistants' rights.  They have a life to lead and if the closing hours are 5.30 or 6.30, the general public accept that and buy their goods.</P>
    <P>In the case of the public house, if there are no statutory hours for opening, I am afraid the publican or his employee will be faced with an objection by the customer if asked to leave the premises, if such customer had reached a certain degree of intoxication. I do not say it would occur in all cases.  By and large our people are reasonable and amenable.  However, in the absence of statutory closing hours, I am afraid the percentage of cases in which difficulties would arise would increase substantially.  Therefore, in order to have some reasonable approach to this question of drinking hours it has been accepted generally that statutory hours are desirable, and in certain areas for many years there have been certain statutory hours in respect of the consumption of liquor on Sundays.  In other areas, of course, the consumption of liquor on Sunday was not possible.</P>
    <P>In considering the Bill before us and the specific proposals made, we must have regard to the interests of the people who have to operate the conditions laid down by this House.  The <Col N="1102" /> conditions as proposed by the Minister in respect of Sunday evening opening hours are conditions which, in my opinion and in the expressed opinion of the trade union organisation who represent that body of workers in the licensing trade will create difficulty and hardship for those people and not only for them but difficulty, hardship and inconvenience for their families.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister wants to make any specific case justifying the extension of Sunday evening hours.  My objection to the proposal to extend the hours to 9 p.m. is basically that it interferes with the family life of those employed in this trade.  There is also the general objection as to the effect of these late hours on the general public, the ordinary citizen and his family.  Is there no pastime or form of relaxation in which the Irish people can engage on a Sunday evening other than drinking?  Surely when later drinking hours have been accepted for the other days of the week, they are sufficient for those who wish to drink without extending the hours on Sunday evening.</P>
    <P>I said on another section of the Bill that in recent years there has been less drunkenness in our cities and towns and in the rural areas.  If people wish to have a drink nobody wants to deprive them of normal pleasure in that regard.  I should like to ask the Minister to indicate in the course of discussion on these amendments whether the opening of public houses from 5 o'clock until 9 o'clock on a Sunday evening will contribute to the continued reduction in drunkenness.  I do not think we should pay too much attention to what happens in other countries, to what happens in Britain, Australia, France or anywhere else. We should have regard to the developments at home over the years and should express our views as to whether we believe it is a good thing for the country to reach a position where the abuse of intoxicating liquor is gradually lessening all the time.</P>
    <P>We in this House are not entitled to take any credit for that desirable development. As various Deputies have indicated at different times in the <Col N="1103" /> course of the discussion on this Bill and possibly will again before the discussion concludes, over the years the law governing the use of intoxicating liquor was more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  However, I think we can accept that in recent years young people in their 'teens and early twenties are, contrary to the opinion held by many people, applying themselves to their interests with less and less reliance on the stimulus of intoxicating liquor.  More of our people are abstaining from drink in their early years and many more are drinking in very moderate quantities. I should like to know whether the Minister thinks that this is desirable or whether he thinks there should be encouragement to induce the young people to drink to excess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have had an opportunity of studying the Minister's speech in a calmer atmosphere and re-reading the relevant points in which each is interested.  I should like to revert to this question of the time which the Minister states it will take to build University College, Dublin, at Belfield.  The Minister said that he was advised, even if the work was in full swing, it would be extremely <Col N="1104" /> doubtful if it would be physically possible to spend £500,000 a year in Dublin on any single building project. I do not know who gave the Minister that advice but it is bad advice and it is wrong advice.  Apart from being a reflection on the capacity of the building industry, and the ingenuity of the appropriate professional bodies ancillary to the building industry, it is extremely doubtful if this statement could be substantiated.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that there must also be taken into account the no small matter of the requirements of the other colleges which the Commission had reported were also pressing. In all the circumstances, he said, he could not see how it would be physically possible to transfer the college entirely within, at the very least, 20 years.  He was also informed that the expenditure concerned would have a 50 per cent. employment content for the building and ancillary trades of Dublin.  I should like to point out to the Minister that whoever told him it was physically impossible to transfer the college in its entirety in a minimum period of 20 years was talking complete and utter nonsense.  I calculate that if a Board were set up, once the Dáil passes this Estimate, to deal say with the appointment of assessors in order to hold an architectural competition, having invited architects to submit plans and having adopted the prize winning design, the successful architect would then have to prepare working drawings.  Quantities would have to be prepared and consulting engineers brought in, and so on.  I would allow 1½ years for that.  Can any reasonable man say that in 18 months' time that having been done&mdash;it could be done in 12 months&mdash;the remainder would take, with the finance available, 20 years? I could understand, if the finance were not available, that we would have to stagger the project.  That would be reasonable but with the finance available the actual building work should be finished in a further three years, or say four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter is this. If one looks at the employment figures at present in the Statistical Abstract one <Col N="1105" /> will see that there are very few skilled workers, if any, on the unemployment register in Dublin City.  Does that suggest to the Minister's advisers that if the project were commenced the skilled trade would not be available? It is misleading to rely on these figures because we know&mdash;Deputy O'Donnell knows&mdash;that when building decreases these skilled tradesmen seek other employment.</P>
    <P>There are many skilled tradesmen, plasterers, masons, carpenters and electricians in other parts of Ireland and some of them are also in England at present.  Many of them have homes in Dublin and in Ireland, and they are waiting for such a project to start to come back.  We have been told from all sides of the House and by successive Governments that the demand for houses for the working classes is decreasing, with the figures of a previous survey approaching reality and fruition. If that is so, is it not the duty of the Government of the day to produce, when they have the opportunity of doing so, an alternative means whereby our second largest industry after agriculture, the building industry, will absorb people who are losing employment in other branches of that industry? Here is the solution, at least for this part of the country, for that situation.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the estimated cost of this Belfield project is £7,000,000.  That is the estimated cost on the 1st February, 1960.  What is this project going to cost on the 1st February, 1980?  We are not foolish enough to think that building costs will come down; we are not foolish enough to think that wages are going to decrease.  Is it not obvious&mdash;this is not the place to go into the reasons&mdash; that over the years to come, with the economic expansion of the country, and if conditions prosper, that wage-earners must get increased remuneration proportionate to the improvement of the standard of living as a whole? Therefore, if we voted an amount of £7,000,000 to-day, we know that in the coming years, if this programme is to be spread over a 20-year period, successive Ministers for Education will be coming into this House seeking very <Col N="1106" /> large sums in Supplementary Estimates and the project that will cost £7,000,000 to-day, if there is this delay in completing it and bringing it to fruition, could cost without the slightest shadow of doubt&mdash;and I shall be conservative&mdash;twice that amount.</P>
    <P>I want to come to the position in Limerick.  The Minister also said that a third pressing problem was that of the claims of some provincial centres for a University College.  To that, he said, there was no facile answer one way or another.  Only a thorough examination of facts and figures in the context of the national economy, resources and needs would bring to light whether there was a real problem in this respect and if so how best it might be solved.  He proposed to set up a Commission to survey the field of higher education.  As I said already, the terms of reference of the previous Commission were so narrow that they should have been given the task of investigating the field of higher education in addition to their terms of reference dealing with the needs of existing colleges.  Are we to take it that apart from Limerick or Waterford or Wexford, Letterkenny or Drogheda that this commission will take another three-and-a-half years?  Is this a means of fobbing us off in Limerick and in other interested places?  Did the Minister not tell me in the House that three of his officials were permanently working, investigating the claims of Limerick for a considerable period over past months? Now we are told we will have a commission. Surely three intelligent officials of the Department of Education&mdash;and one does not get in there unless one has a high standard of education, I believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was not such a casual visitor because I spent four years in the University.  That time could have been condensed to twelve months but the Minister appoints no commission to advise him on certain methods.  The whole trouble in this country is that University education has not kept step with the times.  It is archaic, antediluvian and Victorian. We will get no inspiration from the people in the Senate of the National University because they have not kept pace with the times either.  We had some of them in this House and they did not even keep pace with progress here&mdash;which would not be very difficult.</P>
      <P>It is a rather interesting observation that I made earlier that the four years I spent in college could have been condensed to one year.  During the first year, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays we had one hour's lecture. To say nothing about our unfortunate parents, think of the temptations open to boys with all that spare time which they had apart from kicking a rugby ball about.  There was just one lecture for three days a week from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m.  There was no lecture on Saturday and on the other two days we had two hours per day.  You were supposed to go to the library but, apart from Galway, the National University is only a glorified technical school.  I am not casting any aspersions on it because it is not to-day that this Vote should have been introduced but, perhaps, 15 years ago.  It is too late now.  It is a fantastic situation. They gave evidence before the commission that their position was critical: it is so critical that it will be 20 years before it is solved.</P>
      <P>It was Disraeli who said that a University should be a place of light and of reason and of learning.  Is U.C.D. a place of light, reason and learning?  Is there that personal contact with the students which was Newman's conception of a University and which you have in Galway, fortunately? That too, I suppose, could disappear in time.</P>

    <P>We are told that Munster has U.C.C., Connacht has U.C.G. and Dublin has U.C.D.  We have to go back only a couple of hundred years in our history to see how these colleges were founded originally.  When £1,000,000 is being sought for a harbour, why do the Government not say: &ldquo;We shall not give you £1,000,000 for a harbour in Cork because we have already spent £500,000 in Limerick&rdquo;&mdash;as they have&mdash;&ldquo;We shall not spend this £1,000,000 in Cork because Munster already has one in Limerick.  We shall not give a grant of £150,000 to Killala because Galway are to get £4,000,000 for their harbour&rdquo;?  There is no tendency towards provincial centralisation.</P>
    <P>The inconsistency down the years of the Department of Education appals me.  What would Limerick want? Up to £2,000,000.  Yet yesterday, very glibly, in a few minutes this House voted £3,000,000 for drainage of the Moy, but the giving of this £2,000,000 to stop the drain of a very large proportion of our young people from a very big area of this country has to depend on the considerations of a commission composed of &ldquo;nuts&rdquo;, in the main.  Nuts&mdash;that is right.  Some &ldquo;nuts&rdquo; act on commissions.  Like the balance of payments, you will not get equilibrium on a commission.  Friends of various people like to go on these commissions and they are happy when they are put on them.</P>
    <P>Take the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  Can anyone say that that is not tied up with and must not be tied up with university education? What is wanted in this country is an industrial, agricultural and intellectual revolution over five years.  One would think that this <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was the greatest thing that ever hit this country, with all the talk there is about it.  I do not <Col N="1110" /> agree with that view at all.  I certainly think it was a magnificent production; but it is not a gospel.  It must be treated with elasticity.  It is a foundation, if you like, for progress in the country.</P>
    <P>However, we are not Noahs in this House and our people will not live forever.  If our mentality is to be a twenty-year one, it is a poor outlook indeed.  I say that as a Government Deputy with all sense of responsibility. What you want here is this industrial, agricultural and intellectual revolution. They all go hand in hand.  Why should we be satisfied with a Minister for Finance coming in here and telling us that the programme set down for economic development has been exceeded by some two per cent. or three per cent.?  Compare the increases in other countries in Europe.  We certainly have not kept in step.  That is why I want action now.  I know the Minister for Education is hamstrung. From what I read in the Library, I would not say there is any lack of finance in the Department of Education. They are two million pounds behind in the schools building programme. That is a queer one for you. It is evidently not a question of finance at all.</P>
    <P>We hear cants and clichés from time to time that what we want are factories and not education.  That belief is neither realistic nor factual.  In the main, such comments are made by people who have not given sufficient thought to the subject.  Certainly we need industry, and I am glad that the Minister, in his reference here, deviated for a time to refer to the subject of vocational schools.  Whether a university is built in Limerick or not, you will have school children leaving school without any trade naturally, and with no intention of going to a university. Possibly they have not the wish, finance or the capacity to go to a university, are deterred by the entrance conditions and so on.</P>
    <P>There is no co-ordination in this country at present, whereby the headmasters of all the vocational schools could be brought together and told: &ldquo;Here is our programme for Shannon <Col N="1111" /> Airport and other areas.  We want 230 sheet metal workers and 80 precision workers, etc.&rdquo;  They are spending £1,000,000 on the Bolton Street Technical School.  Have we in fact any target?  What are we aiming at?  In vocational education, are we still to concentrate on the export market, and, as I said, let the taxpayer subsidise to the extent of £700 or £800 each of these students exported?  We want to see that the target we are aiming is employment for them in their own country.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister gave us figures which prove beyond yea or nay that 50 per cent. of the doctors and civil engineers who graduate emigrate for good and yet on the present figures it costs the taxpayers £500 for each graduate who qualifies.</P>
    <P>The public has to be educated to appreciate the necessity of education. On one occasion Aristotle was asked how superior were educated men to uneducated men and his answer was: &ldquo;As superior as the living are to the dead.&rdquo;  There is no public relations branch in the Department of Education and, as Deputy Dillon said, these Commission Reports are too dry, though I do not know what he expected, or if he expected them to be in the style of &ldquo;Lolita.&rdquo;  Admittedly they are too dry and, as I say, I think it is necessary that the public be educated on the necessity for education.</P>
    <P>In his closing remarks, I should like the Minister to say how much of this sum caters for the requirements of Cork and Galway.  Recently he received a deputation from the Governing Body of Galway University; funds are very necessary there if they are to continue their present building operations.  Is it the position that Dublin is to get all this money and that Cork and Galway are to be cut down?  I think they want only £600,000 in Galway, and not a lot more in Cork, and I think the projects there should go hand in hand with the Dublin one.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly approve of the building <Col N="1112" /> programme for University College, Dublin, at Belfield, as any reasonable man must, but I want to point out it is estimated to cost £7,000,000; yet there is no provision in that for a Faculty of Agriculture.  At present the position in regard to university education for agriculture is that students spend their first two years in Cork or Galway, but in their third and final years they must come to Dublin. Surely then, this is a golden opportunity to do something for the avowed principle of decentralisation which was held by successive Governments?  The only decentralisation I saw was in the case of Bord na gCon coming to Limerick.  That was the only example I saw for a long time and nobody could say that was a big departure, but we have had the appalling decision of one man, who talks decentralisation to all the young farmers' clubs, that the headquarters of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann will be at Stephen's Green, in Dublin.  I would like to hear Lieutenant-General Costello on that sometime.</P>

I want the Minister and the Government&mdash;for want of stronger language&mdash;to give a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or a &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and give over this Commission business.  I say Limerick deserves a University; it is a self-evident fact &mdash;not because I live there, or depend on a certain amount of support.  I do not know if some of the people on the committee dealing with that would support anyone, but that is neither here nor there.  They are doing a job to the best of their ability and they have put up an unanswerable case. Let the Minister and the Government say: &ldquo;You will get a University in Limerick&rdquo; or: &ldquo;You will not.&rdquo;  Let them say that and if we are not to get it, then we want to know why.  We might avail of various Trusts, O.E.E.C. Grants, or American Counterpart Funds, and speaking of those, we would make more use of them than was done in the past.  I certainly would not be prepared to wait three or four years to be told &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  That is unreasonable.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> Before I go on to this question of the evidence given before the Commission with regard to the faculty of Agriculture in U.C.D.  I want the Minister to make a particular note of the question of the Charter as it stands at present.  Remember that when the Irish Universities Act of 1908 was passed in the British Commons the outlook of the leaders of Catholic thought in this country was &ldquo;This is not everything we want but we shall be satisfied.&rdquo;  This is 1960.  What are the changes, if any, proposed in this Act?  Non-Catholics are otherwise catered for, and we are dealing here specifically with a Catholic University, the National University of Ireland.  As the Charter exists it would not be possible, it would be completely fatuous, for my colleagues or me to be discussing a University in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Is it the Minister's attitude that if this Board which he proposes to set up and which can take from three to five years to tell us something we know now, recommends a fourth constituent College, then the Charter can be changed?  I do not know if it is as easy as that.  Now is the time to take action because we had experience in Limerick of that Charter quite recently and what it means to us, in these extra mural courses.  I was never quite certain what that meant. Deputy Russell would be more conversant with the matter than I am, for he was ably helped to prepare this report.  It says that there was another reason why support from the National University was not forthcoming for a University in Limerick, namely, the fact that in order to provide for a constituent College in Limerick the Charter of the University would need to be amended.  In its present form the Charter provides only for three constituent Colleges&mdash; University College, Dublin, University College, Cork, and University College, Galway.</P>

      <P>They occupy a unique position, naturally, and the Deputy's intention to head in that <Col N="1115" /> direction on one occasion does him credit.  In the past Dr. O'Rahilly came to Limerick.  He was then President of U.C.C.  He is now writing in <i>Hibernia</i> attacking the claims of Limerick. When he was President of U.C.C. he came to Limerick and tried to institute a Higher Diploma in Education course.  I think there were 60 applicants in response to a public advertisement sponsored evidently by U.C.C., and overnight there was a notice in the paper that that course would not take place.  I do not know if it had something to do with this Charter.</P>
      <P>The Limerick Committee's Report said:</P>
      <P>In association with one of the University Colleges (for several reasons Cork was the obvious choice), to provide first and if possible second year courses in Arts, Commerce and Science, representatives of the Committee have had several meetings and exchanged correspondence with the President of U.C.C. regarding the establishment of first and, if possible, second year courses in certain faculties in Limerick. Arts, Commerce and Science appear to be the most practicable. The Committee were impressed by Dr. Atkins' personal desire to do all in his power to extend facilities for University courses to young people living in the Limerick area.  Notwithstanding the President's good will, however, it would appear from recent information available to the Committee, that the University Charter precludes the holding of such courses outside the confines of the Constituent Colleges.</P>

      <P>This is a Report of a Committee, published by the <i>Limerick Leader.</i>  Apart from Limerick, if Deputy Thaddeus Lynch wants courses in Waterford or if they want them in Dundalk or Drogheda and put up a reasonable case to the Minister, as for instance that a Leaving Certificate student might do the first year equivalent to the PreMed. <Col N="1116" /> at least in Physics and Chemistry or get credit for the first University examination, or supposing some of these cities put up a case for a first and second year course in any part of Ireland, they cannot succeed because they are debarred under the present Charter which the Minister does not propose to change.  The 1908 Act is remaining, the same Act in regard to which the leaders of Catholic opinion when it went through the House of Commons said: &ldquo;This is a great progressive step but not all we want, though it is something.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What did they not get that they wanted?  There has been no change in the Act except a slight amendment in 1935.  Deputy Moher has made reference to Social Science courses. They get these parchments.  The President of U.C.C. came up to Limerick and gave them a diploma in Social Science that has no standing anywhere.  A few who got that diploma have gone &ldquo;nuts.&rdquo;  They have gone peculiar and everyone knows that. They definitely have advanced Socialist tendencies.  They want innocently enough to infiltrate into every political Party.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pointed out that there is no provision in this £7,000,000 for the faculty of Agriculture in Belfield or anywhere else in Dublin.  You have the Albert College, and U.C.C. and U.C.G. but for their third and fourth years they have to come up to Dublin. Everything heads towards Dublin.  I heard the Minister himself on a platform on which I spoke with him <Col N="1117" /> preach the gospel of decentralisation. The Minister has a very good opportunity of putting those expressions or wishes into concrete form.</P>
    <P>I am asking him now to set up the faculty of Agriculture in Limerick.  I am not doing that because it is the home of the dairying industry or because it is contiguous to the Golden Vale.  There is a golden opportunity for the Minister now.  These people have made no provision for the faculty of Agriculture.  Three conferences of the Commission were concerned with the position of the faculty of Agriculture and with conditions in the Albert College, Glasnevin.  Here is what the Report says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;University College Dublin is the only college of the universities which had the full agricultural faculty.  In University College Cork and University College Galway, only the first and second years of the course are taught.  The third and fourth years of the degree course for all colleges (the professional part of the course) are followed exclusively in University College Dublin, in the former Albert College Glasnevin.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The number of agricultural students has been growing and the college has now ceased to conduct the residential course thus making the whole of the Albert College available for the faculty courses.</P>
    <P>What about the sons of small farmers? When the Albert College was a residential college, they could live in there for an all-in fee.  Now they have to come to Dublin and pay £3-10-0 a week for &ldquo;digs.&rdquo;  We are told by some professors in University College Dublin that the number of students from Limerick in Dublin is not very impressive. Of course it is not impressive. How could they afford to come up here?  What is the use of talking about sending the sons of small farmers or of any farmers to Dublin for the study of agriculture?  It is not because Lieutenant-General Costello set up the headquarters of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann in St. Stephen's Green that everyone else should follow his example.  The Minister has a golden opportunity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> The President of University College, Dublin was here yesterday.  He told the Commission that the college representatives could say that for the academic teaching of agriculture they were reasonably well off, but in order to bring the College up to date a further expenditure of £20,000 would be necessary to provide additional facilities for plant pathology, for laboratory research in soil science, etc. and this figure might have to be increased somewhat, if, as now appeared likely, certain repair and renovation work had to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The College's greatest problems in relation to the Albert College, the President said, were farm buildings and farm lands.  There is an area of 350 acres in all at the Albert College property, of which about 300 acres are effective farming land.  The farm is in two sections; some land had to be given to the Dublin Corporation for the initial extension of Collins Avenue and it may be that this Avenue will be carried right through the farm.  Many difficulties have arisen from the fact that the farm is surrounded by built-up areas.</P>
    <P>There are eight miles of perimeter and ten miles of internal fencing. There is constant trouble with this fencing and the lands are subject to trespass by adults, children and dogs. It was instanced that some years ago seven years' research on potatoes had been ruined overnight when an experimental plot of potatoes had been uprooted.  The field where it was hoped to plant spring wheat was crossed by an unauthorised Mass path.  These difficulties, the President said, raised the question whether the College should continue to conduct the faculty of Agriculture at the Albert college.</P>
    <P>The President of University College Dublin, Dr. Tierney, asked that question. He asked &ldquo;The thing is whether University College Dublin should continue to conduct the faculty of Agriculture at the Albert College?&rdquo; The Minister now has an opportunity to have his name go down in history.  I am not casting any aspersions on his abilities.  He has plenty of ability if he does not <Col N="1119" /> allow himself to be overruled by some of these officials who are also very able men.  If the late Mr. Seán Moylan were Minister for Education now, the faculty of Agriculture would be started in Limerick and Mr. Moylan was a very capable man.  The Minister himself is not lacking in intelligence.</P>
    <P>They cannot carry on in Albert College.  They represent to the Commission that the Science and Research faculties in the third and fourth year cannot be provided for in the main College buildings but must be located on the farm.  A farm, it was represented, is an essential adjunct for a faculty of Agriculture and, unless an adequate farm can be provided with the rest of the College, the teaching facilities for the third and fourth years of the courses cannot be provided in the main College buildings but must be located on the farm.  The deputation continued that while the separation of the teaching and laboratory accommodation for the third and fourth years of the course from the rest of the College might involve some sacrifice, it was essential that such accommodation should be provided on the faculty farm, if only for the convenience and saving of time made possible when the theoretical class can be brought within five minutes to where the principles taught in the classroom can be illustrated in practice.</P>
    <P>It was stated also that the properties which the College have at Stillorgan Road would not be sufficient to provide a faculty farm so that on top of the £7,000,000 which the Government are seeking now they will have to come back here for a further substantial sum.</P>
    <P>Professor Ruane told the Commission that a factor which would determine the size of farm necessary would be the desirability of having within the College farm a number of different size farm units&mdash;one of 50 acres, one of 100 acres and one of 150 acres where the principles of efficient farming of holdings of these sizes could be illustrated.  The College, in his opinion, should have a farm of <Col N="1120" /> about 300 acres for teaching in research purposes, and, as well, a farm of 200 acres operated as an efficient business unit where the principles of efficient farm management could be observed in practice.</P>
    <P>That is what they have not got. That is what we have down South. The President of University College Dublin said that a decision to acquire a new farm would have to be taken within ten years.  Professor Ruane is in agreement with his President and said he thought that it would be preferable to face the problem before the position would become untenable. The teaching of students could not be satisfactory if the position of the College farm is to become progressively more difficult.</P>
    <P>Here is a Commission set up by the Government and those are the observations brought to the attention of the Government and the Minister. Our fundamental industry, agriculture, has not been mentioned at all in this Estimate.  Is that not fantastic?  Yet we mouth all those clichés that agriculture is the backbone of our whole economic life.</P>
    <P>Winding up the discussion, they said:</P>
    <P>The teaching and laboratory accommodation of the agricultural faculty in the former Albert College is, as has been stated, in part domestic accommodation which has been converted.  This accommodation is not capable of being rendered permanently suitable for its present purposes.  Low-ceilinged dormitories are not suitable for laboratories.</P>
    <P>I was always under the impression that the Agricultural Institute, which was set up with the American grant, would have a faculty of Agriculture. That is not so.  Our premier industry is agriculture and it is being taught in low ceilinged dormitories to the men who are supposed to teach the farmers how to increase output and become more efficient.  The Commission say:</P>
    <P>Low ceilinged dormitories are not suitable for laboratories, and long narrow rooms are quite unsuitable <Col N="1121" /> for lecture halls.  An important research project&mdash;potentially of great value to agriculture&mdash;which we were shown was housed, for lack of a better place, in an out-office.</P>
    <P>These are the facts.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Minister is going to set up a Commission.  We have not heard what the terms of reference of the Commission will be. We have been told that he proposes to set up a Commission to survey the field of higher education.  What does that mean?  Can anyone tell me?  If I were Minister for Agriculture&mdash;a contingency which will never arise&mdash;I would not go home for the Easter holidays but would stay in Dublin and come to a decision about the faculty of Agriculture.  For God's sake and Ireland's sake, apart from Limerick's sake, get this faculty out of Dublin. The golden opportunity is there now. Is the Minister going to provide them with £100,000 or £200,000 as a rescue operation&mdash;to use the phrase he used in his introductory speech?  Surely he should catch the bull by the horns and tackle the problem now.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke for one and a quarter hours yesterday on the subject of education.  It is a terrible reflection on us that he made no reference of any consequence to the faculty of Agriculture. I will be reasonable.  Supposing Limerick did not exist&mdash;a consummation devoutly to be wished by many people, possibly&mdash;supposing there was no mention of Limerick, could the Minister not channel the funds into U.C.C. or U.C.G. for the provision of increased agricultural facilities so that the students in the third and fourth year, instead of travelling to Dublin, could stay at one of those universities? Is there any reason why they cannot finish the third and fourth years there?</P>
    <P>The only solution that I see is not necessarily to set up such a Commission. This question of agriculture cannot be dealt with by the Commission the Minister is setting up on higher education, which will take three to five years to report back, and the Minister could be Minister for another Department by that time, or <Col N="1122" /> in some other position.  Seriously speaking, it is necessary that the problem should be tackled within a reasonable time while the Minister is in the Department.  It would be very unwise to include the question of a faculty of Agriculture in the terms of reference of the Commission on higher education.</P>
    <P>I would have no objection if the Minister were to invite certain people to advise him and the Government as to (a) what steps are necessary for the improvement of agricultural education; (b) how the existing agricultural colleges could be approved, by an amendment of the existing charter of the National University of Ireland, so that certain years could be credited to them and (c) where a faculty of Agriculture for the whole of Ireland should be located.</P>
    <P>If Albert College want another 400 to 500 acres of land, there is no suggestion as to where that land could be obtained.  Is the Minister suggesting that the land in the vicinity of Albert College would be suitable for the purpose of pilot farms of 100 to 200 acres?  There is not a great deal of training needed if one wants to become a rancher.  One needs to be reared to the cattle trade from the age of 10 years.  The Minister would not seriously suggest that Albert College should be given permission to buy 500 acres around here?  The land would not be suitable for tillage, for research or for giving practical experience of the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>This position is heartbreaking.  I shall do all in my limited capacity to see that some quick decision is taken in regard to agriculture.  I shall do all I can to secure that some decision will be made in regard to the representations which have been before the Department for quite a while, to see whether we can get a decision from the Government in principle.  In a few minutes yesterday the Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael Moran, was given £3 million by this House for the drainage of the Moy, and I made the telling point that £2 million would stop the drain of young people from that part of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> This Fianna Fáil Government are the first Government to do anything constructive in relation to the critical position at Earlsfort Terrace; be that to their credit and be it to their credit that they have accepted the findings of the majority report in regard to locating the site at Belfield.  It is a pity they did not also bear in mind the observations in the report I have here.  This question of a University in Limerick is not of recent origin.  During the Mayoralty of the former Alderman Michael Hartney I recall a meeting being called to which the late Most Reverend Dr. Patrick O'Neill, Bishop of Limerick, gave his unstinted support, and the following is reported:</P>
    <P>(a)  For many years past there has been a persistent and a growing demand for the provision of University facilities for the sons and daughters of parents living in the populus area of which Limerick City (the third city in the State) is the natural centre.  This demand has found various expression over the years, notably in the setting up of a representative committee some 14 years ago, under the Chairmanship of the late Most Reverend Dr. Patrick O'Neill, Bishop of Limerick, and in the attention the subject has received from parents, teachers, schools, commercial, cultural and other bodies.</P>
    <P>(b)  It has been contended&mdash;quite rightly in the opinion of this committee, that the vast majority of parents cannot afford to send their children to Dublin, Cork or Galway, and in consequence, University education in this area has been confined to the children of the well-to-do and those young people who have been successful in securing the small number of scholarships offered annually by the local Councils and the State.  In the case of the latter, of course, the parents are still obliged to find a substantial yearly sum to augment the value of the scholarships.</P>
    <P>The raising of Limerick to the status of a University City would be of great benefit to its commercial life. <Col N="1124" /> I would ask the Minister to note the figures submitted to him by these committees and the upward tendency in regard to secondary education.  In 1936-37 in Limerick City alone there were 1,248 secondary school students. It should also be noted that Limerick County, Clare, North Tipperary and North Kerry have all passed resolutions in this regard.  There is no parochialism in these areas because they regard Limerick as a natural location for this constituent college, realising that it will be of benefit to them.  In 1936-37 there were 4,624 secondary school children in this area of North Munster and in 1958-59 that number grew to 11,000.  Comparing Cork, Limerick and Galway from the point of view of size and population we find that in 1957-58 there were 3,700 secondary school children in Cork, 2,200 in Limerick and 1,100 in Galway.</P>
    <P>I pointed out some time ago that other bodies besides Limerick sought extra-mural courses.  I specifically mentioned the higher diploma in Education.  Would the Minister tell me what is the background to this peculiar state of affairs?  I read from this report which I have already quoted:</P>
    <P>(c)  With the co-operation of U.C.C. to provide courses in Limerick for the Higher Diploma in Education.  This matter was first raised at an early meeting of the Committee when it was unanimously agreed that the establishment of such a course in Limerick would be a valuable step forward.  At present, this course is confined to the University Centres with consequent great inconvenience to teachers, resident in and near Limerick.  In fact, the Committee are aware of certain teachers who have been teaching in this area for years and have never had the opportunity of securing the H. Dip. in Education.</P>
    <P>With the co-operation of Dr. Atkins and the helpful and encouraging support of his Lordship Most Reverend Dr. Murphy, considerable progress was made in arranging for a start to be made on this course in October, 1959.  A senior lecturer was engaged after <Col N="1125" /> much difficulty; assistant lecturers were to be recruited locally and accommodation was readily available. Following these steps, a notice appeared in the Press announcing that the authorities of U.C.C. were considering the provision of a H. Dip. in Educ. course in Limerick and inviting intending candidates to notify the Registrar of the college.  Hardly had this notice appeared when a circular letter was sent to each candidate who had applied to take the course in Limerick stating that &lsquo;owing to various problems which had arisen it would not be possible to provide such a course in 1959-60.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>This turn of events came as a great disappointment to the committee and, needless to say, to the intending participants in the proposed Limerick course.  The committee understand that almost 60 candidates applied to take the course in Limerick.  Of these, about half had the necessary qualifications required by the University authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a problem of the greatest magnitude on his hands.  It will not be easy to arrive at a solution but the longer he thinks of the problems that confront him the deeper he will get into the mire.  The longer he stays in the Department of Education the more departmentally-minded he will become.  Now is a time for him, in the full flush of youth and inexperience, to take action.  Inexperience is a tremendous thing sometimes because one can, as an outsider, consider the pros and cons without being committed to any fixed point of view.  This does not require the advice of any Departmental officials as such; it requires common-sense.  As I said at the outset, if the Minister would agree to my statement that the economic expansion plan envisaged too long a period and if he agrees that what is needed in Ireland now is an industrial, an agricultural and an intellectual revolution all over a period of five years, then he must act quickly in these matters.</P>
    <P>As things are, there are proposals in <Col N="1126" /> the Department of Education which are evidently to be discussed by Commissions and future Commissions of the Department.  The school-going children of today will not alone not have the facilities we are advocating but their children will be very lucky if University education has been improved by their time up to the standard we want, not alone in the Department of Education but in Ireland generally. The whole trouble is this delay&mdash; there is not a sufficient spirit of being up and doing.</P>
    <P>It is very little use for the Taoiseach to make speeches about increased productivity or for the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Education himself to follow on similar lines if they do not do their part.  Surely it is accepted that if the farmer is to give increased productivity and output, the maxim should be that he should have the best advice available in the State? After all, if a patient is sick the best physician or surgeon should be called and his advice taken.  Does the Minister seriously suggest that his neglect and the neglect of his Department to create a Faculty of Agriculture can continue in view of the position of this country where agriculture is supposed to be the mainstay?  Is he being realistic?  It will be a bad day's work if some quick decision on this matter is not taken.  Naturally, I am biassed in favour of having this University located in Limerick. I do not know where else it could be located&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sorry for stressing this point so often but I must appeal to the Minister to be more specific before this debate concludes.  Nowhere do I see in his statement that this question of the Faculty of Agriculture is discussed.  He said last night that an inter-Departmental Committee had been set up by the Government to advise on the establishment of a post-graduate course for science graduates and that in that connection it was estimated the cost would be £250,000 <Col N="1127" /> of which the College authorities would contribute £100,000.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I had better sit down?  The Minister said that as a result of the recommendations of this inter-Departmental Committee it was proposed to expend £250,000 of which the University itself would contribute £100,000.  When replying, would the Minister let us know why this quarter of a million pounds is to be spent in the already overcrowded Dublin area?  In the Commission's report we see that the present residential facilities in Dublin are not nearly adequate and yet it is proposed, with this post-graduate science course, to create a worse problem.</P>
      <P>I sincerely trust that the Minister will give his attention to these problems.  If, by any stretch of imagination, the Minister fails to locate this Faculty of Agriculture in Limerick&mdash;I do not believe in view of the arguments put to him by me and which will be followed in a more capable manner, no doubt, by Deputy Russell and the Mayor of Limerick, Deputy Carew&mdash;he will be doing a great disservice to agricultural Ireland.

      <P>A voice crying in the wilderness.  I think the quotations and extracts which I have given the Minister and the House from the report of the Commission in the past hour are sufficient to prove that the faculty of Agriculture must be established outside Dublin.  The Minister will have a lot of explaining to do if <Col N="1128" /> he wants to say that he came into this House looking for £7,000,000 and never mentioned where the faculty is to be located.  Was it an omission on his part?  I submit that the suggestions I have put before him would solve one of the problems in regard to the faculty of Agriculture but I think he should also give further consideration to what his advisers told him&mdash;that the building of Belfield would take 20 years&mdash;a proposition that is fantastic and ridiculous.  The whole project could be started and finished within five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>So that there may be no misunderstanding, it is necessary for me to explain the system adopted by the Dublin Board of Assistance for revising its medical register.</P>
      <P>Every six months or so, the Board issues an advertisement indicating that cards bearing certain numbers (which are those of cards issued nine to fifteen months previously) will cease to be current after a date about three months ahead and inviting holders of such cards to apply for fresh cards if they wish to do so.  All such applications are decided on their merits in the light of all the current circumstances of the applicant.  The &ldquo;lapsed&rdquo; cards cannot, therefore, be regarded as withdrawn, as, in all appropriate cases in which application is made, they are replaced by new cards.</P>
      <P>In addition to the automatic lapsing of cards by the effluxion of time, cards are withdrawn from time to time where evidence becomes available to the Board that the holder has ceased to be, or never was, entitled to have a card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The records of the Board are not maintained in such a form that it <Col N="1129" /> would be possible, without a great deal of detailed examination, to supply statistics of the number of instances in which lapsed cards were not replaced after application or in which cards were withdrawn.  The number of instances in which cards were withdrawn is, however, stated to be small.</P>
    <P>The following information bearing on the general question may be of interest to the Deputy:</P>
    <P>The number of cards declared lapsed by the effluxion of time during the year 1959 was 24,757.  Many of the persons who held such cards did not apply for new cards.  Some, for instance, had died.  In other cases, the circumstances of the holders of cards presumably improved.  It is not possible to say how many applied for renewal of their cards but the total of the applications made for cards, including renewals, in the year was 32,127.  Of these applications, 23,374 were granted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person who has suffered from poliomyelitis is regarded as being entitled to free treatment under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1948, until such time as the appropriate orthopaedic surgeon certifies that further treatment would not be of benefit.  Health authorities have been notified that the scope of the regulations is not limited to institutional services and that all appliances necessary for treatment may be provided thereunder.  It follows that health authorities may arrange for the repair or renewal of surgical appliances in such cases.</P>
      <P>In any case where it is considered that further treatment under the Infectious Diseases Regulations would not be beneficial, the repair or renewal of surgical appliances would be governed by the provisions of the Health Acts, 1953 to 1958, and regulations made thereunder.</P>
      <P>Persons who are holders of medical cards may in all cases be supplied free of charge with appliances and the repair or renewal of such appliances would be the responsibility of the health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appliances are normally supplied free of charge to members of the middle income group only as part of in-patient hospital treatment, and repair or renewal would be the responsibility of those persons; where hardship would, however, be involved it is open to such persons to seek assistance <Col N="1131" /> from their health authority for the supply, repair or renewal of an appliance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a question by Deputy Dr. <Col N="1132" /> Browne on 24th ultimo, the complete composition of any food or drink has not been laid down by statute or under powers conferred by statute.  There is, therefore, no statute or statutory instrument specifically regulating the content of imitation or substitute cream in confectionery.</P>
      <P>I have indicated also in reply to a question by the Deputy on 25th ultimo that the statutory provisions under which I am empowered to fix standards for foods are specifically limited in their application to cases &ldquo;where the Minister is of opinion that the composition&rdquo; of the food is &ldquo;of special importance to the public health&rdquo; (Section 56 of the Health Act, 1947).  I am not satisfied that present circumstances are such as to warrant my having recourse to those powers with a view to prescribing a standard for substitute cream.</P>
      <P>The manufacture of substitute cream is already controlled in certain respects in the interests of public health.  The Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950, are designed to ensure that food intended for human consumption is not diseased, contaminated or otherwise unfit for human consumption, and Part III of these Regulations prescribes certain minimum standards, both structural and operational, for premises in which food is manufactured.  Registration with the local health authority is obligatory under the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950 (Commencement of Part IV) Order, 1951, for all such premises.</P>
      <P>Under the Public Health (Preservatives, etc., in Food) Regulations, 1928 and 1943, the use of preservatives in most foods, including imitation cream, is prohibited.  The use in any food of certain colouring matters, which are set out in Part II of the First Schedule to the Regulations, is also prohibited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is in the negative. Properly-equipped surgical centres would require a Theatre Suite with all necessary personnel.  For major surgery, the personnel would be a Surgeon, an Anaesthetist, depending on circumstances, a Resident Medical Officer, a Theatre Sister, and additional nursing staff.  Radiological services would also be needed.  It would be out of the question to provide all these facilities in small District Hospitals such as Ballina and Belmullet when a major surgical centre is available in the county.</P>
      <P>All the facilities required for surgery are provided in the County Hospital at Castlebar, backed by services for more specialised types of surgery at regional centres.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960 for Grants to Universities and Colleges, including certain Grants-in-Aid&mdash;(Minister for Education).</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have before us a token vote of £10 for the needs of the different Universities of this country. That token vote of £10 can be described as an indication of the future expenditure to which this country is committed.  The figure has been given as £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 but from what I learn it will be at least £12,000,000.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to decry the merits or worth of Dublin.  I speak in the interest of Galway University but, with regard to Dublin, I would suggest to the Minister that he should hasten more slowly.  If he is prepared to meet the needs of Galway University and Cork University, we can help the situation in Dublin.  We hear that Dublin is bursting at the seams at the moment; so is Galway but Galway has not the problem of having to provide the sites.  We have the sites available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the needs of the constituent Colleges made special reference to Galway University and the need for expenditure of £600,000.  When the findings of that Commission were furnished to the former Minister for Education, Deputy Lynch, he said that he accepted them without any reservation and that Galway University was in immediate and urgent need of accommodation. I should like to stress the words &ldquo;immediate and urgent&rdquo;.  If the present Minister is of the same mind and is prepared to carry out the <Col N="1153" /> findings of the Commission we shall help to relieve his headache with regard to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned that in his first year at College he spent one hour on three days a week at lectures. He is a graduate of the College&mdash; whether that is a credit to the college itself or not I will not stress.  He said that he had three one hour lectures per week in his first year.  It may have been that with the crowded classrooms the authorities may have had to tighten up the amount of time they could give.  I know that no sooner is a classroom in University College, Galway, vacated by one group of students than it is filled to the doors by another.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister on his statement that he is prepared to come to the rescue of the Galway College but he will have to start immediate rescue operations or it will not be a rescue at all but a postmortem. The Minister has the figures of the grants per student to each college and he will see that Galway is the lowest of all.  I want to point out to the Minister that that has been the attitude of his Department towards Galway all over the years.  I feel that the new Minister may have a different attitude towards Galway and I hope that he will.</P>
    <P>We have heard the case made for the establishment of the faculty of Agriculture in Limerick but I would remind the House that 110 years ago we had a Professor of Agriculture in Galway.  Time marched on and, like everything else, the screw was put on Galway.  Money was scarce and that professorship has since gone by the wayside.  However, we have a course already and it is only a question of extending that to the full course.  May I point out to the Minister that we have abundant facilities in that regard? We have a farm of 608 acres attached to Athenry College which is within a few miles of Galway so that with very little expenditure we can complete the full course in Agriculture in Galway.</P>
    <P>The demand for such a course has come from the farmers' groups, from the local statutory bodies and from <Col N="1154" /> the I.C.A.  They have every right to a say in the matter.  I have mentioned Athenry.  I could go further and mention the sheep research centre in Ballinrobe which is within a reasonable distance of Galway.  We have students from all over Ireland coming to Galway, even from as far away as Louth, Donegal and Kerry.</P>
    <P>I think that the claims of Galway as regards extended accommodation and as regards the faculty of Agriculture are as good as those of any place else. May I point out that some of the most brilliant men this country ever produced came from Galway?  The man who first proposed the Shannon Scheme was a graduate of Galway.  The scheme was referred to at the time as a white elephant but it has proved of tremendous advantage to the country.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about decentralisation and, in my opinion, a great deal of lip service to the idea.  If the Chair of Agriculture is to be extended, let it be extended where, with the least expenditure, the situation can be met.  I have referred to two agricultural establishments&mdash;the Agricultural College in Athenry and the sheep research station at Ballinrobe&mdash;all within easy reach.  The Minister should have the question examined before committing himself finally to Dublin.</P>
    <P>A request has been made to the Minister to establish a Diploma of Mechanical Engineering.  I also put it to the Minister that he should consider establishing a Diploma in Marine Science in Galway, which would be ideally suited for the purpose.  That question may be too involved for me to deal with it in this debate but I would ask the Minister to examine it.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister seriously to consider establishing a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering in view of the great demand for technicians. I warn the Minister against the danger of the old school tie idea. I do not know from what College the Minister graduated but there is a danger of the old school tie playing its part, of everything being centralised in Dublin and the possibility of another skyscraper going up.</P>
    <P>In other countries the various <Col N="1155" /> faculties of University Colleges may be scattered all over a town and are not centralised.  I do not agree with the argument put up here last night that it is in the interests of students that all the faculties should be contained in one building.  I do not think that applies in the case of some of the foremost Universities of the United States of America.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the constitutional right of parents to send their children to the University that suits them.  That brings out my point.  Where parents have chosen to send their children to, say, Galway, they may stay there for the first two years and then the Minister says they must come to Dublin.  I do not know if the constitutional right is recognised in that case.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to consider the establishment of a Diploma of Mechanical Engineering in Galway.  No other college has made that proposal to the Minister and I do not want some other college to steal a march on Galway. That suggestion has been made to the Minister and there is nothing to prevent him meeting it.  The demand is spontaneous.  We are not interested in the professional angle of it.  We are interested in the common good of Connaught and the western seaboard, which extends from Donegal to Kerry.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he would be prepared to consider rescue operations. If the Minister considers rescue operations are needed, there must be immediate rescue.  I would urge the Minister to take immediate steps to provide the accommodation required at University College, Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister did not touch upon all facets of University education, he did make a pretty comprehensive survey, a survey which was totally unexpected having regard to the amount which he asks the Dáil to give him but which, in view of the decision which he wants with regard to U.C.D., was quite justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> One must be careful in this House about making broad statements but I think it could be said that many parts of the Minister's very long speech were somewhat encouraging, not alone in regard to University education but in regard to education in general.  However, some very depressing notes were struck, the most depressing being the statement by the Minister of the undoubted fact that it is unfortunate that we export so many graduates. Many of us have had the vague idea that graduates were forced to emigrate to Britain and other countries.  The revelation is very depressing that one-half our doctor graduates are forced to emigrate, that nearly one-half of our civil engineers are forced to emigrate and that, in practically all other faculties, a very big proportion of the students on whom so much has been spent by the State are forced to have recourse to employment in other countries.  That represents a tremendous loss to the country, to its economy and financial resources. There is the small consolation that while we cannot offer them employment at home, we do equip them reasonably well to take their place among graduates, professional or industrial, in the countries where they seek a livelihood.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased that the Minister mentioned another matter.  His view was approved by the leader of the Fine Gael Party.  I think I correctly interpreted the Minister and Deputy Dillon in saying that they suggested that not only should our graduates be specialists in the faculty they adopt but should also have a good, sound, rounded education, with an appreciation of values, not so much scientific, technical and professional, but of life in general.  If that idea were carried out it would make us noteworthy because it is notable, especially in universities in the United States of America, that they turn out specialists. Many of us have met Americans who are specialists in some field but do not know very much beyond that.  That has been my experience of many American University graduates.  To our credit it can be said of our system of education that, in addition to having a degree in a particular faculty, <Col N="1157" /> Irish University graduates have that good sound education about which the Minister and Deputy Dillon spoke in this debate.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises the great shortcomings in accommodation and in other respects as far as U.C.D. is concerned.  While Deputy O'Malley lashed the Government on their financial policy, their educational, agricultural and industrial policy, he was absolutely wrong when he attempted to redress the position in which he found himself by saying that this Government was the first that ever thought of doing anything for U.C.D. or who ever thought of transferring U.C.D. to Belfield by spending a number of million pounds on the establishment of a proper University.  That was started far back, as far as I can remember. I can say without prejudice it was first started by the inter-Party Government in 1948 and, to my knowledge, the idea was pursued and pursued very much during their period of office from 1954 to 1957.</P>
    <P>I do not make a point of that, but the Minister's main purpose in introducing this Estimate is to endeavour to get approval from this House to establish University College <i>in toto</i> at Belfield.</P>
    <P>I agree with the majority of Deputies not so much on account of the cost but on account of the facilities which undoubtedly exist in Belfield.  If University education is to progress at the rate it has progressed in the past 20, 30 or 40 years it must have room to expand.  Even if the Government were to expend something like £2,000,000, which in my opinion is a very conservative figure, for the acquisition and demolition of certain buildings in the vicinity of U.C.D. at Earlsfort Terrace, I believe it would be a much better proposition to establish the College at Belfield where they have so much room to expand.</P>
    <P>There are many objections to that course, but they are very short-term objections.  Many of the present students in U.C.D. have criticisms to make of the proposed transfer on the grounds that they will be upset as far as lodging accommodation is concerned and it will be inconvenient for <Col N="1158" /> them to travel from the centre of the city or from the north side of the city to the proposed establishment at Belfield. Those are very short-term criticisms which I believe will resolve themselves especially when, as the Minister suggested in his speech, there will be hostel or lodging accommodation in Belfield or at least in the vicinity of Belfield.</P>
    <P>I am appalled at the thought&mdash;the Minister probably has very good reasons for what he said&mdash;that it will take 20 years to establish this building at Belfield.  He did not go into very great detail.  I do not know whether he meant that the last fitting would not be installed in the building for 20 years or whether the building itself would take 20 years to complete, that is, between the preparation of plans, the actual building, and so on. If, as the Minister says, and I think we all agree, there is a great necessity for a new University building it should be done in one-fifth of that time.  It is true we have not the same technical resources as many other countries but it is a well-known fact that in Britain, in the United States and particularly in Germany they run up buildings in no time.  I cannot see why it cannot be done here.  The only thing that can stop us here is money. The Minister cannot tell us it is money which will stop him because the Taoiseach has said that if there is any worthwhile project that needs money, the money is there.  That is no misinterpretation of what the Taoiseach said.  He has said on many occasions that we have the money there, and it it is inconceivable that if we very much need a University in Dublin we should have to wait for 20 years before that University will finally be established at Belfield.  I hope the Minister will deal with that point when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned the important factor of the employment content. In the last inter-Party Government the members of that Government were concerned about employment and they initiated some schemes which gave employment to a number of men.  The Government at that time recognised that with the tapering-off <Col N="1159" /> of housing in certain respects, those employed in the building trade would have to be given work.  This is an admirable project which could be engaged in, if not this year, possibly next year or the year after to absorb many thousands of people who have been rendered unemployed by reason of the fact that building has not gone on at the same pace as it did in the recent past.</P>
    <P>I was expecting some encouragement in the Minister's speech about education and he did say something to the effect that every child, rich or poor, should be able to go to the top of the educational ladder.  I know the Minister is a well-intentioned man; at least he was well-intentioned as a Deputy and I trust he has not changed.  Is that just a wish or a promise?  Every one of us pays lip service to the idea that every child, however humble his circumstances, should have the best type of education available to him.  We know, of course, that does not happen.  It is true as far as primary education is concerned but not in regard to secondary education.  I cannot imagine how the Minister hopes to implement what I trust is a promise from him, in view of the present circumstances in regard to education.</P>
    <P>There are many children who cannot avail of secondary education by reason of the cost.  I think I should qualify that statement by saying that we all owe a tremendous debt to many of the teaching Orders.  I have experience of only one and I think that it can be said in respect of that that there is no real problem of cost in regard to the education of pupils who want to take secondary courses. I do not know whether that is true of other Orders or not but I do know of boys and girls who had to give up the idea of secondary education because they could not afford to pay the fees; sometimes if they did get a concession in respect of fees they found they could not continue their secondary education because they could not afford the books, which can be a fairly big item of expenditure in the budget of an ordinary family.  I <Col N="1160" /> am not saying that in criticism of these teaching Orders or any of these schools.  They could not carry on, having regard to the financial set up between themselves and the Department of Education, if they had to give a substantial number of pupils free education and free books.  However, the Minister's statement with regard to rich and poor having available to them all education facilities is contained in about twelve words but it means a tremendous amount and I hope the Minister is prepared to regard that not so much as a wish as a promise.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who want the whole country flooded with graduates or to see every student in the country doing the intermediate or leaving certificate, but I do believe that young children who show promise, no matter what their circumstances are, should have available to them secondary education and if needs be University education.  I know it would be difficult to do that.  For that reason I merely mention in passing what I suggested to the Minister on some other occasion, that he should establish some system of vocational guidance. We would have every child in the State irrespective of his ability opting to go forward for secondary and for University education as well.  I mention this in passing; I know it has not got much to do with this debate.</P>
    <P>I trust it is a promise and not merely the wish of the Minister when he says he intends to tie up, as far as possible, vocational education with University education.  A tremendous amount is being done to give reasonably good qualifications to pupils in the vocational schools, I think I would not be wrong in saying, particularly in Dublin&mdash;and perhaps in the other big cities as well.  The Minister will be doing a tremendous amount&mdash;not so much for education but for business, industry and agriculture&mdash;if he can, to some extent, dovetail vocational with University education.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly approve, despite some of the arguments against it, of the idea of the establishment of University College, Dublin at Belfield.  I was interested to hear Deputy O'Malley's <Col N="1161" /> argument in favour of the establishment of a Faculty of Agriculture in Limerick.  I appreciate that a Limerick man believes that Limerick has certain things to offer that would make it a better site for the establishment of that facility than anywhere else, but, as I listened to him, I thought he was making an admirable case&mdash;although I am not making a claim for it now&mdash;for the establishment of a Faculty of Agriculture at Johnstown Castle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this all-important matter on this token Vote, particularly in regard to the transfer of U.C.D. from its present location to its new site at Belfield.  I hope that the vote&mdash;and I trust that one will be challenged in the matter&mdash;will be so decisive as to give the Minister all the incentive he wants to proceed with this scheme at the fastest possible rate.  I hope he will recover from what I feel was the very bad bit of pessimism in which he talked of finishing in 20 years.  I am very jealous of the Minister, I may say, very jealous of the situation in which he finds himself, that the turn of the political wheel leaves it in his power on behalf of the Government to put this very important further stage to the completion of what was started in 1854 when this country first addressed itself to the theme and the objective of providing higher education for Catholics in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That began in 1854 and the stage then developed to what was called Newman's University, up to the old &ldquo;Royal&rdquo;, through the Jesuit control of U.C.D. and eventually to the passage of the 1908 Act.  One of the things that I feel Deputy O'Malley lit on by accident as regards accuracy was that he said there was not a full demand.  Whatever it was, the idea was taken up with the objective of making the best possible use of promoting the aim and objective of higher education for Irish Catholics.  The 1908 Act was developed and the Charter has even been changed by a slow process.  Certain improvements have taken place in practice which I hope will be developed by amendment to the Charter, if that be necessary, because that old instrument certainly <Col N="1162" /> is not fully adequate for the present necessities of any of the Colleges of the University or even for the federal body, the &ldquo;National&rdquo; itself.</P>
    <P>In 1926, one effort was made to provide, or make up for some of the deficiencies there were in the old provision by the National University and that was when the College of Science and later, the Glasnevin College, were both handed over to U.C.D.  That, certainly, represented a great enlargement of the facilities and teaching facilities in that College.  They got a big development of the Science Faculty and the Engineering Faculty.  They got some provision for development of agriculture through students in this country.  That situation remained until 1948.  Deputy Corish is right in what he says.  I want to emphasise what he says not for any Party purpose whatever because, as far as we are concerned, we are joining wholeheartedly behind the Minister and his Party in this new stage&mdash;not the final stage&mdash;of University progress.  It is a very important stage to which we have now come.</P>
    <P>I make these remarks because very often the criticism levelled against this project may be stated in two words&mdash; that the decision is precipitate and that there has been a certain amount of secrecy surrounding development to the stage we have now reached. So far as speed is concerned, in this matter there has been delay that is difficult to understand.  As far as I I am concerned, the matter started in 1948 when permission was given to U.C.D. to wipe off its overdraft and to put its superannuation fund into a solvent position as well as to require provision for better terms for the staff in that College.</P>
    <P>The President of U.C.D. was told that an old ban that had been put by the Department of Finance on U.C.D. itself in respect of overdraft was withdrawn.  The letter was ambiguously worded but&mdash;and I conveyed this myself to the President&mdash; the intention was that the President, having the overdraft cleared, should avail himself of the new opportunity he had to get a further overdraft for the purpose of buying the lands at Belfield.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> There was secrecy possibly at that point but I considered that that was the best way of dealing with the matter instead of coming here with a token vote for £10 for the purpose of making it clear that U.C.D. would build on that new site which was being looked for.  It was thought that the best way to have the purchasing done at some reasonable cost was to have the matter shrouded in secrecy in that way for a period.  But the matter had been discussed by the Governing Body of U.C.D. for some years.  It was not a new thing in 1940 as far as this body was concerned.  When I heard of it, it was in an advanced stage though not at the stage reached under the auspices of the recent Commission, but we had advanced a stage to the time when it was not merely a pious aspiration.  Plans were made, rough plans with nothing like the detail now available, but definite plans.</P>
    <P>The College authority which is the Governing Body, had over many years discussed this matter.  There were representatives of different organisations on the Governing Body and there was no question of secrecy.  The matter was openly discussed as far as the Governing Body was concerned. The Governing Body of U.C.D. consisted of a group of people, 34 in number; ten of those represent outside interests.  There are eight people elected by the General Council of County Councils, the Lord Mayor of Dublin is there <i>ex officio</i> and there are representatives of the County Council of Dublin.  There are four representatives of the Government; six people elected by the graduates of U.C.D.; six elected by the Academic Council and three who come from the Seanad&mdash;a mixed body but certainly not one that could be relied upon to maintain complete secrecy over anything they were to discuss, and there was no pledge of secrecy.  The matter was discussed by them and I could, through my associations, hear that the idea was permeating through and was getting a good hearing.</P>
    <P>The Governing Body of University College, Dublin is elected for three <Col N="1164" /> years.  Suppose I take 1948, though the question started in 1947.  There have been four or five changes in the personnel of the Governing Body in that time.  It has had this matter under consideration from time to time and I understand at no time has there ever been found as many as five people in separate Governing Bodies to have any objection to the plans then being promoted. As far as my efforts with the College went, having provided them with certain funds with the authority of this House, I then said to them they could proceed through overdraft arrangements to buy in that way the very valuable property which they now possess.</P>
    <P>As far as speed in this matter is concerned, it was announced here, possibly not in a blatant way, what was on foot.  When I went into Opposition in 1951 I took the first occasion on one of the Votes to speak very diffidently about this whole matter, to ask how far the plans had progressed, and to urge the Government to make speed in bringing these plans up-to-date and in giving sanction for expenditure of money and a promise to provide the money.  When the inter-Party Government resumed office in 1954, Deputy J.A. Costello, as Leader of the Government, took the occasion of a celebration in connection with University College, Dublin to make a public pronouncement that the Belfield plans had been fully approved by the Government of 1954, and he went on to add, as they had been previously approved in the 1948 period.</P>
    <P>It is quite wrong for people to speak of this as being hurried.  I thought words had lost their meaning when I read the other day a prominent reference in a paper using this word &ldquo;precipitate&rdquo;, asking the Government not to precipitate a decision on this matter owing to the nature of it and saying that once a decision was taken it would be irrevocable.  Apart from that, I had always understood, through various people on the Governing Bodies who had affiliations with the Party that now forms the Government, that there was no Party division on this matter and that Fianna Fáil, as well as Fine Gael, were definitely in <Col N="1165" /> favour of this further provision, for, as I say, higher education for Catholics in this country.  When I had again become a member of the Opposition, several times I asked why the plans were not being pushed forward more speedily and finally the Commission was established.</P>
    <P>I remember feeling disappointed because, if we take the four Governments in power since 1947 to the present time, these plans had the approval of all the Governments and all the Governments had agreed that the money would have to be found. It was only a question of what was the appropriate date for the introduction of a Vote of this type in order to have the public given full knowledge of what was proposed.  The answer I consider most satisfactory when the Commission was set up, was that there was a certain amount of comment in the country, voiced mainly through some of the newspapers, that there had been a certain amount of unnecessary secrecy about the matter and the Commission was regarded as the best way of dealing with it, a Commission before which witnesses could go and a Commission which would eventually report.</P>
    <P>The Commission took three years and more in their deliberations and at the end they have reported in favour of the Belfield plan.  It is quite clear from reading that report that they started off with a prejudice against the move to Belfield.  They started off directing their minds as to whether it would not be possible to preserve what they call the traditional association of the University with the area in which University College, Dublin, now stands.  They were driven by force of circumstances and they report in terms which make it clear that the circumstances were overwhelmingly against the proposal to stay in Earlsfort Terrace, and by force of circumstances they were driven to vote in favour of the move to Belfield.</P>
    <P>One comment that occurred in the Minister's speech last night should be brought home to the people who are now making objections to this move. It is in the typescript of this speech, <Col N="1166" /> paragraph 43, where he says, speaking of the Commission:</P>
    <P>After one and a half years' labours, however, during which it held 33 meetings, visited twenty different institutions, both at home, in Britain and on the Continent, and received evidence from numerous home and foreign experts and interested parties, it found itself forced to the conclusion again in its own words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the English and Danish Universities we visited, we found that the authorities were dealing with problems similar to the problem of University College, Dublin.  We met administrators and, in some cases, architects and building officers.  We discussed the solution of the Dublin problem with them.  Everything we heard of the experiences of these other universities has indicated to us that the right solution of the Dublin problem&mdash;and the only final solution for it&mdash;is to transfer the College, the entire College, to a new site of adequate size.</P>
    <P>The last sentence is:</P>
    <P>The advice we received in these universities unanimously supports that view.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In another part of his speech, at paragraph 61 he dealt with a matter which has been canvassed in a certain newspaper outside, that is with regard to the suggestion that part of University College, Dublin, might remain at Earlsfort Terrace and that part might be transferred out to the Belfield site. He said:</P>
    <P>The Commission's final conclusion, after thorough investigation of all these matters, was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The difficulty in the case of University College, Dublin, has been to find for the College's accommodation problem a solution which will maintain the general physical unity of the College. We think that it is essential to maintain that unity.  Without this unity and the opportunity of mingling together which it affords to students and professors of the different <Col N="1167" /> faculties, the College would lose what is one of the most valuable attributes of a University.  It would in our opinion be no solution of the problem to build the College's additional accommodation requirements (450,000 square feet net)&mdash;(which is the equivalent of 600,000 square feet gross) &mdash;on the Stillorgan Road site and to leave the rest of the College at Earlsfort Terrace and Upper Merrion Street.  This would divide the College, make it less than a university, and seriously affect the quality of the students.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are two of the matters that are being spoken of outside, mainly spoken of in a newspaper that certainly has not any tradition of furthering the cause for higher education for Catholics in Ireland.  In this morning's paper.  <i>The Irish Times</i>, in its editorial worries how the precious unity of University College, Dublin, is going to be preserved.  We can imagine the sleepless nights the Editor of <i>The Irish Times</i> spent worrying over the &ldquo;precious unity&rdquo; of University College, Dublin.  Certain other comments which follow are just as hollow as that.</P>
    <P>Even in my time, my student days, which go back about fifty years now, I have seen a great improvement in the situation with regard to the provision of higher education for Catholics in Ireland.  A colleague of mine, in an address which he read, spoke of the different attitude there was these days towards education compared to that at the time when subscriptions were being collected for a Catholic University.</P>
    <P>The phrase he used was: &ldquo;The present attitude of the Irish people is in marked contrast to that of 100 years ago following the famine.  When over a million people had died of hunger and typhus they subscribed their pennies at the church doors to start the Catholic University.&rdquo;  We are following at least in their tradition in this debate in providing from the resources of a better organised State the moneys that are required in order not any longer to start a <Col N="1168" /> Catholic University but to put on a better foundation University College, Dublin, that emerged from the struggles of the people in those early years.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise here that I hope we have heard the last of the talk about amalgamating with Trinity in the Minister's very decisive phrases last night.  The Minister said that one of the things that had to be remembered was the sacrifices that had been made by people in this country to get education of this type for the people who belonged to the religion of the main body of the country, and he has said that he could not back it himself.  I do not think any Government could live in this country that would back it and put the parents of University students in the position that they had to go to an institution where they did not believe that their essential needs in education would be properly catered for.</P>
    <P>I turn again to my staff colleague and what he said, looking back on the old days and recording history in a very brief paragraph.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The structure of the present Irish University system was hammered out most painfully fifty years ago as the culmination of a long struggle led by the Irish Hierarchy to secure under conditions acceptable to them opportunities of University education for Irish Catholics equal to those enjoyed by the religious minority, at that time the cultural and material ascendancy of the country.  It was also the general desire that the University should be democratic and national in its outlook.  In fact, as far back as 1887 Dr. Walsh said that it should be a National University.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us keep clear of agreements of the type that Cardinal D'Alton described as ill-considered experiments in the educational field.  In a speech he made in June, 1958, he said: &ldquo;There seems to be desire on the part of some to throw the University question once more into the melting pot and to aim at some type of merger between the existing Universities in the Republic.  That <Col N="1169" /> would be an attempt at a union of incompatibles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that the Minister's view last night is the view of the Government and that he clearly is against this effort to make a union between people between whom there can be no unity. I take it in any event that there is one thing removed from any further Commission of Inquiry or from any hesitancy, and that is the question of the Belfield move.  I take it also from what the Minister said in very strong but proper language that there is no longer any thought here now, or in 50 years' time, of anything that can be called an amalgamation between the National University of Ireland and the other University we have.  We have in this country a particular outlook on life, and I want to quote from a pamphlet written many years ago with regard to higher education for Catholics for Ireland.  It said that elsewhere than in the National University there was no attempt made to provide a knowledge of Catholic religious, philosophical, ethical or social teaching, quite apart from the books recommended in the various courses. It also spoke about the staff that might be selected to guide students with the aid of certain books along the lines of their development through the different subjects.</P>
    <P>The pamphlet at a later stage went on to speak of the philosophy of life that Catholics in this country have, and described it as &ldquo;one that runs counter to the notions and conventions of the non-Christian pagan world, which sets up a high moral standard and which, therefore, imposes a great strain on those who will not compromise with the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It said that &ldquo;the forces working against adherence to Catholic faith and morals are undoubtedly great for all classes of people in the modern world, but they are especially great for those engaged in higher studies where they will meet difficulties of every kind against Catholic faith and morals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our National University is the bulwark against those dangers, and even though there is the criticism that it does not fully correspond with <Col N="1170" /> certain definitions of what a National University should be, at least it is one in which the Catholic view of life prevails and it is a very good thing that the College, by the provision of better provisions and removal to a site where it can expand, can give people of every category a better opportunity to guide students along correct ways by the provision of the site and the developments that must follow the development of Belfield.  There is definitely a new stage being reached as far as the Catholic University in this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to return again to the lecture delivered by a colleague of mine when he spoke of what Universities do in other countries, more particularly Universities in small countries like this.  I quote it as something that I think will be accepted by people who give serious thought to this matter. The passage I want to refer to is this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In a small country the Universities will carry on their normal work of producing educated professional men and women and generally satisfying the vocational needs of the community.  In another way, however, a small country with limited resources is vitally dependent on its Universities.  Such a country inevitably can possess only a limited number of experts and scholars in the various fields of science and of knowledge, and must in a special way depend on these specialists to keep it abreast of the scientific and intellectual developments in the world outside if it is not to become a backwater.  In large countries there may be specialists in the great industrial corporations, in certain branches of Government and in various research bodies who can to some extent replace the University in these matters.  In a small country with thriving Universities specialists in virtually all fields will be available doing their normal work, ready to act when needed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was claimed that the 1908 Act with the foundation of U.C.D. as one College in 1909 greatly helped the State but barely came in time to cater for the various people who derived <Col N="1171" /> their education from National University sources and helped to forward this country to any degree of prosperity it has attained.</P>
    <P>I want to make one last remark on one part of this.  In the Commission's Report they gave an estimate of the cost of the move; against that they set off the savings that would be made when the buildings now at Earlsfort Terrace can be handed over to the Government for use for Government or administrative purposes.  A great deal of argument has been used to show that this is a fictitious saving.  I do not know whether it will be so.  My consideration of the matter in 1948 was real enough, because in those days when the Belfield project was being considered and one thought of the Earlsfort Terrace site being evacuated and the college's whole work being done out along the Stillorgan Road I had certain views.</P>
    <P>I had got from the office of the Minister for Finance a statement of what buildings there were occupied by civil servants in his city and it was an amazing revelation to me to find that one knew of the buildings where the income tax people are, the offices in Dublin Castle, the offices across the street in Government Buildings and the offices in Government Buildings itself but there were numerous houses in addition scattered all over the city and mostly held on lease at fairly heavy rents.  The view I had was that there could be a revision of the public buildings situation taken to correspond with the move from Earlsfort Terrace to Belfield and it seemed to me that the staffs of the Civil Service could be accommodated in at least three buildings and the others turned back to their owners.</P>
    <P>That was the idea we had in 1948. I do not say that it was a very important consideration but it was of some importance and it helped to get the approval of the Government and of the Party to which I belong for all sections of the plans now approaching, I hope, finality under the Minister's auspices.  As I have said I am jealous of him for the reason that it falls to him to do this very important piece <Col N="1172" /> of work for Catholic education in Ireland.  I do not understand the mood of pessimism as to the time. It seems to me that people are afraid to get these plans going.  University College, Dublin will help in every possible way.</P>
    <P>There are groups already in existence which have been discussing and considering these plans in an advanced stage.  I cannot see why the money factor should stop this development or hinder its progress over 20 years. There is plenty of money in this country for worthwhile projects and this is a worthwhile project.  The Minister will add to the fame he will get from being the person to move this Vote if he will put some speed into the development of the matter.</P>
    <P>Many years ago when the Shannon scheme was under discussion that discussion took place in a period very much like the present period, the month of April.  April was then in the season which is known as Lent and one of my colleagues gave me the advice&mdash;<i>festina lente.</i>  What he meant was to make a lot of hurry during Lent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>The advocates of the Belfield site and the advocates of the new building programme for University College, Cork will be many in this House.  I think it my duty, as a former student of University College, Galway to make our plea for the needs of University College, Galway in relation to increased accommodation as set out in the report of the Commission on accommodation in the Constituent Colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with that matter, I should like to say how much I admired the fine speech made by Deputy McGilligan.  I think that anybody who listened to him and heard the views expressed by him, including the short historical account of the development of the college since its foundation, could not but be impressed.  I think that when he asked the Minister to speed up the time limit set by the Commission or by the Minister himself he was expressing the wishes of nearly everybody in this House.  Personally, I am wholeheartedly in agreement with <Col N="1173" /> what Deputy McGilligan has said and I feel that I should congratulate him on the fine contribution he has made to the debate.  I can now understand why he is such a good advocate at the Bar.  I hope that I shall never have the occasion to call on his services but if I have I shall be in very good hands.</P>
    <P>The needs of Galway are less than one-tenth, in terms of money, than those of Dublin.  The problem is the same, increased accommodation, and the solution is the same, availability of funds.  The problem is different in this respect that the proposed new buildings in U.C.G. will all be on the site of the existing University or in close proximity to it.  The extra land needed will be readily available.  A sub-committee was set up composed of the different faculties of University College, Galway, and that sub-committee drew up a priority list of the needs of the College over a period of years.</P>
    <P>That sub-committee submitted its report to the Governing Body of which I happen to be a member.  The Governing Body unanimously accepted the report on the needs for extra accommodation as prepared by the sub-committee and a copy of the report was forwarded to the Minister for Education.  A short while ago the Minister was gracious enough to receive a deputation from the Governing Body.  I was a member of the deputation led by His Grace Most Rev. Dr. Walsh, Archbishop of Tuam. We pressed the Minister to allow University College, Galway, to go ahead with the schedule of the priority of buildings as required by us.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the problem of University College, Galway, was also the problem of the other colleges.  He said that until Dáil Éireann had taken a decision on the matter his hands were tied.  Yesterday, when introducing the Supplementary Vote, he indicated that permission would be given by him to proceed with the necessary work and I now put it to the Minister that in none of the Colleges except U.C.G. will he find it possible to go ahead with the speed and expedition that all of us <Col N="1174" /> would like to see.  We had our plans prepared in advance of the publication of the report.  We have our architect employed and we have actually built, with the Minister's permission, one of the projects to which reference was made in the report.</P>
    <P>Originally University College, Galway, was designed for about 150 students and, as the Minister said yesterday, the figure has stood for the past five years at just under 1,000, which represents a six-fold increase in a period of about 30 or 35 years. The position there at present is very difficult for the students and the professors. At the last meeting of the Governing Body we were informed by one of the professors that he had spent a Saturday morning touring the college looking for a lecture hall for his class and could not find one and had to let his students go.  That can be readily appreciated in a college that was originally designed for 150 students and which now has an enrolment of 960 or 970.</P>
    <P>During the course of our discussions with the Minister for Education he pointed out that the figures in Galway had remained more or less static over the past four or five years; that the numbers had increased in University College, Cork, and in University College, Dublin, but that the Galway figures had remained more or less the same, at in or about 950 to 960.  Our fears in Galway are that the figures for the college will decrease unless something is done immediately to increase the accommodation there.  They certainly cannot increase.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Governing Body with regard to University College, Galway, are that three buildings be put in hand immediately.  They have placed them in a certain order of priority: Botany and Zoology laboratories to be set up.  The setting up of these laboratories would also ease the pressure on the Engineering School.  As I stated earlier on, half of the building is near completion.  We must acquire financial accommodation, whether by way of guaranteed increased overdraft or a grant from the Exchequer, of about £100,000 to tide us over the next two years and in <Col N="1175" /> that two years we hope to get permission from the Government or the Minister for Education to complete the Botany and Zoology laboratories.</P>
    <P>An Experimental Physics building with a Lecture Hall is also required. This would ease the most pressing needs of the Faculty of Arts and indeed it would also help the Faculty of Commerce because the Engineering buildings are at present being used by students of those two Faculties.</P>
    <P>The third item in our order of priority is an Assembly Hall, including a Café and adequate sanitary accommodation&mdash;all housed in one building &mdash;which accommodation is very urgently needed.</P>
    <P>I sincerely trust that it will be possible for the Minister to authorise us in University College, Galway, to proceed with that building plan, particulars of which have already been submitted. We are lucky enough to have a contractor on the job who is working on a time and material arrangement and offering rates that appear to be very attractive.  We want to keep that contractor on the job and to benefit from the low rates for the work and, indeed, from a continuation of the excellent work that he is doing on the College.</P>
    <P>The approximate estimated cost of the three items that I have mentioned is £300,000.  If the Minister would allow us, say, £100,000 and give us two years to complete one-third of the programme, I think that would meet with the wishes of the Governing Body and of the interested Faculties.</P>
    <P>Next year, it is hoped that University College, Galway, will introduce a four-year course leading to the Bachelor of Science Degree.  University College, Dublin, has had a course of that kind for a number of years.  The Galway degree course up to now was spread over three years but unless we are allowed to proceed and to provide the extra accommodation, as set out in the Report submitted to the Minister by the Governing Body, I am afraid that University College, Galway, will not be able to keep abreast of the times.</P>
    <P>I make a special plea for University <Col N="1176" /> College, Galway, also on this ground, that it is the only Constituent College of the National University in which Degrees courses can be done solely through the medium of the Irish language.  One cannot say that about University College, Dublin, or about University College, Cork.  In Latin, Greek, in all the scientific subjects, and the whole range of subjects leading to the B.Comm. Degree, lectures are given through the Irish language to students who so desire them.  That cannot be said of University College, Dublin, or University College, Cork.  If this House is sincere about the Irish language and about furthering the cause of the Irish language, it should be sincere about helping the only Constituent College of the National University that gives anything other than lip tribute to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I have nothing else to say about the proposal to transfer University College, Dublin to Belfield.  Judging from what I have heard in this House, there seems to be all-Party agreement on this proposal.  &ldquo;Belfield is best&rdquo; seems to be the judgment.  But, this much I do say: I was not greatly impressed by the letters written by University Professors or, indeed, by the statements made by them, with regard to this proposal.  They seem to want no discussion whatsoever of the matter.  They seem to regard it as a <i>fait accompli</i>, which I suppose it is. I think that weakened their case considerably in the eyes of the public. They took it for granted that one could not even refer to an alternative, that one could not even criticise them for saying that there was no alternative to transferring the University to Belfield.  If there were less pontificating from the professors of University College, Dublin, and a better attempt at making their case, which had already been made for them anyway by the Commission and indeed by the Government, it would have gone down better with the public.  I, for one, was not greatly impressed.  That is only a personal opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been represented to me that in making a contribution to this debate I am treading on rather delicate ground inasmuch as I happen <Col N="1177" /> to be a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, and this is a matter, the discussion of which should properly be confined to graduates of the National University.  I appreciate that point but at the same time it must be clear that I am, before everything else, a Deputy and, consequently, my responsibility is to the public that I represent here. The eventual expenditure under this Vote which will be very considerable will mean taxation on the people generally.  This undertaking is of such tremendous size that it would be absurd for any Deputy to stay silent during this momentous debate.  It is possible that I as an outsider from the point of view of the University Colleges, not being attached to any of the different factions which are inseparable from University life, would have an objective approach.</P>
      <P>I find it rather disturbing and slightly uncanny to listen to the debate which has been carried on here for some time and to discover so much agreement.  As Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Opposition, pointed out, this subject has raised a very wide, spirited and acrimonious controversy outside.  Many reputable, responsible and talented people are engaged on both sides outside this House and it is very disturbing to find that Deputies have apparently accepted, as Deputy Carty said a few minutes ago, the whole position as a <i>fait accompli</i>, that we merely tie up the strings and send the parcel back to the University authorities to get on with it as they see fit.</P>
      <P>This is not a <i>fait accompli</i> until the House decides the matter.  We are the supreme authority in the State and it is open to us to reject or accept all or any part of the representations of the Commission.  We are not bound to accept the findings of the Commission. It was set up merely to help or guide us but it has no final authority.  It could not usurp our authority nor should we deprive ourselves of our authority before any outside body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said the other day it was a pity that policy appears to be made in the front bench of both sides and that so far there has been no dissenting voice except that of Deputy O'Malley who <Col N="1178" /> dealt with the subject from a point of view different from mine, that is, whether the institution should go to Belfield or should not.  There has been very little attempt by any of the front benchers to examine the whole problem when we are considering whether the new University should be built at Belfield.  I do not think the back benchers have the excuse which I made on their behalf the other day, that the Government benches have the wonderful resources, the minds and the talents of the men of the Civil Service to assist them in disentangling the various points of view for and against this project.  The Opposition equally have a great reserve of talent to advise them, but there is not that excuse in this instance because all of us back benchers have had at our disposal the benefit of the views of people outside whom most of us on both sides respect and for whom we have the highest regard.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, an organisation called <i>Tuairim</i> went to very considerable trouble to prepare a comprehensive document which put at our disposal in the back benches a different side of the picture from that presented by the Government Commission. Therefore, if we choose to use the magnificent report of this independent, voluntary body, <i>Tuairim</i>, we have at our disposal what seems to me to be a reasonably objective analysis of the situation.  Even if we suggest that it is not objective, that they have some vested interest&mdash;I do not think they have but even assuming they have&mdash;there are the simple, incontrovertible facts which they have made available to us and which are not readily available to any independent Deputy.  Therefore, we are very well equipped to debate this whole question and I was very sorry to hear Deputy Michael Carty say the die is cast and there is very little we can do.</P>
    <P>In view of the apparent unanimity certainly among the back benchers and the absolute absence of any political content in the question, I cannot understand why the Minister could not have brought in his Vote, thrown the issue open to the House <Col N="1179" /> and allowed a free vote on the question. This would have been a wonderful opportunity for a decision by means of a free vote.  It would have given all Deputies a greater sense of responsibility in regard to their contribution to the debate and would have removed the rather despairing feeling that Deputy Carty appeared to have.</P>
    <P>It is very rarely we can take a decision by a free vote because of the organisation of politics in the country and that is understandable, but this matter is uniquely suited for such a decision.  It is very unlikely that the Minister will change his mind but I would plead with him to allow a free vote so as to give to the Deputies a greater sense of participation in this momentous decision. Deputy McGilligan was right when he said: &ldquo;I envy the Minister.&rdquo;  We all envy the Minister because he is in a situation to take a decision which could be of the greatest consequence to the country.  He has the opportunity to decide what form this great University will take, the qualifications, the standard of service that it will give to the minds of men and women, not for the next 20 or 30 years but for centuries to come.  For that reason it should be one of the most carefully thought-out and well considered debates ever held in this House.  I am very surprised at the decision that has been taken on the evidence that I have had put before me at any rate.</P>
    <P>The two points to be considered are whether it is desirable and if so, whether it is feasible.  Unfortunately, I could not gather from Deputy Dillon's speech whether he said this or whether he did not.  I hope I am not misquoting him, but I think he said it was undesirable that the University should be retained in the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My personal view is that it is desirable and expedient to transfer the University to Belfield and that it would be undesirable and inexpedient to keep it at Earlsfort Terrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the only <Col N="1180" /> two considerations&mdash;whether it is desirable and if it is, whether it is feasible.  I believe it to be desirable, without any question of doubt at all, that a great University such as is proposed here should remain in the heart of the city.  I believe, on the evidence that has been put before me, that it is feasible to retain the University within the city boundary.  Because of that, I believe that this decision to leave the heart of the city and go to Belfield is a retrograde one and not in the best interests of the University.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan suggested that this was not a hasty decision.  I think we are making a hasty decision, a decision forced on us by the gross overcrowding and the great difficulties under which teaching is carried out in U.C.D. at Earlsfort Terrace.  The Minister must indulge in what he called rescue operations.  The decision is forced on him and it is an urgent decision.  It is imperative that action be taken with the minimum of delay in order to allow the lecturers and professors to teach the students under reasonable conditions of accommodation and equipment for that accommodation.</P>
      <P>To me it is unbelievable that the Minister should suggest that this plan would be a 20-year plan.  I agree with Deputy O'Malley that it seems to be an extraordinarily dilatory consideration of the problem&mdash;20 years in which to spend £7,000,000.  One fact is obvious and that is that if we wait 20 years, seeing the way costs have gone up and are going up, it will cost much more than £7,000,000.  If that £7,000,000 is now a reliable estimate, the shorter the time spent in getting those buildings erected the less money it will take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even considered from that point of view, the financial one, to allow this to be a 20-year development plan will involve unnecessary cost.  I can give a comparison in hospital building. Before the war it cost between £300 and £400, I think, to build one general hospital bed; nowadays the cost runs as high as £2,000 or £3,000 per bed.  Building costs have rocketed and on the estimated cost here I should imagine the ultimate cost, if we wait <Col N="1181" /> for 20 years, will be in the region of £15,000,000 or £20,000,000.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside financial considerations, it seems that the need for these facilities for U.C.D. should be the prior consideration and no question of expense should be allowed to interfere with the provision of a University. I was particularly interested in the answer to a Parliamentary Question today by Deputy Lindsay about the cost of jet airliners&mdash; £6,000,000.  It will be spent, I suppose, in a matter of months to provide these jet liners which are unpredictably costly to operate and which probably will show no financial return in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the people of the country as a whole this is a relatively futile expenditure compared to expenditure which could enable these wonderful proposals to be carried out either at Belfield or at the present site.  The money which is to be spent on these jet airplanes could be spent to provide what is without question the most important amenity or facility for any society&mdash; higher education and an opportunity in the present state of scientific and technological advances to meet the need for various technocrats for industry.</P>
    <P>What crazy, upside-down sense of values allows a Government to sit <Col N="1182" /> down and write a cheque for £6,000,000 for a few jet airliners which will probably be out of fashion in a year or two?  Most of the other countries found it impossible to develop these services except by going into a group but we take it upon ourselves to spend £6,000,000 on them.  University authorities, on the other hand, must wait 20 years to spend their miserable £7,000,000 on this University project.  Surely the Government must begin to have some sanity about this question of education&mdash;the neglect of our primary schools, the lack of adequate buildings over years leaving us with some 1,000 underdeveloped or derelict buildings and the practical absence of secondary school education for all except the child who can pay.  I do not agree that secondary education, even with the small fee charged by the religious teaching Orders, is readily available to students; it is not.  There are factors involved with which I have dealt on other occasions such as the loss of income to the family and so on.</P>
