    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in view of the desirability of bringing the activities of State and semi-State bodies more under the control or supervision of the Oireachtas without at the same time interfering in their detailed day-to-day operations he will consider making arrangements so that a separate annual debate could take place on the activities of the principal bodies concerned, rather than having such discussion confined within the limits of the general Estimates, as obtains at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Control or supervision, as suggested by the Deputy, would, if these words are given their ordinary meaning, imply a degree of intervention by the Oireachtas in the activities of State-sponsored bodies which would be highly undesirable as well as being repugnant to the basic principles on which the Oireachtas has established such bodies.  In my view, as I have previously stated, the existing system is adequate to meet any reasonable need there is for parliamentary control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards bodies which receive grants from voted moneys, there are, in connection with the Estimates, sufficient opportunities for general debate or for the putting down of a motion by a Deputy in accordance <Col N="1184" /> with Standing Orders.  Where capital for such State-sponsored bodies is provided by legislation or where guarantees are given by the State for loan capital, the enabling Bills or Statutory Orders are open to full debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas, and such occasions have in the past arisen frequently.</P>
    <P>In the case of those of the principal State-sponsored bodies referred to by the Deputy which do not receive annual grants but the capital of which has been wholly or mainly subscribed or guaranteed by the State, I would, if there is a substantial demand in the House for such a procedure, be prepared to consider whether there is need for an arrangement whereby the House would be asked to allow time periodically for discussion of a motion dealing with the report and accounts of each such body which have been laid before the House pursuant to statute.  The extent to which other opportunities for Dáil debate are available in the case of a particular body would be a factor in the consideration of the need for a motion, and I would envisage that a motion in relation to each such body would not be required more frequently than once in a few years. I should also make it clear that I would not be in favour of such a procedure unless discussion on the motion were to be confined to matters of policy, arising out of the Report and Accounts, for which a Minister clearly has parliamentary responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has noted the suggested increases by the Federal Republic of Germany in tariffs for imports of industrial goods from countries other than those of the European Economic Community; what impact this proposal would have on the Irish economy; and whether he considers that it would be detrimental to the envisaged proposals for a wider European free trade area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy has in mind the possible effect on tariffs applicable by the Federal Republic of Germany to imports from third countries of certain proposals recently made by the Commission of the European Economic <Col N="1186" /> Community for the more rapid execution of the provisions of the Rome Treaty, in so far as those proposals would involve the earlier introduction of a common external tariff.  The proposals would also reduce the common external tariff of the Community by 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>I understand that the proposals referred to are at present under consideration by the Governments of the six members of the Community. Until a decision has been taken in the matter the eventuality envisaged by the Deputy remains hypothetical, and I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by making a statement on the effects on our exports to the German Federal Republic or on the proposal for a wider Free Trade Area of the adoption by the Governments of the Community of one particular course.</P>

      <P>The information requested is available only in respect of all persons who entered or left the State via the border and includes, therefore, both the receipts from visitors from Britain or other countries who left the State via the border as well as the receipts from Six County residents.  In addition the corresponding expenditure outside the State by Irish residents relates to the total of such expenditure by all those who returned via the border, whether incurred in the Six Counties or elsewhere.</P>

    <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the net and gross receipts in respect of tourism and travel, etc., of persons involved in such cross-border traffic for the years 1955-58.

In the latest completed two year period, viz.  1957-59, a total of 2,695 turbary allotments were made on numerous bogs throughout the country.  In the same period, a total of £109,000 was expended on turbary development.  Statistics are not available for the other details in the question.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question on this section if I may.  He may remember that two questions arose very specifically on the Second Stage, one relating to textiles, the other relating to tablets.  There is an amendment down to the Schedule relative to the tablets, which will provide an opportunity of further discussion on that specific point, but the point was raised on the Second Stage that under the system designed for the protection of a certain branch of the textile industry, a practice exists <Col N="1212" /> whereunder a domestic distributor or manufacturer of readymade goods is allowed to import free of duty so many yards of cotton textiles in certain categories, provided he purchases from a domestic manufacturer, not an identical, but a corresponding quantity of cotton textiles.  In regard to some categories he may bring in five yards, if he purchases two at home.  In regard to others, he may bring in perhaps three yards, if he purchases one.</P>
      <P>The point was put to the Minister that it had been suggested to us that under that arrangement, quite apart from any conditions imposed by him in the licences issued by him or by the Revenue Commissioners in licences issued by them, the domestic producer, when approached for the two yards or the three yards the importer was required to purchase from him in order to get his duty-free licence, imposed a condition himself that the purchase of the domestic cotton cloth must be made through one named agent.</P>
      <P>The Minister, commenting on that, said certainly there was no such condition in any licences issued by him and it was then explained very clearly that there was no question of that, that the question was: were individual manufacturers imposing conditions of that character and, if so, should the Minister not take steps in his licence to ensure that no such conditions were imposed and that a person who is obliged to purchase cotton textiles from a domestic manufacturer shall be free to purchase them through any agent, if he is required to employ agents at all, or, better still, that he shall be entitled to purchase them from the factory direct, always provided, of course, that he tendered cash or that he was in a position to produce a satisfactory credit record.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister has had an opportunity of looking into that matter and, if so, perhaps he could reassure us that unauthorised restrictive covenants of that kind are not being employed under the protection of licences issued by him.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot give the Deputy any information further than I gave the last <Col N="1213" /> day.  He may remember that I asked Deputy Sweetman on that occasion to give me particulars.  Deputy Sweetman did mention to me verbally the name of the firm and I caused inquiries to be made at once.  I have not yet got the result of those inquiries but as soon as I have them, I shall communicate with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree in principle that such conditions would not be proper conditions to lay down under the restrictions created by a licence issued by him? Clearly, the whole tendency of Oireachtas Éireann is to avoid monopolies and, therefore, if a licence issued by the Minister were being used by a domestic manufacturer for the purpose of promoting a monopoly of that character, I take it the Minister would direct that steps be taken to prevent it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To an extent, that is a hypothetical question because the cotton cloth to which the Deputy refers is not made by one firm only. There is an alternative source of supply.  However, the question of the operation of a restrictive practice, of which the Deputy complained, if I could divorce it from the issue of licences to import a certain yardage of cloth is a matter rather for a Fair Trade Commission inquiry.  I am not commenting in principle at this stage until I get more information concerning the practice of which complaint is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, if he wanted to, could quite easily have found out since last week what the circumstances were in relation to this firm.  It could have been done quite easily.  Telephonic communication is reasonably speedy, and the Minister is guilty of a breach of faith in coming to the House and putting down this Bill for discussion on Committee Stage to-day without having the information. On the Second Reading the Minister asked for the name of the firm.  He got the name from me there and then in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a clear implication that the Minister would not ask for the Committee Stage of the Bill until he had armed himself with the proof as to whether or not the statement I made was accurate.  I have since inquired and I am satisfied beyond question that it is accurate, that in fact, because of the way the licences work, no one can import any of these articles for which proof of home sales is required without going to the single agent of the factory concerned, that single agent being in this city in Wicklow Street.</P>
      <P>I satisfied myself beyond question on that point and the Minister should not make an Order under the powers contained in the parent Act unless he makes it a condition that the manufacturing concern for whose benefit the Order is being made gives him an undertaking that there will be no monopoly, gives him an undertaking that one person will not be the sole channel through which people can get imports of other similar materials.</P>
      <P>In certain respects this manufacturing company is the sole Irish producer of certain material which cannot be imported under the Minister's Order without the sales note being produced first of all to show that the Irish product has been bought in a certain percentage. That sales note cannot be got without a person who wants to buy the Irish cloth going through a particular agent in Wicklow Street.  Surely that is contrary to everything for which all Parties in this House should stand.  If the Government makes an Order the effect of which is that they hand over as a Government to someone else the power to decide what shall or shall not be imported, that they hand over to someone outside the decision as to the amount of any commodity to be imported, surely the Government have a responsibility to see that, in those circumstances, the people to whom the power is being handed over are not in a monopolistic position and are therefore not able to squeeze prospective customers and are not in a position to ensure that they, rather than the Government, can dictate terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue is clear.  The issue is: if there is to be a monopoly, should it be <Col N="1215" /> the State that runs that monopoly or should it be some private individual? I am amazed that the Minister, in the interval from last week, did not take adequate steps to satisfy himself of the position.  I am amazed that the Minister comes back to ask the House to endorse a Bill that continues to confer a monopoly on a particular firm.  The circumstances in which that is done certainly reflect little credit on those concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister ever hears talk around the town.  I am sure his officials who are dealing with these people who apply for licences also must have some interest in the matter and, from that interest, probably hear talk around town.  The town is full of gossip about this transaction. Anybody in that trade that the Minister asks will tell him that it is becoming a matter of constant talk.  The question is being constantly asked: why is there this monopoly?</P>
    <P>Those are circumstances which should have been probed by the Minister before he came to this Committee Stage.  It is obvious that on the remaining stages of the Bill there will not be the same full opportunity available to the House to make the examination that there would be on the Committee Stage.  I would have far preferred that the Minister or the House would not have to rely on my assertion that these are the facts.  I know that when the Minister investigates them officially he will find that I am right.  It would have been far better that he had the facts of his own knowledge rather than that they should be told to him by anybody else in this House, that he knew them officially and that he had decided officially what action he would take in regard to them before he brought the Bill here on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>If I decide that the firm against which he made the complaint is entitled to appoint only one selling agent, I have a right to ask the House, under those circumstances, to make the Order.  If, because Deputy Sweetman does not agree with the manner in which the company sells its output, he objects to the granting of certain protection, it is a matter of his own opinion.  I am quite entitled to disagree with Deputy Sweetman on that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister agreed with Deputy Sweetman and was rather shocked by the disclosure when the Deputy mentioned it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of what he disclosed, yes, but I am entitled to adopt a different point of view. I am entitled to take a different line. Since the Deputy rose, a note has been handed to me in which there is an indication that what the Deputy has said is correct but not completely correct.  There are three manufacturers of certain cotton fabrics.  I do not think I should identify the fabrics in case I might identify the firms, at any rate, until I have a full opportunity of studying this document.  Duty-free licences are recommended for the importation of these fabrics on a certain basis, as Deputy Dillon said.  Orders for the fabrics produced by one of the firms are placed with the company's selling agency, which is in Wicklow Street, as the Deputy stated, but the confirmations of orders on which licences are based are furnished to his importer by the manufacturers themselves on their own printed forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the other two firms, orders for the printed fabrics are placed directly with the manufacturers. In one case, the manufacturer places the orders through one firm, as it were, and in the other case, the manufacturers receive the orders in their own factories.  But there are two <Col N="1217" /> types of fabrics concerned.  In the one case only the firm which sells its output through an agent makes the one type and in the case of the other type of fabric, all three make it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is one type which the agent-firm alone makes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  I have just said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If you want to import that fabric, you must go to that agent.  You cannot go to one of the other firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the position. Nevertheless, the confirmation of an order does not necessarily mean that it is confirmed for all time.  At any time, the Government may amend, vary or completely rescind an Order.</P>
      <P>If, as a result of further inquiries by me, I decide that the practice in which this firm engages is a wrong one, undesirable in the interests of the public, I should have no hesitation in taking action to ensure that such a practice would not be persisted with, but at the moment, I suggest to the House that it is possible that the firm is justified in selling its output through a particular agent.  I am not certain that there is any serious damage done to the purchasing public because the article has to be bought through one agent.  If the firm itself decided not to have a distributing agent, the people entitled to purchase that fabric would go direct to the firm and therefore would have no choice.  I do not see that there is any great abuse <i>prima facie</i> in what Deputy Sweetman complains of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I had no knowledge whatever of this practice until he mentioned it here.  I do not move around Dublin and hear gossip among business people; I do not know very many of them, perhaps, but I have made inquiries through my officials and I am told that no complaint has been made in the Department about this practice, so that the Deputy may believe me when I say that his statement in the House last week was the first I or my officials heard about it.  If the practice <Col N="1218" /> is wrong, and if I so decide, it can easily be remedied irrespective of the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be&mdash;perhaps deliberately&mdash;avoiding the point at issue, which is that the Government and only the Government have the right to determine what shall be imported and what shall not. If the Government hand over that right to an individual agent, that is giving an agent a monopoly which should be retained by the Government.  The Government have the responsibility to ensure that when they make an Order in this case that goods cannot be brought in except under licence, they should attach to that licence a condition that a monopoly shall not be placed in any other hands.</P>
      <P>There are two classes of fabric involved. In respect of one, there is a choice: in respect of the other, there is no choice.  I think the Minister confirmed that, and I accept that he had only a moment to read the note after standing up, but the Minister will find that is the case.  It applies not only to this firm.  This was the only firm of which I had knowledge when I stood up last week.  Since then, it has been suggested to me that this is not a practice adopted solely by one firm and that in other cases where the Minister for Industry and Commerce has handed over control in this way, handed over a monopoly, there may be a similar practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, I do not know enough about the other cases to mention them categorically, but as a result of the discussion last week it was suggested to me that there are other similar cases and I ask the Minister to examine the whole problem, to consider the people who are concerned and to see whether what has happened is that advantage is being taken of the method of issuing licences for imports by having so many articles imported set against the production of so many articles at home.  If he does that, I think he will find that there is almost a trade growing up&mdash;so to speak&mdash;in relation to some of these import licences and that in certain cases, purchasing orders are being given and import licences <Col N="1219" /> obtained on foot of them when perhaps the order is not completed afterwards in the clear light of day as had been represented to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The whole question involved here is a very simple net issue: will the Government have the monopoly of deciding what is to be imported or are the Government going to hand over, in respect of any commodity, that monopoly to a private individual?  I think that if the Minister makes inquiries, he will find there are other cases and that these Orders should not really be confirmed until the proper course has been taken.  The proper course is to refuse to make a control Order until he has an undertaking that there will be full and adequate steps taken in each case to prevent a monopoly, whether in the case of the particular concern I have mentioned, or in any other case I have mentioned in private to the Minister, or in any other case at all.  That can be done quite simply and the Minister should not come in here asking for confirmation of the Order until he has made it clear that he proposes to avoid such monopoly as exists in this case, or may exist in any other case, where such monopoly is discreditable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seemed to resent the suggestion that he was open to legitimate rebuke for not being informed of this practice.  I respectfully submit that he is.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce has an obligation to keep himself informed, at least to the extent of being sure that what is common gossip to-day will be known to him to-morrow should he be required to act in an official capacity in that context.  I do not think that, if the Minister approached anybody trading in these textiles, with special reference to the textile in relation to which there is only one producer, he would not have got the information that has been thrust upon us.  I think, too, that if he got that information and if he found that this particular monopolist was requiring all orders to be channelled through one agent in respect of the textile of which he is the unique producer and, in respect of the other two textiles <Col N="1220" /> in which there are three producers, one of whom was channelling all his trade through one agent, he ought to take the appropriate steps.  If I were Minister for Industry and Commerce and I discovered this practice was going on under an Order made by me I would ask that an inquiry should be made as to what was at the back of this practice. If I were told: &ldquo;We have received no complaints in the Department&rdquo; I would be inclined to ask &ldquo;Why?  Is it not odd?  Would it not want to be looked into?  Why is there this peculiar difference in practice?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now that this practice has been brought into the light of day, may I, having some experience of these matters myself, urge upon the Minister that all monopolies are evil? But, where you choose to employ a system of protection, such as is enshrined in many of the Orders under this Bill, monopoly up to a point is inevitable because we have here a case in which only one firm is producing a particular cloth and the purchase of some of that cloth is a prerequisite to getting a permit to import other similar cloth without paying a prohibitive duty.  It becomes quite intolerable if, on top of that monopolistic position, there is imposed on the manufacturer in Ireland a further monopoly, which says: &ldquo;Not only must you provide me with a legitimate profit on the cloth I am producing but you must also provide me with a margin wherewith to provide an exclusive agent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think a stronger case than <i>prima facie</i> has been made that an abuse exists here and I would hope the Minister would feel free at some stage of this Bill to say that a practice of this kind does not commend itself to him, that it should be put an end to in this case, that, if any other such arrangements exist, they should be terminated, and that anyone seeking facilities of the kind afforded by this Imposition of Duty Order in future shall be fixed with notice that the imposition of one monopoly upon another, as is here practised, will be tolerated no longer.</P>

      <P>I do not want to prolong the discussion, but I should <Col N="1221" /> like to say that since I became Minister for Industry and Commerce, I have marvelled at the extent of consultation there is between the officials of the Department and those engaged in trade, particularly those engaged in the textile industry.  No week passes but there is consultation of some sort on some aspect of the textile trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Invariably, in any difficulty that arises either from the manufacturers' or their customers' point of view, both sides are usually well represented by organisations and they usually make representations to the Department and are heard almost at once, or certainly as soon as consultation can be arranged.  Not only are they heard but it is usually arranged also that both sides, if there is a dispute, are brought together and they are asked to thrash out their problems before a Chairman, who is usually a high official of the Department, and probably one or two other officials.  This Order is one of the first of these Orders in respect of which I am now seeking confirmation under this Bill, so it has been in force for several months.</P>

I am accepting entirely &mdash;it has been confirmed by my own inquiries&mdash;that the complaint made by Deputy Sweetman last week was true, but it is nothing short of amazing to me that the people who complained to Deputy Sweetman did not come and complain to me when I was the person who could have done something about it.</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to listen to any complaints.  I am still further amazed that knowledge of similar complaints has come to both Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon and not a scintilla of complaint has been available to the Department. Everyone engaged in the textile trade knows he can approach the Department at any time if he has a complaint. It is a practice of the Department to bring the opposing sides into conference, if that can be arranged. That can be arranged in this case and I suggest now that those who have complained to Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman should bring their complaints to the Department and, within seven days, I shall arrange a conference presided over by a senior officer of my Department and attended by those who make the complaints and those against whom the complaints are made.  If, as a result of that investigation, I find that the complaints are well-founded and there is reason for action on my part, I shall not hesitate to take action.  If the complaints are made to my Department to-morrow I shall do all in my power to ensure that, by to-morrow week, a conference will have been held and, if necessary, appropriate action taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>By all means, but in the Department, the details of the complaints would be understood by men who are used to handling such problems.  They could bring the two parties together and find the truth and the extent to which anything wrong has been done by one of the parties.  I would then be in a position to assess the merits of the case and to take appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand what the Minister means.  The fact is that the Minister admits these goods have to be channelled through one agent.  That agent will not be expected to work for nothing and, therefore, that agent must be paid.  That means the person who has to import the goods has to pay a margin to meet that cost. If the Minister accepts that is a cause of complaint, I shall produce evidence to the Minister and he will make arrangements accordingly.  The people who have to pay the extra commission will have to be recouped.  If the Minister will follow up his undertaking to have the complaints investigated with an assurance that he will take steps to see that refunds and repayments are made, I shall willingly take advantage of that offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a principle involved here in respect of which I must make a reservation.  I understand from the Minister that he has described the day-to-day practice appropriate for persons engaged in trade and industry who want the fullest information from his Department and that he has expressed his ready willingness to provide it to anyone who comes to look for it, but I do not think that is appropriate for members of this House.  Our duty is not to bring our <Col N="1224" /> complaints to the Department.  Our duty is to bring our complaints to Dáil Éireann and our duty, as I conceive it, is that if we have a matter to raise in Dáil Éireann, we should raise it in such form as to facilitate the Minister in preparing himself to meet it with the fullest information when he has the position assembled.  There is no use in setting traps for the Minister's foot and asking him to answer about details off the cuff.  That may sound easy but we all know it is quite impossible.</P>
      <P>In this case, we took the precaution, on Second Stage, of ventilating the situation and then, at the Minister's request, after the debate, Deputy Sweetman took the occassion to give the Minister verbally the names of the firms involved.  I think the Minister thereupon has responsibility to the House to come here on Committee Stage, fully informed.</P>
      <P>The principle here involved is: is it legitimate for a monopolist producer, whose monopoly has been created by Order of the Minister, to use his position under the Minister's Order to superimpose on his own monopoly yet another monopoly and say to the public in general: &ldquo;Although you must buy my goods, if you are to remain in the trade at all, I insist that you buy them through one particular agent.&rdquo; I believe that is a malpractice and I speak with 30 years' experience of the trade.  That is a malpractice which is being operated under the protection of the Minister's Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is extremely&mdash; I shall not use the word ingenuous&mdash; unfamiliar with the ordinary ways of trade if in the face of these facts of which he now has knowledge, he says to himself: &ldquo;No complaint is ever made&rdquo; and does not ask himself the question: why?  I ask the Minister now to cause a strict inquiry to be made into the position&mdash;I thought he would have done so between last week and to-day&mdash;and then give the directions which I imagine he will feel it his duty to give.  I think he should ask how it was that he was not given this information in time to meet the case he might legitimately be called upon to meet in Dáil Éireann.  The Minister <Col N="1225" /> ought to have that information, and when he has it, I think he will not doubt that he has a duty to act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prolonging the debate every time I reply.  I do not suggest that Deputy Dillon is at all wrong in that principle.  He is quite right, if he hears a complaint of any sort, to ventilate it here if he considers it to be his duty.  There is also another principle involved, the principle of trading practice.  If a firm manufactures a commodity, it is entitled to sell it directly to the consumer, or through an agent.  If it sells it through an agent, it is reasonable to assume that he the agent will get some profit out of his participation in the exercise.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if the manufacturer decides not to sell through an agent, but to set up his own selling organisation, is it not reasonable to assume also that that fact will add a certain amount to the price of the commodity &mdash;the fact that the manufacturer himself has to have a selling organisation within his own set-up?  The suggestion that the fact that there is a selling agent other then the manufacturer himself increases the cost of a commodity would not, I think, hold water. If that selling agent were not there, it is only reasonable to assume that the manufacturer would have to have some selling organisation within his own industry which would cost some money.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason that I have stated that to the extent to which consumers of the fabric are obliged to buy through one agent, there is a <i>prima facie</i> case.  On the other hand, I do not think anyone can deny the soundness of what I have said, that the manufacturer is entitled to have his own agent and, if not, to set up his own organisation to sell the goods.  I can add nothing except to say that I invite those who have complaints in this respect to come to the Department with them and to give me the fullest details, and I shall have the conference held to which I have already referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the conference to be about?  There is no use in having a conference about what is <Col N="1226" /> a fact.  It is a fact that one concern&mdash; there may be more but there is at least one of which I have positive knowledge&mdash;has taken advantage of the Minister's Order to direct that business must be channelled through someone else.  I do not want to say more than I have to, but I have a duty to say certain things in this House.  It is perfectly obvious&mdash;and I do not believe the Minister is so naive as not to realise it, if he thinks about it for ten minutes&mdash;why no one will raise any complaint, and why we have had no complaint in this instance.  No one would dare to do so because he would be afraid of being penalised afterwards.</P>

      <P>But hardly against the Minister's advice.  An Order is not brought to the Government to be made except at the instance of the Minister.  The fact is that the remuneration of an ordinary selling agent or the remuneration of a selling department of the manufacturing organisation is the remuneration proper for pushing a line.  The remuneration is based on the fact that it is <Col N="1227" /> necessary to push the line to get sales for it.  In this case, the Government are ensuring that there must be sales. It is not a question whether factory A employs a manufacturer's agent to sell its goods or whether it sets up its own selling organisation to sell its goods in the ordinary way.  In this case, the goods have to be bought. The Minister, by his Order, has determined that the goods have to be bought.  Therefore, there would not be any necessity for a selling agent at the factory concerned.  It would be an invoicing matter just at it would be invoiced in the ordinary way by the agent concerned.</P>
      <P>If the Minister sits back and thinks about the details of the concern that is involved, if he makes some inquiries from friends of his in the trade&mdash;I am sure he has some friends in the trade&mdash;I believe he will be as shocked as I was to learn the whole story.</P>

      <P>The House is aware that this matter has been discussed on a few occasions here.  This is the only opportunity for the House to deal with the Order which has given rise to criticism.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said a few moments ago that he was rather surprised at the amount of consultation that went on&mdash;I gather, <i>die in diem</i>&mdash;in his Department.  He rather gave the impression that the Department of Industry and Commerce was unique in the fact that, in relation to any administrative or other action, consultation of a detailed kind took place in relation to interests affected.  That, indeed, if it were so, would be a happy state of affairs.  I could understand any Minister, feeling that to be the situation, to be pleased, if not complacent, about it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> We have here, in relation to the Order affected by this amendment, an example I fear of little or no previous consultation with affected interests&mdash; an example of the Minister, of the Government, or of somebody in the Department acting on a story&mdash;attractive, I have no doubt&mdash;put up on behalf of a particular point of view.  This Order imposes a tariff on necessary medicines and life-saving medicinal preparations for the treatment of sick people.  I have little doubt that when this Order was made last September, a case was put forward&mdash;<i>bona fide,</i> I am certain&mdash;that if such a tariff were imposed, industries here would be capable of manufacturing or completing the manufacture of drugs, tablets and medicinal preparations similar in quality to those being imported.</P>
    <P>That is very attractive.  I do not for one moment believe that if such a case were put forward it was not believed in and probably that such a case could in fact be proven and established. However, that is not the whole story and it shows that, in relation to a matter of this kind, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Health&mdash;if they were consulted, as I suppose they were&mdash; failed to consider properly the effect of such a tariff because the affected people are not the few engaged in working the machine that makes the pill but the general unthinking mass of the people&mdash;those who get sick, those who are sick and those who need medicines or drugs in one form or another.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any consideration was given to what their point of view might be.  I want to suggest a few things that should have been considered. What is involved in this tariff is quite a major decision.  Though it may not be recognised as such at the moment, in effect, it is a decision to start in this country a pharmaceutical industry.  We had a bit of it before. The beginnings of it have been there. This is a decision by the Government to support the creation of a pharmaceutical industry.  I wonder if that has fully been considered?</P>
    <P>I do not think it could be suggested that there is a very large employment <Col N="1229" /> content involved, nor do I think that enters into it very much.  I can understand a case being made in favour of such an industry in this country&mdash; there may be arguments against it but certainly there are arguments for it. One preliminary step which should have been taken and which has not been taken in relation to these matters, since they concern medicines and drugs, is the establishment of an independent bureau of standards.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister's speech on Second Reading.  I know it to be true that one of the industries concerned in this matter have their own scientific research and their own ways of ensuring that standards are observed.  That is not sufficient.  The bureau of standards should be entirely independent of the industry.  In other countries&mdash; in Britain, particularly, and in Continental countries&mdash;where the companies engaged in the manufacture of drugs and medicines are public charitable concerns&mdash;where there is no profit involved such as in the case of the Burroughs Wellcome Foundation&mdash;they have their own bureau and their own standards.  It is quite wrong, I suggest, when we are dealing with a commercial enterprise such as that with which we are dealing here, that we should be content in relation to a matter affecting the health of the people to abide by the standards observed by those engaged in the commercial enterprise itself.</P>
    <P>That preliminary step was not taken. I do not think it is too late to take it.  I think there is available here&mdash;and certainly there can be made available here&mdash;sufficient scientific knowledge and experience to establish such a bureau.  If such a bureau were established, its establishment would or should be supported by any firm or company engaged in the manufacture of these preparations here.  If it were established, it would assist the Minister if it is his policy to establish in this country a pharmaceutical industry of a <i>bona fide</i> and genuine character. Until such a bureau is established, I am going to ask the House to agree with me that we should not persist in the protection, under this tariff, of medicinal tablets and similar preparations. <Col N="1230" /> That is one consideration which I urge.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration which follows from the fact that there is not such a bureau of standards here.  That consideration was referred to in passing, I think, by Deputy Dr. Browne in the debate on the Second Reading. It is a fact that this tariff, as it works out in practice, has imposed a tax on sick people.  It has put up by from 50 per cent. to 75 per cent. the drugs and medicines commonly used and generally used in this country by people who are sick and require treatment.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say that could not be, that those engaged in the industry here have given an undertaking that the home manufactured pills and drugs will not cost any more than the imported article.  I know that undertaking was given.  I know it was honoured.  Secondly, the Minister may say that if anyone wants to import a Burroughs Wellcome preparation or any other preparation a licence is freely available.</P>
    <P>That is quite a good case on paper but I suggest that it does not hold water for one moment for this reason, that the majority&mdash;I should say the great majority&mdash;of general practitioners, when they are writing out a prescription which is to be filled by a chemist, give a prescription for a well-known proprietary drug, pill or medicine, generally a Burroughs Wellcome product.  The chemist may know that it is something manufactured here by an Irish firm which he has every reason to believe is the same and is as good but the chemist cannot interfere with the prescription and must fill it.</P>
    <P>If it is a medicine or drug which is commonly prescribed, it is possible, I have no doubt, for the licensing provisions to operate but, generally, that does not happen.  Generally, what happens is that the particular drug or medicine prescribed is needed straight away and it is sold by the chemist from his stock.  It is sold by him or maybe sold by him in relation to stock upon which he had to pay duty.</P>
    <P>I hope I am putting this as reasonably <Col N="1231" /> as I can.  I think the initial mistake made in this whole business was that the necessary foresight was not exercised.  That may not be the fault of the Minister's Department.  It may have been the fault of the advice tendered or not tendered to his Department.  The initial mistake was that the ground was not prepared for the establishment or the support of a pharmaceutical industry in this country and, because that was not done, people do not know whether the Irish equivalent is, in fact, an equivalent and as good.</P>
    <P>They are inclined to regard claims put forward by the commercial interests producing these as being, in fact, the kind of blurb that most people use who advertise their goods.  If there were available an independent scientific bureau that could assess the quality of any drug or medicine manufactured here and give it the O.K., then I think the Minister would find it far easier to get the co-operation and the assistance of the doctors in prescribing Irish drugs and medicines. Until that is done, in my view you are not going to have these Irish drugs supported as they should.  The result is that the impact of the tariff is, in fact, being felt by the general body of sick people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that I on behalf of my Party have tabled an amendment to delete the tariff from the Schedule in the hope that the necessary preparation may be made to deal with this matter in the way I described.  We are not against the tariff.  I can see there is a great deal to be said in favour of supporting and establishing a pharmaceutical industry here.  The only criticism I have endeavoured to express is the fact that this has not been handled in the way it should have been.</P>

      <P>When I was replying to the Second Reading of this Bill last week, I dealt with complaints made from the Fine Gael benches in regard to this particular duty and I reminded the Deputies that the procedure adopted in this case was exactly the same procedure adopted when Deputy <Col N="1232" /> O'Higgins was Minister for Health under the same circumstances.  About four years ago&mdash;five years ago now&mdash; there was imposed a duty on injection solutions.  The Department of Health was then consulted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in advance of this Order being made.  They indicated to the Department that the home-manufactured commodity was as good in all respects as the imported one and the tariff was imposed by Deputy O'Higgins's colleague, Deputy Norton, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It did not apparently occur then to Deputy O'Higgins that this bureau of standards might have been set up at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite a different thing.  Liver extract is a purely nutritional preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, in the course of my reply last week I did refer to the fact that there is in existence, as Deputy O'Higgins knows, the British Pharmaceutical Codex and the British Pharmacopoeia and the standard formulae for the preparation of tablets are laid down in these two publications.  It is an offence in this country to sell drugs or tablets contained in the Pharmacopoeia or the Pharmaceutical Codex, unless they correspond to these standard formulae.  The Department of Health have advised the Department of Industry and Commerce that the quality and standard of the tablets produced by the Irish manufacturers are as high and as good as those imported from other countries.  As well as that, the cost of the tablets ex-factory compared favourably with them.  I do not know if in any case they exceeded the ex-factory cost of similar tablets produced in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was evidence that tablets imported from abroad&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;abroad&rdquo; in the wide sense &mdash; were being sold at a lower price than in the home countries.  That is one of the reasons the duty was imposed in this case.  There were a number of complaints when the duty was first imposed but there were no complaints, I repeat, from the medical profession&mdash;certainly not to my Department at any stage. There were similar complaints at the <Col N="1233" /> time of the imposition of the duty on the injection solutions both, on that occasion, from medical sources and from pharmaceutical sources.  In any event it happened that the fears expressed by them proved to be unfounded and there have been no complaints since then with regard to the duty imposed on injection solutions. At the time of the imposition of the duty on medicinal tablets it was clearly stated that duty free licences would be issued freely for the importation of tablets which were not manufactured here and I think that Deputy O'Higgins agrees that that undertaking has been honoured.</P>
    <P>As well as that, in the event of a preference being expressed for a particular type of tablet, or a particular proprietary brand produced outside Ireland, provision was made that a person who, for one reason or another, insisted on getting that particular tablet got it without paying any duty because lots of up to 100 units are not subject to duty.  As I stated last week if a person expresses a preference for a French, British or German tablet, and if a similar tablet is produced here, he is not obliged to buy the Irish tablet nor is he obliged to pay any more for the imported tablet.  So long as he imports the tablets in lots of up to 100, they are duty free.</P>
    <P>I am further advised that the standards of manufacture in Ireland are of the very highest and that there have not been any complaints latterly about the quality, the price or the availability of Irish tablets, or any complaints about inability to get alternatives if these are required. Under all these circumstances I do not think that the objections to the confirmation of this Order can stand.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that it would be a good thing to establish a bureau of standards here, but I do not agree with him that it is a necessary prerequisite to the manufacture of tablets in this country.  I do not know to what extent the Department of Health have had regard to the possibility of establishing a bureau, but I know it is a matter that has been adverted to by them.  Nevertheless, the Department of Health, as I said <Col N="1234" /> last week, has qualified medical practitioners and pharmacists and they carry out periodic inspections of the places in which these tablets are manufactured in Ireland.  I am told that on all occasions the inspections have disclosed a highly satisfactory position as regards standards of hygiene and quality of output. Therefore, I repeat, I can see no reason why the House should refuse to confirm this Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan;</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, when he refers to the availability of duty free licences for consignments of lots up to 100 units in number, to what class of persons are those licences available? I should like to know is it a fact that the ordinary person is at liberty to apply for such a licence and obtain it?  If that is the case, it must be a matter of great concern.  It would mean that people ordinarily limited by doctors to a certain amount of these drugs, or medicines, could, under licence, obtain a supply limited only by this requirement of 100 units. It might be highly dangerous to an ordinary person to allow him to have recourse to that quantity of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the Deputy's statement is not quite right?  No licences are required to import quantities up to 100.  Duty free licences are given for tablets not manufactured here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state whether that advice was actually given to a person who applied to the Department for a permit, a person who objected to paying the price plus the duty and that this person, an ordinary consumer, was actually provided with a licence to import? Would there not be danger in granting such licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister is completely correct in saying he is safe in standing over his statement that he has had no complaints from the medical profession.  Is it a fact that the profession actually take coverage in any duty they may have by naming the firm whose preparation they want dispensed and that different circumstances <Col N="1235" /> apply inasmuch as the chemist is obliged to give to the customer exactly what is named by the doctor in the prescription?  He has absolutely no choice in the matter and is obliged to supply what is prescribed.  That is the established practice with doctors and consequently that perhaps would explain the fact that the Minister is not in receipt of complaints.  If that is so, it just means a considerable imposition on many people who are faced with heavy expenses in relation to the purchase of medicines throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Higgins said, the position is not quite the same now as it was.  In relation to this establishment of an Irish pharmaceutical industry, I probably took the first steps myself in that I allowed the imposition of a tariff on Virol or something like that in order to allow a small industry in the midlands to be established. There is no comparison between a substance containing cod liver oil or malt and the substances we are dealing with.  It is quite clear that this baby industry is likely to become a very much more powerful and substantial one and everybody wishes its well.</P>
      <P>The Minister must not adopt the attitude that those of us who question it do so because we are anxious to see the continued importation of British, American, French or German drugs. I think we are able to make any substance or to carry on any craft, skill or profession as well as the people of any nation in the world.  We have proved that; and I believe we could prove it in the case of a pharmaceutical industry, too.  All I want to see is that the industry is given every possible chance of surviving in this its critical stage when it branches out into rather more important medicines, drugs and tablets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason that I think the suggestion of Deputy O'Higgins, and the suggestion of a number of responsible people, that a bureau of standards be established is a perfectly reasonable one.  This suggestion is based on the <Col N="1236" /> assumption that the Irish pharmaceutical industry will extend, expand and grow.  It is not a suggestion that has in mind the idea that it will collapse; on the contrary, it is an idea based on the assumption that the industry will expand.  For that reason, we want to see the highest standards set and maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to misunderstand the position a little in relation to the position of the medical profession. I do not think the average doctor gives a damn whether the drugs he prescribes are made in Hong Kong, Honolulu, Thurles or anywhere else.  He is primarily concerned with whether they secure the end he has in mind, that is, the curing of the particular illness from which the patient is suffering.  I do not think the Minister will be inundated with protests from the medical profession. On the contrary, I think the medical profession would much prefer that no great row was made about this whole question because they do not particularly want a change.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made a point in regard to drugs that are habitually used, that, on the one hand, a doctor has a belief in veganin, aspirin, some proprietary medical preparation, simple or complicated, which happens to work.  He is conservative.  He knows it is likely to work and that it has been tested and tried.  He is likely to cling to that particular drug.  On the other hand, the patient is also concerned in these things.  It is quite an act on the part of a doctor to break a patient off a habit or a belief he happens to have in a particular drug. The doctor will not bother breaking that without some incentive.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister is to get the medical profession into his Department and ask them for their co-operation, I still think he will have a very hard job getting them to collaborate. There is a certain conservatism and a certain primitive belief &mdash; not really primitive, but a justified belief&mdash;that particular drugs will work and others will not.  Why change horses when you are quite happy about getting the patient well?  The Minister's job is a particularly difficult one, even taking <Col N="1237" /> the advice put forward to him with the best will in the world.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister should take it that because the medical profession has not protested, everything is quite all right.  It is not the doctor who pays for these drugs&mdash;he merely recommends them&mdash;it is the patient who pays for them.  If the patient is given a prescription and goes to the chemist and finds that the price of the imported drug has increased by 10 per cent., 20 per cent. or whatever it is, the doctor is not really concerned because he has his fee.  He merely says that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is trying to establish a new Irish industry and everything is more costly than it used to be.  Generally speaking, the Department and the Government get the blame, but the main point is that it is the patient who pays and the cost of medicine is increased in that way.  I think it is unnecessarily increased because there must be some way in which it could be established to the satisfaction of the medical profession that we can make these drugs here just as satisfactorily and efficiently as they can be made anywhere else and that the Irish trade could become established as being satisfactory and completely reliable in the production of medicines, tablets or drugs.</P>
    <P>However, in present circumstances, I do not believe the Minister can give the medical profession any such guarantee.  It is no good quoting the British Pharmacopoeia at them.  Have the provisions and conditions as laid down in the British Pharmacopoeia been observed by the manufacturers? The manufacturers will say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. The person distributing the diluted milk will not tell you he put water into it.  For that reason, we have the food and drink regulations and health inspectors, some of whose functions are the periodic inspection and analysis of the different foods used for human consumption.  These are some of the very good provisions of the 1947 Act, provisions which basically should be implemented in this Bill also.</P>
    <P>There is no good in the Minister saying that officials have gone down to these factories, have looked at them <Col N="1238" /> and found that the premises are satisfactory and clean, and that the equipment is clean.  That is neither here nor there.  It is no use having first-class equipment and machinery and competent looking technicians turning out drugs which are not in fact made up to the formula laid down in the British Pharmacopoeia or which are in some way defective.  The only way in which you can ensure they are not defective and that they are according to the detailed formula of the British Pharmacopoeia is by analysis.  Going in and having a look at the factory and machinery is not a sufficient or satisfactory examination in this case.</P>
    <P>For that reason, there is a most compelling case for the Minister to establish some form of independent and objective bureau of standards which can be above all of us&mdash;the profession, the public and the manufacturers &mdash; and consequently make certain statements which simply cannot be questioned because they are of scientific origin and therefore of great value.</P>
    <P>If the Minister dismisses this whole idea of a bureau of standards, I do not think he can be serious in putting forward as a substitute that health inspectors and Department of Health officials should be satisfied with what they see. Why do other countries, on the Continent and elsewhere, not satisfy themselves with these devices if they are adequate for the protection of the public in relation to these various kinds of drugs?</P>
    <P>It is a particularly difficult thing to assess the quality of effectiveness of drugs.  If you have a drug which is defective in quality, the patient simply does not get better and it is important to try to keep control of the effectiveness of drugs.  There is no good in saying to the doctors: &ldquo;Keep your eyes on these things and, if they do not work, we shall know then that they are not up to the standards laid down by the British Pharmacopoeia.&rdquo;  There are scientific methods to control the sale of drugs and these methods could be used properly only in a bureau of standards to test such drugs as biomycin, and the effectiveness of drugs on animals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> I personally appear to have very much more faith in an Irish pharmaceutical industry than the Minister because I hope it will become a very big industry which will eventually be in a position to export its products rather than that we should have to depend as at present, on other countries.  Therefore, these steps should be taken so that we shall be able to offer to our own medical profession the evidence of analyses carried out by scientists, and be in a position to export to other countries that will probably be glad to trade with us, such as the Afro-Asian countries.  When we take such steps and develop exports, we can export the drugs with absolute confidence that they are what they say they are on the label.</P>
    <P>It is impossible, on the evidence put forward to us at the moment, to offer any such guarantee to the medical profession in our own country or, indeed, to that in any other country and, as a medical person, I could not consider switching with any serious drug. I am not talking about aspirins or anything like that, but it would be quite wrong, without the absolute certainty of a standard established by an independent authority on drugs, to switch in the treatment given by one drug now and possibly risk the life of an individual.</P>
    <P>For that reason, the Minister should give serious consideration to the suggestion of establishing a bureau in relation to the distribution of drugs. I would also like to ask what is the position in regard to the Department of Health as regards the authority it exercises over the use of drugs in local authority hospitals and institutions of all kinds, through the Combined Purchasing Section of the Department of Local Government.  Is there to be a re-consideration of the permitted drugs for use in these institutions?  Is that list of drugs to be pruned and are imported drugs to be excluded and substituted by home-manufactured drugs and medicines?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help intervening with a certain amount of interest, from the point of view of <Col N="1240" /> control.  The trouble about this debate is that the other side gives it the appearance of being a matter of the Opposition versus the Government. We should look at a matter of this sort as objectively as possible and that is what I shall try to do now if I can, though I may appear for a moment to have gone very much in the direction of Deputy O'Higgins.  The net question is the quality of the drugs concerned and I think we can take the premise Deputy Dr. Browne has given us, that we all want to see an Irish pharmaceutical industry develop here.  In fact, in modern times, developments in such directions are quite natural and if we do not develop such industries, we shall be stunted.</P>
      <P>We can also accept the premise that we should, without much difficulty, be able to manufacture the drugs, in so far as the chemical substances required are concerned.  A pharmaceutical chemist mentioned to me that in regard to variants of certain types of drugs, there is a bewildering multiplicity, without any real difference in certain categories, but then there are other types of drugs in the modern pharmaceutical set-up&mdash;if I may put it that way&mdash;which are very different, delicate and very specific, and which perhaps require a very large organisation to produce them in quantity to a uniform standard.  That may be the administrative problem that we have to face here but let me try to put it more specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Dr. Browne would worry very much about variations of such common and chemically simple drugs as aspirin. Even though there are variants of that, with a little codeine in them, it is a very simple chemical substance, capable of simple preparation and capable of simple standardisation.  I speak subject to the correction of my pharmaceutical colleagues here in this House, but when one comes to deal with drugs of the type of the antibiotics, for instance, there are grades and variants of these.  I may be putting my neck out in making this statement because I have no technical knowledge, but I rather suspect that these antibiotics are varied from time to time and that may be due to some <Col N="1241" /> variation in the resistance built up by the organism causing a disease.  I do not know if that is true or not, but I do seem to sense that certain antibiotics that are in use today are not quite the same things as they were a few years ago, and that a change in trend is taking place.</P>
    <P>In that case, there is obviously a major problem for a country like this starting such an industry, and there is obviously a case for control because we cannot afford to leave it to the doctors to see that drugs work.  Talking about standardisation, the net proposal I should like to make is that if the Pharmaceutical Society&mdash;which is obviously the professional body concerned to control these things&mdash;could be facilitated in establishing control, by consultation or otherwise, most of the difficulty inherent in this could be overcome.  In a sense, it is really a drafting difficulty.  Such chemically simple drugs as aspirin are easy enough to handle but one trouble is that in getting a Bill to capture them, you will probably go very far in capturing others as well, and I personally feel that there will always have to be elasticity in regard to the importation of drugs in certain categories, owing to the rate of change, and owing to the fact that it will be a long time before we shall have the chemical potential to supply them.</P>
    <P>Possibly the last and crucial point touched upon by Deputy Dr. Browne was this: who is to be at the disadvantage in this?  So long as the Minister does not absolutely prohibit the drugs being imported&mdash; and the Minister has been very careful to point out that anyone can get any particular drug which he wants, at a price&mdash;it will not be the person who can afford to pay for these drugs who may be in any danger.  It will be, in the first instance, the person who is strained for payment.  But I would be more concerned, just as Deputy Dr. Browne was concerned, about what is to happen in the big institution where the thing may be formalised somewhat, but it would be beyond me to analyse that problem any further than to make that suggestion for consideration, not by way of <Col N="1242" /> implication that there is anything wrong in this proposal.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the chemical or the category of drug should be more clearly defined.  That is going to be an expert job.  It will not be a job for an administrator in a Department.  In fact, properly speaking, it would not be a job for an administrative department at all. If the category of drug that can be made subject to this order can be defined, then there are clearly certain drugs that you could, without much complaint, let go into that.  In regard to all the rest, I could make no better suggestion than that if the Pharmaceutical Society&mdash;the society which is responsible for the professional control of the people whose business it is to know what drugs they are dispensing and to dispense them&mdash;in conjunction with the medical profession, were to be approached from the point of view of supplying the machinery to deal with the other problems, it would, perhaps, be the most feasible solution and, perhaps, would meet not only what the Minister is trying to do, and laudably trying to do, but also whatever substance there is in the objections which have come from Deputy O'Higgins's side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to keep this matter under discussion but it is of importance, and I want to suggest to the Minister, having heard the views which have been expressed by Deputies, that any person with a reasonable mind must be coerced to the conclusion that here is something which justifies the criticism that has been made here today. This is not a commodity similar to all the others dealt with in this list of tariffs.  This is a tariff affecting the medical treatment of sick people and people who, like the majority of us, are not doctors, as Deputy Dr. Browne is, who are ignorant of their own complaint, trust the person who treats them as a doctor and trust the pill he provides for them.  If that pill does not work, they die, and that is the end of that story.  If it is not effective, if it just does not do its <Col N="1243" /> work, that could be a serious thing. I do not suggest that the particular preparation would poison a person or cause or precipitate death, but it may not be effective in curing or alleviating the condition it is supposed to deal with.  If there is that possibility, it is a serious one.</P>
      <P>If we are to embark on the protection or expansion of a pharmaceutical industry here, there are very serious implications which we should all understand.  First of all, we may isolate ourselves from research that is taking place elsewhere throughout the world.  In relation to advances in science and in medical knowledge, there is a general charitable view that the benefit of such advances should be shared throughout the world.  If we do embark on an industry ourselves, we must be very sure that we realise what is involved in doing that and, above all, we should be certain, to the extent of its being established without question, that any preparation or any drug manufactured here and put on the market is clearly established as being the genuine article.</P>
      <P>The Minister believes it to be so now.  The industries engaged assert it to be so.  At least one of them has a well-equipped laboratory and testing service, and so on.  But that is an assertion made on behalf of a company engaged in a commercial enterprise and it is not the same thing. Until you have an independent scientific assessment of these things, the truth is you will not succeed in establishing a pharmaceutical industry because, in fact, you will not get doctors to prescribe or patients to seek these home-manufactured preparations.</P>
      <P>To use a tag with which the Minister is probably familiar, this is a case in which not only should justice be done but it should also appear to be done and not only should those engaged in the industries here produce drugs of a high quality but that should be established beyond question by an independent scientific body outside the industry itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a discussion here which has been an objective discussion, not centred in any one side of the House.  It does suggest, or should <Col N="1244" /> suggest, to the Minister that there is a well-based concern with regard to this matter, that the criticism that has been offered here is of a helpful kind and intended to be constructive and I would urge him to reconsider this whole matter along the lines suggested here.  If he does so, I think he will be putting this industry on the correct lines.  If he does not do so, I feel that all the tariffs in the world will achieve nothing because there will continue to be a demand for imported medicines and they will continue to be prescribed by doctors, and the Minister's Department will have to issue licences or, if the licences are not applied for, sick people will have to pay more for imported articles and what is intended will not be achieved.</P>

      <P>Following Deputy O'Higgins's suggestion, in regard to certain types of drugs, the purely chemical type of drug, could the Minister not use the State Laboratory?  I am reminded by something Deputy O'Higgins said that the Minister for Finance does not trust the manufacturers of spirit to keep to particular schedules and milks and waters and all these things are tested in the State Laboratory.  Up to a certain point, that organisation conceivably could be expanded to take in such a control. Deputy Dr. Browne could correct me on a technical point in this but I think that control would be limited to certain what might be called directly chemical substances.  Where you are dealing with some of the antibiotics and the biological preparations, you would probably want a separate control.  There again I can only suggest falling back on the Pharmaceutical Society with the medical profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>Great play is being made with the question of a bureau of standards.  In Britain, there is not a bureau of standards.  Each manufacturing industry has some analytical system of its own but I understand that there is no bureau of standards in Britain, notwithstanding the fact that they have a tremendous pharmaceutical manufacturing industry there.  In France the bureau of standards they have provides only a limited service for the people and too much play has been <Col N="1245" /> made on it.  As regards the question of meeting the Minister for Health with a view to setting up some bureau of standards here, I agree with Deputy de Valera that for ordinary drugs or chemicals used in medicines there is not much in it so far as this Order is concerned.  We can get the proper tablets containing the proper quantity and the proper quality as it is.  The difficulty arises mainly because of trade names.  Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned veganin which is called by many other names such as codalgin or codemprine.  Codeine compound tablets are what we actually call them and it would be a great ease to the people and very much cheaper for them if they could call the thing by its proper name as it is usually prescribed by the doctor.</P>
      <P>When this measure was first introduced we had all these questions out with the Minister, and it was brought home to us that in order that a pharmaceutical industry would be given a chance of prospering in Ireland it was necessary to do something to prevent the influx of a tremendous quantity of every drug under the sun. There are always eight or nine different names for a drug prescribed for a patient by the doctor.  One firm will call it one thing, another firm another thing.  The result is a chemist must get eight or nine different bottles of the same medicine to satisfy the fad in whatever area it is.  If this Bill even had the effect of limiting the variety of these names it would be a great saving.</P>
      <P>We understand that anything that is not manufactured here can be imported under licence without duty. I am sure the Minister understands that when we say &ldquo;anything that is not manufactured here&rdquo; we mean that anything that is not manufactured here of the highest quality can be imported. If an article of the highest quality is manufactured here I fail to see why the Minister should allow a whole variety of drugs to be imported.  As regards tablets called saxin which are really saccharine tablets, I see no reason why they should not be subject to duty because saccharine is saccharine no matter what you call it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is no bureau of <Col N="1246" /> standards in England so far as the pharmaceutical industry is concerned. Each manufacturing firm has its own system of evaluating standards, but where they have they have a limited use.  The standard set is usually what is contained in the article, not what effect the tablet or whatever it is will have on the patient.  If we could get a bureau of standards with that end in view it would be much better for us.  However, I believe that as the industry develops it will set up its own system of standardisation.  I have heard of this Bureau of Standards in connection with other industrial developments.  Notwithstanding the importance of medicines, I think it would apply to an even greater extent to matters outside medicine altogether. However, we have had this matter out with the Minister and we came to the conclusion that in the best interests of the industry and without doing any harm to the doctors or the patients, the Order is justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this from the standpoint of asking myself the question: is it desirable or is it undesirable to develop a pharmaceutical industry in this country?  I think it is and that some of the firms in the pharmaceutical industry here have achieved a high standard of excellence and a high standard of care in the preparation of their products, and their products would bear comparison with any of the commodities of a similar kind imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty, however, is that our manufacturers in this field are not able to afford the fantastic sums of money which are spent by our larger neighbours in advertising their products, with the result that because of the power of advertisements, the power of the Press to disseminate advertisements, it has been possible for the consuming public to get the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the well-advertised product is the one which will give the speediest measure of success in curing the patient.  In the secret of their own hearts I am quite certain the manufacturers of the product have to acknowledge that there is no mesmeric content in their tablet, that in fact any tablet compounded <Col N="1247" /> of the same ingredients and taken in the average case will give the same average results.  Of course when a firm is established and has a market it will naturally fight for that market.  I am afraid a good deal of the agitation around this question of protecting the pharmaceutical industry in certain fields as envisaged in this Bill has originated in a desire by exporters in other countries to try to hold on to a pharmaceutical market here which has been of considerable value to them.</P>
    <P>This Bill, from the standpoint of the protection which it affords to the Irish pharmaceutical industry, is a reasonable one.  It says that whatever you can manufacture here under standards acceptable to top level people in the medical field in the Department of Health will be protected against imports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it does not say it but I have a recollection of the file that says that this matter went through the Department of Health, was seen by the Department of Health people and is known to the Department of Health people.  I hardly imagine the medical people in the Department of Health are in a conspiracy to give the consuming public here an ersatz product instead of one with which the consuming public are familiar.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that where a commodity is not manufactured here a licence to import it free of duty will be given, or where there are people who imagine that only a particular class of tablet made by a particular firm in such-and-such a town or in a garden village in England will produce the result the patient wants, you may import 100 of those tablets, free of duty, every day, every week, every month, so long as you want to pay for them and so long as you believe the more of them you consume the better you will be.  It all rests with the people.  That is very largely the whole basis of a number of these medical prescriptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> If a bureau of standards is to be set up I think it should be applied in other directions.  If you look at the newspapers you will see an advertisement like this: &ldquo;Grandmother is now 90.  She has been ten years in bed, but she started to take such-and-such a syrup or such-and-such a tablet; now grandmother is up and walks five miles a day.&rdquo;  That is printed in our papers in 1960.  You will have another person advertising in this way; &ldquo;Such-and-such a person who had had no hair on his head for years, applied this solution to his head and after one week he started growing a luscious crop of black curly hair.&rdquo; That kind of stuff is printed day after day and week after week.  From about October to March, is the silly period for these advertisements.</P>
    <P>Other advertisements will provide a cure for colds so efficiently and effectively that the colds keep coming back at the same time every year. There has always been a market for hair restoratives, with the result that one only has to take up a provincial paper to read such advertisements on the mesmeric effects of applying a coloured lotion which produces a luxuriant crop of hair.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  All that kind of thing is an impost on credulous, simple humanity.  In the natural striving for beauty and good health, people believe in these preparations which could be more usefully deposited in the local river and should never have seen the light of day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not, of course, say some of the most valuable drugs at the service of stricken mankind are in that category, but I do say that many people are buying commodities which are supposed to be cures and, in fact, these things are deliberate frauds on the people.  I do not know whether Deputies have read the recent report on the drugs racket in America in which it was established there that some of the manufacturers of drugs bought ingredients for the drugs and after having liquefied or ground up the ingredients and converted them into <Col N="1249" /> liquid or tablets, the gross mark-up was in the vicinity of 5,000 per cent. on the original purchase price of the ingredients, all of course showing the extent of human faith in these commodities, that people will pay these prices for microscopic portions of commodities which are recommended to them as calculated to cure disabilities. However, that is aside from the main argument and I do not wish to digress further into that field.</P>
    <P>If we want to help an Irish pharmaceutical industry to develop this is one of the ways of doing it.  It ought not to be developed at the price of inflicting upon our people the ersatz product which is not satisfactory and which does not come up to international standards.  There has been no evidence that anybody proposes to do that.  The reputation of our firms and their contact with the medical and pharmaceutical world outside is an insurance against that.  In any case, if a patient believes that a particular brand is the kind necessary to cure him or to give him relief he may import 100 tablets as often as he likes. That provides a reasonable safeguard.</P>
    <P>No evidence has been produced to indicate that this is a dangerous step or that it has had, during the short period of its operation, any injurious effect on our people, and it ought not at this stage to be killed.  Instead we ought to allow it operate and have it reviewed if at any time there is any evidence that is is having an adverse effect on public health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the House should be led away by the lurid picture painted by Deputy Norton of the irrelevant hare&mdash;not hair&mdash;to which he referred.  It seems to me that this product is one which depends entirely on confidence for its success.  If there is not confidence in a medicinal preparation it does not matter how good it may be.  More than in the case of any other saleable product, the sale of what we are discussing here depends on the purchaser having complete confidence&mdash;more so, perhaps, on the customer than on the doctor having complete confidence in it.  It is a fact that at present there is <Col N="1250" /> not that confidence.  It is a fact that probably from what the Minister has said, there is no justification for that lack of confidence.  As long as the lack of confidence remains it is perfectly clear that the product cannot be successfully used.  The easiest way of restoring confidence is the way advocated by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
      <P>Deputy Loughman suggested that in England there was not such a bureau of standards.  There is something not quite the same as a bureau of standards but something that has effects on the standard of the product provided and that, no doubt, has been one of the causes why that product has been so well accepted.  Deputy Loughman is not here at present and I should not like to hurt him in his absence, but the Deputy said, speaking as a layman, that the case he was making for this Order was that it was too much trouble for chemists to keep in their establishments many wide ranges of different drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  That, as I understand it, was the case Deputy Loughman made on behalf of the chemists&mdash;I do not want to attribute it to him personally &mdash; that this was a good Order because the chemists were not going to be asked to keep a wide range of commodities.  Surely that is the worst possible argument that could be made for the Minister in relation to this Order and I am sure the Minister must have been saying: &ldquo;Heaven preserve me from my friends if that is the line they are going to take.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real fundamental point in this matter is that we all regard anything in relation to health as being of importance not so much from the point <Col N="1251" /> of view of whether the thing does us good but of whether we believe it does us good or not.  That is the fundamental difference between things related to health and other products.  I cannot understand, therefore, why the Minister will not accede to the request to do anything that will help to establish that confidence.  That is the case that was made by Deputy O'Higgins as I understand it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points I want to make in conclusion. Deputy Sweetman has referred to what Deputy Loughman said. Deputy Loughman made the case that there is no bureau in England.  I do not think that is precisely the case. I am not an expert on it; others may know more about it.  But there is the important factor that the Borroughs and Wellcome Foundation is not a commercial concern in the ordinary sense.  Under its Trust, its profits go back into research and so forth.  The fact that the British pharmaceutical industry is largely founded on Borroughs and Wellcome activity ensures both an acceptable and definite standard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton made an interesting speech here, though I hesitate to suggest that, like the &ldquo;flowers that bloom in the spring, tra-la,&rdquo; it has nothing to do with the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was based on the need for having a bureau of standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if Deputy Norton appreciates the case we make here.  We do not think&mdash;at least I do not think and neither do those Deputies who have spoken here and who share my view&mdash;that this tariff will assist the expansion of a pharmaceutical industry here.  We know that that is the intention behind the tariff, but we do not think that the tariff will assist in that direction until such time as there is a bureau of standards to vouch for and approve of the articles manufactured here.  Such a bureau would put us on the right track and keep us there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you not got <Col N="1252" /> the standard for most of the drugs, leaving out the experimental ones or the biological ones, in the Pharmacopoeia already?  Having the standards, is it not really then a question of analysis?  I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but I am afraid the use of the term &ldquo;bureau of standards&rdquo; may upset the entire case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The formula may be there in the British Pharmacopoeia. My concern is that there should be available here an independent scientific assessment to ensure that these standards are observed.  If that is done, this tariff will be a success.  If it is not done&mdash;I am sorry to have to say this&mdash;I do not believe any number of tariffs will succeed. Whether it is because of advertising, or some other reason, the fact remains that there is confidence in established medicines and preparations.  What is really essential here is that confidence should be created first because it all comes down to confidence in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Loughman mentioned saccharine tablets and the case of the individual who, having got a prescription for a particular saccharine tablet, had no choice because the chemist had to give the particular tablet on the prescription even though he knew there was a much cheaper preparation available.  Actually that sort of thing has created a very difficult position for chemists in general. They know the names of most of the home-manufactured drugs and, as time goes on, they would become familiar with a wider and wider range of such drugs.  They know those drugs are comparable to the imported article, but they are rigidly bound by the prescription. In fact, I understand they are liable to some form of legal or professional sanction if they recommend a preparation which they know is equally effective, but perhaps somewhat cheaper.  It seems to me to come back to the point that the Minister must get the medical profession on his side so that they will prescribe the cheaper article.  With the best will in the world, the chemist cannot alter the prescription, as Deputy Loughman pointed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> With regard to a bureau of standards, there is the saving factor in Britain that there is competition of one kind or another.  I do not think that is an altogether satisfactory alternative. Again, British industries are much wealthier and they can afford to have well-equipped laboratories for their own scientific assessment.  However, I do not think that this is a satisfactory substitution for a bureau of standards.  I do not think we should be bound by their practice in this regard.  Deputy Loughman has given us to understand that the pharmaceutical industry here will try to press on the Minister the necessity for having a bureau of standards.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy O'Higgins that Deputy Norton's contribution had nothing to do with the case.  Deputy Norton, quite correctly, gave us a list of completely bogus claims made, presumably, by Irish manufacturers of a certain type of medicinal preparations; they will grow hair; they will slim people; they will restore lost youth, and make a hundred and one other improvements.  Lucozade, which is simply a sugar and water preparation, is meant to have magical and costly ingredients designed to restore energy.  Most of these things have no real therapeutic value at all. But my point is that these bogus claims are made.  Deputy Norton appreciates that they are bogus claims &mdash;by Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>I do not think, therefore, that we can trust the manufacturer entirely to observe strictly the terms of the undertaking given by him on the label of a particular preparation.  We cannot be sure that it will effect a particular result in the patient.  It has been established by Deputy Norton that there are already people at the moment behaving after this fashion. There will be nothing to stop them continuing the practice in relation to rather more serious preparations.  For that reason, the points made by Deputy Norton were illustrative of the danger of not having an independent assessment of all preparations made by Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>He also made a point in relation to the patient who can afford anything <Col N="1254" /> up to 100 tablets.  In the ordinary case of the average patient the general prescription for a simple illness is three, four or a dozen tablets. It is very difficult to visualise a patient going to the trouble of seeking to import and asking for a special import licence for 50 or even 100 tablets.  I think that would be asking too much of the average human being suffering from a casual illness.  But I am glad the provision is there, though I doubt if anyone will bother using it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate seems to be becoming a bit involved. Deputy Norton was dealing with a different aspect.  I was talking about the serious drug.  But Deputy Norton put his finger on another problem, a problem which does not really come into this debate, though I share with what Deputy Dr. Browne said to some extent in regard to the matter. It does not directly come in.</P>
      <P>We all recollect that some years ago the Minister for Health made a very welcome Order from the point of view of everyone concerned in which he restricted freak claims for the working of miracles, but we, I understand, were dealing, in this debate, with the series of drugs a doctor would prescribe and we have worked on the principle that they could be manufactured in Ireland and that if we could stimulate a native pharmaceutical industry we should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept those premises and on those premises, I see the problem then as simple as this.  There is a large number of the common drugs which, whether bottled by the chemist himself or whether he takes them out of a proprietary bottle and puts his own label on them&mdash;or tablets such as aspirin&mdash;and there is no reason why they should not be made here and protected here.  Of that I am convinced.  I find myself completely in agreement with the Minister up to that point, but it is here that I find myself becoming cautious and asking: Do we need some external standards? For instance, if a drug of the same variety as aspirin, which is based, I understand, on salicylic acid, is sold, <Col N="1255" /> there is probably a spot check.  I do not want the standards and purity of the pharmacopoeia, but I suggest some agency like the State Laboratory which checks alcohol for Revenue, milks and the purity of water supplies. It could be done on a sampling basis, in which a sample is taken to ascertain by test whether there is so much of the chemical, aspirin, and otherwise, for purity and standard.</P>
    <P>I happen to have a proprietary bottle of tablets here which sets out the composition of the tablets: ten milligrammes of dicyclomine hydrochloride and 15 milligrammes of phenobarbitone. I have no reason to think they could not be equally well manufactured in Ireland.  Probably the same thing is being manufactured in other countries by different firms with merely a difference in the proprietary brand. In so far as that is concerned, I am at one with the Minister, but I want to ask is there some external check?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  Why does the Deputy assume there is not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not assuming there is not, but is it sufficient? That is the point.  There is some external check, that is so, and that goes for all that type of drug and, therefore, there is no problem in relation to this Order, but I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the more exotic or biological drugs and even the experimental drugs, but I suggest leaving them to the medical profession.</P>
      <P>On the question of analysis, the Minister could help the House and actually close the debate so far as I am concerned by specifying what are the external analytical controls on such drugs.  That would close the debate as regards a large variety of the proprietary drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it necessary to go back to some extent on the history of this industry which is not an old industry in this country.  There are, I think, five or six firms which manufacture these drugs.  There is one firm in particular and as I said in reply to a Parliamentary Question it was as a result of a request made by that firm <Col N="1256" /> that the original duties were imposed. They had been manufacturing for a number of years and were quite satisfied with their progress.  They had increased their market to a point where, apparently, people who exported these drugs to this country from other countries became concerned about their progress.  It appeared at one stage that tablets were available on the market at prices lower than the prices in the markets of the country of origin. It was in those circumstances that it was decided to impose this duty.  Since then, the industry has progressed and I am glad to say appears to be still progressing.  I hope the stage will be reached when we shall have a very worthwhile pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in this country.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies, and Deputy O'Higgins in particular, referred to the fact that unless the products of the Irish pharmaceutical industry have the confidence of the public, no tariff will assist their expansion.  More than confidence is involved in these cases. I am sure Deputies will be familiar with the preferences expressed for different kinds of commodities by reason of usage and not only by usage, but by the fact that agencies are established here for the distribution of products made abroad.  Even though those products could be procured here of a quality and at a price comparable with the imported commodity, these agencies continue to do business, because the people to whom they sell are in the habit of buying the particular products.  Sometimes duties are imposed in order to break people off that bad habit, even though the Irish commodity is as cheap and in some cases cheaper than the imported one.  More than mere confidence is involved in many cases in relation to tariffs.  There is also the question of habit and of inducing people to buy the Irish product of comparable price and quality with the imported one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton was right in his recollection of what happened on a previous occasion.  There was consultation with the Department of Health.  I should like to say to Deputy O'Higgins that the tariff imposed was not for the protection of somebody producing <Col N="1257" /> malt extract in this country.  There is such a tariff in force but the injection solution tariff was genuine.  A tariff was imposed in respect of genuine medical preparations for injections and that was done with the co-operation of the Department of Health and the Department of Industry and Commerce when Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Norton were in office.</P>

      <P>Surely it is?  I am not disputing the main contention of Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Dr. Browne that a bureau, or some independent authority, should be set up. There is at the moment an independent authority in the Department of Health.  There are pharmacists and analysts and inspections are carried out.  The premises of the Irish producers are inspected from the points of view of the pharmacists and analysts and the products are, in fact, analysed from time to time.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health has stated that he envisages an even more technical type of organisation.  In reply to a Question by Deputy Dr. Browne some few weeks ago, he stated that he was giving urgent consideration to the establishment of what he described himself as a pharmaceutical control laboratory.  The Minister made that statement on 2nd March, and when he says he is giving urgent attention to the matter, I am sure he means what he says.  At an earlier stage, he said he hoped for the establishment of a State laboratory to ensure that an even more effective system of inspection and analysis of Irish pharmaceutical products will be carried out.</P>

They have made no complaint to me.  I do not see why I should try to get them on my side.  I assume, in the absence of any complaint, that they are not against me.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne asked me a specific question as to whether or not there would be any dictatorial powers as far as health services are concerned, arising out of this Order.  My opinion is that, before this Order, Irish medicinal preparations, where they were available, were stocked by the Department of Health dispensaries and other institutions.  The position has not changed.  I am informed that if imported tablets or drugs are required the Department of Health has facilities for the making available of these imported tablets or drugs to patients requiring them.</P>

      <P>No licence whatever. A person can order from any factory in the world on his own postcard or by asking his chemist to do so.</P>
      <P>If I acceded to the request of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins that I suspend the operation of this Order pending the establishment of a bureau or a control laboratory, it would mean stunting the growth of this industry.  At the moment, I do not think it is necessary.  The safeguards are very adequate to ensure that the standard of the Irish commodity is maintained and is comparable with that of the imported one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the House that the prices are comparable and in some cases they are less than the cost, on the home market, of some of these imported tablets.  In the meantime, I welcome the urgent attention given and being given by the Minister for Health to the setting-up of the control laboratory. To suspend the Order now would stunt the growth of this firm and <Col N="1259" /> retard the day when we would have a really worth-while pharmaceutical industry.  The immediate effect would be to disemploy a number of workers at present engaged in the Irish industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quoted what the Minister for Health said of his intentions in respect of the establishment of a laboratory to deal with claims in regard to pharmaceutical products.  I would hope that the Minister would be able to say to his colleague, the Minister for Health, that the terms of that laboratory ought to be so widened as to enable it to deal with all kinds of products, not merely pharmaceutical products but the type of product which I mentioned earlier, varieties of salts, balm, liquids, all of which claim in one way or another to be able to effect some desirable change in the appearance or well-being of the simple man or woman who purchases them.</P>
      <P>If you look at the daily and weekly newspapers and at the English Sunday newspapers you will observe the vast amount of stuff advertised.  It would be very interesting to ascertain the expenditure by our people on foreign products apart from the native products. It would be very interesting to ascertain the amount of money we spend on purchasing commodities manufactured outside the country in the simple belief that they will effect these cures.  You will see an advertisement in regard to the speeding-up of the tempo of life.  You will see an advertisement for some preparation which will make an individual suffering from lassitude and inertia almost like a human dynamo.  Then there is a tablet to help a person to slow down, to make life easier for him, to help him to adjust himself to the tensions and strains of daily life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That extends even to animals. Recently, I saw an advertisement for tablets calculated to make old tom cats as frivolous as young kittens.  All that kind of thing goes on and simple people buy them.  We would do a good service to the community at large if we set up a bureau and said: &ldquo;Nobody will be allowed to sell commodities <Col N="1260" /> in that field which do not, in fact, pass the test that they will do for the human being what the manufacturer of the commodity claimed they would do.&rdquo;  If that were done, a lot of people would be wiser and richer than they will ever be so long as these indiscriminate advertisements are allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was discussing the Minister's proposition to spend twenty <Col N="1261" /> years on this new University project, and deprecating that intention.  It seems to me to be a proposition which must occasion consternation amongst the Governing Body of the University. The suggestion that the University should be transferred to Belfield means, I suppose, that the University will now try to operate for the best part of 20 years in its divided state.  It must be a source of very considerable inconvenience to teachers and students.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in the Minister's opening statement.  I think most of us will be very grateful to him for having dealt so comprehensively with the position in relation to education. We are glad to know that a belated effort is to be made for permission to examine this whole question of higher education for our people.  At the present moment there is no doubt that University education in Ireland is the preserve of the wealthy minority.  A considerable number of our children are denied access to the opportunities that University education gives to any boy or girl, man or woman.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, there is no doubt that the answer to the Minister's query in relation to whether we turn out too many graduates is an unequivocal &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It is our fault that our society is not sufficiently well developed to absorb the total number of potential graduates in our society who are denied access to higher education, through no fault of their own, but merely because their parents cannot afford the fees.  The question which the Minister could appropriately ask with more validity is: &ldquo;Are we turning out too many illiterates or semi-illiterates?&rdquo; That is a very much more serious consideration.  To restrict the number of University graduates would seem to me to be on a par with the suggestion that we should restrict the amount of land under the plough or restrict the amount of food.  There could be no moral justification for it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found the Commission's Report remarkably disappointing.  It was a Commission composed of a number of very highly qualified, talented people.  They were asked to make an <Col N="1262" /> objective examination of the position of the National University of Ireland in its present situation.  Its terms of reference were to inquire into the immediate needs of the National University of Ireland and to advise as to how, in present circumstances, its needs could best be met.  The Report, published two years later, recommended that the space requirements of University College, Dublin, in addition to the others, could not be met on or near its present site and they recommended moving to Stillorgan at an expenditure of £7 million.</P>
    <P>I think the recommendations are particularly disappointing.  I think they are ill-founded.  I do not think they are soundly based.  I do not think they are reasonable or rational. I do not think they are in the best interests of the National University of Ireland, the city of Dublin or the country as a whole.  I am very surprised that there has been this ready acceptance of the findings.  While they started out with the intention apparently of seeking a solution of the College's accommodation problem in the vicinity of the main College building in Earlsfort Terrace, they were gradually worked round&mdash;quite unreasonably, I believe&mdash;to a decision which was already taken.</P>
    <P>In 1949, I think, a decision was taken.  I was a member of the Government at the time.  I was not conscious that the decision we are now discussing was finally taken at that time as far as the Government was concerned.  I think a decision was taken by at least one individual and that all of us are now dangling at the end of a string manipulated by that particular individual who was able to impose his will on the rest of us, including this Commission.  I do not think it is in the best long-term interests of the University or our society.  There was an implied complaint from the Commission that if their terms of reference were different and had they invited views of coordination within the University or over a wider field, other solutions might have presented themselves.  I think that, while the terms of reference were limited and undesirably <Col N="1263" /> limited, certain considerations entered into the terms of reference, in the first place, the necessity for haste.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy McGilligan's suggestion that there was not haste.  There simply had to be haste having regard to the magnitude of the problem at Earlsfort Terrace at the present moment with the overcrowding and the positive inability there must be for students to learn and professors and lecturers to teach competently. The solution for that problem was not to recommend a decision which in the end will militate against the interests of the University.</P>
    <P>The cause of that problem was the dilatory attitude of successive Governments over 40 years to this whole question of higher education in all its aspects&mdash;the neglect of secondary education and the virtual neglect of higher education.  Therefore, we have to set up a Commission with terms of reference which refer to University College, Dublin, because of the urgency of the problem there.  In that way it could be said to deny the Commission the right to examine this whole University problem in its proper context, its proper context of course being the position of this great University in the country in the centuries ahead.</P>
    <P>I say that the commission was hog-tied by a decision taken by a small group of individuals and that decision caused its failure to realise its own desired objective which was to keep the University within the precincts of the city.  The decision by which the Commission was hog-tied was the decision that the University must be what is called the campus type University.  There is more than one type of University.  There is the Oxford and Cambridge residential type; the red bricked type and the campus type which has buildings spread over a 200, 300, 400 or 500 acre site.  It may have advantages but I believe that the advantages of any other type of building, taken in our particular circumstances in Dublin, greatly outweigh any possible advantages there may be in this campus conception of a University.</P>
    <P>If the Commission had not been <Col N="1264" /> committed, either at the beginning of or throughout their deliberations, by this decision to insist on a campus type University, there would be no difficulty at all in keeping University College, Dublin, here where it belongs, in the heart of the city.  This retreat from the heart of this ancient city to the country, to rustication, of what should be a great institution, is the decision of old men.  It is a decision of a generation which will not meet the challenge of the demands of the modern, scientific and atomic age. They are living in the days when University settlements were founded in remote places because of their religious associations, such as Glendalough, Clonmacnoise and various other places.  But we are living in the atomic age, not in the stone age.  The purpose of a University is not to reguild the Book of Kells, or create new Books of Kells.  It is to create the technocrats of the modern age as well as to train the professional people.</P>
    <P>This decision is a retreat from the demands of modern needs.  A University in my notion should be the centre of the whole cultural and educational complex in a society.  It should be a heart pumping the blood, a throbbing through the life of a nation&mdash;providing the professional men, the scientists, the philosophers, the teachers, the thinkers&mdash;to supply the needs of the agricultural industry, or the ordinary textile industries, and our schools and colleges and educational establishments.  But it belongs in the heart of any city and we had this unique opportunity of retaining this University within the boundaries of our city and helping it to grow and become part of our life.  Now it is to rusticate.  The idea is to isolate it from the life of the city, this great ancient city of Dublin, and move it into the suburbs.  Because of the insistence on this adhesion to the idea of the campus as opposed to the residential city type of University, every other consideration has been thrown overboard.</P>
    <P>There is the question of cost.  This will mean a greatly increased cost and I do not put cost as being the most important consideration.  This will <Col N="1265" /> mean a break with the historic siting of this University which, as the Minister pointed out, had a most poignant and troublesome origin.  To the people associated with it, it must have very historic and close ties with many of the people involved in it, Newman and the other, who established this particular kind of University in the face of opposition.</P>
    <P>There is the very great practical consideration of the convenience of something in the region of 5,000 students, and I expect about 500 lecturers and professors.  This has all been put aside in favour of the idea of the trees and the tree-lined avenues, houses set back amongst the woods, the daffodils, the crocuses and the rest of it.  Those are all delightful in theory, but they are impractical in 1960, relatively irrelevant in 1960, in a relatively poor country trying to educate the greatest number of boys and girls, with a relatively small amount of money.  It is all very well for the United States of America and these other countries which, by means of the lavish foundations of the industrial magnates, endow great Universities with the campus idea.  It is all very well for these people to do that, but I honestly do not think that even if it were desirable&mdash;and I do not think it is desirable&mdash;we can afford to do it.</P>
    <P>I think the general decision is a particularly retrograde one.  Some of the remarks made by the Commission suggested they had been away and had had discussions in other countries. They had been assured by people living in Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Reading and various centres such as those, that this decentralisation was a very good idea.  Of course it is a very good idea for Sheffield, or Birmingham or Manchester.  Many of the people in those places would like to get out to our Stillorgan and get away from the slums and sordid, smoky surroundings of these rather horrible cities in the Black Country in the North of England.  But there is no comparison at all between these Black Country cities, towns in the North of England, and Dublin, particularly the part of Dublin about which we are talking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> I think the Commission has been, for its intellectual weight and the calibre of the minds of the men involved, extraordinarily ingenuous in their acceptance of the suggestion by people who do not know as precisely as we do, and as the Commission damn well ought to have known, how things are here in Dublin&mdash;the very unique situation which we have here in Dublin.  This whole matter has been unnecessarily confused because, no matter what Deputy McGilligan says, it has been hurried by virtue of the crisis in the University in Earlsfort Terrace.  That crisis is the product of the inertia on the part of many Governments over a very long time, but I still do not think it justifies our taking a bad decision, and I think this is a bad decision.</P>
    <P>I say that our situation here in Dublin is like no other situation anywhere else.  I want the University College of Dublin to remain in the heart of the city, integrated with the life of the people of the city, and I do not want it to go into isolation, as it proposes to do.  The Commission has not justified its decision to go out to Stillorgan in the light of the possibilities of remaining in the city in the surroundings in which it could create a new, great university.  I say our situation here is unique because in this particular area where it was proposed to build a university, we have a remarkable grouping of cultural establishments of the highest order, a remarkably convenient grouping of these cultural establishments of the highest order.</P>
    <P>As I said, a University should be at the heart of that cultural and educational complex here in the centre of the city.  We have the National Museum, the National Library, these Houses of the Oireachtas, the National Gallery, the Royal College of Physicians, the College of Surgeons and the various other institutional bodies such as the Institute for Advanced Studies. Then there is a matter which I shall deal with later, Trinity College, Dublin, and its great unique library.</P>
    <P>In relation to these other cities, Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester and so on, when they go out to the <Col N="1267" /> surburbs, they have a perfectly good reason.  I do not mean to be disrespectful when I say that any sane man living in the city of Birmingham would live outside it if he could or move outside it as quickly as he could. I do not think that is true of Dublin. Even leaving that aside, the surroundings, the pleasant character and nature of the area we are talking about in Dublin, none of these people is leaving behind him these prerequisites to the most ideal cultural-educational unit that any society could devise.  If you could sit down and plan for a hundred years, you could not have provided these wonderful buildings all within sight of one another in the heart of the loveliest part of the city of Dublin. There is nothing like the case that there is in the other great British cities, overcrowded, congested and many of them slum-ridden as they are.</P>
    <P>Dublin is unique, too, in the fact that in this area we have the &ldquo;lungs,&rdquo; the green belts, the Merrion Square area, the College Park area, the Stephen's Green area, Leinster Lawn, the lawn at St. Peter's Place and Iveagh Gardens.  All of these could become a component part of a great new University in the heart of the city, integrated with it in one way or another. There is not here the overcrowding you find in these industrial cities in the heart of England.  There are not the great tenement buildings, one looking down on the other.  Even the buildings there are in these areas I have mentioned are relatively sparse. They are the four or five storey houses with very large gardens.  There are wide streets.</P>
    <P>Again, there is this consideration, that in many of these industrial cities, property is particularly valuable, of high commercial value.  Consequently, the acquisition of land in these areas is prohibitive, but it is not prohibitive here.  If our people are determined to have this most precious of all things &mdash;their premier University in the heart of their capital city&mdash;nothing could stop them from acquiring the land in one way or another.  Its commercial value is relatively low compared with other cities.  There is no great Bond <Col N="1268" /> Street, Oxford Street, Grafton Street or O'Connell Street, no shopping centre to be disorganised as a result of the provision of the necessary land in the heart of the city.  Then again, unlike Paris, Madrid or Stockholm, there are not great works of art or historic monuments which would preclude our acquiring land and levelling whatever is on that land in order to provide the space needed to build our University.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is sheer rubbish on the part of the Commission and on the part of the Minister to suggest that it is not possible to build this new University in the heart of the city of Dublin.  Admittedly, if the Government are committed to find from 200 to 500 acres in order to build the campus type of sprawled University, then of course they have no alternative but to go into rural Ireland, go out to Stillorgan and find it there. But is the Minister committed; and, if he is committed, why is he committed to this campus type of building, rather than to the alternative types of buildings which are open to him, should he wish to provide such a University?  The Minister has made no case whatever for this critical decision, the insistence on behalf of somebody that a campus and only a campus type of unit is the one acceptable to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last week, I was dealing with this amendment moved by Deputy Belton which, in my opinion, would make a bad Bill worse.  It is serious enough in modern times to consider proposals made by a Minister after due, careful, <Col N="1269" /> and proper consideration for those who are entitled to the first consideration of this House, the men, women and children of the general public, and the Minister himself proposes to extend the drinking hours on Sunday evenings. Deputy Belton, in his amendment, proposes conditions which, in my view, are even more unsatisfactory and more prejudicial to general public interest, and more harmful, both to those engaged in the trade and to the members of the families of those who might utilise the extended hours to drink on Sunday evenings.</P>
      <P>In connection with this section of the Bill, one should not dwell at any great length on what is happening on the roads and streets under modern conditions, but at least we are entitled to take into account that from authoritative sources in all parts of the world, we learn that death, mutilation and injury are not lessened in cases where people have taken drink.  The proposal in the Bill, and the even more unwelcome proposals in the amendments tabled by Deputy Belton, if accepted by this House, in my opinion, would contribute to greater danger for the ordinary citizens of this country in that respect.</P>
      <P>The accidental death or injury of any member of the family of an Irish citizen is always very sincerely deplored, and I have no doubt that proper expressions of sympathy are extended from all sides of this House to a family, a member of which has been killed or seriously injured as the result of an accident on the public roads, but it is little use for us solemnly to tender such sympathy to a sorrowing parent or relation if, at the same time, in our legislation, we deliberately perform an act which can have no other effect but to increase the danger of accidents on the roads.</P>
      <P>If any Deputy cares to consider this matter with any degree of objectivity, with any degree of thought for the innocent victims, he will readily agree with me that to introduce deliberately into legislation an amendment such as this, undoubtedly would mean greater danger to people using the roads, especially pedestrians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want briefly to refer to the point I made earlier.  When legislation <Col N="1270" /> is introduced, we have a responsibility to be satisfied, in the first instance, that there is some demand from the general public for it, or some need on the part of the public for an alteration in existing conditions. I have not yet heard any case made by anybody that convinces me in the slightest, or that would convince any neutral observer, that there has been a demand made to extend official drinking hours on Sunday evenings beyond what they are at present.  I have not as yet heard any case made that there is any need as far as the general public are concerned for an extension of these Sunday drinking hours.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister again faced with the dilemma that he has been faced with in all sections of this Bill?  Is he faced with the possibility that some sections of the public, aided and abetted by those who normally should lead public opinion and give example to the ordinary citizen, will continue, as has been said on many occasions in this House, to disregard the licensing laws and, in that respect, bring these laws into public contempt?</P>
    <P>I said earlier in Committee, and I repeat, that laws of this nature, obviously, are not made for one small section of the community.  If it were possible to arrange matters so that those people who go into public houses, clubs or hotels, and drink to the point where they may be a danger to themselves and an inconvenience and a danger to others, would remain in such places until they became completely sober again, the Minister might have some case.</P>
    <P>If it were possible for those people who drive commercial vehicles or private motor cars and those who are of a nature that when they reach a certain stage of intoxication, their next objective must be to insult and injure others, to be kept in the public houses until they had reached such a state of sobriety that they did not constitute a possible danger to innocent people, there might not be such a strong argument against these proposals to amend the present legislation by extending the hours of drinking on Sunday, or against the amendments in the name of Deputy Belton.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> I do not think it is a good thing deliberately to create conditions late on a Sunday evening which may result in people coming out of public houses, clubs, and hotels and driving motor cars while not technically drunk but with their judgment and vision so impaired and prejudiced as to be a danger to the ordinary citizen and his family.</P>
    <P>In these matters, the general public, the citizens, particularly the more helpless, weaker section of the community, are entitled to protection from this House.  The weaker section of the community are the women and children. I am not proposing, and I have not advocated, a limitation of the present drinking hours.  I have opposed on every section of this Bill any extension of these hours, particularly any extension of these hours which in addition to adversely affecting the wellbeing of the general public, would cause, or would be likely to cause, hardship and inconvenience to those who work in the trade, to those who obtain their living by running public houses, and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not wish at this stage to refer at any great length to the other factor involved in this proposal to extend the hours on Sunday evening or in the amendment to extend these hours even further.  I am a city Deputy.  In common with many other people in the city and, I suppose, the majority of people in the country, I like to enjoy, if I can, a Sunday evening with my family, perhaps attending a concert, theatre or some place of amusement, or out in the air.  In ordinary life, it is impossible not to be aware of the fact that there are various public houses and places where liquor can be obtained on a Sunday evening.  Around the hour of 7 o'clock, which is the existing closing hour, there is an exodus of people in motor cars.  It is proposed now to delay that exodus to a later hour on Sunday evening and to deprive those who work in public-houses of reasonable association with their families.  There is no need to impose on them through this Bill the obligation of working till 9.30 or 10 o'clock on a Sunday evening. <Col N="1272" /> It has been said in the course of the discussion that an extension of the hours, particularly on Sundays, would result in a demand by the workers for compensation which would, in turn, affect the cost of the commodity. Having had representations from those who represent the workers involved, I know the workers do not want these hours.  They have protested very strenuously through their organisation against the proposal to lengthen the hours.  They have made it as plain as it is possible to make it that they feel they, like other citizens, are entitled to relaxation, to normal association with their families and to join with their friends in social activities on Sunday evening.</P>
    <P>The hardship entailed in this proposal applies equally even in cases where there may be no outside labour employed but where the proprietor and members of his family are the only people engaged in operating the establishment.  I feel it is proper to say a word on their behalf, because reference has been made by people from among that section of the community to this question of the longer drinking hours proposed on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill is retrograde and reactionary.  It will detrimentally affect the interests of those who earn their livelihood by providing the public with intoxicating liquor. It has not been shown that there has been any widespread public demand for an alteration in the hours.  It has not been shown that any person is really suffering by reason of the fact that public houses close at 7 o'clock on Sunday evening, and that, in order to allay the suffering of an individual, it is necessary to impose hardships and inconveniences and to affect and interfere with the privileges of the normal family domestic life on Sunday afternoon.</P>
    <P>If this proposal is carried, some publicans may make a little more profit.  It is a fact, now, that individual owners of these establishments, individual hotel-keepers and individual controllers of clubs repeatedly and regularly break the law by providing intoxicating liquor to people already intoxicated. <Col N="1273" /> Calmly and casually, because of the desire to accumulate a little more of the world's goods, they give drink to people they know are not in a fit condition to drink.  One has only to go around any part of Dublin, Cork or any other city and observe &mdash;not all the time or the major part of the time but at some times&mdash; people coming out of public houses literally unable to stand.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill is before us and these proposals for the extension of drinking hours on Sunday evenings are before us because of the contempt in which the present licensing laws have been held throughout the country and because of the refusal of the authorities&mdash;this Legislature and the law-enforcing body&mdash;to live up to and to accept their responsibilities properly. The Minister has no easy task and, in fact, must have had moments of heart-searching in piloting this Bill through the House.  I would ask him and Deputies to consider the boys and girls coming out of our secondary schools, attending Universities, seeking and starting in employment, and to consider whether their future, their security and their wellbeing are not much more important than the interests of the unknown pressure group who appear to have inspired this piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I conclude by asking the House to do two things in connection with the amendments we are now discussing&mdash;to throw out the amendments of Deputy Belton which are even more reactionary and retrograde than the sections contained in the Bill and, in the interests of Irish citizens and Irish families, amend the Bill by accepting the amendments in my name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting Deputy Belton's amendment but I want to correct an impression which I think Deputy Larkin might convey to people outside the House that the hours suggested in the Bill and recommended by the Commission are far in excess of the hours actually operating at present. That, of course, is not the position. We all know that over the greater part of the country the <i>bona fide</i> law is in operation which permits drinking on <Col N="1274" /> Sunday evenings up to 8 p.m.  We also know that by an area exemption order drinking can be continued up to 10 o'clock.  I want to make certain that as far as the House is concerned, at any rate, it is understood that the hours which are being recommended, the hours in the Bill, are hours that have been given considerable consideration before they were recommended.  They are the hours the Government think should operate.</P>
      <P>Personally, I do not favour Deputy Belton's amendment extending the hours to 10 o'clock: I much prefer the hours contained in the Bill, from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.  We have some idea why the Commission made that recommendation. In the first place, I think it was to make some <i>quid pro quo</i> to the <i>bona fide</i> trade which it was thought would be hard hit by its abolition and secondly, the hour 5 p.m. was designed, I believe, to meet the requirements of people coming from football matches and other sporting events which take place on Sunday afternoons.  From that point of view, I am satisfied that the hours recommended in the Bill are the hours which the House should adopt.  On the question of the Sunday hours, we should consider dealing with area exemption orders.</P>

      <P>I do not agree for a moment with the suggestion of Deputy Larkin or with that of the Minister when they say that in my amendment I am proposing an extension of trading hours.  In fact, the amendment suggests a curtailment of trading hours. The Bill suggests trading hours of 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.; my suggestion in the amendment is 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and I went so far as to say that I would prefer 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.  I do not know whether the Commission considered the difficulties that arise, or will arise, in the trade in Dublin and I am sure to a great extent these <Col N="1275" /> difficulties apply in Cork, Limerick and Waterford as well and in other large provincial towns where public houses employ a good deal of labour.</P>
      <P>I was very surprised to hear Deputy Larkin's view on this amendment because I think there is a great trade union principle involved in it.  When speaking on this matter before, I pointed out that according to the working conditions applying in the licensed trade at the moment, a man is entitled to one Sunday off in two. Take, for example, a licensed house with eight employees; only four employees are working each Sunday and it is really inhuman to expect the staff to have their tea before they report back for work at 5 o'clock.  It is also inhuman to expect them to wait until they have closed, cleared up and washed up at 9.30 at night to have their tea, unless the licensee is in a position to have other staff to relieve them.  Additional staff cost a lot of money and the only way that can be found is by increasing the price of drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be suggested: &ldquo;Let publicans employ extra men.&rdquo;  But the only reason extra men would be needed would be for tea relief on Sunday evenings.  After the debate on this section last week, it was suggested to me that people attending sports fixtures at Croke Park or Dalymount Park in Dublin or big matches in Thurles, Cork or Limerick on Sundays, would prefer to have opening hours at 5 o'clock.  If the associations have at heart the interests of the people who pay going through their gates, I suggest they should postpone the starting times of their fixtures until 5 <Col N="1276" /> o'clock so that those attending sports fixtures would have suitable facilities later.  I think this will create one of the biggest problems in the operation of this Bill when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>Am I correct in thinking&mdash;did I hear the ruling of the Chair properly&mdash;that, on this amendment, the question of area exemptions may be discussed?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask the House to permit me to make the point that I did not associate myself with the two amendments recommended by Deputy Belton because I did not agree with them, but, in respect of amendment 15, which is quite distinct from the other two, I am proposing a reduction of two hours in the evening hours of opening on Sundays in the summer and a reduction of one hour in the evening hours of opening on Sundays in the winter.  I want to make that submission for a reason to which I referred on another Stage of the Bill. This is part of the Bill which I had an opportunity of discussing with representatives of the Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' Assistants' Association. They made various representations on this matter to a committee of our Party, and I explained to them that, on the Committee Stage of this Bill, our Party was having a free vote on the various sections.  I was so impressed by the case they made, which was a very simple one, that I felt bound to put down this amendment that that case might be brought to the attention of the House.</P>
      <P>The case is this.  They say that, if their members have to work the new hours proposed in the Bill, it will mean that a young married man with a young family will not get to see his family at all because, by the time he finishes work on a weekday, cleans up and gets home young children are ordinarily in bed.  Heretofore, he had the prospect, on Sundays, of getting home in time to spend a few hours with the children.  Under the proposal in the Bill, if in winter he has to work until 8 o'clock, he does not get cleaned up and free to go home until nearly 9 o'clock and by the time he reaches home the children are in bed.  If in the summer he does not finish until 9 o'clock by the time he gets cleaned up and reaches home it is nearly 10 o'clock.  I propose, therefore, that on Sunday evenings the public houses shall be closed at 7 o'clock so that that man can get cleaned and be home before the children are in bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same considerations substantially apply to the small publican who employs no staff.  If he is to remain on duty&mdash;and he must, in fact, remain on duty for the hours permitted in the Bill if he is to retain his business&mdash;it means he finishes in the evening at 9 o'clock in the summer, <Col N="1279" /> and 8 o'clock in the winter, on Sundays and St. Patrick's Day.  He reaches the stage really when he has no time in which he can effectively close the door and enjoy the company of his children, or to enable his children to have the benefit of their father's company in their early years.</P>
    <P>I have a long experience of the retail trade.  I remember once differing pretty trenchantly with the late Deputy Murphy of the Labour Party who was angry with me because I said that at Christmas time I thought it was not an unreasonable demand to make on grocers' assistants, or shop assistants in the retail trade, that they should work late for the convenience of their customers if they got suitable overtime pay.  I still hold that view.  People who enter the retail trade must justify their existence by affording the customers reasonable convenience, and if seasonal demands are made upon them to work overtime, they ought to do it cheerfully in the service of the people from whom they get their living, provided fairly remunerative overtime is given for the work.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if publicans engage in the trade of providing entertainment of this kind, it is reasonable to ask them to reconcile their personal convenience with the convenience of their customers, up to a point.  That is something this House is sometimes liable to forget&mdash;that there is a Rubicon beyond which we should not go.  We have a duty to consider, in connection with legislation of this kind, how far we affect the personal and domestic life of the people who are affected by our legislation.  It is not true, in this context, to say that these opening hours are really permissive. Nominally these opening hours are permissive but, in fact, and in practice, they are mandatory because any publican who fails to keep his door open during the hours prescribed in this Bill would not long retain his trade.  Therefore, if we say in the Bill that publicans may remain open until 9 o'clock, they must remain open because none of them can afford to close.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the convenience of <Col N="1280" /> the public, I do not think any case has been made for completely disrupting the family life of a young married man in this trade.  That is a circumstance to which we should have regard. It is our duty to do so, having carefully weighed up the corresponding obligation on the publican and his assistants to adopt their convenience to the legitimate requirements of the customers. Is it wholly hopeless to imagine that this House could concern itself about that two hours' domestic enjoyment for a very small section of the community?</P>
    <P>I like to cherish what is, perhaps, the illusion that so small a matter is not beneath the attention of this House. It is in that spirit that I find myself with my name in the rather unlikely association with that of Deputy Larkin. Whether our approach to this problem is quite the same, I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken on this amendment but I am still not quite clear, even though I am a teetotaller, as to how we shall deal with it when it comes to voting.  I submit that amendment No. 15 is not affected in any way by amendment No. 13, on which we have voted.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, possibly in not quite the same terms as Deputy Dillon, my reason for advocating an earlier closing hour than that proposed on a Sunday evening and on St. Patrick's Day is in consideration of the family life of those engaged in the sale of liquor, their right to some family and domestic association, to some relaxation and to some social life with their families on a Sunday which would very seriously be prejudiced by the proposed extension of the closing hours.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to repeat that when the doors of a public house close, it is not the end of work as far as the staff or the proprietor are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> For those people who may be enjoying &mdash;I think that is the term, possibly, Deputy Dillon would use&mdash;a drink in the public house, their enjoyment ceases at 7 o'clock but the work of the staff and of the proprietor continues possibly for half-an-hour, an hour or even longer.  Their normal pursuits on a Sunday evening are very seriously interfered with.  That aspect deserves serious consideration.  Unlike Deputy Dillon, however, I think that to consider this matter fully, we must not confine ourselves to the narrow field which was mentioned.</P>
    <P>The extension of the hours on a Sunday evening will very materially affect not merely the families of those working in the public houses but also many thousands of families because of those who patronise the public houses. In the cities and in rural areas, very frequently concerts are held on Sunday evenings in the various public halls, parish halls, school halls, and so on.  It is one evening of the week when concerts and entertainments are attended not merely by an adult audience but by fathers and mothers who bring their children with them to such entertainment which may be in aid of some charitable objective.  They go along to support it and possibly also to enjoy the dramatic and other abilities of members of the family or of friends or relations, or possibly of fellow-students of the children.</P>
    <P>Most of these entertainments&mdash;and I think they are very useful entertainments&mdash;are attended, especially as far as the ordinary community are concerned, on this family basis.  They mostly close around 8 o'clock or maybe 8.30 p.m.  It all depends on other factors but certainly I do not think the present proposal would make any useful contribution or give any encouragement to those who think that this type of local effort is useful, either from a social or cultural point of view.  I do not think it would contribute to the growth and development of a good community life if this type of effort, which is so much associated with a Sunday evening, were in any way prejudiced or interfered with by encouraging fathers or other male members, who would normally attend them, to remain in the public houses and not to <Col N="1282" /> do as they do now, accompany the members of their families to these concerts, plays, dramas and dance demonstrations, and so forth.  There is hardly a community where the people gather together to encourage and develop this type of cultural and social activity where the events are not arranged to take place on a Sunday evening.</P>
    <P>There is another factor.  It may not be a large one but it certainly weighs considerably in my mind.  I refer to the unknown initiator of this proposal to increase these hours on Sunday. There was a majority and a minority report and it is not yet clear to many of us which is the majority and which the minority report.  Certainly it is quite clear that, aside from some lines in that Report, the suggestion to extend the hours in this way has no real support from any responsible source or any solid basis in our community. Accordingly, I again commend to the House the views expressed in support of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a little experience of this sort of business.  I was in the dance game a lot one time and I dreaded a holiday occurring on a weekday because, when it did so, the crowd come out half &ldquo;canned&rdquo; and I had endless trouble.  That is what we are inviting by opening the public houses until 9 o'clock.  In the summer, they used have four hours for drinking. They will come out and they will not go home.  It will not be worth going home.  They will make for the dance hall to give trouble.  In any case, if they do not make for the dance halls, they will club crawl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that hour of the night, you cannot arrange to go to the pictures or anywhere else, particularly the seaside. The people who come out of the public houses at 9 o'clock will want to finish the night and if they cannot get into a club, they will try to get into a dance hall.  There are quite a number of these places in this city.  There are clubs and so-called restaurants where you can get tea with a half-one in it. In fact that goes on all night.  I raised this question before but the Minister does not seem to be aware of the existence of these places.  I was in the dance game for 30 years and I ought <Col N="1283" /> to know what is what and who is who.</P>
    <P>We are inviting trouble for the dance hall people on Sunday nights. The people coming out of the public houses at 9 o'clock will club crawl. Therefore, we are actually encouraging drunkenness, whereas if the public houses were closed at 7 o'clock&mdash;I agree with the amendment&mdash;it would mean that the people could hardly get so &ldquo;canned&rdquo;.  They may go home and have their tea and make other arrangements, knowing that the public houses are closed.  It might be too early for the clubs.  They would make other arrangements.  They would, perhaps, arrange to go to a cinema. They would have one hour to go home. If it is a fine evening, they will still have time to go to the seaside.  In other words, there is a check on drinking the night out.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a good thing in many respects.  It would be a good thing for the home because where wives are fond of drink, they will go out earlier and will not come back until 9 o'clock.  That means that the children will have to fend for themselves.  The hour itself is bad because Sunday night is a miserable night if you have not made arrangements to go somewhere. If you go down town, there is nothing in the town.  That is why I say that when they come out at 9 o'clock, they do not know what to do with themselves. They will make a beeline somewhere. They will get drink or make a nuisance of themselves.  I agree with 7 o'clock because it will allow a publican and his staff to go home.  It will be good for the homes because parents will be able to look after their children knowing that the public houses are closed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider this question of clubs and so-called restaurants.  It is very easy to make laws and say they will be uniform but there is always the wide fellow who plans to defeat them.  It would be a good thing for everyone if the public houses closed at 7 o'clock. Closing at 9 o'clock will give rise to a nuisance because people will not know what to do with themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>They are one or two of a minority.  You will always get the black sheep.  But I am afraid Deputy Sherwin has lost sight of his own argument because he ought to know that no licence can be given to a dance hall after 12 o'clock on a Sunday night.  Whether a man goes out at 9 o'clock or 7 o'clock, I think the fellow who waits for three hours and then deliberately goes to buy a dance ticket as well can be described as having a great thirst.  There is one thing which we should not lose sight of, and I think Deputy Larkin lost sight of it, that is, that the principal people concerned in this business are the members of the licensed trade.  If they are not able to meet the high rates which they have to pay, the high licence fees and all the other demands on them, it will mean a very considerable amount of unemployment.</P>
      <P>It is a rather serious matter for a bar assistant to be unemployed because he is not fitted for every sphere of life.  We should not lose sight of the principle involved that we should not take from any person without grave reason his means of livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!  I hope the Deputy will bear that in mind when we come to the 6-day licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many arguments for and against.  I think the Minister is very generous with the 6-day licence.  I know that Deputy Dillon has a lot to contend with in his own town.  I think in his own dear town somebody mentioned that there were 56 6-day licences.  I hope that is not true.  We must not lose sight of the fact that for the people concerned, it is a difficult type of livelihood.  There are all kinds of impediments and difficulties to surmount.  Some people talk as if licensed houses were some sort of automatic machine into which people go, spend plenty of money and come out again, having enriched the publican <Col N="1285" /> during their short sojourn there.  There are people who spend money freely but the vast majority who frequent publichouses, whether on Sunday evenings or at weekends, are people who drink a pint or two.  They ensure that their sojourn in the local publichouse, as well as allaying their thirst, if they have one, and I presume most people who go drinking have, is a social event.</P>
      <P>Speaking here the other night, I said that the fact that so many publichouses had closed down in England since the advent of television offers the greatest proof that publichouses are social centres.  Deputies should be guarded when they make statements regarding drunkenness.  That day has gone. Several Ministers for Finance did more to create a spirit of temperance than anybody else I know of.  When the price of drink was 2d. a pint, or 2½d. a glass, many arguments could have been advanced against opening on Sundays or extending hours.  Of course, this Bill does not extend the hours of opening for the licensed trade.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin was concerned about people trying to find their homes at night time.  I should prefer to try to find my home at night time than have to find out whether the bank manager was going to keep me another hour in the &ldquo;sweat house&rdquo; or not.  The majority of the publicans live from day to day and I can assure the House that in rural Ireland there are very few wealthy people in the licensed trade.  The profits in the trade are small and everyday demands on the traders are great, owing to the great competition which they must face. You must naturally expect the people in the licensed trade to be, of necessity, more generous than the average person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the average town of 4,000 or 5,000 people, you will find four, five or six draperies but you will find 40 to 50 publichouses.  You might have two or three hardware shops but again you will have 40 to 50 publichouses competing against one another.  The competition is so keen that it is a difficult trade and it is a trade that should command a certain amount of sympathy from everybody here.  I think that to curtail the hours of <Col N="1286" /> drinking would be a great injustice. Remember this Bill curtails the hours of drinking and brings with it penalties hanging over the heads of every member of the licensed trade.</P>
    <P>We know the home is sacred but the home of the publican is the one home that can be subjected to inspections morning, noon and night, as often as a Guard feels that he should inspect it.  In order to enter the home of the ordinary individual, a Guard has to go to a great deal of trouble. He has to swear an affidavit that so and so has happened or is likely to happen in the home, and he has to get authority from the district justice to go into the ordinary house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this Bill because, as I said initially, it does extend the drinking hours.  It is true it proposes to alter the present <i>bona fide</i> hours of trading but, in so far as the cities are concerned, the present closing hours are 10 p.m. in the winter and 10.30 p.m. in the summer.  This Bill proposes to extend those hours to 11 p.m. and 11.30 p.m. and also to apply the same hours between city and country areas.  I believe that the case against the Bill as it stands was very well put, and in very moderate tones, by Deputy Maher.  He spoke as a person who had, as he put it, experience of the working of the licensing hours in urban and rural areas.  He confirmed the views which I had expressed, as I experienced them in my own constituency, which is part urban and part rural, that it is impossible by means of legislation to try to impose the same pattern of life on urban and rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all familiar with the different <Col N="1287" /> time-tables observed by people working in the urban areas and those which obtain in rural areas.  These differences need not be repeated, but I believe it is a mistake first of all, to think that the hours are not being extended, because over-all the effect will be longer drinking in the urban areas, and, so far as the <i>bona fide</i> trade is concerned, a half-hour differential between midnight and 11.30 p.m. or midnight and 11 p.m. as the case may be.</P>

Many Deputies have referred to the fact that Sunday night is a night on which families are anxious to remain together and that there is no great case for longer hours.  In fact, I believe that the proposed extension of the hours on a Sunday evening is not desirable.  For that reason, I believe this amendment should be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage one does not know whether this is a Bill to provide for more drinking or less drinking, especially having regard to the undoubted fact that there is quite an amount of illegal drinking in the country at present.  I have certain views on the question of drinking on Sunday.  I should like to put this case to the Minister and those people in favour of having the public houses open from 5 p.m. until 9 p.m. in the summer months and from 5 p.m. until 8 p.m. in the winter months.  I think it will be accepted that in present circumstances the majority of people who drink here go to take their drink at approximately 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming that the public houses close, as they are supposed to, at 10 p.m. in the winter and 10.30 p.m. in the <Col N="1288" /> summer, it means that on a weekday the great majority of drinkers have about 2½ hours in the summer and two hours in the winter.  Now, under the terms of this Bill, they can drink on a Sunday from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m., one and a half hours, and from 5 p.m. until 9 p.m. in the summer, four hours.  Therefore, this section will permit people to drink on a Sunday for 5½ hours while on a normal day they will be permitted under this Bill to drink, for all practical purposes, from 8 p.m. till 11 p.m. in the winter and 8 p.m. until 11.30 p.m. in the summer.  You give them 5½ hours' drinking time on a Sunday, while for all practical purposes they get only from three to three and a half hours on an ordinary week-day.</P>
    <P>Normally, a man leaves work at 5.30 p.m. or 6 o'clock.  He goes home for his tea, does a few odd jobs, reads the evening paper or the daily paper. He does not go out to the public house until 8 o'clock&mdash;I would say that would be the earliest.  I do not care what anybody else thinks but I say Sunday is a day different from other days.  I know that when one talks like that here, one runs the risk of being told one is moralising and telling people how they should respect Sunday but, in my opinion, Sunday has a special place in the week and I believe it is of special significance for the majority of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I am personally opposed to a drinking session of four hours.  It is true that the normal man does not get drunk in an hour or an hour and a half, but I fear to think what might happen to him in four hours.  Somebody might say to me: &ldquo;Can you not mind your own business?  Let him do what he likes.&rdquo;  In this Bill, however, as in others, we have accepted the principle of control over drinking hours.  Anybody who objects to my saying that four hours is too long could say, if we did not accept that principle, that we should have no drinking hours at all but should allow people drink for 24 hours a day.</P>
    <P>I have much sympathy with the views expressed by Deputy Dillon, <Col N="1289" /> Deputy Larkin and Deputy Sherwin. I would also have a lot of sympathy with the views of Deputy Davern if this Bill were designed principally for the protection of publicans.  I do not think anybody would disagree with Deputy Davern when he says that publicans have to meet heavy expenditure in regard to rent, rates and licence fees as well as providing a living for themselves and their families. As I said, this section will permit 5½ hours of solid drinking.  On Sunday there is no question of a man coming home and having to dress up in his best suit.  He is ready from the word &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;  He is ready at twenty-five past 12 to go to the public house, and he may come out at 2 o'clock.</P>
    <P>So far the Minister has not told us in detail how the Guards will operate this Bill.  He has not told us if it is possible for the Garda, at its present strength, to enforce the provisions of this Bill.  It will be an awful tragedy for the country if a majority in this House accept the Bill and there is not absolute control subsequently.  If I believed there would be absolute control with regard to the drinking hours permitted by it, then I should be a little happier, but, having regard to the strength of the Garda, it seems to me that it will be impossible for the drinking hours to be rigidly controlled. It may be, however, that even though the Garda will not be able to do it with regard to all licensed premises, the first few fines imposed upon publicans will be enough&mdash;to use a colloquialism&mdash;to soften the coffin on other publicans who may be inclined to extend their drinking hours.  That is why I want to impress upon this House what we are actually doing in this section.</P>
    <P>We are giving substantially more time for drinking on Sundays than we are on weekdays, by reason of the fact that on weekdays men cannot go out to drink until 8 p.m., or in some cases 8.30 or 9 o'clock.  I object to that.  I believe Sunday is different and should be treated differently.  I should prefer no drinking at all on Sundays, but that where there were special circumstances, we could provide within the framework of the Bill for the granting of exemptions.  Nobody objects to <Col N="1290" /> people getting a drink who come up from Cork, Wexford, Kerry or Donegal to see a match in Dublin, or to people getting a drink who go down to matches in Cork, Galway, Kerry or any other part of the country because they are <i>bona fide</i> travellers.  Nobody would object to a Bill providing that district justices could grant exemptions in areas where outstanding sporting events were taking place, or granting exemptions in seaside resorts which cater for large numbers of visitors during particular periods of the year, especially during summer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin spoke about the difficulties that publicans' assistants would undergo if this section were operated. I, too, subscribe to that view, but, like Deputy Larkin, I think the position will be much more difficult for the owner-publicans, the owners of public houses who have to serve drinks on Sundays.  The trade union movement in the city of Dublin has objected to the extension of hours on weekdays and Sundays, and, by reason of the fact that it is an organised body, will probably be able to do something about it.  If there is an extension of the hours, there will probably be a rearrangement of shift work, or compensation will be sought for the extra work involved, but the owner-publican is not in that happy position.  As Deputy Dillon said, if he does not open his public house during hours when he does not want it to be open, it will mean that he will lose a certain amount of business.  On that point, I have the utmost sympathy with the owner-publicans who have to work in their own premises.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Sherwin exaggerated at all when he talked about the effect on dances on Sunday nights.  Despite what has been said, dances are conducted reasonably well on Sunday nights.  I know that is so as far as provincial towns are concerned, though I should say I am not acquainted with the position existing in Dublin.  Further, I do not think Deputy Sherwin gave the impression, as Deputy Davern said, that everyone who drinks on Sunday will start to break up a dance.  The man who is drunk is not dangerous at all.  It is the <Col N="1291" /> fellow who is half drunk who is dangerous.</P>
    <P>Could anybody visualise the situation in dance halls in Dublin, or in provincial towns, if a lot of these young folk who are now termed &ldquo;teddy boys&rdquo;, and who act as &ldquo;teddy boys&rdquo;, patronise dance halls after being put out of public houses at 9 o'clock on Sunday evenings?  I do not say that the majority of people who drink during these hours will behave in that fashion, but one drunk can ruin a dance.  The sober man resents the behaviour and interference of a half drunk, and resents the fact that he comes into a dance hall to cause a row.  Normally, if a row breaks out, it is between one half drunk man and three other sober fellows, and I do not think we can underestimate the damage on this day which we regard as a day for good, clean amusement.</P>
    <P>We also have to have regard to the fact that church services are held between five and nine o'clock on Sunday evenings.  That is a very important aspect of this whole affair, and it is a very important aspect of Irish life.  I do not think it would be unreasonable for this House to proclaim that there should not be any drinking during the time when church services are normally being held.  That is my view and I believe that many Deputies are of the same opinion.</P>
    <P>Members of the Labour Party have a different view from the view I hold, even with regard to that, but at least our Party decided that the proposals in this Bill were a matter of conscience. I regret, and I am sure the country regrets, that Fianna Fáil Deputies have not the same freedom.  I do not blame the individual Deputies for that.  I blame the Front Bench, and the Taoiseach, who told them they could not have consciences in this matter.  That is a deplorable thing.  I do not say that they would reject the Bill if they had their way, but they certainly would change certain sections of it and I am sure they would substantially change the proposals in this section, judging by the speeches they made.</P>
    <P>The Commission did a very important <Col N="1292" /> job of work but the Commission is not as important, or even one-tenth as important, as this House. The people who were on the Commission represented particular interests and to the discredit of the rest of the public, sufficient interest was not taken in that Commission.  There was not one-fiftieth of the submissions made that should have been made by various interests, because, unfortunately, people regarded it as just another commission that either would not report at all or would not report for a long time.</P>

      <P>I just want to make a few brief points on this amendment which I support wholeheartedly.  I think the amendment should be accepted if the Bill is to fulfil its entire purpose.  I understood the purpose of the Bill was to eliminate anomalies and abuses, to provide reasonable extensions and to effect control in such a way that it would have the full force of the law behind it, and the respect of the people in general.  I must compliment the Minister on his judgment and wisdom in the hours he has decided on with regard to the early afternoon opening from 12.30 to 2 o'clock.  For years, I have felt that there would be far less abuse if the licensed houses were opened after last Mass, that there would be no illicit trading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. The evening closing is going to be the Becher's Brook of this Bill.  It is the question that is giving most concern in most parts of the country.  We must realise that in the urban and rural areas, for the first time, the opening on Sunday is being legalised in the hours provided in the Bill.  We do not know how the people will react to that and we would want to be <Col N="1293" /> very cautious and circumspect in regard to limitation of the hours.</P>
      <P>The hours 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. give reasonable scope.  I do not know why the publican should be the slave of the public at all times or why his family cannot have enjoyment or freedom on Sunday evening.  It is the day when people make social calls, when they visit friends, the day when they go to the seaside or to amusements of all kinds.  Are the publicans to remain inside at all times in order to serve the public?  I do not think it is fair to those who are in the trade that that should be the case.</P>
      <P>The traders in the towns and rural areas will be very pleased with the privilege they will get under this Bill with regard to the early afternoon opening on Sunday and would be quite satisfied and happy if they were allowed to open from 5 to 7 in the evening.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish spoke very pointedly in regard to the four hours from 5 to 9 p.m. on Sunday evening.  The person who takes drink for social pleasure need not have anything to worry about in this Bill.  The danger is the man who is inclined to linger on, who is inclined to be an addict.  If he goes into licensed premises at 5 in the evening and stays there until 9, what will his condition be when he leaves? Consider the conditions on the roads and streets to-day.  Will he be capable of going home safely?  If he is in charge of a car, will he be capable of driving it?</P>
      <P>Sunday is the day when people, generally, are free, when they like to have a drink at their leisure.  The publican does not want the man who is called a &ldquo;sitter&rdquo;, who will stay the whole evening.  The publican prefers the person who takes a drink or two with some friends and then leaves and goes about his business.  That kind of customer is most valuable to the publican.  We should not make it possible for those who are the victims of temptation to remain on licensed premises and drink to excess.  Therefore, I support whole-heartedly the amendment to the effect that opening on Sunday evening should be 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</P>

      <P>This section of the Bill, like others, allows room for reasonable disagreement and the amendments put down indicate that there are people of different opinions about the closing hours on Sunday evening.  There are two choices.  There is the amendment proposed by Deputy Belton, which is not accepted.  There is the alternative that they should close at 7.</P>
      <P>As the Bill stands, the opening hours would be from 5 to 8 or from 5 to 9 in the summer months, thereby cutting through what is normally regarded as the tea hour, the time a person normally returns home for an evening meal.  We cannot have it both ways.  On balance, I support the amendments put down here.  While not wishing to be puritanical, we cannot overlook the fact that Sunday is held in a particular regard in this country and we must have regard to that fact in framing legislation.</P>
      <P>We must also have regard to what the normal individual does on a Sunday, whether he lives in the city or in a country area&mdash;not the man who has a car or who can afford to hire a car for the day but the average man with a family.  He takes a Sunday afternoon off and goes to a football or hurling match and, possibly, on the way home goes into a public house and has a few drinks and gets home at a reasonable hour for his tea.  That is how the great majority of family men live and we should legislate to give them a reasonable opportunity of having a few drinks on Sunday afternoon and getting home to their families at a reasonable hour.  The amendment does provide for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the publican has been put forward by Deputy Davern and the loss that the publican will inevitably incur if an hour or an hour and a half is taken off the suggested hours in the Bill.  With all due respect to Deputy Davern, who knows the business better than I do, I do not think that is likely to happen.  I do not think that the difference between closing at 7 and closing at 8 would have such a dire effect on the trade that the hundreds of people he visualises would be thrown out of employment. In the rural areas, where <Col N="1295" /> they do a considerable amount of business on the day of a hurling or football match, the closing hour of 7 would give ample opportunity to a man to have a reasonable number of drinks and to go home at a reasonable hour.  Therefore, by and large, we would be steering a reasonable middle course, in the interests of the rural and the city areas, if the amendment as set out were accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I register a personal note of protest?  Are we not all getting very mealy-mouthed in this House?  When I hear people saying with the utmost possible discretion that Sunday is a day for which there is special feeling in Ireland, I turn to my colleague behind me and say, &ldquo;What is the Third Commandment of the Decalogue?&rdquo;  I am right in saying that it is, &ldquo;Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath Day.&rdquo;  Why should we be so chary about acknowledging the fact that the Lord God Almighty declared to Moses on the Mountain that it behoved us to keep holy the Sabbath Day?  The fact of it is that this House, in its wisdom, has decided in so far as public houses are concerned, to put an end to that Commandment. It makes me shiver, it makes me feel that we are living in another civilisation, that people should regard it as almost indecent to refer to the Ten Commandments in this House any longer.</P>
      <P>We ought, with our eyes wide open, to realise that Dáil Éireann has decided, in its wisdom, when it passes this Bill, that so far as public houses are concerned, that Third Commandment of the Decalogue is to be in some degree abrogated.  There is no use fiddling with that fact and that is the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that Sunday is held in special respect in this country is a reason not peculiar to Ireland.  It is a reason that ought to be a characteristic of the Christian Church the world over.  I shall tell you what is peculiar to Ireland is that this must be one of the last countries in the world in which <Col N="1296" /> we are not ashamed to say it.  What makes me shiver is when I begin to hear the same careful phraseology employed that I expect to hear at an international conference of the United Nations where, of course, to mention the name of the Lord God Almighty is regarded as highly indecent.  Surely we have not reached that level in this country yet?</P>
    <P>We know what we are doing and we are doing it, I presume, with our eyes wide open but, having done it, you should not try to put a cloak of respectability on it by saying that Sunday is a day which has always been held in peculiar regard in this country. Sunday is the day referred to in the Third Commandment of the Decalogue and, if anyone has forgotten that, it is time he bought himself a penny catechism and read it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it was inevitable that there would be some divergence of view here on the opening hours on Sunday afternoon.  Taking the divergence of view that emerged in the discussion of the various aspects of this Bill by the Commission, it is significant that they agreed with the hours in this Bill for the country as a whole.  They made an exception of the county boroughs but the majority report prescribes the hours we are discussing here for Sunday evening opening.  A minority of members of the Commission took the view that these same hours from 5 to 9 p.m. should apply to the country, outside the county boroughs, though why they made an exception of the county boroughs, I am not quite clear. In so far as there seems to be a general view expressed by all sides on the Commission in regard to the country as a whole, it was that the hours set out in the Bill were the most suitable and the most acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the members of the Commission probably had reservations about this matter, just as some Deputies who have spoken here this evening have had reservations and expressed them.  On the other hand, I believe the members of the Commission felt that the hours recommended here were the hours most <Col N="1297" /> likely to succeed in our circumstances. By &ldquo;succeed&rdquo;, I mean the hours most likely to appeal to our people and the hours most likely to be enforced.</P>
    <P>Listening to some Deputies, one would imagine we were, for the first time, opening wide the doors of publichouses on Sunday, whereas in fact there are very substantial legal opening hours on Sundays.  There are the hours of 1 to 7 p.m. in winter time for the <i>bona fide</i> traffic and the hours of 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. in summertime which are now being abolished. In hotels and restaurants throughout the country, on Sundays, you were entitled to drink with meals from 1 to 3 p.m. and from 6 to 9 o'clock every Sunday evening.  In addition to that, as Deputies well know, there were area exemption orders which were widely availed of, particularly in recent years.  Every dog fight throughout the country was made the excuse for obtaining an area exemption order and these area exemption orders were granted because there was the demand of public opinion largely behind them and because people could enjoy the opening hours that were there, that people with cars, for instance, or even people with bicycles could cycle out three miles and, in accordance with the law, get all the drink they wanted while the man on shank's mare was confined to his local town unless he did as many of them did, paid for a seat in a taxi and went out to the local <i>bona fide</i> house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is an area exemption order the same as a general exemption order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The area exemption order would apply only for four hours and would apply on Sundays only to the seven-day licensees.  It was granted generally on the basis of a large influx of people for a football match or some other occasion.  The four hours could be split; you could get it, for instance, for two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon, and so on.  The exemption orders were granted by some justices after 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock, as the case might <Col N="1298" /> be, the closing hour in the evening for <i>bona fide</i> houses.  I often had doubts as to whether justices had power to do so, but some of them, at all events, held that they had such power and you had a situation obtaining that area exemption orders were granted, say, from 8 to 10 on a Sunday evening in certain places, particularly in certain seaside resorts.</P>
      <P>Let us remember that under this Bill we are doing away with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  Therefore, we are closing the doors of the publichouses to the people who, by travelling three miles on a Sunday now, can drink from 1 to 7 p.m. in the winter and 1 to 8 p.m. in the summer.  We are doing away with the area exemption order to which I have referred under which seven-day licensees could open up in towns throughout the length and breadth of the country for a period of four hours. We are doing away with all these facilities that were there and that were enjoyed by the public.  Does anybody suggest that we in this House would be realistic unless we provided reasonable hours as a substitute to cater for the people who enjoy the existing hours?</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish has argued about the extraordinary situation of having all these hours available for drink.  He says 5½ hours are available on Sunday and refers to the tremendous effect that would have.  The Deputy knows very well, if he knows the country, that, even under the existing law, there are many more hours available for drinking, if one wants to drink.  He says a man has these hours free on Sunday that he would not have on other occasions.  All workers, I think, have a half day on one day or other in the week and on that argument it could be suggested that, say, from 1 o'clock on a Saturday, the worker has ten hours in which to drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer to all that is, of course, that nobody will sit down for all these hours that are available for drink. There is a limit, particularly in the case of the workers to whom Deputy Corish referred, that is, the economic limit on the amount they can afford to spend on drink.  If anybody thinks that a law could be enforced that would not provide a reasonable substitute for the drinking hours the <Col N="1299" /> people now enjoy throughout rural Ireland, he does not know the country.</P>
    <P>The case for this amendment has been made on two different lines. Deputy Dillon was putting the case for the amendment solely on the basis of the labour difficulties it would create, on the basis that the barmen with families would not have time to enjoy any family life.  However, Deputy Belton who spoke on the previous amendment has told us that the barmen concerned, in accordance with their union rules, work only every other Sunday.  If there are eight employees, four work on one Sunday and they are off the following Sunday.  If that is the position&mdash;and it was so stated in the House by Deputy Belton &mdash;the case made by Deputy Dillon would not appear to me to be well founded.  There are a number of types of work, trades or employment in which the public must be served and in respect of which the workers have to work unusual hours.  I have no doubt that their unions and the custom of these trades provide for what the unions and the trades consider to be ample leisure but immediately cases spring to mind such as bus workers, catering employees or railway men, all of whom work unusual hours.</P>
    <P>It might be suggested by some people that Deputies have to work unusual hours.  In the catering business &mdash;I take it we must regard public houses as being in the catering business&mdash;workers must serve the public. It is part of their job, and I believe it is a very highly-organised business from the union point of view and that there are very strict union rules for the workers.  Other Deputies have put the case for this amendment on other bases&mdash;some on a religious basis, some on a basis of conscience&mdash;but, taking the hours as recommended by the Commission, by and large, they appear to me to be the nearest thing for which there is any hope of securing full acceptance.  Further, considering that we are doing away with the hours and facilities to which I have already referred, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to try to legislate for lesser hours than those provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>When going into the arguments as <Col N="1300" /> to the desirability of uniformity, I should like the House also to remember that when we are doing away with exemption orders, we must aim at a law in this section that will be suitable for all parts of the country or as near as we can get to it.  We have an existing law in Dublin and the county boroughs fixing the hours from 5 to 7 p.m. and we have difficulties in rural areas and towns throughout rural Ireland in catering for the people coming from football matches or other sports functions.  We have a demand for longer hours in seaside places and some, of course, would prefer hours to be even longer than are prescribed in the Bill.  There is a multiplicity of varying local needs throughout the land and we must aim at providing in this Bill hours that will be generally suitable, so far as we can, for all the citizens.</P>
    <P>When we consider that we are doing away with exemption orders and <i>bona fide</i> traffic&mdash;which, it is generally agreed, should be done away with&mdash; I think the nearest we can go to something generally suitable for every part of the country is to fix the hours prescribed in the Bill.  For these reasons, the amendment is not acceptable to the Government.</P>

      <P>This amendment could be described as consequential on amendment No. 10.  Under the law as it stands, Section 13 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, hotels and restaurants are allowed to serve drink with a substantial meal between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.  As the Bill, as introduced, proposed to allow general opening of all licensed premises, including hotels and restaurants, between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., it was unnecessary to link the provision that hotels and restaurants could serve drink with a meal during that period. We have now provided that the period of general opening should end at 2 p.m.  Accordingly, this amendment is necessary to preserve the existing condition that hotels and restaurants can serve drink with a meal up to 3 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

Secondly, it provides that the meal must be consumed at the same time as the liquor is consumed and that they are taken in the same part of the premises.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I might invite the attention of the Ceann Comhairle to the text of the Bill, on page 5.  The amendment reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 18, after &ldquo;any Sunday&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, between the hours of two o'clock and three o'clock in the afternoon, or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are those words meant to come in before &ldquo;during the months of June, July, August and September, between the hours of nine o'clock and 10 o'clock in the evening...&rdquo;?  If they are, the section does not seem to make <Col N="1308" /> any sense at all.  I gather that the amendment is now designed to make the section read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;13....</P>
    <P>(b)  on St. Patrick's Day or, unless his licence is a six-day licence, any Sunday between the hours of two o'clock and three o'clock in the afternoon, or</P>
    <P>(i)  during the months of June, July, August and September, between the hours of nine o'clock and ten o'clock in the evening, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  during any other month, between the hours of eight o'clock and ten o'clock in the evening....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That does not make sense to me.  Does the subsection, if amended in that way, make any sense to the Minister?  It is a matter of grammar.  Is it right that it is in line 18 these words are being inserted?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It reads exactly as the Deputy has just mentioned, that after the words &ldquo;any Sunday&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;between the hours of 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock in the afternoon&rdquo;.  Then we go to subsection (i) &ldquo;during the months of June, July, August and September between the hours of nine o'clock and ten o'clock in the evening&rdquo;. That is giving them the extra hour in the evening to serve a meal also after the normal closing time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The hour finishes at nine o'clock.  On Sunday the hours are from five to nine and from nine o'clock, they can continue for an extra hour up to ten o'clock.  During that hour, the hotels and restaurants can serve drinks with a substantial meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point which I think needs elucidation.  The Minister said that a meal such as he has in mind will have to be served in the restaurant and cannot be consumed in the bar even in an hotel which has both a bar and a restaurant. That certainly is not clear from the section in the Bill.  The section provides that: <Col N="1309" />&ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall operate to prohibit the holder of an on-licence in respect of premises which are for the time being an hotel or restaurant from supplying intoxicating liquor to any person on the premises or from permitting intoxicating liquor to be consumed on the premises.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But there are quite a number of hotels which have a public bar.  The section, as it stands, would not necessarily mean that the meal would have to be consumed in the restaurant.  Apart from that, this section would appear to penalise those publicans who are developing the food end of their business which is a development that ought to be encouraged.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that now, Sir.  The effect of the amendment would be to give an advantage to hotels and restaurants and to penalise those public houses which would serve what might indeed be a more substantial meal than can be got in any hotel or restaurant.  It is the experience of many that the best mid-day meal at a reasonable price can be obtained at a public bar.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be under a misapprehension.  There is, in fact, no change being made in the law as far as hotels and restaurants are concerned except in so far as this amendment becomes necessary as a result of No. 10.  Heretofore, you were allowed to have drink served with meals in hotels during the closing hour in the middle of the day.  Perhaps the Deputy would read the end of that section.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> if, in each case the intoxicating liquor is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  ordered by that person at the same time as a substantial meal is ordered by him,</P>
    <P>(ii)  consumed at the same time as and with the meal,</P>
    <P>(iii)  supplied and consumed in the portion of the premises usually set apart for the supply of meals.</P>
    <P>I think that makes what we are saying quite clear.  This facility, if I may put it that way, had already been in existence before this Bill was brought in.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister clarify this point?  I have in mind the case of an establishment where meals are supplied at the counter, barbecued meals and adjoining this room there is a bar proper.  Would it be possible, under the Bill, for the owner of the premises, if he discontinued, as he would be required to do, the sale of intoxicating liquor in the bar proper, to serve intoxicating liquor with a meal at the counter as he is doing at present in an adjoining room?</P>

      <P>The bar or hotel must close in conformity with the law, the same as an ordinary public house, but it has been granted the facility of serving drink with a meal during that closed hour.  As the Minister for Lands has already pointed out, this facility existed in previous licensing laws. Then, it was from one to three and also from six to nine, so that we are not making any change.  The only reason we have to bring in this amendment at all is that we have changed the hour in the Bill, which was one o'clock on a Sunday, to 12.30.  Now to conform with the rest of the Bill, we may have to make other consequential changes. That is really all we are doing.</P>

      <P>I feel we are overlooking the fact that substantial meals are being served in licensed premises, the owners of which have gone to very great expense.  The meal is a substantial one.  It is not just a hamburger. It is high-class food.  The room is not necessarily a separate one.  Consequently, while you can have a full course meal, the place would not be considered a licensed restaurant.  Hence a grave disadvantage immediately arises.</P>
      <P>A number of these establishments have been set up at very great expense for the convenience of the public.  I can speak with some degree of certainty in regard to these places.  For a long number of years, even since 1927, there are places where substantial hot meals, from menus, are supplied.  Admittedly, they have the kitchens and all the equipment but they are still bar premises.  They are probably the most popular eating places for businessmen.</P>

      <P>On the section, I think a good deal of what has been said might more properly be said now.  I fully appreciate that it is not reasonable to ask the Minister across the House if this is a substantial meal or if that is a substantial meal but it would be of assistance to the House if the Minister could give us a decision on that express question, which we are raising, from the case law as <Col N="1314" /> it exists for a definition of &ldquo;a substantial meal&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I want to get at.  The Minister for Lands says that there have been examples of cases where meals have been deemed not to be substantial and others where they were deemed to be substantial.  The reason the section is being questioned is to give Deputies time to consider whether they should put down amendments on Report Stage.  I think if we had a little more information as to what the Bench has said about substantial meals then we might be in a position to make the law much more watertight.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, some of these decisions are in conflict with one another.  We are trying to make it more regular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the utter impossibility of writing into legislation what &ldquo;a substantial meal&rdquo; is.  It might depend upon where a man might be, in what country he might be.  If a man is in China, I imagine a dish of rice might be a substantial meal, or when the German soldiers were arriving over Crete some type of pill might have been a substantial meal for them.  At all events, we have decided that a sandwich served with a drink is not a substantial meal and indeed the courts, <Col N="1315" /> speaking from recollection, naturally would not consider solely just what is in front of a man.  The court would take other circumstances into consideration, how he got there, where he came from, and so on, in deciding whether in fact what he was consuming could be regarded as a substantial meal at the particular time.  A substantial meal would be decided, I am sure, to be what we all regard as a substantial meal.  The nearest I can get to it is to say that a snack would not cover one from the point of view of the law, nor would a sandwich cover one, and that a substantial meal would be something we all regard as a main meal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on what Deputy Sherwin has rightly said, is there not the possibility that if a person gets a bottle of stout and eats fish and chips off a plate in a hotel, that may be regarded as a substantial meal.  If however, a man cannot afford to go into a costly hotel and instead eats fish and chips out of his hand and has a bottle of stout with them, he may be told he is not having a substantial meal because it is not on a gilt-edged plate.  That is the difficulty that the members of the Opposition are trying to resolve.  I think it would be desirable that an effort should be made to define &ldquo;substantial meal&rdquo; in this Bill if the draftsman can do it. The section is getting away from the point raised here that we ought to encourage what is known as the pub or common bar to serve substantial meals.  The section compels the publican, even if he is serving a very substantial meal, to close while it allows the restaurant or hotel across the street to remain open at any time on any day of the week.  I believe that is undesirable.  I can see that there are difficulties in that, for the time being, the majority of publicans are not serving meals.  It would be desirable if some method could be provided in the Bill to encourage publicans to serve substantial meals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section clearly is to allow a person who is having a meal, wherever he is having it, to have a bottle of stout with it.  My objection is that it allows him to have that substantial meal only in a hotel or restaurant.  If he is having a substantial meal anywhere, even at a pub counter, I believe he should be allowed to have a bottle of stout with it.  Many pubs have rooms which are not commonly drinking rooms but which in fact are occupied only for that portion of the day in which people are consuming meals. However, under this section, the Minister argues that they be not permitted to serve meals or drink in such rooms, although even under the subsection to which he refers provided the meals are supplied in premises usually set apart for the supply of meals, they may be consumed.  Perhaps I should not encourage the Minister to apply a restriction which the district justice might feel did not apply to such rooms in public bars, but there are plenty of premises which have separate rooms or extra accommodation to cover meal times.  I believe we ought to encourage those and not penalise them as we are under this section.</P>

I think we can safely leave it to <Col N="1317" /> the courts to decide what a substantial meal is.  In fact, it hardly ever arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that attitude is quite fair to the courts.  The Minister has pointed out the difficulty Deputies have in deciding what a substantial meal is. He says the courts can do it without any great difficulty.  Surely the reason is simply that the courts have a set of facts before them in a particular case and the word of the court in the matter is law.  It is not a question of having to discuss the thing inside out, as we have to here, and come to a decision as to what should in ordinary circumstances be regarded as a substantial meal or what, on the other hand, should be regarded as a snack, to use the phrase of the Minister for Lands.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty. My own view is that you cannot go any great distance with a definition.  If the Minister assures me that both himself and his officials have endeavoured to see if a definition could be given and have come to the conclusion that it could not, I am prepared to accept that.  However, I do appreciate the point of view of Deputies who put forward the case that, if it is possible to find a definition, this is the place to find it and now is the time to find it.  The Minister should at least let us know whether he has specifically directed his mind and the mind of his officials to the question of the necessity of endeavouring to give a definition, if a definition can be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Really, a Leas-Cheann <Col N="1318" /> Comhairle, I must enter a demurrer here.  There are certain principles which we must vindicate in this House. I think the Minister has got this back to front.  A judicial decision stands until reversed by a superior court. There is no other court capable of reversing a decision of Oireachtas Éireann.  A decision of Oireachtas Éireann stands unless repealed or altered by Oireachtas Éireann.  If we define a substantial meal, no one can change it except us.  If any court defines a substantial meal, only a superior court can reverse it or we can reverse it by legislation of this House. No court can reverse us by a decision.</P>
      <P>However, to tell the truth, my sympathy goes out to the Minister because when I look on my left and see my colleague, Deputy Blowick, and when I look across at Deputy Loughman and think of an unfortunate district justice being confronted with a prosecution of the pair of them lunching together and having to decide what is a substantial meal, I confess that, like the Minister, I should find myself, were I upon the Bench, at a loss to make a decision in that specific case.  If that difficulty presents itself among our very colleagues in this House, when we look at the universality of men in this country, and women too, I agree that to define a substantial meal and to apply that definition to everybody is beyond the possible skill of any draftsman, unless you take up the position of arbitrarily deciding that the test shall be that the meal costs more than the drink.  But that is not something I would recommend because it would give rise to an infinity of fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An arbitrary rule of that kind would be a way out of your problem, but that just begets fraud.  There is no use legislating in such a way as to set a premium on fraud.  I think there probably is no way out of the dilemma except that of adopting the practical principles of common law as to what one should reasonably regard as a substantial meal, conceding at once that, in the exceptional circumstances I envisage, it would require a Solomon to give a satisfactory judgment.  But then, unlike the Minister, I rejoice in <Col N="1319" /> the fact that such judicial decisions are not irreversible.  If that falls short of equity and justice it can always be referred to a superior court for review. In the last analysis, we are here to put the judiciary right, if that necessity should arise.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Dillon inasmuch as I do see a way out of this difficulty.  On the introduction of this Bill, the Minister stated it was proposed to create uniformity in the trade and to do away with differentials in trading.  By the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade I suggest the Bill will create another one and a more difficult one to combat.  I think the way out of this difficulty is for restaurants, hotels and so forth, to close their public drinking places at the same hour.  In that way the difficulty will be very easily overcome.</P>

      <P>The Bill, as introduced, gave effect to the recommendations of the Commission that, in the matter of hours of trading, clubs should be put on the same basis as licensed premises generally, with the same right as hotels to serve drink with meals.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention, if it is in order, to put down an amendment for Report Stage.  In the city of Dublin, general exemption orders are given.  At the moment, they apply in relation to the cattle market, the vegetable market and the Port of Dublin.  It is understandable that exemption orders of a sort are required for a substantial market, such as the cattle market and, to a lesser degree, the vegetable market, but, unfortunately, these places are seldom availed of by the people for whom the special exemption order is granted. It is more common to see people in dress suits in these places in the mornings rather than the people who go there to sell or buy cattle or vegetables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little more concerned with the recent granting of special exemption orders for the dock area of Dublin.  When a licensee found a <Col N="1323" /> loophole in the last Licensing Act, many people thought that he had hit on something worthwhile.  That was the case until every other publican in the district decided to apply for a similar licence and what was a most lucrative business for one public house became a millstone around the necks of the others.</P>
    <P>The terms of the amendment which I propose to put down are that where licensees are granted a special exemption order from, say, 7.30 a.m., they should, in turn, be obliged to close their premises at 7.30 p.m., in other words, that each licenced house should have the same number of hours' trading.</P>
    <P>Awkward situations have arisen in regard to the grant of these licences because it is at the discretion of the justice to decide where the sphere of influence of dock labour commences and ends.  One licenced house could avail of a special exemption order, while another premises across the street or next door would fail to get such a licence.  It is wrong that legislation should be passed by the House which would give one trader an unfair advantage over another in the same business or in the same area.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister could see his way to agree to the terms of the amendment I have submitted for Report Stage, that a trader who is granted a special exemption order in respect of the morning will be required to close at a corresponding hour at night, so that he will have the same number of hours' trading as publicans who keep to the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to some extent with what Deputy Belton has said, but I think the way he suggests of dealing with the problem is not the right one.  It is only a year or so ago that applications were made in the dock area for early opening and these special exemption orders apply to a great extent in dockland.  The sensible thing to do in this case is to charge a very heavy licence fee.  I cannot speak of the cattle markets but I do know that in dockland and the Ringsend area, there is definitely a demand for early opening but only for a limited number of houses.  If a licence fee, say, <Col N="1324" /> of £100 a year were charged in respect of special exemption orders only a limited number of houses would avail of them to supply a very definite need and it would not interfere with the basic principles of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I suggest that Deputy Belton might think along those lines and the Minister might consider introducing a heavy licence fee.  The figure I would suggest is £100 a year.  That would solve the problem created by a lot of houses having a licence and not using it except on rare occasions and making things impossible for houses which are providing soup, sandwiches and meals for early morning workers and people returning from shift work.  It would ensure the provision of those facilities. That would be the better way to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I agree with Deputy Lemass in that but I do not think he realises the difficulties that would have to be overcome. According to the law, the licence fee is determined on the Poor Law Valuation of the house.  The Minister would have to bring in amendments to place the licence fee payable on a public house on a similar basis to the basis on which hotels pay a licence fee, namely, on the sales of liquor rather than on the Poor Law Valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly what Deputy Lemass has in mind is a special stamp upon the application, which is a different matter and which, if my memory serves me aright, was raised to £3 during the past few years.</P>
      <P>Provisions to cater for this class of person have existed for a very long time.  These provisions are made to cater for fairs and markets and, in some instances for fishermen.  This section is brought in here merely to remove a doubt as to the life of the particular exemption order, as to whether it ends at the annual licensing court or goes on.  A doubt was raised in some quarters.  This law is a very old law and my personal view of the matter is that I do not think it would be right that a special fee such as has been suggested should be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not really a question of <Col N="1325" /> providing particular facilities for publicans.  This law is designed to cater for certain classified workers or people employed in a particular trade.  These are the people who must be considered.  Furthermore, I could not visualise how a district justice would operate if he were to confine early opening orders, for instance, to one or two houses on fair days in a country town or to one or two houses to cater for this particular trade in the immediate vicinity of where these people work. The people in the trade who apply for these facilities do so because there is a demand from their customers or the people for whom they cater for these facilities.  Otherwise, they would not apply.  I think that rule, by and large, will still be followed and that only those people who normally cater for this kind of business will take advantage of this law.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the law has been in existence for a very long time. There is a necessity for it.  Of course, it may be true to say that where there are special opening hours, the odd person for whom the hours were not designed may take advantage of them but you cannot legislate against that.  It happens all over the world. I have read recently that in London under the different rules in force, you may drink during the 24 hours of the day if you wish.  This law has been operated throughout the country at fairs and fishing ports for a very long time and there would be no mention of it in this Bill except that it was necessary to remove certain doubts as to the operation of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton and I seem to be worried about the same problem.  Unfortunately, I have not got the statistics, but I am sure the number of early opening premises in the city area, particularly in dockland, has increased almost ten times in the past couple of years.  They have got this general exemption order and that is what has brought about this situation which I do not think it was ever intended should develop.  It is hard to legislate against people taking advantage of a law that was not intended to <Col N="1326" /> cater for them.  If the special stamp on the licence could apply to urban areas only, that would not interfere with the case the Minister has made in respect of rural Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister has heard the complaint which has been mentioned to me, that these general exemption orders in respect of the vegetable and fruit markets were originally made to provide for licensed houses in the adjoining streets.  Then they began to go down Capel Street; then the district justices went around the corner and began to give them down Ormond Quay until a larger area was taken in, parts of which it was very hard to relate to the actual area which it was originally designed to serve.</P>
      <P>When this problem was presented to me by the persons interested in this matter, I could not elicit from them, nor have I been able to think of one myself, any means whereby the Oireachtas could fix an inflexible limit.  If you admit the principle of these exemption orders at all, I do not think we have any alternative but to leave it to the district justice hoping that, having gone down Ormond Quay, he will not cross the Liffey.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that it is the courts who grant these orders, and I do not think we can dispute their right to do that.  One thing I can assure the House is that as far as this type of house is concerned in Dublin, the police keep a very strict watch over them.  So far, they have found nothing in the nature of abuse and I can only assume these houses are serving a public purpose, especially around the dock areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the same thing is happening around the market areas, that is, Smithfield, the fishmarket, the vegetable market and these other markets contiguous to Smithfield.  However, from the point of view of law and order, they are being conducted in a <Col N="1327" /> way that satisfies the police authorities and so far they have raised no objection to the operation of these premises in the manner which the law permits.</P>

      <P>I recognise there is a problem here and, as Deputy Dillon and the Minister have said, it is largely a problem which must be tackled by the courts.  When a question is raised in Committee on a Bill of this sort, we must try to find a solution for the problem in the Dáil.  I think I am correct in saying these general exemption orders are granted under the Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1927.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Long before 1927, a problem in relation to public houses generally was tackled by the Act of 1902 which clamped down on the number of new licences which could be issued under Section 4 of the Intoxicating Liquor (Ireland) Act of 1902.  I am wondering, if the suggestions made by Deputy Belton or Deputy Lemass do not recommend themselves to the Minister, if it would not be worth considering, in relation to the general exemption order houses, the same kind of clamping down as was done in the 1902 Act in regard to public houses generally.  We might consider the position as at a particular date and say that, unless there is an increase in the number of people requiring facilities in an area, there will be no increase in the general exemption orders granted for that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the approach to the problem of too many public houses in the 1902 Act was that the Legislature then said you could not get a new licence unless you extinguished an existing licence and, in addition, unless you proved there was a 25 per cent. increase in population in the civil parish in which the licence was being sought.  My suggestion is that you could tackle this problem in a somewhat similar manner, that these general exemption orders may only be granted if the court is satisfied that they are both <Col N="1328" /> necessary and desirable in order to cater for people using markets or fairs or in connection with some other calling, trade or business which required them to be in an area or locality at a time when the ordinary licensing hours do not suit them.</P>
    <P>There are areas in the city where it was necessary and desirable, in the view of the court, that these additional facilities should be granted, as the Minister for Lands rightly pointed out, not to the publican but to the users of the markets or fairs, the wharves or the docks.  If there is an abuse, the Minister could look into the question on the basis of clamping down on the granting of further exemption orders for those areas, unless an applicant is in a position to prove that there is some extension of the use of those areas during the off licensing hours. In addition to the present requirements, an applicant should be able to prove there has been an increase in the user in those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>These are very interesting and important points and I undertake to have them examined.  All the points which have been raised on this Bill, and in regard to which strong opinions have been expressed, will be examined with a view to seeing if it is necessary to take any action in regard to them.  The subsection that we are bringing in is intended to cure an ill by making these licensees apply annually for a general exemption order.  From that point of view, I have no doubt that the courts when they are examining the application will take into account the desirability of granting orders only to suitable applicants. As far as we are concerned, we have never had any evidence that there were too many of these premises: while we have had occasional suggestions to that effect no one has ever supplied evidence by letter or word of mouth and, from that point of view, we are unaware of the fact, as has been suggested here by some of the Deputies, that there are too many licensed premises with general exemption orders.  If the licensees apply to the court and the court grants the order we cannot interfere with the decision of the court.  I cannot say whether <Col N="1329" /> there is any truth in the statement that there are too many of these premises. We can, perhaps, look them up and see what the number is.  I cannot say what number of premises we have serving this purpose at the moment but we can certainly look into the matter.</P>

      <P>The Teachers' Salaries Committee, which was appointed on 8th December, 1958, has not yet submitted its report.  I understand that the report is at present in course of preparation.  Pending receipt of the report, I do not think it would be proper for me to furnish the further information requested by the Deputy.</P>
