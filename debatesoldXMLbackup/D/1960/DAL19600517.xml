    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what staff and machinery are available for stamping deeds in the Stamp Office, Dublin Castle; whether there are any substantial delays at the Stamp Office counter; if so, the causes thereof, and if the delays could be eliminated by the provision of additional staff or machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question relates only to the <Col N="1303" /> facilities provided for persons who wish to have their documents stamped while they wait.  Two officers are available for checking the amount of the duty in these cases, and marking it on the documents to be stamped. One officer, who operates a single stamping press, is available for the actual stamping of the documents.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question on the 23rd March last, I explained that the limited accommodation available on the present site of the Stamping Office does not allow of any extension of the existing facilities, and that delays occur when large numbers of callers present themselves at the same time.  Better provision for personal callers is being made in the plans now under consideration for the building of new premises for the Stamping Office.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Revenue Commissioners are taking all possible steps to reduce delays to a minimum. Assistance is being provided for the Stamper so as to enable him to deal more quickly with the documents presented to him, and assistance will also be provided for the Marking Officers if it should become necessary. It is hoped that these measures will result in a substantial improvement, but the position will, in any event, be kept under constant review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  Take the question that is asked here; the Minister purported to say that he would not usurp the functions of the Film Censor.  I want to suggest that the Censor has no function in this case, and it is on the question that he has no function it is suggested that the Minister might consider it desirable to intervene in a case where he was satisfied that a film was being generally disseminated without notice to the public that it was Soviet propaganda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that the Censor has no power under the Act to deal with the defect that we allege against this film, even if he knew it was pure Soviet propaganda?

      <P>No, Sir.  I submit I am making no argument.  The Minister says he would not arrogate to himself the function of the Censor and I asked him is it not true that the Censor has no function in the situation outlined in the question.  The Minister says he agrees with me that the Censor has no function.  Then I asked him if, in these special circumstances, seeing the Censor has no power to correct what is wrong, does the Minister for Justice think that the matter at least should be investigated as to whether he should not take powers to indelibly mark as Soviet propaganda films of this kind, if he does not decide to prohibit them altogether?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervened in this debate for the purpose of taking advantage of the concluding statement of the Parliamentary Secretary.  He stated that his was a factual statement and that if Deputies wished him to elucidate any matters he would be only too glad to do so.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he can give me information as to when operations will commence on the drainage of the Deale.  About two years ago a survey was carried out and I am satisfied that it was completed. The scheme is still in the hands of the Office of Public Works.  We are anxious to get a clear indication as to when work will commence in the area. Up to now it has been in the pigeon holes of the Office of Public Works <Col N="1323" /> and has not been exhibited or advertised.</P>
      <P>I should also like to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that, in regard to the priority list compiled by the Drainage Commission, the people in county Limerick are at a loss to understand why the Rivers Deale and Maigue were relegated to 11th or 14th place.  We may not, of course, question their judgment in that matter but other catchment areas that had not the same claim have been drained. There is no comparison between the catchment areas of the Moy, the Corrib, the Brosna and those of the Deale and the Maigue.  There would be some similarity between the Feale, the Deale and the Maigue but I cannot see that there would be any comparison between the areas already drained and the areas to which I have referred. In the catchment area of the Deale there is the finest land in Munster, the average valuation of which would be about £30 an acre.  The average valuation per acre in the Maigue catchment area would be about the same.</P>
      <P>The great amount of money spent over the years on land reclamation is much appreciated.  It was expended for the sole purpose of improving the land and bringing the maximum amount of land into production.  In the catchment areas of the Deale and the Maigue there is land which is second to none in the world but which has been subject to severe flooding down the years.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is replying, to assure me, so as to satisfy the people in my constituency, that there was not any fiddling within the last nine or ten years with the priority list.  I do not believe there was, except in one case which was brought to my notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question which I asked about eight or nine months ago, the Parliamentary Secretary assured me that the survey of the Maigue would be undertaken without any undue delay.  When he is replying, I should like him to give me some clear indication as to when that survey will commence.  These are the two points I wished to bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I should like him to elaborate further <Col N="1324" /> and to give more information concerning these schemes.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to another type of drainage which is being transferred from the Department of Local Government under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  He said that for want of a better name he would classify this scheme under the heading &ldquo;intermediate rivers&rdquo;.  By that, he meant small independent catchments with clear outfalls which were not included in the original lists of the other general schemes.  I should like to know what progress, if any, has been made in implementing this scheme of intermediate rivers, side by side with the major and minor catchment schemes already listed.</P>
    <P>Deputies from West Limerick are very interested in an intermediate scheme at Mellon and Pallaskenry which very seriously affects the agricultural activities and productivity of many farmers in that area.  This is quite independent of the catchment area of the Deale and the Maigue.  It is classified as having a separate outfall into the river Shannon.  We have a unified opinion and unified action on that scheme.  In West Limerick, we are very proud of it and Deputy Jones, Deputy Ó Briain and I have already submitted to the Department that this scheme should be examined at the earliest possible moment.  It is very important.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to bring home to the Parliamentary Secretary.  He said that there are 28 major catchment area schemes.  He said:</P>
    <P>Of the 28 major catchments, schemes for three have been completed, works are in progress in three others, and seven more are at various stages of survey and design.  Two minor schemes have been finished, one is in hands and four are at the survey or design stage.</P>
    <P>I know that Rome was not built in a day but surely to goodness the Office of Public Works has had well-oiled machinery to put the 1945 Drainage Act into operation since 1950, and it is not very creditable that from 1950 &mdash;ten years ago&mdash;to 1960, only three <Col N="1325" /> major catchment areas have been drained.  Three have been completed; three more are in progress; and seven are at various stages of survey and design.  Only two minor schemes have been finished; one is in hands; and four are at the survey or design stage. I believe that more could and should have been done over the years with regard to arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask since the implementation of the land rehabilitation scheme, or the Land Project as it is called, what amount of State money, of the taxpayers' money, has been spent since 1950 primarily and solely for the purpose of improving agricultural land.  The 1945 Act is second to none in any democratic European country.  We should be proud of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, but still we hear from the Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing this Vote, that only three major catchment areas have been drained.  I do not want to repeat myself&mdash;repetition is not allowed&mdash;but I know a tremendous amount of money has been spent under the headings I have mentioned, and still in the heart of the Golden Vale in county Limerick, the lands of the best dairy farmers in the world&mdash;they are second to none&mdash;are still subject to flooding.  I should like to emphasise again that there is a feeling abroad in Limerick&mdash; I am sure it is not correct&mdash;that there was some fiddling or interference with the order of priority and when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying I should like him to clarify the position in that respect.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the intermediate rivers which have been handed over to the Office of Public Works now from the Department of Local Government.  Four is the number mentioned in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement as the number of schemes about to be put into operation in 1960. To my mind, more schemes are necessary for the success of the land reclamation scheme as a whole because several schemes are held up due to lack of outfall where such rivers need to be drained in order to add to the value and the productivity of the land.</P>
    <P>There is, also, to my mind, undue delay in the Office of Public Works.  I <Col N="1326" /> was told some time ago that the Office of Public Works is a bullet-proof machine.  If that is so, it is the duty of every Deputy to keep sniping at that bullet-proof machine to ensure that what could be done and should be done will be done as expeditiously as possible.  I know a lot of blame is directed at the Office of Public Works which I feel is unjustified, but, during the years I have been here&mdash;ten or 12 or some such period&mdash;I have had personal experience of delays which I thought should not have been so prolonged.</P>
    <P>I know if we had to face another emergency in this country how quickly we could gear up every Department&mdash; the Office of Public Works, Defence and all the other Departments&mdash;to deal with whatever menace or emergency faced us.  One thing will always stand to the credit of the Office of Public Works, that is, that their one fundamental idea&mdash;and they are probably right to some extent&mdash;is that they will not make a mistake, but they are painfully slow in arriving at decisions and painfully slow in other matters and we as the representatives of the people in a democratic Parliament would like to see them going ahead faster.</P>
    <P>As I said, there is a feeling that the Office of Public Works is a bullet-proof machine and that they work as they like.  Some Deputies are of the opinion that they can make very little headway with that Office.  I cannot say that.  I find they are a bit slow in arriving at decisions in many cases.  There are schemes for schools in West Limerick before the Office at the moment, and I should like to see them expedited as much as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to hold up the Parliamentary Secretary any longer, but I should like him to clear up the point about the priority placing of the River Deale, and I should like to hear him say that it was not interfered with by No.  So-and-So on the list.  That scheme should be put into operation as quickly as possible.  Apart from its value to the dairy farmers of the area, it would be of immense help to the whole country.  I further ask <Col N="1327" /> him to give me some clear indication as to when the survey of the Maigue catchment areas will be undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at somewhat of a loss to understand why Deputy Collins describes the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act as the greatest instrument of democratic legislation in Europe since the net result is that we have only got three arterial drainage areas done in the past 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I meant the basis of the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act was as good as there is in any country in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about the basis.  The basis can be beautiful but it is the superstructure I am concerned with.  You can have a lovely basis if you like, but if you never build anything on it, it is a waste of time and public money.  I find myself more in sympathy with Deputy Collins when he deplores the slow and awkward procedure for getting any drainage work done.  It is something for which we have to rebuke ourselves, that in 15 years we have only three catchment areas dealt with, at a time when rural unemployment has been very acute, with thousands leaving the land and when any work we could provide in rural Ireland would be very valuable. Here there appears to me to be highly remunerative work at which a great number of people could have been profitably employed and the drift from the land very materially reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tried to get a great deal more drainage work done when I had some voice in the matter.  One of the places the survey for which was pigeon-holed when the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor took office was the River Dromore in county Monaghan.  I believe he has a complete survey of that river in his office.  All he has to do is to blow the whistle and the drainage on that catchment could proceed forthwith.  I do not know why he does not do it.  I cannot claim that it is situate in rich and fertile land as is <Col N="1328" /> the river to which Deputy Collins referred.  It is not.  It is situate in relatively poor land where the farmers are small farmers with very small holdings and the flooding of their holdings constitutes an annual disaster for them.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to tell us that he is not content with the beautiful foundations but is resolved to build a handsome superstructure and that part of that superstructure will consist of the drainage of the Dromore river in Monaghan.  That concession to the small farmers of Monaghan is long overdue.  However, I do not want to challenge the Parliamentary Secretary without publicly recording what I know, too, is correct.</P>
    <P>I directed the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to an ancient monument which for many years was neglected and which I thought stood in very real danger.  To his credit, the matter was immediately taken up with the appropriate division of his Department, the monument was scheduled and is now under protection.  I refer to the ancient crowning place of the O'Connors in Roscommon which I think was largely lost sight of.  It is now scheduled as an ancient monument and will be given a measure of protection.  The Parliamentary Secretary is entitled to get credit for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the clock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter. It is the story of the clock on Government Buildings, three faces of which have been going for the past 20 years and the fourth face of which has been at 12 o'clock for 20 years.  I ventured to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to that anomaly.  I am obliged to record that, within a month&mdash;after, I understand, a sanguinary struggle within the Office of Public Works which involved several other Departments&mdash;the matter was rectified and the fourth face of the clock is now recording.  That is something on which I must heartily congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want seriously to say to the Parliamentary <Col N="1329" /> Secretary that to the people of County Monaghan the Dromore river is a very urgent matter.  It is one which I think he ought to look into and attend to.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the National Monuments Grants.  I think many people do not fully understand what is happening.  Every other country in the world is intensely solicitous to preserve its own national monuments which stretch back into the early history of the nation.  Few people in this country realise that, archaeologically, it is estimated that this is the richest country in Europe and that no adequate survey has ever been made of it.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department of Agriculture I wanted to get an aerial survey made of the whole country primarily to facilitate the design of drainage works but, incidentally, to make available to the National Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Work an aerial survey of our archaeological remains.  I speak from memory here, but the Parliamentary Secretary can check what I say.  I got a test survey done on Croghan in County Roscommon.  If you take what is called the peripatetic survey of the Ordnance Survey you will find marked on it about seven archaeological sites in the Croghan area. When we made the aerial survey, we found revealed I think 40 archaeological sites.</P>
    <P>The great danger is that by inadvertence many of these sites will be extinguished by ordinary agricultural operations.  The only thing that has saved Croghan so long&mdash; and Croghan may be a more important site than Tara&mdash;is that a variety of circumstances has created a situation in which that part of Roscommon has largely been a sheep walk for many years.  However, as the sheep walks are divided up into economic holdings for small farmers, tillage operations will tend more and more to encroach upon that archaeological area and a great deal of very treasured history may disappear unrecorded.</P>
    <P>The National Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works has at <Col N="1330" /> its disposal each year a sum of £6,000. With that amount, it is utterly impossible to make any impression whatever on the volume of work that ought to be done if we are to do it before the march of time extinguishes these remains.  It is interesting to observe that in the staff provided for the National Monuments Branch there is one archaeologist (unestablished).  His remuneration amounts to £1,000 a year without pension.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the archaeological remains of the kind I have described at Croghan, there are situated all over the country a number of old abbeys, castles and other early buildings associated with the pre-Norman period in this country.  There is grave danger that these will disappear.  I know of one case in my experience, though this was not pre-Norman but post-Norman, where the castle of the O'Garas, in which the Annals of the Four Masters were largely written, very nearly disappeared.  It was being rapidly carted away and incorporated in cow houses and walls and being broken up and spread on the roads until we eventually succeeded in getting it scheduled under the appropriate Act. It is now a protected monument but before that was done very material damage had been done to it.</P>
    <P>I make the case on the merits of preserving these buildings and archaeological remains for our own benefit but if that argument is not sufficient to carry conviction to the Minister for Finance to the point of persuading him to make sufficient money available, a powerful case could be made from the point of view of tourist revenue.  If you bring a group of French people, a group of Spaniards or a group of Americans to this country and you show them the Norman remains of which there are a good many in the form of old castles and so forth, you will frequently hear them ask the question: &ldquo;Are there no archaeological remains of buildings related to the period prior to the Norman invasion of this country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, history has it to tell that there are very few such left because during the seven centuries of <Col N="1331" /> the struggle in this country most of the pre-Norman structures disappeared but there are some, and some of great beauty such as those at Cashel.  Cashel happens to be a great assembly of such remains but scattered all over the country there are others and it is simply not physically possible for the staff of the National Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works with the resources available to them to survey them, much less to protect them.</P>
    <P>I want to urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary that out of a Vote of £634,550 we ought to be able to find more than £6,000 for the protection of a national treasure which is being annually dissipated.  The tragedy of it is that, once dissipated, nothing can bring it back.  The Parliamentary Secretary already has a voluntary body to assist him called, I think, the National Monuments Advisory Council. I am prepared to leave in their hands the aesthetic question of whether we ought to put roofs on some of those old buildings or whether we ought to take restorative measures to protect them from further deterioration.  There can be valid arguments on both sides to that question.  Many European countries do not hesitate to carry out certain restoration work on ancient buildings of that character which threaten to disintegrate, even to the point of putting a new roof on them.  Others hold the view that it is aesthetically wrong to restore an ancient building of that kind, because it destroys the integrity of its original perfection.  I leave that to be determined by the Advisory Body at the Minister's disposal.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it would reflect credit on his own name if he woke up the Treasury to the fact that £6,000 out of £635,000 is an altogether inappropriate provision for this important work.  If he cannot make more money available purely on the grounds of national interest or on aesthetic considerations, I think there is an important point to be made in connection with the tourist traffic to this country which expects to find, and ought to be able to find, the archaeological <Col N="1332" /> architectural remains of the pre-Norman period in this country which they can visit and admire.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that not only should these buildings be protected, preserved and, if necessary, in some measure restored to protect them from further disintegration, but that they should be marked with some modest panel which would indicate their history and their significance.  I remember raising this question here ten years ago.  I made some progress and so I do not hesitate to raise the matter again.</P>
    <P>If you go to the United States of America, which has a very much shorter history than we have, and if you visit Gettysburg you will find that every incident of the battle of Gettysburg is marked on the battlefield today by artistically designed plaques which tell shortly the story of Piggot's Charge, where it began and where it crumbled; the story of the defence on the ridge and the story of where the Generals commanding the rivals had their headquarters. In fact, with the assistance of these plaques you could reconstruct for yourself the whole story of the Battle of Gettysburg.</P>
    <P>Thousands and thousands of people go there to see that scene and to walk over the site of these incidents famous in the history of the United States of America.  Of course, millions do not go.  Many people are not interested in those kinds of things but I think that the thousands and thousands who do go and want to go ought to be catered for.  We have a good many amenities in this country for tourists but we should not hesitate to exploit all of them.  It may be that only a relatively small percentage of the tourists coming here will be interested in architecture or archaeology but we ought to be able to tell the world what is unquestionably true, that, archaeologically, this is the richest island in Europe.  How many people know that?  How many of our own people know it?</P>
    <P>To me the tragedy of it is that we are letting this archaeological treasure-house disintegrate.  I suppose this was borne in on me in particular because <Col N="1333" /> I organised the Land Rehabilitation Project.  The first thing I did when I set that on foot was to appoint an archaeologist to the project because I foresaw the danger of archaeological sites being destroyed.  We had several such incidents where we would have an archaeological survey and had to review programmes of work in contemplation because they would destroy archaeological remains.  In many cases it was sufficient to go to the site to record what was there and, if it was not of enduring interest, to file the report made by the archaeologist and go on with the work.</P>
    <P>You frequently found something which you thought was an important archaeological site when it was, in fact, no more than the foundations of a fourteenth century or fifteenth century house.  If you found yourself entering a place of prehistoric origin an entirely different procedure had to be adopted.  That is not sufficient.  That was simply preserving those sites which stood in immediate peril.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to consider doing a great deal more and that is to make available to this section of his Department sufficient sums of money (1) to enable them to survey the archaeological sites more effectively than they have been surveyed, (2) to protect the architectural and archaeological sites of which they have notice and (3) to mark them with some kind of informative plaque and carry out such restoration work as may be requisite to prevent their further deterioration.</P>
    <P>That is a specific task which I ask him to undertake.  Over and above it there is an urgent necessity that an aerial survey of the country should be made for archaeological purposes.  I believe he would find a sympathetic reaction both in the Department of Defence and in the Department of Agriculture for such a survey, but what is everybody's business is nobody's business.  I pressed that very strongly and I think the Parliamentary Secretary will find either in the Board of Works or in the Department of Agriculture draft plans for such a survey.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> At the time I believe the Department of Defence took exception.  They alleged they were taking exception on the highest strategic grounds.  I think the real reason was that they could not get the Department of Finance to sanction the purchase of planes which they wanted and they stuck in their heels and said that either the Department of Defence or the Department of Agriculture would have to do the survey as it would not be strategically safe to let anybody outside the country do it. That, I think, was the real reason; they wanted the planes, the Department of Finance would not sanction their purchase and they thought it was a good way of putting on the screws. I do not care a fiddle-de-dee who conducts the survey but I think if the Parliamentary Secretary adopted this plan it would have excellent results.</P>
    <P>If he wants confirmation of the survey and of the riches that could be revealed in the pilot scheme which we did at Cong, he will find the relative papers, maps and markings in the Department of Agriculture, where I know them to be, and if he does not know in which section of the Department they are I can tell him that they are in the Land Project Division in Upper Merrion Street.  It might interest him to look further and to see the marvellous differences between what is revealed by an aerial survey and a peripatetic survey.</P>
    <P>I praise the Parliamentary Secretary for his diligence in attending to the O'Connor site and the clock, and I deplore his indolence in dealing with the Dromore River in the County Monaghan.  I await his performance in respect of the matters I have mentioned in relation to the National Monuments Branch of the Board of Works before passing a verdict on his merits or demerits as a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>We all deplore the flight from the land about which Deputies repeatedly speak.  Public men in various parts of the country are stressing that national loss, but, whilst we are awaiting a solution or a part solution of that problem by the establishment here and there of industries <Col N="1335" /> to provide some employment, we have this problem of drainage at our very doors awaiting solution.  I do not think half enough is being done in that direction and what is being done is far too slow.  I can well understand the delay at times in dealing with large catchment areas, but surely there are smaller primary rivers, or intermediate rivers as they are called, which do not require such extensive surveys and which could be more easily tackled even locally because the suitable machinery is now there, which was not the case before. In addition, the workers are there if there is any hope of getting steady employment on these projects.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to devote&mdash;as I think it is his intention&mdash;much of his energy and all the resources of his Department towards dealing with that work.  In every part of the country something can be done.  It is no credit to us as a nation that we have only three or four large projects in progress on the land because even though the country may be considered small, when one travels around, one finds that there is a fair share of it.  There is far too much waste of marginal land which is being left without attention.  It is too costly a matter for the people concerned to tackle but if it were tackled it would have a splendid result.  These lands would be made fertile and the farms along these rivers would become more economic, consequently giving encouragement to the people who are living along them to remain there and work because their efforts would be more profitable.  This land is often rough grazing land for part of the year and flooded, needlessly I would say, at other parts of the year because we are too slow to take on these minor drainage schemes, as I would call them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of roads made by the Board of Works for utility purposes and then left there.  The county council will not undertake to maintain them because they are too narrow in some cases to meet the council's engineering requirements.  It is a <Col N="1336" /> waste of public money to make these roads and then leave them without attention.  There are too many of them all over the country and that type of road work should be integrated.  Now that the county councils have gone ahead pretty quickly with the improvement of the roads, I think it time that there should be more co-ordination and that some of their efforts should be devoted towards providing better facilities for say three or four farmers or cottiers in particular pockets where there are not link roads and where their problems will never be dealt with unless there is some co-operation and co-ordination in that regard.</P>
    <P>The next point with which I should like to deal is the matter of schools. Good progress is being made in this regard, but it amazes me when I consider the period it takes from the time the erection of a new school, or the repair of an old school, is contemplated until there is a start made on the work.  Sometimes things take so long that the health of the pupils is endangered.  I know of a school in my constituency where the delays have been so long that the primitive toilets which they have there have had to be closed.</P>
    <P>The public interest demands speedier attention to these matters.  Sometimes a new school is contemplated, say for girls and reconstruction of the old one for boys.  Here again, we have the question of co-operation of the local health authority with the schools authorities in getting water to the schools or at least as far as the school grounds and the installation of these facilities which in these modern days are regarded as essential.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has mentioned national monuments.  I am with him whole-heartedly in the matter he brought to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary, because undoubtedly some of these old castles and monuments will disappear if they do not get attention.  Were it not for their attraction to tourists, perhaps, they would not be counted amongst our major problems, but, at the same time, it means the loss of a great national asset if we do not take <Col N="1337" /> prompt action.  A survey of these monuments was made by the Irish Tourist Association some years ago. It might have been a superficial survey, but at least these monuments are recorded and the survey would show those that require immediate attention and those that are most valuable as a tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>These are three or four matters that I want to bring before the Parliamentary Secretary now that he is new in the Board of Works.  He will make his mark there and will do something of real value to the country if he undertakes what I have suggested and, as a result, the national economy will benefit and the services that the Board of Works can give in regard to public buildings and schools and so on will be something of real advantage to the rising generation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the previous speaker about arterial drainage and about the urgency of draining some of the smaller rivers. The officials of the Board of Works who have carried out arterial drainage so far have much to be proud of because the work they have done is stupendous and excellently carried out.  Anyone who sees it and knows the difficulties and problems that faced them must take off his hat to them especially when we consider that we are a very young nation and that most of the engineers had no chance of gaining experience of big works in other countries.  The interest they have taken and the high standard of the jobs they have so far executed give great hope for the future in spite of the gloomy views of some people about the outlook for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is understandable&mdash;and correct&mdash;that bigger schemes should go ahead first, such as those that have been completed and those being undertaken at present, still, as Deputy MacCarthy has pointed out, some of the smaller rivers are causing great havoc especially to small farmers whose lands are being flooded each year.  These people suffer an annual blow or even disaster when their lands are flooded.  In the case of the small <Col N="1338" /> farmer of say 25, 30 or 35 acres, if five or six acres are flooded in the winter or subject to periodic flooding the whole year round&mdash;as happens in many cases&mdash;that is a serious drawback and loss.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the Board of Works can do an immense amount of good by arterial drainage and by draining the small rivers.</P>
    <P>I put these matters to him for consideration; it might be possible for the Board of Works to undertake some of the rivers that would not cost such a lot to do.  I have in mind a particular case with which the Parliamentary Secretary is not perhaps familiar.  I am referring to the Carrowbeg river that flows through Westport.  Under the Local Authorities (Works) Act a very good job was done on part of it, but part was left undone and that has spoiled the whole effect.  While talking of the drainage of smaller rivers, I do not envisage any huge scheme of deep cuttings such as have proved necessary in the Corrib and are proving necessary in the Moy but deepening and clearing with ordinary dragline dredgers.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should look into that.  I am not asking him to undertake all the rivers at once but if it were possible for the Board to make a rough and ready survey to find out exactly which of the smaller rivers are doing the most damage, I think these could be undertaken in conjunction with the bigger schemes and without taking away the engineers engaged on the bigger schemes at present.  If the Parliamentary Secretary did that he would do an immense amount of good.</P>
    <P>We cannot help hearing complaints and grumbles from those whose lands are being flooded and who happen to be in the catchment area of a small river.  They know that there are 101 or 107 catchment areas all over the country, big and small, and only three of these, as the previous speaker pointed out, have been completed and only three or four have got under way since the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.  It is very hard to blame those who grumble when they can see very little hope that, in the lifetime of even the very youngest of <Col N="1339" /> them, arterial drainage would come their way.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will probably tell me when replying that it is not easy to get money for all these schemes but this year, if I read the book of Estimates correctly, I see that £640,000 is all that is provided for arterial drainage under subhead J (2).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>Construction Works and Maintenance are under separate heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am talking of Construction.  I take it Construction is what is covered in regard to the Corrib-Clare, the Maine, Inny, Moy, etc.  That is not a very big expenditure for such important work.  I am not going to blame the Parliamentary Secretary or bring any acrimony into the debate&mdash;it would not do any good &mdash;but the immense amount of good that arterial drainage does and the employment provided by it, particularly in rural Ireland, I think are two powerful arguments with which the Parliamentary Secretary can tackle his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and get money out of him by fair means or foul, if necessary at the point of the gun.  I suggest it is the best possible way in which money can be spent.  Much money is very well and usefully spent under these Votes but none better than in arterial drainage.  I dare say many arguments and, I am afraid, a lot of nonsense, have been put forward by interests opposed to arterial drainage for selfish or other reasons that I find it hard to understand but I think I know the Parliamentary Secretary well enough to have confidence in him that he will not be caught by chaff of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat that £640,000 is rather small expenditure and if it could be expended to cover some of the smaller rivers it would do a great deal of good.  I am not suggesting a major job.  Let us take the Carrowbeg which flows through Westport.  With the availability of the engineers and machinery from the Board of Works now, a few thousand pounds would make an excellent job of that river and, in the process, would relieve up to <Col N="1340" /> 400 or 500 farms of flooding.  The Newport river is another.  Still another is the Annies River which flows into Lough Carra.  I understand the Parliamentary Secretary will be receiving a deputation shortly in regard to that.  It is really part of the Corrib catchment area.  Indeed, if the Parliamentary Secretary tackles some of the small rivers he will do very useful work.</P>
    <P>I want to touch now on maintenance charges following on arterial drainage. I do not think it is fair to put these charges on to the ratepayers.  The drainage of the Moy started a short time ago.  That scheme will do an immense amount of good where Mayo is concerned, some good where Roscommon is concerned, and a great deal of good where Sligo is concerned. When the work is completed in five, six or seven years' time the cost of maintenance will fall on the ratepayers of county Mayo.  People who will derive no benefit from this scheme will have to pay 3/- or 4/- in the £ for maintenance.</P>

      <P>Rural improvement schemes are doing very good work, but I have two minor complaints.  First of all, contributors should get first preference. There is a regulation, probably imposed by the Parliamentary Secretary's colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, that only men from the employment exchange can be employed.

      <P>Very good.  I shall have more to say on that later.  Deputy Dillon referred to monuments.  I endorse everything he said.  It is a pity that some of the more important historical monuments were allowed to fall into decay and be pulled down by people who did not appreciate their value.  In the past superstition&mdash;to use the local word, &ldquo;pishrogue&rdquo;&mdash;saved a good many of these monuments. Indeed, this superstition had a beneficial effect from that point of view. Probably these &ldquo;pishrogues&rdquo; were first mooted by those who were anxious to save these old monuments.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that in many cases valuable archaeological sites were destroyed because the people did not understand their value.  In many cases these are a nuisance from a farming point of view, just as great a nuisance as the E.S.B. poles and pylons.  A farmer anxious to improve his land would naturally remove these monuments, and he can scarcely be blamed for tidying up the place.  The Board of Works has a duty, however, to preserve our important monuments.  I agree fully with Deputy Dillon in that.</P>

      <P>The first matter with which I want to deal is the need for an amplification system in this House. I have mentioned that matter a few times in the past year.  The Board of Works is arranging for the provision of an intercom. system.  They should simultaneously take steps to provide amplification.  Some people admittedly can be heard outside on the road.  There are others who cannot be heard at all, especially when the House is full.  Even the Taoiseach sometimes cannot be heard when he whispers to the Ceann Comhairle.  We, on these benches, have to ask one <Col N="1343" /> another what he has said.  I know the Press find it very difficult to hear.  I see the Press reporters cocking their ears to try to catch what is being said. There should be some amplication, if only for those who are known to have low-pitched voices.</P>
      <P>There should be amplification on the Front Bench so that certain Ministers who have very low-pitched voices could be clearly heard.  What is said here should be heard by everybody, including visitors.  Visitors like to hear the debate.  On the occasion on which I mentioned this matter before the Press commented on it and said it would be an excellent idea.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the matter.</P>

At least 500 children must still come <Col N="1344" /> into town to school because there is no room for them in Finglas.  The parents complain that they cannot afford the bus fares and quite a number of children miss school because their parents have not got the necessary sixpence bus fare.  One man who had two little girls going to Cabra told me that in dark winter evenings he was a bit nervous because his girls had to cross lonely roads to get from Cabra to Finglas and the journey was too far for his wife to travel every day.  Anyway there is still need for another school in Finglas.</P>

      <P>The rivers in this city do not flood agricultural land so it is not the responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary but there have been complaints &mdash;which have been mentioned by another Deputy&mdash;of flooding due to the overflow of the rivers from outside the city area.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give that some thought. I note that £32,000 is being provided to build gates for hangars.  They must be &ldquo;some&rdquo; gates.  The Minister is responsible for military structures, barracks, and so forth, and we hear a great deal about the need for civil defence, but we never hear any talk about the building of shelters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke at length on the subject of the Garden of Remembrance, and seems to be very interested in the past.  He was wondering why we have done nothing about reconstructing famous battlefields as an attraction for tourists.  He mentioned Gettysburg.  There is a much better <Col N="1345" /> construction of that type, that of the Battle of Waterloo in Belgium.  He suggested we should try to save monuments of the pre-Norman era.  I do not know if there is anything worthwhile or anything at all of the pre-Norman era.  As far as I can judge from my little knowledge or study, the Irish of that period were not townspeople at all.  They lived in the country on hills such as the Hill of Tara.  They built no monuments or castles.  They had only old mud homes of some sort. They certainly did not use stone and that is why there is nothing, certainly nothing of the Norman period, that can be saved.  It was the Danes who first built stone structures around Dublin and then the Normans continued to hold the country against the Irish, but the Irish themselves built nothing worthwhile.</P>
    <P>From the historic point of view and that of tourism, something should be done in that direction.  It is the great spectacle of St. Peter's, the Forum, and so on, that brings so many visitors to Rome.  The Italians make a fortune out of them.  Even in Paris there is a never-ending flow of people into such places as Napoleon's Tomb; they pay in and the proceeds go to the Old Soldiers' Fund.  Westminster Abbey is another place of interest.  Whenever I go abroad, which is not often, I always visit these places.</P>
    <P>There are a few episodes in our history which are worth bringing into the limelight.  We seldom did anything decisive but the Battle of Clontarf was decisive.  We defeated the Danes who were trying to muscle in here.  Then we had the Boyne and Aughrim.  We had great international figures here such as St. Ruth from France, Schomberg from Germany and William of Orange.  English people and others would have read at least a little about those episodes and they might be interested in seeing some memorial created around such episodes.</P>
    <P>I am wondering what will be the character of the Garden of Remembrance for which £20,000 is being provided.  I have seen many plaques around this town, puny things which are seen only when they are erected <Col N="1346" /> and then forgotten.  They are so small that it is a strain to see the inscription on them.  Although the Custom House can be seen in the distance, one has to go inside to find out the history attached to it.  The structure may be very impressive but the visitor would not know it was associated with any great military feat.  As regards the old days in Wexford, you see a man depicted with a pike and you know he must have been a soldier.  I hope the Garden of Remembrance will be a worthy memorial, not just a piece of concrete with a few names.</P>
    <P>We ought to have something like Westminster Abbey or the Triumphal Arch in Paris, something that people will be interested in seeing and will even pay to see, something that will inspire people and of which people will be aware in a thousand years from now.  As soon as this generation has passed the monuments, stone structures and little plaques we put up will have been forgotten.  We ought, for instance, to have some kind of sepulchre like Napoleon's Tomb in which the remains of Wolfe Tone, Collins and Brugha could be interred and which could inspire people.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, to provide something spectacular, something that tourists will consider worth visiting.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the Wellington Monument.  Last year I noticed that some big lumps of bronze were missing from it.  I do not know whether they have been replaced.  If it is the Parliamentary Secretary's responsibility to preserve those monuments, I would ask him to have it inspected.  I suppose someone was trying to &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; the bronze.</P>
    <P>An employee of the Board of Works asked me to mention this point.  He said that most of the work of the Board is handed out to contractors and that boys are engaged and dismissed when they reach 18.  Those boys get only about £2 per week, whereas the Union wage for boys of that age is £3. They are dismissed because they would have to be paid double the wage.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to inquire into that.  It is not fair to <Col N="1347" /> give those boys such small wages and then dismiss them.  I was also asked to inquire from the Parliamentary Secretary if there was any chance that those boys could be given some official status or given the opportunity of being employed under the Board itself.  I have nothing more to add; and as I am not a country Deputy I shall not talk about drainage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the Parliamentary Secretary of a promise which a deputation from Tipperary, Waterford, and Kilkenny County Councils received from the Minister concerning the start of the survey of the Suir catchment area.  We were promised it would be started this year.  I wish to remind him of that promise and hope it will be honoured.</P>
      <P>I rise particularly to support the plea made by Deputy Dillon for the taking of some greater steps by the Government in connection with the preservation of our monuments, in particular our ancient monuments.  I am afraid that, notwithstanding the great knowledge of Deputy Sherwin, I am prepared to accept the statement of Deputy Dillon that this country has a greater store of ancient monuments and antiquities worth preserving than any country in Europe.  I think the treatment we mete out to these monuments throughout the country is absolutely deplorable.  Some monuments and buildings erected over a thousand years ago, or even more, are being neglected, and as time passes they will disappear completely.  I believe that but for superstition connected with the raths scattered throughout the country not one of them would be left today.  Since we do set a high value on ancient things, we should do everything in our power to preserve remains of that nature.  The fact that we are spending only £6,000 per annum on our ancient monuments is absolutely disgraceful. Even ten times that sum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is like the previous speaker.  He is confusing the salaries for the small staff with the overall figure for the preservation of monuments.</P>

    <Col N="1348" />
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I was taking the figures from the previous speaker.  However, from my own knowledge I see very little spent at all.  That is the reason I was prepared to accept that figure.  This will give you an idea of what I mean by preserving the history of the country.  I know of a bridge, a very big bridge, which was erected first in the year 1360, which was rebuilt in the year 1660 and which, about seven or eight years ago, underwent a form of reconstruction. A building on the centre arch was demolished and the coping stones on both sides of the bridge were replaced with concrete.  For a monument as old as that bridge, I think that was a disgrace to the people of Ireland and particularly to whoever was responsible for carrying out work of that description. I regarded it as vandalism and I think so still.  Nothing ancient in the country should be touched without having the most extensive inquiries made to see whether it should be replaced, reconditioned or destroyed.  I rise principally to press on the Parliamentary Secretary the desirability of doing everything possible, and even going to the limits as far as expenditure is concerned, to preserve for future generations what has been handed down to this generation from the dim and distant past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the remarks of Deputy Sherwin relative to our public monuments and our history in this country. It is well to remember, though, that other countries have monuments that commemorate great victories and other great national incidents, whereas our history has been entirely different.  Our history has been one of a struggle for our independence.  Therefore, we cannot show monuments of great victories but we can show that we have fought unceasingly down the ages to secure our freedom.  We can put up monuments to people to commemorate the many acts of gallantry and the many lives that have been sacrificed in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the Garden of Remembrance.  The Parliamentary Secretary purposely in his statement just made a brief statistical survey of <Col N="1349" /> everything covered by his Department and indicated that he would reply to the points raised.  The point I want to raise about the Garden of Remembrance is this.  I take it that this Garden will cover the whole period of Irish history.  This is something new in this country and it should cover the entire past, as far back as one can remember, to honour and commemorate all those who have contributed so much to Ireland.  In this Garden of Remembrance we shall be creating something not only for our own generation but for the generations that come after us. It is for that purpose I want to raise a small point.  I hope this Garden of Remembrance&mdash;there is nothing derogatory in the remarks I intend to make &mdash;will not be devoted only to the period of history from 1916 on, that it will go right back over the past and pay tribute to all those who played their part in the long struggle for our national existence.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that strikes me about the staff in the Board of Works. I should like to pay my tribute to them, as I have always regarded them as an efficient staff and very obliging in every way, but I understand that they have always had difficulty in recruiting engineering staff.  I think one of the reasons for that is that people in a professional capacity like to have an opportunity to utilise to the fullest the powers and knowledge that such a profession gives them but, in the Board of Works, they are very often tied to a particular type or section of work and therefore it becomes rather tedious for them.  That, as I say, is one of the reasons why the Board of Works have some difficulty in recruiting staff, though they offer rates of pay and conditions comparable with the rates of pay and the emoluments and amenities offered by other organisations. Those who control and run the Board of Works should bear that in mind and, when they recruit engineers, should give them the opportunity of dealing with the many different facets of their profession rather than confine them to one particular section.</P>
    <P>Turning to the grants for harbours, while I realise it is not a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary, I think <Col N="1350" /> it must be clear that when the Swedish expert made his recommendations in reference to harbours, consultation must have taken place between the Department of Lands and the Parliamentary Secretary or his Department. If an expert were to suggest that something should be done to any harbours, that proposal would have to be submitted to the Board of Works who are the technical advisers and also the contractors in a great many cases for the different Government Departments. I notice that the Vote of £100,000 this year covers only two harbours and I think both of these are in one county.  It does seem to me that the Parliamentary Secretary must have had discussions or been brought into discussions&mdash;the officers of his Department, anyway&mdash;and other harbours must have been considered.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate to us what are the prospects, in so far as his Department knows, for the other harbours. I do not expect him to be able to tell the House when those harbours will be done, or what is in the mind of the Minister for Lands, but I do suggest that he might let the House know if the different propositions put up to him for some of these harbours were found feasible, acceptable, and economic by his Department.  I think I am justified in bringing this matter up because there are two harbours which immediately come to my mind.</P>

      <P>I have made it crystal clear that I do not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to do it, but I want to know if these schemes have been put to him and if they were feasible schemes.  Then, at a later date, one can raise them with the Department of Lands.  It is only because the Parliamentary Secretary has told us that £100,000 is being spent on two harbours that I want to know if other harbours were submitted and considered satisfactory.  I am not asking the Parliamentary Secretary to do those harbours.  With <Col N="1351" /> respect, Sir, I fully agree with you that it is a matter for another Minister but I want to cite the case of Kilmore Quay in my own constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree. I have made that clear and I am not holding the Parliamentary Secretary responsible in any way for the disposition that has been made already.  I am only asking him whether the Kilmore Quay scheme has come before him and if it was considered a practical proposition within his Department.</P>
      <P>I now come to the question of monuments. I do not think we have enough money available for our public monuments. I agree with all the Deputies who have spoken that they are important and are part of our national history.  I know that the Commissioners of Public Works have a good many of these monuments on hand which they have been asked to take over and maintain in order because, in many cases, it so happens that the private individuals concerned are not able to do so.  I cite particularly the case of a very famous Abbey, Tintern Abbey, in my county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> Tintern Abbey is a building that was constructed about 1435 by the Earl of Pembroke in thanksgiving for being saved from shipwreck on the coast of Wexford and was subsequently occupied by the Franciscan Friars.  It is an exact replica of a famous Abbey in Wales and, as I say, historically, it goes back many hundreds of years.  It is a very fine pile and it is visited by many visitors who come to our area, particularly Americans.  Some time recently, I asked if it could be considered and taken over and I was told there were not sufficient funds available and that the Commissioners had too much work on hand at the moment.</P>
    <P>That seems to indicate to me that perhaps we are not providing enough funds for this very important work and, even though it is a direct outlay on the part of the State, it will give a remunerative return if it attracts visitors who come in here.  It is only right, in the cultural interests of the nation, that we should protect old monuments like that and I would again ask the Parliamentary Secretary to say if it would be possible to do something about that historic pile this year.</P>
    <P>I see that there is a provision of £6,000 for Rosslare Strand and I also note that experimental work has been going on there over the past two and a half years.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate to the House what is the position there now and if it has been successful or otherwise. It may be early for him to be able to give a dogmatic opinion one way or the other but I do know that 30 or 40 yards have been lost again in the past 12 months on the golf course at Rosslare Strand, down at the end of the Point.  If that continues, it means that the Point will eventually disappear altogether.  The residents there and I would like to know if this experimental work has been a success.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider it a success and, being a success, does he consider it desirable to go ahead now with a big scheme for the purpose of preserving this very important Point, because it must be borne in mind that if that Point goes, then the town of Wexford, with a population of 15,000 to 20,000, will ultimately be threatened?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> I am a little disappointed, like other Deputies who have spoken, with the amount of money voted for schools. Infra-structure as it is known, is pretty good in this country but I do not think we can say the same of school building, though great advances have been made over the past 20 years or so.  I think in his opening statement the Parliamentary Secretary said that there were 700 schools to be built or replaced, and I do not think it is any real economy&mdash;in fact, it is a false economy&mdash;to save money on schools. The Parliamentary Secretary should use what influence he has with the Government to secure enough money to go ahead with the building of schools, though, of course, I know the Department of Education is responsible for building them, but schools cannot be built unless the Board of Works get the money to build them, so the two things are correlated.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to deal with is the question of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That scheme has been abandoned.  The whole situation in regard to drainage is very difficult, particularly for Deputies within their own constituencies.  Since the abolition of schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, there are no funds at the disposal of local authorities to deal with emergency work that may arise from time to time.  There is really no scheme to deal with such a situation.  The Office of Public Works is concerned only with main arterial drainage.  If a Deputy is approached about an emergency, such as flooding due to heavy rain or the overflowing of a river, there is nothing he can do about it.  He can go to the county council but their only means of dealing with it is to raise it on the rate.</P>
    <P>In my view, the Office of Public Works should associate itself in some way with drainage other than arterial drainage.  In fact, I have always been in favour of one body being responsible for all drainage and I do not know any body more competent to deal with drainage than the Office of Public Works.  It is the only organisation which has the up-to-date skilled engineers who fully understand <Col N="1354" /> the problems and who will give maximum value for the money spent.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary, who is a newcomer to political office.  I feel sure that it is only a stepping stone, within his own Party, to further promotion.  Of course, he may not be there very long.  There is always that risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join the other Deputies in extending congratulations to the Office of Public Works for the work they have carried out in my constituency.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Esmonde's remarks with regard to the engineering staff.  I sympathise with the engineering staff.  When I consider the work they have performed, I have no hesitation in saying that if they were operating privately they would receive as much from one job as they would receive by way of salary in two years in the Office of Public Works.  I am proud of the fact that we have Irishmen capable of performing such splendid work as they have done on the quays at Wicklow. From time to time officials are criticised. Therefore, it is only right to say that the work that has been performed on the quays of Wicklow for an expenditure of £60,000 is a memorial and a monument to the engineers in charge of it.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be very pleased indeed that that wonderful work has been done, without inconvenience to the port, within the space of two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary not to allow that good work to be wasted and, before the job is completed, to continue the work another 50 or 60 yards.  There is very heavy traffic to the quays of Wicklow, where nearly 400 men are employed. Fortunately, the Harbour Board are in a very secure financial position.  We appeal for a continuation of the work for 60 yards while the experienced men of the Office of Public Works are on the quay, so that we shall be in a position to cater for a larger number of the <Col N="1355" /> 700 ton boats that are coming into the port.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that if the Parliamentary Secretary has not already done so, he should visit the place and see for himself the work performed by his engineering staff.  He will be the first to agree with me that they deserve the greatest praise and congratulation.</P>
    <P>A large number of schools has been erected in my constituency and some schools have been reconstructed.  Again, the architects are to be praised.  We are proud of the fact that we have men to perform such good work.</P>
    <P>With regard to drainage, an appeal has been made to the Office of Public Works.  It concerns flooding of land in Newcastle.  From the report we have had, I am satisfied that the Office of Public Works are considering the matter.  If they do only half as good a job there as has been accomplished on the quays and harbour of Wicklow, we shall have no cause to complain. Inevitably, there is the problem of finance.  If portion of the work is carried out in the various areas, we shall be able to satisfy some of the people.</P>
    <P>I do not think the question of coast erosion is a matter for the Office of Public Works.  That is regrettable because, owing to their experience of the effects of tides and winds and their long experience of marine work, they are as capable as any foreign expert who might come in and make recommendations. Such an expert might recommend something which our own marine engineers would regard as unsuitable, knowing the effect of tides and gales on a particular harbour or pier.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to convey the best thanks of the Harbour Board to the engineers who were in charge of the work in Wicklow. May I again express the hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will use his influence to have that work continued a further 60 yards so that a good job may be completed?  There is only one complaint about it, that it was too good a job and will last hundreds of years. If we had spent less money and continued further up the quay, all doubt <Col N="1356" /> would have been removed.  We are satisfied and delighted with the work that has been done and hope that the Parliamentary Secretary, in the near future, will consider the advisability of extending the work, for the protection of factories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty1957" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This, undoubtedly, is a very important Estimate, particularly to rural Deputies.  The Estimate does not raise any contentious matter. Everyone interested is anxious to see more of the type of work provided for in the Estimate carried out.</P>
      <P>I should like to join with other speakers in complimenting the Parliamentary Secretary on being so practical in his approach to the various problems in relation to drainage and in relation to the schemes to aid small farmers which come under his jurisdiction. Most Deputies agree that excellent work has been carried out under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  That being the case, it is no harm to put on record that the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, which was passed when Fianna Fáil were in power, made it possible to commence drainage work on the River Moy.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments on the Moy drainage.  First, it is one of the biggest drainage schemes in the country and on behalf of my constituents, I wish to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his assistance in bringing the drainage of the River Moy to its present stage.  The Government of the day are to be complimented on their wisdom in speculating £3 million, designed to drain 48,000 acres of land and to put 700 people into employment.</P>
      <P>That is a blessing to the people of north Mayo and Mayo in general, not to mention Sligo, Roscommon and part of Leitrim.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government that in an area where there are so many congests and so much poor soil, we very much appreciate the policy of the Government. The scheme is of tremendous benefit to the small farmers and it holds out the greatest possible encouragement to the people who live on the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> It is regrettable, therefore, that certain vested interests did their utmost to stop this great scheme.  However, this is not the first occasion in my constituency on which attempts were made by certain people to sabotage the most important scheme that ever came west of the Shannon.  I was assured that 3,000 families will benefit materially by this mighty scheme and I have already been told by business people in the town of Ballina that they have noticed an upward trend in business since this scheme was started.  Naturally I should like to feel that that upward trend will be speeded up.</P>
    <P>However, I am satisfied that we in the Government have turned the dangerous bend and are on the road to progress.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of my constituents, that we appreciate every penny that will be sunk in the drainage of the Moy.  I want to put on record in this House what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Lands have clearly stated on two occasions, both inside this House and outside it, that is, that the interests of the fisheries will be protected.  I am satisfied with that statement and I do not intend to make any further remarks on it.</P>
    <P>There is one further aspect of this Estimate to which I should like to refer.  I wish to pay a compliment to the Office of Public Works, to their engineers and their architects, on the wonderful job they are doing in the construction of new national schools. I sincerely hope that no slowing down will take place, especially in rural Ireland where national schools are badly needed, and particularly in my own constituency.  I compliment those people and I hope they will continue to make provision in the Estimates year after year for the construction and reconstruction of national schools and for the provision of additional rooms, where necessary.  Those who go down to the west of Ireland can see for themselves the magnificent job that is being done.  Our schools are very modern.  They have very modern amenities such as sewerage and water.  I hope this good work will continue.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment the Mayo <Col N="1358" /> Vocational Committee who have carried out an extensive building programme for Mayo.  If I am not mistaken&mdash;I am open to contradiction &mdash;there are plans in the Office of Public Works for vocational schools in Claremorris and in Kiltimagh.  I think those plans have been approved. However, there is one outstanding vocational school in which I am really interested and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the matter.  I refer to Geesala vocational school.  I do not know if the plans have been approved; I think they have. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to expedite the building of that school.</P>
    <P>If I am relevant in doing so on this Estimate, I wish to make a correction of a false statement made in this House on last Thursday evening.  It is not the first occasion this statement has been made.  If I remember, two years ago in this House, the late Parliamentary Secretary was challenged by the Fine Gael Deputy in my constituency and by Deputy O.J. Flanagan in regard to the erection of a slip at Blacksod Bay.  I want to put it on record because I believe in 1960 that Fine Gael or any other body cannot put it across the people of this country.  If they make a statement they must back it by hard facts which I intend to do during the course of my remarks.</P>
    <P>It is a peculiar coincidence that this statement was made in 1955 for the first time, just before the Mayo County Council election and last week we heard the very same statement made in 1960, just before the county council election.  I have here <i>The Western People</i> of June 4th, 1955, a paper with one of the largest circulations of any provincial paper in Ireland. Under the heading &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary in Erris&rdquo;, we read the following statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since becoming Parliamentary Secretary in charge of a fishing industry I have travelled to almost every important centre in the Republic, and I must say that I am particularly impressed by what I have seen in Blacksod.  I am satisfied <Col N="1359" /> that despite apparently continuous neglect by the appropriate State Departments a prosperous fishing industry can be developed here, and I am going to take all steps necessary to provide the facilities required to improve the position of the particularly fine type of fishermen I have met in this area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was made by Deputy O. J. Flanagan, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, when he addressed a meeting of fishermen and others at Blacksod.  He also promised to improve Faulmore pier.  He also promised a pier or a slip at Graughill.  He is further reported as saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been completely misled by the information submitted to me in connection with the landing facilities here and the necessity for improving them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was referring to Graughill, there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to a few matters on this Estimate.  I understand there is a scheme in the Parliamentary Secretary's Office for the development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  I need hardly say how necessary it is to proceed with that work.  Dún Laoghaire Harbour is one of the major gateways to the country.  It is important as a port through which a great number of tourists visit the country.  Certain work has already been carried out there.  I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary and the staff of the Office of Public Works the importance of proceeding as rapidly as possible with that development scheme.  It is a project which might be regarded as a major scheme.  As well as providing <Col N="1361" /> an essential service there, it will also give much needed employment.</P>
      <P>I should like to say how pleased I am, in common with many other people, at the reconstruction and repair work which the Office of Public Works have done on ancient shrines and monuments.  Many of the most famous shrines such as Clonmacnoise, Monasterboice, Glendalough and others have been the subject of great attention by the Office of Public Works for some considerable time.  The work done is a tribute to the skill and to the knowledge of the craftsmen concerned. Very satisfactory restoration work has been carried out at each of these places.  Another place in which I saw work which was excellent was at Jerpoint Abbey in County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>In addition to what might be described as better-known or more famous shrines or national monuments, work should be carried out on smaller shrines or memorials which are probably not as well known but which have local interest and have historical interest as local shrines.  In that way we can preserve some of the best known features of our cultural heritage and can show our own people and visitors memorials of traditions of which we are proud.  It is indeed very gratifying to visit any of these places where the work has already been carried out.  I understand that great numbers of people have visited these places since the restoration work was undertaken.  In collaboration with Bord Failte, plaques have been placed setting out briefly an historical account of the memorial in question.</P>
      <P>I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary the desirability of proceeding wherever possible with smaller work even where the shrines or abbeys or churches, as the case may be, are not as well known as others.  We have throughout the country a very rich heritage.  Many have significance in their locality.  It helps to make people proud of their locality as well as providing an attraction from the tourist point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that, during the course of this discussion, many Deputies have referred <Col N="1362" /> to the general satisfaction at the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary to his present position.  I should like to join in extending my good wishes to him during his term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works comes in for a good deal of criticism here year after year.  Personally, I think the greater part of that criticism is entirely unjustifiable and very ill-founded.  The Office of Public Works is materially different from the other Departments of State in so far as its activities are not initiated by itself. Its activities depend largely on the demands made on it by the Departments of State.  Very often, people wrongly blame the Office of Public Works when moneys are not made available for schools and for various other buildings in the State.</P>
      <P>As far as I know, the position is that the Office of Public Works has no responsibility for the provision of money for schools.  Its responsibility is to survey the sites, prepare drawings, plans, and so on.  In other words, the Office of Public Works is the functional body to provide the service but the money must come from the parent Department of State.  The Office of Public Works is responsible for new schools and extensions and renovations to existing schools.  It also has responsibility for new Garda Barracks and the maintenance of existing Garda and military barracks and State buildings of all kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Office of Public Works has been criticised here for its slowness, I have no doubt but that it could very well increase its pace if its administrative personnel and its technicians were provided with the money to enable them to do so.  The provision of money depends entirely on the other Departments of State.  In the course of time, it is quite obvious to the ordinary person that the activities of the Board of Works in many directions will taper off.  When we have those 700 new schools which the Parliamentary Secretary told us must be replaced and when we have renovated the 300 odd schools which still await renovation, extension and repairs, that <Col N="1363" /> side of their activity, if it is activity, will cease.</P>
    <P>The major activity of the Office of Public Works will be arterial drainage. I certainly think that will be one of the foremost major activities in this State in future years.  I say that because of the possibilities it affords for rural employment.  I say it as well because of the possibilities of bringing into production many hundreds of acres of excellent fertile land which are waterlogged for the greater part of the year.  I have seen the results of arterial drainage by the Office of Public Works.  In the case of one scheme, it was work which I thought was magnificent.  After it, the land brought into production grew magnificent crops and relieved the tension that existed among the owners of the land because of the flooding in former years.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us how many are actually engaged in arterial drainage, what the employment roll is and what number of technicians are employed by the Office of Public Works.  I ask him that because of the importance of this national activity in order to enable the people properly to assess the value of the work which arterial drainage can do, provided the funds are available. I should say that it is much more important to provide funds for arterial drainage than for alterations and extensions to this House.  All these may be necessary in one sense but I think these national matters are of more importance.</P>
    <P>I have heard it stated before that the Press representatives in this House are really very badly treated in the way of accommodation.  I hope that if there is anything in the way of alterations or extensions, provision will be made for better quarters for the Press representatives. The Parliamentary Secretary is fortunate in having the goodwill of everybody in this House.  I am confident that he will retain that goodwill and will face up to all the problems, pleasant or difficult, with that pleasantness and efficiency which he has shown here while a member of this House.</P>

      <P>Might I at the outset say that I appreciate the many kind references that have been made to me?  I am very unworthy of them and I can only express the hope that Deputies will always feel the same.  The debate was, I think, on a very high plane.  Most of the Deputies chose to take an objective outlook on the comprehensive work which the Office of Public Works has undertaken.  Their criticism, generally, was constructive and that is as good a tribute as they could pay to the Office itself and I accept it as such.</P>
      <P>All Deputies showed a keen appreciation of the magnitude of the task which the Office of Public Works has to undertake.  They may at times be a little pessimistic if something in their own localities is not going as fast as they would like.  In the main, as I am in a position to know, it is agreed that, taking the overall picture into consideration, the Office of Public Works is doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>As one would expect, the main discussion centred around a few items.  I want to deal briefly with these in a general way before I refer to any of the various points raised by individual Deputies.  I refer to arterial drainage, schools and the Garden of Remembrance and a few other matters which came up for general discussion.  I want to say again that, when I came to the Office of Public Works, I found arterial drainage in an organised, progressive state, working to a priority list &mdash;a prescribed plan which I have no intention of altering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in the event of something materialising which would justify taking a very major decision with regard to any of these projects on that list that I would in any way change my mind but I do not expect any such thing is likely to happen.  I would point out that in regard to a number of schemes nearing the work stage at the same time, one may by-pass the other by a matter of months as a result of the survey, the design work or the preliminary work necessary before the work stage is reached being undertaken or got through in a more expeditious manner than was anticipated. <Col N="1365" /> That does not alter the priority list.  We have no intention of altering that.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to deal with a number of the main criticisms made by Deputies with regard to arterial drainage.  The complaints, if we can call them such, from different parts of the House really amount to the fact that each Deputy would like to have some activity commencing in his area before the time already arranged. Deputy Lynch was the first speaker. He deplored, as he did in previous years, when he was on the back bench&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the lack of activity in his area with regard to all matters pertaining to the Board of Works schemes.  I think he was particularly concerned with the Suir.  I should say, now that I am dealing with arterial drainage, that the survey, the starting of which he asked about, has already begun.</P>

      <P>The Board of Works do not allocate work just on a geographical basis for the sake of satisfying different districts.  In many cases, they act as agents for other Departments and undertake the planning and so forth just as the decisions are reached by those Departments and by the Government.  Might I digress a little from arterial drainage to answer the point always made and which was made this year again by Deputy Lynch?  Perhaps at some other stage all the activities of the Board of Works will be concentrated in Waterford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could happen. I should like to refer to the few matters that were raised specifically in relation to arterial drainage.  I suppose it is no harm to repeat that arterial drainage, as advised by the Drainage Commission, is the only real way of tackling the drainage problem in this country.  While Deputies may interject spicy little pieces of propaganda time and again with regard to <Col N="1366" /> the suspension of the operation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, I believe, as I have said before, that the enactment of that measure was putting the cart before the horse. Frequently, we relieved flooding upstream only to aggravate it downstream. We made no provision for maintenance; the river bed silted up and had to be done over again very shortly afterwards.  While I am not in any way trying to deprecate the efforts of those who were enthusiastic, on both sides of the House, about the Local Authorities (Works) Act, I believe it was premature in that it was undertaken before arterial drainage had reached an advanced stage and in areas where drainage of a minor nature could be undertaken more successfully.  I can see ample opportunities for carrying out local authorities' work in drainage of that type at a future date when we have cleared the big outfalls from the major catchments in the country, and not until then.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the extension of the drainage programme to what are called the intermediate rivers.  That is an important extension. It does not mean that we shall tackle every little stream in the country. When that question was being examined by the Government&mdash;as to how the drainage programme could be extended to take in a smaller catchment&mdash;many Deputies thought that they would have something like a repetition of the local authorities' drainage.  That was not intended but it was appreciated by the Government at the time that there were many rivers not included in what we now call the minor catchment priority list which were very much in need of attention.  These were visualised under the intermediate rivers programme. Surveys have been carried out on four such schemes at present. I think it cannot be regarded as anything other than a very useful extension of the arterial drainage programme which brings in another category of catchment not already catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that I should deal with any of the other points raised in <Col N="1367" /> regard to arterial drainage.  The question of maintenance was raised by some Deputies.  It is a point which arises in the case of some Deputies only after they have experience of arterial drainage in their areas and the question of payment arises.  Kerry is one such county.  Deputy Palmer does not think it right to expect that rated occupiers of holdings in parts of the county far distant from the benefits of the area drained should be asked to contribute to the maintenance of the scheme.  That is a decision which was taken when the 1945 Act was going through this House.  It was thoroughly debated and discussed and it was finally provided in the Act that maintenance would have to be a county-at-large charge in so far as the scheme affected the county.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, when the catchment extends to two or more counties, the charge is apportioned to the counties in proportion to the amount of benefit to land in each county.  I do not think you could have it on the basis of the 1925 Act when you had a charge on the individual owners alone and they were asked to contribute to the scheme.  No individual could be expected to provide the necessary contribution for schemes of the magnitude of the present arterial drainage schemes.  I agree with those who said that not merely can the direct benefits of drainage be taken into consideration in the arterial drainage but the indirect benefits which are sometimes not foreseen at the time the scheme is carried out.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputies who seemed to think we were not making sufficient progress.  Some Deputies referred to the few schemes undertaken. They can scarcely have a full appreciation of the magnitude of the task&mdash;in the first instance, the preparation of a survey of a large catchment, and secondly the amount of work involved in putting a scheme into operation, the amount of technical staff and machinery required, and so forth. They must remember that while only a certain number of jobs have reached the work stage at the moment there are a few about to reach the work <Col N="1368" /> stage and there are others at an advanced stage of survey.  There are quite a few more, like the Suir and the Maigue, on which the survey has just begun, so that the programme is considerably advanced and while there may be only a few schemes completed, there are quite a few on hands.  There are a big number at the survey stage and there are many moving into that stage so that the programme as a whole is very well in hands.</P>
    <P>As time goes on, the cost must grow to a very big figure indeed.  Schemes like the Moy, which only started this year, require only a comparatively small provision in the Estimate but when they reach their peak stage&mdash; particularly in the case of the Moy where it is estimated there will be 700 men employed at the peak stage&mdash;the provision will be huge.  At the same time there will be two or three other schemes proceeding simultaneously so that the Estimate will be for a very large figure.  People who think we are not making sufficient progress must not appreciate the amount of work involved and must have the idea that we have unlimited resources.  The work is proceeding satisfactorily, and I think Deputies will agree that progress is being made.</P>
    <P>Moving away from arterial drainage, I think I should say something about schools.  Some tribute has been paid to the progress made with school building.  Tribute was also paid to the type of school which we are building and there were some contrary views expressed in that regard, too, with respect to the type and standard of schools.  It is perfectly obvious that there are two different views in regard to the type and standard of school that we should have.  One body of opinion thinks that a school should be an elaborate and substantial type of building, paying due regard to the important work for which it is utilised, the training of youth.  There is another section which seems to think that any sort of utility building is sufficient as long as it houses the pupils and provides accommodation so that the work can be carried on.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly obvious that the architects of the Commissioners of Public <Col N="1369" /> Works have tried to strike a balance between those views.  They appreciate that a school cannot be an austere, utility building.  They realise that the resources at their disposal must be utilised to provide as many schools as possible but between the two they have struck, as I say, a balance where they build what I consider to be a decent type of school, a well-planned building worthy of the important work for which it is utilised and of which the nation can be proud.  We could build a much more elaborate building which could be a much better school if we wanted to spend more money but we have to take the middle of the road as between the question of the funds available for the work and the importance of the architectural design which should, I believe, be applied to school buildings in particular.</P>
    <P>The number of schools built during the year just ended was somewhat less than last year's figure.  The difference is very little really and the number is not the only measure or yardstick to be applied to progress in regard to schools.  The actual amount spent was higher than ever before expended on school building.  I would remind Deputies who complained about lack of progress that it was three times what was spent 10 years ago.</P>
    <P>There is a better comparison one can make in regard to progress in school building in the past year.  The number built is not a real measure because if you are building many large schools naturally the number will be less.  I am advised by the Commissioners that the average school built gives accommodation to 104 pupils&mdash; 104 places.  Taking that average, and applying it to the amount of places we provided last year, we would have 121 such schools.  That is a good picture of the progress made last year, a much better picture than the actual number of schools involved.  I think it is a very good record and I hope we can maintain it or even surpass it in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The number of schools completed within the year does not itself indicate all the activity in regard to school building during the year.  If we were <Col N="1370" /> to count the number of schools on which the Office of Public Works were engaged in carrying out work during the year, it would amount to 280 new schools and 165 in respect of major improvements, improvements costing over £1,000.  That gives a better picture of actual activity in school work in the year.  Sometimes we are inclined to think the number of schools completed represents the total progress in school-building for the year.  The number which will reach the completion stage during the year is what we are giving as our programme for the year and we hope that will be in or about the target of 100&mdash;or better, if possible.</P>
    <P>In passing from schools, I should say that we are at all times concerned with and all those in the Office of Public Works associated with the building of schools are at all times considering, ways and means of expediting school-building.  We are going as fast as the technical staff at our disposal permits at the moment.  We are not hamstrung for funds; we could get more money to build more schools if we could turn out the plans and get the work going.  It is very popular to complain about delay in building schools and those Deputies who complain&mdash;as probably I did in the past when I was less intimate with the work of the Office than I am now&mdash; should realise that while the Office of Public Works is always the scapegoat, it is not always responsible for the delays.  I say that without trying to cast aspersions on any other section or body but, of necessity, from the day the manager decides that he should have a new school until the key is turned in the door, my Office is held to be the cause of the delay.  That is far from correct.  Many things happen for which we are not responsible&mdash;difficulties in procuring sites, getting proper title, decisions as to accommodation to be provided.</P>
    <P>Somebody complained that we should always provide extra accommodation. That is a matter for the Department of Education and I understand they always give it the utmost consideration.  That necessarily involves a certain amount of delay also.  They <Col N="1371" /> must take into consideration the pupil potential in the district in the future. They do that and, by and large, they are fairly accurate.  It would not be correct, as some Deputies suggested, to build an extra room to the school because we have cases where rooms have to be closed down and we have cases where additional rooms have to be provided, in rural Ireland.  I opened an additional room in Galway last year.  Even though the school had been built only a short time before, there was an unprecedented increase in the number of pupils coming there. In fact, on that day, the manager suggested that they would probably put on a fourth room, so that it is not always possible to estimate accurately, nor would it be possible to have an extra room because numbers may diminish and you may find the extra accommodation is not necessary.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about a matter which is of great importance and was not very much discussed except at the outset of the debate.  That is the question of the restoration of Kilmainham Jail.  Some Deputies paid tribute to the body undertaking the voluntary work of restoring this great national monument and I was very glad they did so because on the goodwill and enthusiasm of the public will the success of this committee depend. I should like to appeal again, as I did in my opening statement, that the committee be given the full support of everybody for the very worthy project they are undertaking.</P>
    <P>I was sorry that Deputy Corish saw fit to make a kind of adverse criticism on the question of voluntary labour. Whether one agrees or not with the propriety of voluntary labour, I think this is one case where sentiment and patriotism should transcend any other consideration.  Voluntary labour in this case is purely voluntary and the effort is not prompted by anybody other than those who took a decision&mdash; a purely spontaneous decision&mdash;to do a job that might not be reached by the Government for a long time, due to the huge programme which the Office of Public Works has in hands.</P>
    <P>Kilmainham Jail is a huge building with long associations with Irish <Col N="1372" /> history.  If this committee succeeds in restoring it as a national monument, and preserving it as an historical museum, it will be one of the greatest national monuments we have.  There are very excellent people on this committee, people prompted by nothing more than the highest ideals of patriotism.  They deserve the full support of everyone who has any interest at all in the struggle that took place down through the years for freedom.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Corish referred to voluntary labour, I know that he was referring to the principle of voluntary labour as such.  Every man, whether he be a technician or a labourer, should be anxious, in my opinion, to get his name on the list of those who are aiding the committee, by voluntary effort on their part, to carry out the huge task they have undertaken. All the workers, from the architects down, are voluntary.  The Minister has given them a period of five years to see how work will progress. Certain conditions have been laid down.  One of these is that the Minister nominates two trustees of his own. There are certain other provisions to ensure that the work for which the committee is organised is the work which will actually be carried out. The work will be subject to review, or examination, as it progresses.  I have dealt with it at some length in order to bring home the importance of the kind of co-operation that is needed if the task is to succeed.  It will succeed only with the co-operation of all sections and with the assistance of everybody who is in a position to help in any way.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the Garden of Remembrance and some speakers were anxious to know whether it was to be a Garden of Remembrance commemorating just a section of those who gave their lives for freedom, or whether it would commemorate all who gave their lives.  It will commemorate all.  It will be a Garden of Remembrance commemorating all those who gave their lives. I do not pretend to be competent to explain the plan fully to the House. <Col N="1373" /> It will be cruciform, carrying one large statue and four smaller ones. The sculptured monument will represent Éire and the four supporting warriors will represent the Provinces, with the patriots in the background. From what I know of the plans and the design, I can say that it will be truly worthy of those whom it seeks to commemorate.  I believe it will find general approval.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will be possible to deal with all the individual matters raised.  Indeed, in some cases, had the Deputies seen fit to write to me, I could have given them all the information they required.  Deputy Loughman, and some others, were anxious to know the position in relation to the Suir. The survey of the Suir, as I have already stated, has commenced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon dealt with national monuments.  Like many of those who spoke, he took the figure in the Estimate for salaries and wages, £6,000 odd, as the figure for the upkeep and preservation of these monuments. Under Subhead C. there is a provision of £20,000 for national monuments. It is not, of course, sufficient, but it is far in excess of the £6,000 which some Deputies seemed to believe was the sole provision made for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon put his finger on the position when he said there was no country in the world richer in its archaeology than this country.  Remembering that, it is easy to get some grasp of the huge task of preservation.  It would be impossible for the Office of Public Works to take over all the monuments and other archaeological treasures.  They do the best they can with the staff and funds at their disposal.</P>
    <P>It is generally believed that we get considerable assistance in this work from voluntary societies.  That is true up to a point.  Societies are active in co-operating with the Office of Public Works and bringing to their notice monuments worthy of preservation. In one way, that is not altogether helpful since it makes the task more involved and difficult.  In fairness to these societies, they do in their own districts often spend money on preservation or protection work <Col N="1374" /> where a monument has not yet been taken over by the Office of Public Works.  When the Office of Public Works makes a preservation order, that does not necessarily mean that they undertake to restore the monument or to preserve it.  It merely has the result of ensuring that the monument will not thereafter be interfered with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to monuments which were carried away to build fences and cowhouses.  That has happened, but, by and large, the more important monuments are the subject of preservation orders.  Many of them have been restored and a good deal of preservation work has been done on most of them.  The amount at the disposal of the Office, £20,000, is nothing like what would be necessary if we were to undertake the entire task of restoration and preservation. One has to consider how far one can go side by side with providing technical staffs and the finances necessary for other work, such as school building, drainage and so forth. However important the archaeological side is, any all-out effort generally to undertake restoration of all the worthwhile monuments we have must wait until other work which is entitled to greater priority is nearing completion or has at least reached the stage where we can say it is no longer a problem.</P>
    <P>The National Monuments Advisory Council is a statutory body set up by the Minister to advise him and to advise the Commissioners on the question of national monuments generally. They meet quarterly and have a standing committee which is always available and has done immense work. They are a form of buffer between the public and the Office of Public Works as regards those monuments that are worth while taking over for restoration and preservation and those that are not.</P>
    <P>I do not want to talk at any length about the rather veiled reference made by Deputy Lindsay to property disposed of by the Office of Public Works on which he said a profit was made afterwards.  Personally I do not know to what property he referred.  Possibly it was machinery sold by public <Col N="1375" /> auction.  I am not quite sure but I shall probably find out later.  However, all I can say is that any property disposed of by the Office of Public Works is advertised.  When there is any quantity it is disposed of by public auction.  If there are only individual items the property would be disposed of by tender, when it would not be feasible or practicable to have an auction.  It is always duly advertised and, so far as I am aware, auctions held are, as with all auctions, quite successful.  There may be people who would go to these auctions and pick up an item, as one will any time at an auction, and make a profit on it afterwards but I am sure the Minister or myself cannot be blamed for that.</P>

      <P>That is possibly the best advertisement an auctioneer can have.  If he has the reputation of giving a bargain people will turn up in greater numbers in future to buy more.  However, while there may be an occasional bargain you do not always get a bargain at an auction.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies asked questions about Garda barracks, whether the work had commenced or was about to commence.  In some cases it is a question of tenders not yet being invited and in other cases the tenders have been invited and the contract is about to be placed.  It would not be possible to deal with all cases individually. If Deputies would drop me a note, as is usual for them to do, I shall be only too glad to give the necessary information.  Deputy McQuillan, for instance, inquired about the Roscommon Garda Station. Tenders for the erection of that station have just been received and are being examined.</P>

    <P>Deputy Giles was worried about our departure from the priority list in regard to the Boyne drainage scheme. I can assure him, as I assured a deputation in that connection, that there will be no deviation from the priority list as set out.  The Boyne will <Col N="1376" /> take its place in the list unless something unforeseen happens such as the Summit talks not going according to plan or an atomic bomb dropping on the Boyne.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Deputy Lindsay was one of the Deputies who inquired about portraits and busts of national leaders and I have a summary made out in regard to them.  The works include a reproduction in bronze of busts of Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack.  The Brugha bust was the work of the late Oliver Sheppard and the Stack bust was the work of the late Albert Power.  There is also the casting in bronze from plaster models of busts of Thomas J. Clarke and Seán Mac Diarmada.  These models were the work of the late Albert Power. Also included are the design and supply of two copies in bronze of a bust of Thomas McDonagh by Oisin Kelly; the design and supply of two copies in bronze of a bust of Joseph Plunkett by Peter Grant; the design and supply of two copies in bronze of a bust of Eamonn Ceannt by John Bourke; the design and supply of two copies in bronze of a bust of James Connolly by Seamus Murphy; and the purchase of a portrait of the President by the late Leo Whelan.  The painting of portraits of Mr. W.T. Cosgrave and Mr. J.A. Costello by Seán O'Sullivan has been commissioned, and the painting of a portrait of Mr. Robert Barton by Mrs. Hilda Robberts Marsh has also been commissioned.</P>
      <P>The bronze busts referred to have been completed and delivered and may be seen at the Office of Public Works. Any Deputy may call at any time and we shall show them to him with pleasure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the work at Dún Laoghaire harbour, which we all agree is most necessary work. It has been undertaken in stages and, although only half the work is completed at the moment, already it provides a very necessary amenity for cross-channel passengers.  We have heard criticism about the amenities there from time to time.  Deputy Jones, I think, complained that he was not permitted to go on the pier when seeing somebody off.  Since these works were undertaken, the Office of Public Works have had to make a very hard and fast rule about letting people on the pier while work is in progress. From time to time, Deputies have approached me for permission and we have been able to arrange it specially for some of them.  However, if the pier were to be left open to those accompanying passengers, the work could not possibly be carried out.  But the work will be completed one day and the amenities there will be considerably enhanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Deputy inquired about the survey of the Maigue catchment.  That work has already commenced.  A Deputy wanted to know, I think, if the Minister was honouring the pledge given to a deputation some time ago that the survey of the Maigue would start this year.  I can assure Deputies <Col N="1379" /> that it has already started.  It may not be long started but it has started, and that is the important thing.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I want to thank Deputies for the very constructive way they approached the Vote generally. They made allowance for the fact that this was my first time introducing this Vote.  I am sure there are many matters on which I may not have given them all the information they would have liked, but I hope they will bear with me.  I should like to pay a tribute to the staff of the Office of Public Works.  They have given me all the co-operation one could wish for.  Sometimes they are accused of delay by unthinking people, but I have found every individual, from the top down, most anxious to ensure that the work is carried out satisfactorily and expeditiously.  With that approach, I have no doubt that the big programme we have on hand, and which seems to be becoming larger every year, will be undertaken with the utmost expedition.</P>

      <P>The Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes makes provision for the annual programme of employment schemes to give work to men in receipt of unemployment assistance in urban and rural areas, including towns with a population of 200 and over; and for other services such as Bog Development Schemes, Rural Improvements Schemes and miscellaneous schemes, including minor marine works and archaeological excavations.  Provision is also made in the Vote for the salaries, travelling and other incidental expenses of the staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office, who are responsible for the administration of the Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the practice of my predecessors for a number of years in dealing with this Vote to give a résumé of the work done in the preceding financial year, and I propose to do likewise.  The gross estimate last year was £856,530, to which should be added a sum of £1,550 transferred <Col N="1382" /> from the Vote for Remuneration, giving the figure of £858,080, as appears on page 48 of the Estimates Volume.  In addition, there was, however, a sum of £21,469&mdash;being the unexpended balances of previous years' allocations from the National Development Fund&mdash;available for expenditure, bringing the gross total to £879,549. The expenditure in the financial year just closed is estimated at £859,210, which is 98% of the gross provision.</P>
    <P>To give a comparative picture of the operations of the Special Employment Schemes Office in recent years, I have made available to Deputies a tabular statement giving particulars of the expenditure under the various subheads of the Vote for 1956/57, 1957/58 and 1958/59; the estimated expenditure for 1959/60; as well as the provision proposed for these services in 1960/61.  In this schedule I have shown the estimated balance of £16,000 still available for expenditure from the National Development Fund, and earmarked for urban schemes. This figure does not appear in the Estimates Volume; as, when the estimates were being prepared some months ago, it was expected that all these balances would have been expended.  It is anticipated now that only about £5,000 of last year's expenditure will have to be met from the National Development Fund balances, leaving £16,000 still available in the Fund for 1960/61.</P>
    <P>The grants under Subheads E, F and G for Urban, Rural and Minor Employment Schemes are related to the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each area.  A census is taken annually in the third week of January by the Special Employment Schemes Office of the number of these men, as well as the number of persons in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit, in each of the 60 urban areas, 477 non-urbanised towns with a population of 200 and over, and 2,875 rural electoral divisions in the country.  This week was selected as it approximates the peak period of unemployment, by which date persons who have received only seasonal employment around the Christmas period have returned to the unemployment register.  This census <Col N="1383" /> also includes, in addition to the men drawing unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance benefit, men who had been in receipt of such payments but who were working on Special Employment Schemes Office works during a particular week.</P>
    <P>The 1960 census gives a total of 30,521 men in receipt of unemployment assistance, compared with 35,492 in January, 1959&mdash;a reduction of 14%.  The 1957 figure was 35,116. The drop in 1960 compared with 1959 was greatest in urban areas, the urban figures being 9,357 for 1960 compared with 12,006 in 1959, a reduction of 22%.  The figures for rural areas were 19,746 in 1960 and 22,036 in 1959, a reduction of 10%.  There was little change in the figures for small towns with a population of 200 and over, the figures being 1,418 for 1960 and 1,450 for 1959.  The over-all reduction was, as already stated, 14%.  Including persons in receipt of unemployment benefit, the census figures were: 66,363 in 1960, 74,929 in 1959, 76,962 in 1958 and 84,098 in 1957.  There is, therefore, a reduction of 11½% in the total figure for 1960 compared with 1959; and a reduction of 21%, or more than one-fifth, if the 1960 figure is compared with the 1957 figure of U.A. and U.I.B. combined.  The drop was greatest in the urban areas, the figures being 21,601, urban, in 1960 compared with 25,916 in 1959, a reduction of 16½%; 4,919 in towns with a population of 200 and over in 1960 compared with 5,792 in 1959&mdash;a reduction of 15%; whereas the rural area figures were 39,843 in 1960 and 43,221 in 1959, a reduction of 7¾%.  The over-all reduction was 11½%, as already stated.</P>
    <P>The number of unemployment assistance recipients who were employed on the Special Employment Schemes Office works during the census week ended 23rd January, 1960 was 1,942; and persons in receipt of unemployment benefit were 556, giving a total of 2,498.  The corresponding figures last year were 2,081 U.A., 652 U.I.B., 2,733 total.  The bulk of the employment given under this Vote is in the winter period and, therefore, the <Col N="1384" /> number of persons employed varies considerably during the year.  The peak period in 1959/60 was during the week ended the 19th December, 1959, when 5,212 men were employed, of whom 919 were in urban areas, 466 in non-urbanised towns and 3,827 in rural electoral divisions.  The lowest number was 815, during week ended 7th November, 1959, of whom 122 were in the urban areas, none in non-urbanised towns and 693 in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Subheads A, B, C and D provide for salaries, travelling and office expenses of the Special Employment Schemes Office.  The increase of £2,500 in the provision for Subhead A in 1960/61 is accounted for mainly by the necessity to provide for a full year for the increased pay for the Civil Service granted as from 15th December, 1959; and to a lesser extent by the normal incremental progression in the scales of pay.  These increases total £5,500 approximately, but they will to an extent be offset by the replacement of some senior officers by more junior personnel.  There is a small increase in the estimate for travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>Subhead E, Urban Employment Schemes, provides for works in the four county borough areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and 55 other urban districts.  The grants are administered through the Department of Local Government, and are conditional on the local authorities submitting suitable work schemes for approval by the Special Employment Schemes Office, and making contributions towards their cost.  The local contribution is 20% in the case of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, i.e., one-fifth; 17% or one-sixth in Cork and Limerick; 14% or one-seventh in Waterford, and it averaged 12% in the 55 other urban districts, varying between 5% and 17% in the different towns.  A sum of £227,000 was provided in the Vote for these urban schemes in 1959/60; but, in view of the balances available from the National Development Fund, it was decided to make a sum of £235,000 available for new works last year. This was allocated as follows: <Col N="1385" /> £120,000 to Dublin, £18,000 to Cork, £17,000 to Limerick, £8,000 to Waterford, £6,000 to Dún Laoghaire and £66,000 to the other 55 urban areas. The estimated expenditure last year amounted to £231,740.</P>
    <P>Employment schemes are ordinarily concentrated in the winter period, but the Dublin schemes are proceeded with the whole year round&mdash;each U.A. man getting a 12 weeks' spell of employment.  The unemployment assistance recipients' census figure for Dublin was 4,712 in January, 1960, compared with 6,480 in January, 1959, and 5,889 in January, 1957.  Half the urban unemployment assistance recipients are, in fact, concentrated in the Dublin area.  Dublin Corporation were notified on the 13th October, 1959, that a State grant of £120,000 was available for new works costing £150,000, subject to a contribution of £30,000.  Schemes to absorb the full amount were duly approved, of which £20,000 was for the improvement of footpaths and laneways, £95,500 for road works at the North Wall, Cabra, Kimmage, Terenure and other areas of the city, and the remainder, £34,500 was for park development and other amenity schemes, including £24,000 for further work in St. Anne's Park, Dollymount, £3,300 for the development of an open space at Templeogue Road, £3,200 for a playground at Ringsend, and £3,500 for ancillary works at Sundrive Park Stadium.  During the last financial year, work was also proceeded with on schemes approved in previous years, including the development of Bushy Park, Terenure, costing £36,000 and which is now completed; earlier works in St. Anne's Park, Dollymount, costing £26,000, and remedial works on the Little Dargle River, costing £37,500, as well as the main Sundrive Park and Stadium scheme.</P>
    <P>The average number of men employed weekly on the schemes last year in Dublin was 167, of whom 115 were unemployment assistance recipients. The numbers varied during the year from a peak total of 235 to 90, of whom 175 and 37 respectively were unemployment assistance recipients. <Col N="1386" /> As the unemployment assistance personnel of the gangs are changed at the end of a twelve weeks' period of employment, some 450 Dublin fathers of families each got a twelve weeks' spell of employment in the year.  The amount which will be allocated to the Dublin County Borough area in 1960/61 has, of course, not yet been determined at this early date, but, notwithstanding the substantial reduction in the number of unemployment assistance recipients, it should not be very far short of last year's figure.</P>
    <P>The Cork Corporation were notified on the 5th October of a State allocation of £18,000 for new schemes, subject to a contribution of £3,600, one-sixth of the total £21,600.  Schemes to absorb the full allocation were approved, of which £16,000 approximately was for various road works, £4,000 for the partial development of an open space near Mayfield housing scheme, and the remainder, £1,600, for the clearance of a derelict site at Friars Walk and the improvement of the junction at Blarney Street and Shandon Street.  The allocation of £17,000, conditional on a contribution of £3,400, total £20,400, was not wholly absorbed by the Limerick County Borough.  Road works costing £14,650 were approved, and amenity schemes absorbed £4,250, including the erection of walls at Ballinacurra, Weston and Island Road, the extension of a playing pitch at Caledonian Place and the re-surfacing of an area at Mill Road&mdash;leaving a small balance of £1,500 which must now be regarded as cancelled.</P>
    <P>Waterford Corporation submitted schemes to absorb their allocation of £8,000 State grant, £1,335 local contribution, £9,335 total.  Of the approved schemes, £6,815 was for road works, and the balance, £2,520, was for amenity schemes, including the provision of an entrance to the recreation ground at Poleberry, the laying out of an open space at Hennessy's Road, and the improvement of the surrounds of Reginald's Tower.  Dún Laoghaire also absorbed the full allocation of £7,500 being a State grant of £6,000 and a local contribution <Col N="1387" /> of £1,500, that is one-fifth of the total.  The works were all amenity schemes, including further development work in the park at Williamstown, laying out park at Ashgrove-Birchgrove housing scheme, which absorbed £4,230 of the allocation, and the remainder was for the improvement of bathing facilities at Sandycove harbour.</P>
    <P>The allocation for the fifty-five other urban districts amounted to £66,000 State grant, £9,095 local contribution, £75,095 total.  The grants varied between £250 in towns with less than ten unemployment assistance recipients, such as Bundoran, Castlebar, Carrickmacross and Templemore, providing for only a few weeks' work for the unemployment assistance men at Christmas time; and £4,900 for Drogheda, £4,700 for Tralee, £4,300 each for Dundalk and Wexford, £3,700 for Sligo, £3,500 for Galway, £2,800 for Kilkenny, £2,400 for Clonmel and £2,300 for Bray, etc., in the larger urban areas.  The maximum number of weeks employment which may be given to an individual unemployment assistance recipient in urban areas other than Dublin is eight: as already stated, twelve weeks are allowed in the case of Dublin unemployment assistance recipients.</P>
    <P>The full allocations were absorbed in all these urban areas, and the works approved included £38,800 for road works and £10,500 for footpaths.  The remaining £16,700 of the £66,000 State grant was utilised for various amenity schemes, such as the development of parks, open spaces, derelict sites, retaining walls and car parks. The distribution of the available money for the new financial year in the County Boroughs and other urban districts has not yet been determined. It will, however, be on the usual basis, related to the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each individual area.</P>
    <P>The amount in Subhead F, Rural Employment Schemes, was £35,000 in each of the last three years, and this provision is being repeated for 1960/61. These schemes have in recent years <Col N="1388" /> been confined to non-urbanised towns with a population of 200 and over. The grants are made available to the county councils concerned, who are required to contribute a quarter of the cost, so that a total of £46,665 is available for expenditure.  The schemes are usually carried out in the weeks immediately preceding Christmas, and the allocation for each town irea in nearly all cases is between £200 and £300. 156 of the 477 town areas got small grants last year, and there were not sufficient unemployment assistance recipients in the other 321 areas to warrant an allocation.  There were, in fact, only 171 unemployment assistance recipients scattered among the other 321 town areas.  The approved works consisted mainly of footpaths in the towns and environs, but other items were also included such as minor road works, removing hedges, planting shrubs, development of parks and cleaning of streams.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead G, minor employment scheme are carried out in the period November to March, and are intended to give employment to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance in rural areas.  The works consist of the repair and reconstruction of accommodation roads to farmers' houses, lands and bogs, in areas in which there are substantial numbers of unemployment assistance recipients&mdash;commonly known as the congested districts.  The unit of distribution is the electoral division, of which there are 2,875 in the whole country.  These full-cost grants are, however, given only in about 400 of the electoral divisions, of which last year 14 were in Cavan, on the borders of Leitrim and Longford; 10 in Clare, all on the sea coast; 10 in West Cork, mainly in the Beara peninsula adjacent to Kerry; 85 in Donegal, mainly in the western half of the county; 37 in Galway, west of a line going north and south through Galway city; 50 in Kerry, mainly on the sea coast and bordering Limerick; 35 in Leitrim, scattered throughout the five rural districts; 8 in Limerick, all on the Kerry Border; 12 in Longford, on the Leitrim border; 92 in Mayo, on the sea coast and in the Rural District of <Col N="1389" /> Swinford, adjoining Sligo and Roscommon; 9 in Roscommon, all in Castlerea Rural District on the border of Mayo; and 28 in Sligo, on the sea coast and on the borders of the Rural Districts of Swinford in Mayo and Castierea in Roscommon.</P>
    <P>Drainage schemes cannot be carried out economically in the winter period, and they are not, therefore, suitable minor employment schemes.  Schemes under this subhead are, therefore, confined to road works.  Farmers who benefit by getting a good road to their houses, lands and bogs are expected to give road materials free, if such are available on their lands.  As the schemes are for the benefit of unemployment assistance recipients residing in the vicinity of the work, the farmers are not themselves eligible for work on these schemes, unless they happen to be on the highest scales of unemployment assistance in the immediate neighbourhood. There still appears to be some misunderstanding on this point in some areas of the country, and I am, therefore, emphasising that the fact that a farmer happens to reside on a road to be repaired gives him no claim to work on the scheme.  886 schemes were approved last year to absorb the expenditure of £130,000, and approximately 15,250 families were served by these works to their houses, lands or bogs.  The provision for the new year for this service is the same, that is to say, £130,000.</P>
    <P>Subhead H, the Bog Development Schemes subhead, makes provision for road, drainage and other works to facilitate the production of turf by landholders and other private producers. The expenditure on this scheme was £99,177 in 1956/57, £156,266 in 1957/58, £158,240 in 1958/59, and it is estimated at £161,050 in 1959/60. Any excess expenditure over the £160,000 provision will be met from the National Development Fund balances.  There were 1,184 schemes approved last year, of which 511 representing an expenditure of £57,000 approximately, were drainage works, and 673 were road works costing £103,000 approximately.  Some 33,000 families in all were facilitated, 11,000 by drainage works and 22,000 by road <Col N="1390" /> works.  Bog drainage works are done under this subhead in all parts of the country.  The road works financed from the bog development subhead are confined to the areas outside the congested districts.  Bog road works in the latter areas are financed from the Minor Employment Schemes subhead, and not the Bog Development Schemes subhead.  Although these bog development schemes are not primarily intended to give employment, they give useful work to the unemployed in the various areas.  Priority in employment for these schemes is given to unemployment assistance recipients or persons in receipt of unemployment benefit in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>On subhead I, the Rural Improvements Scheme, is a contributory scheme, and makes provision for grants towards the cost of carrying out works to benefit the lands of two or more farmers, such as small drainage schemes, bridges and the repair or reconstruction of accommodation roads to farmers' houses, lands and bogs.  It applies to all parts of the country, irrespective of the unemployment position. It is the only scheme available for the improvement of farm roads outside the congested districts, and for the smaller types of land drainage works in all areas.  Road schemes can also be done in the congested districts under the Rural Improvements Scheme in cases where the beneficiaries are prepared to contribute towards the cost.  Works of a better and more durable standard are done under this contributory scheme, than are done under Minor Employment Schemes, where, in many instances, the small numbers of unemployment assistance recipients limit the amount of money that can be made available.</P>
    <P>The history of this scheme from 1943 to date was outlined by my predecessor in his introductory statement last year&mdash;columns 474-475 of Dáil Debates of 26th May, 1959&mdash;and I do not think it necessary to repeat that information to-day.  The expenditure under this scheme was £238,639 in 1956/57, £194,654 in 1957/58, £169,088 in 1958/59, and will, it is expected, exceed £198,000 in the year just closed. Although some 771 schemes, costing <Col N="1391" /> £200,000 were approved in 1958/59, expenditure, as will be seen, was less than that sum, mainly owing to the very bad weather in 1958.  A sum of £200,000 was available in 1959/60 and almost the full amount was allocated; 719 new schemes, costing £196,800, were authorised, of which 191 schemes, costing £31,030, were drainage works, and 528 schemes, costing £165,770, were road works.  All schemes for which the contribution was forthcoming were, in fact, authorised for execution.</P>
    <P>The minimum contribution is 10 per cent. for farmers with an average land valuation of below £6.  The scale increases in accordance with the average land valuation of the benefiting farmers, being 12½ per cent. contribution for valuations averaging between £6 and £7; 15 per cent. for valuations of £7 to £8; 17½ per cent. contribution for £8 to £10; 20 per cent. contribution for £10 to £12; 22½ per cent. for £12 to £15; 25 per cent. for £15 to £18; 30 per cent. for £18 to £25; 35 per cent. for £25 to £50; 40 per cent. for £50 to £100 and, in the case of farmers with an average land valuation of over £100, the State pays half the cost and the farmers pay the other half.  A provision of £200,000 is made available again for this service in 1960/61.</P>
    <P>On subhead J, the provision for Miscellaneous Schemes was £15,000 in each of the last three years, and the same provision is being made for the new year.  The expenditure last year will, it is estimated, amount to approximately £14,000.  This subhead meets expenditure on minor marine works, towards the cost of which County Councils are required to contribute, and which they are required to maintain on completion.  The subhead also finances archaeological excavations and other miscellaneous schemes, such as sportsfields.  About £2,850 was spent on archaeological excavations last year, of which £1,100 was for work at Tara, £740 at Dooey, Co. Donegal, £415 in Rear Cross, Co. Tipperary, £290 each on Dalkey Island and Bohanagh, Co. Cork and a small item of £35 in connection with excavations <Col N="1392" /> at Shannon airport.  Other works authorised during the year included £3,150 for foreshore protection works in Wicklow, £550 for the completion of sportsfields at Lahinch and Listowel and £515 for a road to a coal mine in Co. Roscommon.  During recent weeks, provisional commitments, subject to the necessary contributions being made by the County Councils concerned, have been made against this year's provision, totalling £7,500, in respect of minor marine works at Dursey Island in Co. Cork and Cleggan and Mullaghglass in Co. Galway.</P>
    <P>The Appropriations-in-Aid subhead is made up almost entirely of the contributions in respect of the Rural Improvements Scheme, which amounted to £32,370 in 1959/60.  It also includes receipts in respect of development works on privately owned bogs, the County Councils' contributions towards the cost of minor marine works, and the sale of surplus stores. A figure of £35,000 is included in the Estimates&mdash;the same as last year's.</P>
    <P>In addition to the works financed from Vote 10, the Special Employment Schemes Office acts as agent of the Minister for Transport and Power in respect of the carrying out of development works to facilitate the output of turf for the four hand-won turf generating stations at Caherciveen, Co. Kerry; Miltown Malbay, Co. Clare; Screebe, Co. Galway, and Gweedore, Co. Donegal.  They are financed from a National Development Fund allocation of £80,000 at the disposal of that Minister.  New works, costing £8,000, were approved last year, of which £4,000 approximately was in Donegal, £2,600 in Clare, and £1,400 in Kerry.  The expenditure last year is estimated at £7,000, and the total expenditure to date out of the £80,000 is £21,000.</P>
    <P>The Special Employment Schemes Office also acts as agent for the Minister for the Gaeltacht in respect of the carrying out of accommodation road works in Gaeltacht areas, financed from the Vote of that Department. New works costing £18,200 were authorised in 1959/60, of which £8,350 was in Galway, £7,300 in Donegal, nearly £2,000 in Mayo, and £300 each in Cork and Kerry. <Col N="1393" /> Deputies may recall that in 1958/59, although works costing £40,000 had been approved, the expenditure that year amounted to only about £24,000. Including new sanctions, the expenditure in 1959/60 on these schemes amounted in all to £33,000 approximately, of which £12,000 was in Galway, £9,200 in Donegal, £8,750 in Mayo, £1,850 in Kerry and £1,110 in Cork.  The expenditure on the Gaeltacht schemes, and on the works for the benefit of the turf-fired generating stations will, of course, be accounted for by the Minister for the Gaeltacht and by the Minister for Transport and Power respectively, and not by the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
    <P>In the earlier part of this introductory statement, I referred to the substantial reduction in the number of unemployed this year as compared with last year&mdash;14 per cent. in respect of unemployment assistance recipients; or 13 per cent. if the figure is compared with January, 1957. Taking unemployment assistance recipients and unemployment insurance benefit claimants together, the reductions were 11½ and 21 per cent. respectively. Notwithstanding this reduction, Deputies will see that the provisions for these services in 1960/61 are substantially the same as last year's.  These schemes are not, of course, the answer to the unemployment problem.  They do, however, provide very real benefits as an adjunct to the system of direct Social Welfare payments, by giving spells of manual work at normal rates of wages to men with the highest number of dependants, who, in many cases, have been unemployed for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>I have referred in some detail in this statement to the various works of public utility which have been undertaken under these schemes in Dublin and other town areas.  Rural Deputies are familiar with the benefits which accrue to farmers under the Minor Employment Schemes, Bog Development Schemes and Rural Improvements Schemes, and these schemes need no further emphasis from me.  As I said in the statement <Col N="1394" /> made by me on the Vote on Account on the 8th March, I consider that, having regard to other commitments totalling almost £123,500,000 as shown in the Book of Estimates, reasonable provision has been made for these schemes in the current year, and I commend the Estimate accordingly for the consideration of the House.</P>
    <P>That is what I think is a reasonably detailed statement on Vote No. 10 in relation to the Special Employment Schemes Office.  If Deputies tried to follow me, and if I did not go too quickly, I think they will find most of the information there that they require.  At the same time, I do not want to stifle discussion.  I shall try to give information to any Deputy who wishes to raise points I may not have covered in what I think is a detailed statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few criticisms to make of the system, not of the Parliamentary Secretary.  He gave us a list of the contributions demanded, according to valuation, under the Rural Improvements Scheme.  I feel that in the lower regions of these valuations, the contribution should be removed altogether.  I do not think it fair to ask landholders under £10 valuation for a contribution under a Rural Improvements Scheme.  Whatever about the higher valuations, the lower valuations should be exempt, because in most cases the contribution seems to be too heavy for their purses. Therefore, the people concerned must leave undone work on the by-road going into their houses or on necessary drainage.  That is the position, even though in most cases the contribution required under a Rural Improvements Scheme seems not to be too heavy.  In the case of people up to £10 valuation, a full cost grant should be given.  It would help to stem the flight from the land and prevent much of the closing-up of houses in rural areas because small holdings are no longer able to hold youngsters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contributors should get first preference for work on Rural Improvements Schemes.  After contributing to a scheme, it is pretty galling not to get <Col N="1395" /> work on it.  I know that many contributors look forward to employment on the job.  It is clear that contributors, if employed on the job, will put their utmost energies and wits into it.  Surely that is plain commonsense.</P>
    <P>I desire to pay a tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary's engineers in the head office and down the country. Their work on Rural Improvements Schemes is a credit to them.  When a by-road or a link road is put into first-class order under a Rural Improvements Scheme, it is a pity that, in view of modern traffic conditions, the Special Employment Schemes Office does not complete the job by spraying tar on the surface.  As such a good job is made of it, spraying with tar would make it permanent.  That may seem as if I am flying my kite too high, but I assure the Parliamentary Secretary it would help to maintain people on the land and prevent recurring expenditure on the same road every seven to ten years.</P>
    <P>With regard to Minor Employment Schemes, I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary not to allow a Minor Employment Scheme or drainage to take place in winter.  It is acknowledged even by men who work on such schemes to be a waste of time.  You cannot do a satisfactory drainage job when the drains are full of water.  It is better to wait until later in the year.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that such work does not take place in winter but some does.  While some drainage jobs may be done in winter where there is an outfall for the surface water, I submit that in other cases it is a waste of money. The employment would be the same in the dry season and a good drainage job would be done.</P>
    <P>As the Government have closed down completely on the Local Authorities (Works) Act under which very useful work was done, the Parliamentary Secretary should provide more money for drainage under Rural Improvements Schemes and Minor Employment Schemes.  Land reclamation work under the Department of Agriculture was in many cases held up because there was no outfall for <Col N="1396" /> the water.  County councils were doing excellent work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and were allowing a lot of land to be drained under the Land Reclamation Scheme.</P>
    <P>As the Government have suspended the operation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, I submit that until they restore its operation, the responsibility devolves on the Parliamentary Secretary because the Special Employment Schemes Office is now the only office that can undertake the work dropped by the county councils under that Act. In many cases, the work of the Land Reclamation section of the Department of Agriculture is held up because there is no outfall for the water.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to spend more money on drainage, particularly between February and October, under both Minor Employment Schemes and Rural Improvements Schemes.</P>
    <P>In all cases, the work done, certainly as far as roads are concerned, is a credit.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials to consider the link road: I am not talking of the cul-de-sac.  Sometimes it is very difficult to get a grant to repair a link road. The present position is absolutely unfair to people who happen to live along a link road used by outsiders for different purposes.  In my part of the country, link roads are torn up by people using them as short cuts to the bog, to fairs, markets, and so on.  The county council will not take them over. I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary should instruct the Special Employment Schemes Office to facilitate the repair of such link roads.  Many county councils will now take them over if they are put into a proper state of repair.  His office must do the spade work in that regard.</P>
    <P>At present there is a great deal of bitterness among the people who live along the link roads.  They cannot get a grant if they happen to be in an area where unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit recipients are few in number.  At the same time, they are some of the heaviest ratepayers in the country.  They cannot get a minor employment scheme grant.  In the case of road improvements, as they cannot get a grant, they are getting <Col N="1397" /> the road done at their own expense and outsiders benefit.  In that connection, the Parliamentary Secretary should ensure that a full cost grant be given for the repair of such roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, who has made many improvements in the administration of this Vote, that the name should be changed.  Instead of calling this the Special Employment Schemes Office, it should be called the Special Employment Projects Office.  The word &ldquo;schemes&rdquo; connotes a certain amount of scheming in regard to getting things through rapidly from the point of view of sanction.</P>
      <P>We in the city of Dublin have much to be grateful for, having regard to the amount of money made available to us for special works.  We have a special department in the Corporation dealing specifically with this grant.  I want to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to what I would call a fault that lies on the bookkeeping side.  We sometimes have plans submitted to the Department of Local Government for approval and sanction which involve in many cases substantial sums for substantial projects.  In due course, we are notified that the money is available.</P>
      <P>If we go along within the financial year, we reach by way of amount granted our full complement of what is made available to us, although it is known in the Department of Local Government and also in the Office of the Parliamentary Secretary that this money cannot be spent within the financial year because the project might take from 18 months to two years to complete.  Therefore, the unexpended portion is resanctioned in the subsequent year.  We find ourselves in this difficulty.  We cannot employ all those whom we would wish to employ within one financial year because it is then said we used up the money made available to us; and if we do not, we are told that there is money still to our credit and why do we not spend it before looking for more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A little commonsense in the examination of the reasons why moneys <Col N="1398" /> have not been spent should be taken into account and a proper understanding reached.  We in Dublin are grateful for this grant.  First of all, we are grateful from the humane aspect because it enables us to give substantial relief employment to many of those people to whom the Parliamentary Secretary referred who have been a long time unemployed and who are high up on the list of outdoor assistance recipients.</P>
    <P>We have been able to give the 13 weeks' work, rotated throughout the whole year, to a substantial number of men.  We could, however, improve on that.  It is true that while the overall picture shows a considerable fall in the number of those registered as unemployed, nevertheless, there are so many still unemployed that we feel we should do our part in trying to give employment to them, even on this restricted basis.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we feel that the city of Dublin has been improved considerably.  We have been able to make available to our citizens very many amenities hitherto beyond the pocket of the exchequer of Dublin Corporation.  We have made amenities available to go hand in hand with the development of the tourist trade. I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary should examine clearly the position that confronts us on a month to month basis or when a position is reached when it appears we may be about to overspend the money given in any one financial year.  It should be made clear that before any approval is withheld no overspending will result.</P>
    <P>Further, we have considerable difficulties sometimes in convincing the Department of Local Government and, through them, the special employment projects office on particular schemes.  In the spending of this money we hold that the largest possible amount should be spent on wages.  In other words, it should be spent on the labour content but when consideration is given to those items of expenditure and when there are criticisms resulting from that consideration, we feel we should be given an opportunity of examining <Col N="1399" /> with the officials the particular case under review and we should not be told that this happened or is likely to happen without our being able to answer it and prove otherwise, if we think it can be proved or be shown by competent officials where we are wrong and why we are wrong.</P>
    <P>I hope that this method of Government assistance, through local authorities, will bring about not periodical but continued relief to the unemployed. I remember when this was first set up under what was then called the National Development Fund, it was looked on as something temporary and set up to meet what was then an emergency.</P>
    <P>People who are unemployed, through whatever cause, whether by reason of changes in certain industries or changes in housing and so forth, are in an emergency.  Therefore, the Government could in this manner be continually at the disposal of those people by offering them employment of such a nature as has been given to them every year since this item of Government expenditure was set up.</P>
    <P>I remember when, on the eve of Christmas, all of us used to petition the Government for a kind of emergency relief fund so that we could give employment for four or five weeks to a certain number of people.  Thank goodness, that has gone and has been replaced by this very sensible arrangement. While in a general way I have no fault to find with the projects or the special employment projects office, I feel that there should be some consultation between the officials of the Department of Local Government, the Office of the Parliamentary Secretary and Dublin Corporation in connection with quite a number of projects that are being considered.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that this development in our national housekeeping can be developed into what one might call an insurance scheme.  We should have projects approved of in regard to the work that could be done, in regard to the estimated cost, but not necessarily to be proceeded with forthwith. They could be approved of, properly planned and pigeon-holed <Col N="1400" /> against some unexpected emergency, when they could be pulled out of the pigeon-hole and put into effect without delay, rather than that we should have to wait until the emergency comes and then have to plan, make the drawings and the estimates and let a month pass before getting approval and the consequent employment that you want to get.  Therefore, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to agree that some encouragement should be given to local authorities to have the members of the council working with the officials to plan, even if it is only for the purpose of pigeon-holing some reasonable projects which could be put into effect, if and when an emergency arises.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see a certain amount of elasticity and a certain amount of understanding that completion of certain projects or their development can be affected by weather conditions and that there can be a hold-up which should not be held against a local authority.  Weather conditions might make it impossible to proceed as was originally anticipated. In conclusion, I should like to repeat I am not happy about the bookkeeping side.  The bookkeeping side should be related to the expenditure as it is made and the local authority should be allowed to spend what is allocated in a financial year and not kept from spending certain moneys because grants made to them, which cannot be spent in that year, are debited against them.</P>

      <P>It is satisfactory to learn that under this Vote the same sums of money have been allocated under the various headings as were allocated last year.  In fact, it could be said that the Votes in each of the years from 1956-57 to the present year have been somewhat about the same.  Under the various schemes, very good work has been done as a rule but sometimes there are grievances, which generally arise in connection with works, that the money allocated was not well spent.  I suppose in all such schemes and works, you cannot give perfect satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blowick referred to the local contribution under the Rural Improvements <Col N="1401" /> Scheme.  I think he suggested that there should be no local contribution where valuations were under £10. I would not go quite so far but I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the local contribution should be lowered.  For instance, the minimum contribution is 10 per cent. for a farmer with an average land valuation of £6.  I suggest that that should be reduced to 5 per cent. because, after all, a farmer with a £6 valuation could not very well afford to pay anything but a small sum.  Again, 12½ per cent. for a farmer with a valuation of £6 to £7 is too high and I would suggest 7½ per cent.  Then you have 15 per cent. for valuations of £7 to £8 and I would suggest that that should be reduced to 10 per cent. and so on in proportion. I would prefer that there should be a contribution even in cases of small valuations.  I remember that the contributions were lowered some time ago and then were raised again.  I do not know whether it was the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor or not who was responsible but it does not matter.  I think in fairness to farmers those valuations are so low&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about a change of Government but I hope there will be a reduction in the contributions. Some difficulty often arises in connection with these Rural Improvements Schemes where perhaps five, six, seven or eight people are required to contribute.  One or two of those interested in the road improvement <Col N="1402" /> may refuse to give consent to have the work done or may refuse to pay his share of the contribution required because he is not a friend of a neighbour, or something like that.  I do not know if any means have been devised by which that difficulty can be overcome.</P>
      <P>As a rule, what happens is the grant is lost and people who are willing to contribute suffer as a result. In other cases, while some people may be quite willing that the work should be carried out they refuse to contribute and others have to make up the amount required.  In fact, I have known of cases where three or four people were involved and one man paid the whole contribution.  He, of course, being put in that position would like to be made ganger but I see that according to the rules and regulations, that cannot be done.  It is a pity there could not be a little elasticity in such cases where a person pays a big contribution.  But the rules and regulations are against that and one of the excuses given in connection with the appointment of a ganger is that if you appoint one of the contributors as a ganger, the others would hardly be inclined to obey him and would say: &ldquo;We paid our money as well as you.&rdquo;  There may be something in that, but I think some means should be adopted by which nobody could hold up a work which is very necessary.</P>
      <P>These Rural Improvements Schemes have been very useful and have always resulted in good work.  In Kerry, when roads are well done, especially link roads to which Deputy Blowick referred, we always take them over.  It may be a link road connecting two county roads, perhaps a mile long, and used by various people, not alone those living along it but people going to the creamery or to the bogs to draw turf who refuse as a rule to pay the contribution required of them.  There is this difficulty about getting the local contribution because the people who live along the road maintain that those who use the road should also contribute but they can never get them to do it.  I suppose these difficulties will always arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> In connection with minor relief schemes, it would appear that those in receipt of unemployment assistance think that money is just allocated for the purpose of getting work and doing as little as possible.  I do not know if the ganger could always be blamed for that because it is not very easy, I suppose, for a man to create trouble with his neighbours, but the work is not always satisfactory.  Another point is that in an electoral district, there may not be a sufficient number receiving unemployment assistance to qualify for a grant.  There may be six in one electoral district and in the neighbouring one, seven or eight, and I understand that unless there is some number like 12, 15 or 16 in an electoral district, that district does not qualify for a minor employment scheme grant.</P>
    <P>I wonder could the Parliamentary Secretary say if there are any regulations against joining the two together for the purpose of allocating one grant for the two areas so that you could have the number of unemployed from each making up such number as would enable them to get a grant. Very often&mdash;and especially in my own area where there are a good number of unemployed and perhaps a good number of them unemployable&mdash;there is that difficulty particularly because of emigration and other factors, and we do not have the required number and yet there are some very necessary works that could be done on roads and drainage under minor relief schemes.</P>
    <P>It is very necessary that grants for roads leading into bogs should be allocated before the time comes for drawing turf from the bogs out to county or main roads for conveyance home, but as a rule these allocations are not made in time.  If the grants were made available earlier so that work could be carried out in August and September at the latest, it would be a great improvement.</P>
    <P>I see in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that work was carried out for the Minister for Transport and Power in connection with bog roads in the vicinity of turf generating stations. <Col N="1404" /> We have one such station at Cahirciveen. I have here a letter I got this morning from the Turf Producers Association there seeking grants, they say, from the E.S.B.  I suppose it is the E.S.B.; I do not know exactly how the money is given but I know that grants are not given from the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is the Parliamentary Secretary's Office that carries out the work.  I know he does not allocate the money but I should like to know who is responsible.  I suppose it is the Department of Transport and Power.  It is very necessary to carry out this work where turf is required to supply a generating station so that the supply can be maintained.</P>
      <P>There are some special cases I know of in South Kerry in regard to the erection of small bridges and so on, and which have already been referred to the Special Employment Schemes Office and if they are not dealt with in due course, I suppose we can always call to the officials or to the Parliamentary Secretary.  On the whole, good work is being done under the Vote and any little grievances that arise locally cannot, I suppose, be the responsibility of the Office.  The Parliamentary Secretary has given a very detailed and clear statement; perhaps it is so minute that it is not easy to follow in detail.  I hope that money will be allocated in good time in future for roads connected with bog development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this Vote following the other two Votes usually results in a certain amount of confusion as many points in relation to this Vote have already been discussed.  Schemes for the making of utility roads are matters which have become an integral part of the country's economic life and I believe that long after we have passed the stage of making provision for unemployment, we shall still require the Special Employment Schemes Office to provide accommodation roads which are not the responsibility of the county <Col N="1405" /> councils.  For that reason, the Office is faced with the difficult task of providing money for the relief of unemployment and at the same time, applying it in the most useful manner to a big selection of roads given to it.</P>
      <P>A great many applications reach the Office from which it must choose what it thinks is the most useful, at the same time giving due consideration in accordance with the regulation to the relief of unemployment.  That is not an easy task but one which I think the Office has performed with great success, making due allowance for the amount of money at its disposal.  If there were sufficient money to go around, a wonderful job could be done and every Deputy pleased especially those from congested areas who can point to many roads, many amenity schemes which must await their turn simply because there is not an unlimited fund behind this Vote.</P>
      <P>We have been doing very well in past years and we are providing the same amount this year in spite of the fact that the numbers on the registers of unemployed show a substantial reduction and it is on these figures that allocations are based.  But while a minor employment scheme grant is not always available for various reasons&mdash; it is limited in accordance with the number of unemployed in the electoral district &mdash; the Rural Improvements Scheme is always there to help out. In such cases as that mentioned by Deputy Palmer, who suggested that where neither of two electoral divisions has a sufficient number of unemployed on the register, they be taken together and given the benefit of one grant, that was hardly feasible when one job was allocated to cover a section. It was hardly possible to decimalise it further, to bring it down to a very small amount.  The rural improvements scheme is a very important adjunct in that case.  It is the type of scheme I prefer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism in the past in regard to the increase in the contributions under the rural improvements scheme.  When initiated, this scheme was certainly a step in the right direction.  In the light of experience subsequently it was <Col N="1406" /> found desirable to increase the contributions. That, too, was a wise step, particularly when one remembers that we very often do not properly appreciate anything we get for nothing. One need only compare the work done on minor employment schemes with that done under rural improvements schemes to see which is the better scheme from the point of view of quantity and quality.  If local farmers, and others, are anxious to have a certain amenity, be it an accommodation road or drainage, provided it is really essential they will always find the necessary contribution to take up a rural improvements scheme grant to carry out the work. That is immediate proof that the work is necessary.  When it is a case of a free grant for an accommodation road in a congested area, for example, everybody who has any bit at all of an accommodation road will fill up an application form, actuated very often by a desire to get a grant expended in the locality rather than, by the desire to have the road in question repaired. It then becomes the function of the engineering staff of the Special Employments Schemes Office to separate the wheat from the chaff.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the amount of money paid in by way of contribution last year on rural improvements and the number of applications which have gone through.  Whenever the applicants indicate they are prepared to contribute, the Office can be reasonably satisfied that the scheme is a worthwhile one.  The same sifting is not necessary before sanction is given.  When the work is carried out it is practically always found to be of a very high standard, of a very satisfactory nature, and a good job in every respect.  The main reason it is satisfactory is that very often many of the contributors work on the scheme.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point made by Deputy Palmer and Deputy Blowick that the contributors should get preference.  Some counties do not experience much difficulty in this matter because in certain areas&mdash; Deputy McMenamin is well aware of this&mdash;the contributors are frequently registered unemployed and, because of <Col N="1407" /> that, they have no difficulty in finding employment on the scheme.  There are two ways in which to look at this question of giving preference to contributors.  It is all very well to say that because they contribute they should be entitled to first preference. The possibility is that living next door to a contributor there may be a labouring man drawing unemployment assistance.  The State has a responsibility to provide him with work.  The State is perhaps contributing nine-tenths of the money spent on the scheme.  The contributor is getting the benefit of a State grant to provide him with an amenity.</P>
    <P>Why should the State have a further liability towards him?  Why should the State provide him with employment when there are in the locality men in receipt of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit towards whom the State has a definite responsibility from the point of view of providing them with employment?  Contributors get the preference when the other categories are not available.  The continued success of the scheme and the increase in applications are proof that the scheme is a successful one.  It is also conclusive proof that the increase in contribution has had no adverse effect on it.  I am not in favour of reducing the contribution at the moment because, as I have already said, something for nothing is not always appreciated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe dealt with the urban side.  I am rather perturbed about the difficulty there is in getting schemes with a high unskilled employment content.  Sometimes I wonder if we are providing amenity schemes rather than employment-producing schemes.  We try to marry both as far as possible.  Schemes put up by Dublin Corporation are excellent as amenity schemes but they do not always carry a high unskilled labour potential.  For that reason, these schemes have to be watched very carefully.  When one remembers that, in a scheme put forward in an urban area in which there is 33?rd per cent. unskilled employment content, it will take £25 per week to employ one <Col N="1408" /> man on that scheme, one appreciates how little impression a few hundred thousand pounds make on the relief of unemployment over an extended period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to a pool of works, to changing the name of the office and so forth.  With regard to a pool of works, that is a matter which the Corporation can usually undertake themselves and it is a matter as between them and Local Government.  He referred also to the question of sanction for works in one year which would not be undertaken within the year and to the carry-forward, resulting in sanction being given the following year.  My information is that the practice has always been to watch the figures carefully to see that the Vote is not exceeded; in other words, that the Vote is not burst.  The Special Employment Schemes Office keep a watchful eye on the number of schemes sanctioned to ensure there will be no over-spending of the Vote within the time and there is a carry-forward, no matter how well it is watched.</P>
    <P>There is very little else to which I need refer on this Vote because the speakers on the two previous Votes succeeded in covering much of the material that was dealt with in this Estimate.  Minor employment schemes have become a very important feature of rural economy and irrespective of whether they are utilised as a means of absorbing unemployed or not, money will always have to be found for repair and maintenance and for that reason, the greatest possible care has to be exercised to ensure that the money is allocated to the proper roads. I think we can look forward to their always remaining a feature of the work of this Office.</P>
    <P>During the year, the same amount of money is available, even with a reduced number of unemployed, and we are satisfied that we shall be able to give as good or better employment during the low season, which is mainly the winter season.  In reply to those who mentioned the futility of doing drainage in the winter, may I say that while it may work out in an isolated case that a job is undertaken in the <Col N="1409" /> winter, by and large, drainage is not undertaken in the winter?  It is preferable to have it carried out in the summer season when better value is given for the money.</P>
    <P>I do not think there were any other questions raised to which I need refer on this Vote.  Now that I have more intimate contact with the staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office, I am prepared to say, with no ulterior motive, that they are always as anxious as I am to have public money that is given to them expended in the most useful way and distributed fairly to the areas for which it was originally intended.  They do an excellent job from the top man down to the lowest in the office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,424,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 &amp; 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1953; No. 45 of 1926; No. 14 of 1940 (secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (sec. 23); No. 17 of 1951; etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate amounts to £10,114,000, being a gross total of £10,780,592, less Appropriations-in-Aid of £666,592.  The net provision represents an increase of £401,300 on the comparative total shown for 1959/60, but the increase of revenue we expect is enough to offset the increase in expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a commercial account basis, it is expected that we shall maintain roughly the same position as during the last few years when Post Office operations showed a profit, though a relatively modest one.  However, I shall <Col N="1410" /> deal with the general financial aspect in more detail later on.</P>
    <P>Deputies may already have noted that the amounts we are now dealing with do not include any of the sums to be voted for the new Radio Éireann and that the comparative figures for 1959-60 do not include the Supplementary Estimate for £10 taken in March to cover the expenses of the Television Advisory Committee.  I must, however, mention that, owing to a change in procedure subsequently decided on, we shall not now realise the item of £75,000 in our appropriations-in-aid shown as expenses recovered from broadcasting licence fees.  It was not possible to have this change carried into the Estimates volume owing to the advanced stage which had then been reached in the printing.  Another late change in Appendix C (No. 48), which could not be effected for the same reason, involves a reduction to £182,200 in the figure for services rendered to the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>Finally, the figure of £9.4 millions for postal, telegraph and telephone revenue quoted at the end of Part II of the Estimate naturally does not include any of the extra revenue we shall earn from the increases made recently in postal and telegraph charges.</P>
    <P>There, is however, no extra complication in making a straight comparison between the various subhead provisions this year and last year because adjustments have already been made in the 1959-60 figures to cover the amounts transferred from the Vote for Remuneration and the Vote for Increases in Pensions, totalling £136,700.  It is to be remembered, though, that so far as the staff subheads are concerned, the increased pay and pensions operated only for 3½ months of 1959-60, while they have been provided for 12 months of the current year.</P>
    <P>Subject to these general observations, I may now comment briefly on the various subheads where there is a variation of £10,000 or more.</P>
    <P>Subhead A.1 relates to Headquarters Offices.  Half the increase of £59,000 is due to the increased rates of pay.  Most of the remainder is for <Col N="1411" /> increased overtime in connection with the proposed change over to a mechanised system in the Savings Bank which should not be repeated in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Subhead A.2 provides for Metropolitan Offices and Subhead A.3 for Provincial Offices.  The major part of the increase of £103,800 and £227,300 respectively is ascribable to the increased Civil Service pay.  In addition, there is provision for higher remuneration for sub-postmasters and an extra pay day in the year for staff who are paid on Fridays.</P>
    <P>Subhead H.2 covers Losses by Default, Accident, etc.  The extra £11,200 is required to meet known cases of Savings Bank, etc. losses.</P>
    <P>Subhead I.1, deals with Salaries, Wages and Allowances (Engineering). The net increase here is at the comparatively small figure of £35,300 but this is because the cost of the extra staff taken on for the expansion of the telephone system is offset by an increased relief from Telephone Capital Funds.</P>
    <P>Subhead K. has reference to Engineering Materials.  The extra £36,700 is explained by the growth of the Telephone system and is due specifically to increased purchases of Engineering Stores and Motor Transport.</P>
    <P>In regard to subhead M., Telephone Capital Repayments, the development of the Telephone System is financed by issues from the Central Fund which are repaid by annuities extending over periods not exceeding 25 years.  This subhead contains full provision for the annuity payments to be made during the year.  The increase from year to year&mdash;the present figure is £100,791 more than in 1959/60&mdash;is a natural consequence of the growth in the telephone system, a growth which in its turn leads to increased revenue.</P>
    <P>Subhead N.1. relates to Superannuation Allowances etc.  Increases under all heads, but principally in pensions and in additional allowances following on an increased number of normal course retirements, make up the increase of £35,900.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> Subhead 0.2. refers to Civil Aviation and Meteorological Wireless, provision and installation of equipment, etc.  This subhead varies very considerably from year to year and the decrease, as compared with last year, merely indicates a less costly programme of new works.</P>
    <P>Subhead T covers Appropriations-in-Aid. Apart from the item of £75,000 for wireless licence expenses to which I have referred already, the main changes here which contribute to the total increase of £109,191 are an increase of £42,100 in receipts from Savings Bank Funds for services given by the Department and a decrease of £13,000 in receipts from the sale of non-engineering stores.</P>
    <P>In comparison with the previous year, letters posted increased by approximately 6 million or 2 per cent. and the traffic during the Christmas period 1959 was the highest ever. There was a small, but welcome, increase in parcel traffic.</P>
    <P>Some problems of mail operation were caused by the petrol crisis of November and the disruption of Aer Lingus services in March this year but they were overcome with little or no interference with normal services.  The closing of the railway system which served South and West Donegal has led us to review mail distribution arrangements in that area.  The matter is complex but substantial progress has been made and it is hoped, within the next few months, to introduce there a much improved distribution network with consequential benefit to the public.</P>
    <P>Completion of the national scheme of reorganisation, begun in 1948, aimed at giving a better all-round standard of postal services in the provinces and a 6-day frequency of delivery on all mainland posts, is now in sight.  The services in the Head Office district of Westport were reorganised within the past year and the new organisation for Portlaoise, the last remaining district, will come into operation on the 23rd May.  Under this country-wide scheme, the standard 6-day postal delivery has already been extended to 1,084 posts and the final figure will exceed 1,100 when the Portlaoise area <Col N="1413" /> is added.  In effect, about 100,000 households to which delivery was formerly given on 3, 4 or 5 days only a week have, over the last twelve years, been given the benefit of a 6-day delivery.</P>
    <P>The steady growth of Dublin City and suburbs has made the sorting of mail for delivery there increasingly complex and difficult for our staffs to perform accurately from memory.  The number of streets, roads, etc., served by the Dublin and District delivery postmen now exceeds 3,500.  In order, therefore, to simplify the sorting processes and reduce the risk of error at an important stage of the handling sequence, an appeal will shortly be made to the public to adopt a new postal address numbering scheme&mdash;a zone numbering scheme is another way of describing it&mdash;for Dublin City and suburbs.  The scheme will be quite simple from the public's point of view, it will merely involve their adding the appropriate zone number after the word &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo;&mdash;for example, &ldquo;Dublin 2&rdquo; in the case of Leinster House, Kildare Street.  Similar, or more detailed, numbering schemes for much smaller urban areas than Dublin are operating with conspicuous success in other countries and I have no reason for thinking that the public here will prove to be any less co-operative.  Full details of the scheme will be announced later.</P>
    <P>On the foreign postal side the new Small Packet service, by which goods not exceeding 2 lb. can be sent by letter post, got off to an encouraging start.  Postings are already of the order of 375,000 a year, mostly to the U.S.A. and Canada.  The air parcel post service was further extended during the year and parcels may now be sent by that means to all countries which accept air parcels, in effect to most destinations in the world.</P>
    <P>A special postage stamp was issued in July last to commemorate the first Arthur Guinness.  As already announced, a special stamp will shortly be issued on the theme of the World Refugee Year and a further special issue later this year will commemorate the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunication Administrations, <Col N="1414" /> of which Ireland is a founder-member.</P>
    <P>Public telegraph traffic continues to decline.  About 1,800,000 telegrams were dealt with during the year ended the 31st March last, which was about 4% below the level for the previous year.  Foreign telegrams were actually a few thousand more and exceptionally there was a marginal rise in, radio telegrams due to an increased number of gale warnings but these together were insufficient to offset the much bigger fall in internal telegrams and in telegrams exchanged with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>As in the last few years, the one bright spot in the telegraph field is the Telex service which is continuing to grow rapidly.  Last year I reported that the number of subscribers had increased from 63 in the previous year to 85.  The latest figure is 116 and the number of recorded messages during the year ended 31st December, 1959, was 152,000 as compared with 95,000 for the previous year.  In view of this increasing demand we are now drawing up plans to convert the whole Telex service to automatic working. This will mean that Telex subscribers here will be able themselves to dial directly to Telex subscribers in Britain and on the Continent.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of telegraph transmission on the basis of teleprinter and telephone working has now been completed.  The position is being examined anew to see what further improvements in organisation may be possible but it seems unlikely that any substantial economies can be effected.</P>
    <P>The increase in charges which was recently put into effect applies to internal telegrams only and is designed merely to offset the higher costs resulting from the Civil Service pay award and to prevent the telegraph loss from rising again.  For 1958/9 which is the latest year for which actual figures are available that loss was £140,144; for 1959/60 the estimated loss is £125,800.</P>
    <P>In 1959, there were 117 million local calls and 15 million trunk calls. The corresponding figures for 1958 were 104 million local calls and 15½ million trunk calls.  The reduction in <Col N="1415" /> the number of trunk calls is more apparent than real as under the new group charging system introduced on 1st August last, many calls which would previously have been charged at trunk rates were treated as local calls.  The only comparison possible is, therefore, as between the total number of trunk and local calls which shows an increase of ten per cent. as compared with the previous year.</P>
    <P>A record number of 11,600 subscriber exchange lines was installed in 1959, being over 1,000 more than in 1958.  Some 10,000 miles of trunk circuits were added to the trunk system; 16 exchanges were converted to automatic working; and 129 exchanges were extended and/or modernised during the year.  Fifty-four new telephone kiosks were erected.</P>
    <P>Although the number of exchange lines installed in 1959 was a record, it was exceeded by the number of applications during the year.  A record total of 13,200 applications were received, some 2,700 more than in 1958. As a result, the waiting applicant list increased; excluding telephones in course of installation, the figure on 1st January, 1960, was 2,700, compared with 1,500 on 1st January, 1959.  Provincial applications increased by over 1,500 and this is largely attributed to the concessions introduced last August, namely, extension of distance covered by standard rental to three miles of all exchanges, application of residence rental rate to farmers and enlargement of local call areas.  Since these measures were designed primarily to stimulate rural telephone development, the increase in demand is gratifying.  We aim at connecting 15,000 new telephones in the current calendar year; for the first four months which have already passed, installation of new telephones has averaged over 1,200 per month.</P>
    <P>In the Finglas and Walkinstown areas of Dublin, over 400 applications have had to be held up pending the installation of additional automatic exchange equipment and in Cork city there are about 400 on the waiting list for the same reason.  It is expected that it will be possible to provide service <Col N="1416" /> for the bulk of Finglas-Walkinstown applicants later this year.  In Cork city, two new automatic exchanges have been erected and installation of equipment is in hand; it is expected that these two exchanges will be opened in about four months' time, following which service will be provided for the waiting applicants as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Last year, I outlined the new plans for future telephone development and in particular, the introduction of the group charging system for telephone calls.  Under this system, which came into force on 1st August last, all exchanges were arranged into groups for charging purposes, local call areas were considerably extended and a simplified scale of trunk charges was provided.  The total cost to the Department of this and other concessions was estimated at £125,000 per annum.  The new system has worked very satisfactorily for subscribers generally.  The relatively small number of complaints received referred principally to the non-application of local call fees between certain adjacent areas, or to delays on certain routes arising out of the extension of the local call areas.</P>
    <P>On the first point, the simple answer is that we could not have afforded any further concession.  On the second point, it is unfortunately the case that arising out of the introduction of the extended local call areas, delay has arisen on several routes.  It was not possible to plan against this; we had to wait and see what growth emerged and where it arose.  Steps are being taken to provide the necessary additional circuits on the routes affected as rapidly as possible but it will take some considerable time to cater for all the demands because we also have to provide for normal traffic growth and it will be necessary to undertake extensive cable schemes on many routes.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned last year the plans being made to extend the full long distance subscriber trunk dialling facility, which is at present available on the Athlone and Cork exchanges only.  The necessary equipment has now been ordered, and installation is <Col N="1417" /> expected within the next 12 to 18 months, for the introduction of subscriber trunk dialling at Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick, Mullingar, Naas, Sligo and Waterford. In addition, equipment has been ordered and installation is expected within two years for the conversion of seven groups of exchanges to automatic working with subscriber trunk dialling facilities.  The seven groups comprise a total of 50 exchanges in the following areas&mdash;Balbriggan, Curragh Camp, Kildare, Midleton, New Ross, Roscommon and Tuam.</P>
    <P>I also referred last year to the innovation in this country of providing trunk circuits by means of radio links. The first of these, between Galway and Athlone, is in course of erection and, although it has been delayed somewhat for technical reasons, its completion is expected by the end of the year.  A contract has also been placed for a radio link connecting Sligo with Bundoran and Donegal, and contracts will be placed shortly for similar radio systems to link Waterford with Wexford and Enniscorthy, and Dublin with Wicklow.</P>
    <P>In concluding my review of the telephone service, I wish to refer to a matter which gave rise to some discussion in this House a few months ago, that is, the small print in the telephone directory.  The main complaints were about the thin or light impression of the new type and the smallness of the telephone numbers. At the time I undertook to see whether the objections which were made to the type could be met for the next issue of the directory.  I am glad to say that the type to be used in the next issue will give a heavier or thicker impression, the telephone numbers will be larger and the heavy entries and exchange names will be accentuated.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to come to the House with a new Telephone Capital Bill later this year.  That occasion will provide a further opportunity to review the position of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>Post Office Savings Bank deposits in 1959 amounted, in round figures, to £16.74 millions, an increase of £1.34 millions on 1958; withdrawals at <Col N="1418" /> £14.88 millions showed an increase of £.3 millions.  Moreover the withdrawals included an amount estimated at £.93 millions which was reinvested in Exchequer Stock, Savings Certificates and Prize Bonds.  Estimating interest for the year at £1.95 millions, the total balance due to depositors at 31st December, 1959, was £82,500,000 as compared with £78,750,000 at 31st December, 1958.</P>
    <P>Deposits by Trustee Savings Banks during the year amounted to £1.48 millions, an increase of £.62 millions, and withdrawals to £.64 millions, an increase of £.21 millions.  At the end of the year, the balance to credit of the banks, including interest, was £13.75 millions, being £1.2 millions over the figure at the end of 1958.</P>
    <P>Sales of Savings Certificates in 1959 at £3.04 millions were up by £.35 millions on the previous year's figure and the repayments, including interest, of £2.25 millions were down by £.36 millions, making a total improvement of £.71 millions on the previous year's figure.</P>
    <P>So many factors may affect the total net investment in these savings services that it is difficult to point to any particular reason for the overall improvement but we can all be grateful to the Savings Committee for their efforts in promoting the savings habit amongst our people.</P>
    <P>The postal order and money order services were extended from the 28th March this year.  Postal orders of value £3, £4 and £5 were introduced while the limit for money orders issued and payable within the State was raised from £50 to £100.  Certain adjustments in poundage were also made, with the object of placing the services, particularly with regard to low value orders, on a more secure basis economically.</P>
    <P>The number of money orders issued in 1959 was approximately the same as in 1958 but the average value increased somewhat from £11 8s. to £11 12s.</P>
    <P>There was a decrease in 1959, as compared with 1958, of about 9 per cent. in the number of postal orders issued.  This decrease which was due mainly to a reduction in the use of <Col N="1419" /> lower value postal orders for crossword and other competitions, had the effect of increasing the average value of a postal order issued from 7/10d. in 1958 to 8/7d. in 1959.</P>
    <P>The larger works wholly or substantially completed since last year include the new district sorting offices in Crumlin and in Churchtown, Dublin, the new post office in Letterkenny and the new post office in Galway which is to be opened very shortly.  The buildings for the two regional automatic exchanges in Cork city are now being equipped.  The first stage of a substantial improvements scheme at Bray Post Office was completed and the remaining work of enlarging and modernising the public office there is in progress.</P>
    <P>At the present time work is also in progress on a new post office at Droichead Nua and buildings for automatic telephone exchanges at Athy, Portlaoise, Tullamore and Walkinstown in Dublin.  Contracts have been placed for improvement works at Gorey Post Office and for an automatic telephone exchange building at Mallow, whilst tenders have been invited for automatic telephone exchange buildings at An Uaimh and Malahide.  Work is also expected to begin before the end of the year on extensive improvements to the public part of Limerick Post Office, and on the building of a new post office and telephone exchange at Wicklow.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Estimates last year I said that the sketch plans for the new central sorting office in Dublin had been approved.  The contract drawings are now being prepared and whilst it is rather difficult to give reliable forecasts for such a large project I am hopeful that the piled foundations for the structure, now in the design stage, will have been laid before the end of next year and that the main building contract will be placed not too long afterwards.</P>
    <P>The number of staff provided for in the Estimate is 16,321.  The increase of 142 over last year is due to an addition of some 170 to the professional and technical grades of the Engineering Branch partially offset by <Col N="1420" /> a reduction of 28 in the numbers employed in other grades there and elsewhere in the Department.</P>
    <P>Preliminary work is in progress with a view to the introduction of an automatic data processing system in the Post Office Savings Bank in 1961.  This system, which will be based on use of an electronic calculator, should lead to substantial savings in the administrative costs of the bank.  Some redundancy of staff is likely to arise but it is expected that we can solve this by transfers to other Departments and, while the redundancy lasts, by employing people on work normally performed by other grades.  The various staff associations have already been advised of the general outline of the scheme in so far as it will affect the staff and, at a later stage, problems arising out of the redundancy will be discussed with the staff side under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    <P>So as to keep abreast with progress in the techniques of industrial management representatives of the Department have attended Seminars, Conferences and Instructional Courses organised by the Irish Management Institute and other bodies working in similar fields.  These courses covered such subjects as &ldquo;Work Study&rdquo;, &ldquo;Transport Management&rdquo; and &ldquo;Management through People&rdquo;.  The experience and information acquired at these courses and the contacts established there are of considerable value.  In purely postal and telecommunication matters the same spread of knowledge is achieved by membership of the specialised international bodies such as the Universal Postal Union and by informal contacts with other administrations whose experience is always readily put at our disposal.</P>
    <P>In addition to the normal Engineering Branch training schemes for technical grades, a series of special courses on new exchange techniques was given to engineers, inspectors and trainees by a representative of one of the Department's contractors.</P>
    <P>The Commercial Accounts for 1958/59 show that we made a profit in that year of £277,576.  So far as 1959/60 is concerned I said, in reply <Col N="1421" /> to a Parliamentary Question on 6th April, that on such information as was available it was estimated we would make a net profit of about £265,000.  We have not yet got all the data necessary to prepare detailed accounts for 1959/60 and so my statement of 6th April still stands good&mdash; for the present at any rate.</P>
    <P>I approach the question of a forecast for this year with some reserve because, while we can usually estimate our expenditure closely, we cannot be so certain about our revenue.  And it is to be remembered that a variation of even as little as 1 per cent. in revenue implies a difference of over £100,000 in receipts, a very considerable amount in relation to the net profit.  However, subject to these remarks, and assuming no unexpected events, I think we should show a profit which will show little change overall from the profit in any of the last few years.</P>
    <P>Both our gross expenditure and our gross revenue will however be higher than before.  The Civil Service pay award has increased our staff costs by a half million pounds a year.  On the revenue side the reduction in telephone charges which was made last August was expected to cost us £125,000 a year.  So far as we have been able to judge, that estimate was an accurate one.  The increases in postal and telegraph rates which we made at the end of March should bring us in £185,000 a year.  It is satisfactory that although our expenses rose so sharply we were able, by making a net increase of only £60,000 in charges, to adhere to the principle that, taking one year with another, the Post Office should pay its way.  That is the principle which has been accepted by successive Governments. Its soundness needs no emphasis from me.</P>
    <P>This fairly satisfactory position is, as I indicated last year, due to the steady increase in our volume of traffic. People are writing more, they are becoming more telephone conscious and, in both those services, we can handle more business without a corresponding increase in costs.  The one black spot is the telegraph service; it is impossible to eliminate the loss there and we must be watchful to prevent it being <Col N="1422" /> any more of a financial burden than is possible.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the relatively small increase of staff provided for in the Estimate.  The fact that with this small increase we are able to cater for a greater increase in business is of itself a tribute to the competence and zeal of all grades of the Post Office service.  As Minister, I am happy to express in this House my appreciation of their services during the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>The statement made by the Minister is detailed.  On the whole, it seems that the position with regard to the services rendered by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is satisfactory from a financial point of view with the exception of the telegraph service. The loss incurred on the telegraph service may be due to a large extent to the increased cost of telegrams.  It is certainly true to say that the cost of telegrams is entirely too high and that a person will think twice or three times before sending a telegram.  The loss may also be due to some extent to the increased use of the telephone. Telephones have been installed in many country areas, a development which is very satisfactory.  Up to recently, I suppose this country had the lowest number of telephones of any country in the world.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister found it necessary to increase postal and telegraph charges, because, since the reorganisation was introduced&mdash;I think by Deputy Everett when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in 1948&mdash;while postal deliveries are satisfactory in all parts of the country, I understand that the daily service is not yet available in every part of the country, though there is also a better method of delivering letters from headquarters to the various sub-offices in the different counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking of sub-offices, I must refer to the necessity for increasing the salaries&mdash;they can scarcely be called salaries&mdash;of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses. Of all the people in <Col N="1423" /> the employment of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, they have been the worst paid down through the years. Of course, the idea is that as a rule they have some other way of making their living.  They may have a shop or something else and they may depend upon the people who come in to do business in the post office making a purchase.  However, I do not think that should be taken into consideration at all.  In fact, it is surprising that there have been so few cases of embezzlement or misappropriation of public funds, because there must be a great temptation to these people who are handling so much money.  They may be very short themselves and to tide them over some emergency, they may perhaps appropriate to themselves some of the available money in the hope of being able to repay it before being caught.</P>
    <P>On the whole, these sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have done very good work and have proved themselves very honest and efficient in the discharge of their duties, in spite of the way they have been treated financially. I do not know what protection could be given to them.  We know that recently many attacks have been made on them, and especially on sub-postmistresses. I am sure the Garda Síochána will see to their protection.</P>
    <P>Not only are these people paid low salaries but also the wages of postmen are something of which we cannot be proud.  They do their work efficiently and well; they are out in all kinds of weather and have to do long journeys. In some cases, it may not be a whole-time job, but they are badly paid for the work they have to do.  There is, in the grade of postman, a rank called auxiliary postman.  It is very unfair that when those men reach the age of 70, they retire and have nothing to fall back on but the old age pension.  I do not know whether it would require legislation, or some alteration of a regulation in the Post Office service to establish them.  In fact, I could never see why they are not established and entitled to some gratuity or pension, big or small, on reaching the age of 70, <Col N="1424" /> because many of them have no other means when they retire except the old age pension.  Indeed, during their term as auxiliary postmen, or established postmen, they cannot have anything to spare.</P>
    <P>As regards means of travel for postmen, I think there was a regulation at one time&mdash;I do not know if it exists now&mdash;in certain areas that the postmen must walk.  In some cases, they might have to walk many miles.  In other cases, they were allowed to use a bicycle.  I do not see why a postman should not be allowed any mode of transport he desires, even a motor car, which, of course, he could not afford, unless he had some other means.  I know that in some cases a motor car would be allowed, if the postman were suffering from any disability.</P>
    <P>I cannot tell exactly what changes have been made but I know some changes have been made and I am sure they are for the better.  I understand postmen are paid also in accordance with the number of hours they work and I suppose if they have to walk, their hours are longer and if they cycle, their hours are shorter, and if they use a motor cycle or a car, they are still shorter.  I do not think the means of transport at their disposal should affect their remuneration in any way.</P>
    <P>The uniforms of the postmen are not very spectacular.  They are dull.  After all, our postmen go into every part of the country; they meet various people, and tourists see them.  They should have a brighter uniform, a smart uniform, and not something that looks as if it were handed to them to throw on their backs.  I suppose a great deal depends on the men themselves but it is not very easy to look smart in a uniform that is anything but smart. The same applies to the postbags. They may be good for the safety of the letters or the parcels within them and keep them perfectly dry, but they are of a most peculiar make.  I believe they are made in jail by prisoners and they look as if they belong there, too.</P>
    <P>There is not very much else I wish to say in connection with this matter because a very full statement has been given, but I should like to say that the <Col N="1425" /> Minister has always been very courteous, as have his officials, so far as I am concerned.  I am sure others will agree that all those connected with the Post Office itself, including sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, have always been courteous and have tried to carry out their duties to the best of their abilities.  They perform good work and the people should be grateful for the service they render.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, when I spoke on this Estimate, the Minister was new to office.  I raised a number of matters then asking the Minister to look into them when the discussion on the Estimate was over, knowing, of course, that at that time the Minister could not be expected to be as familiar with the administrative activities of the Department as I have no doubt he is this year.</P>
      <P>I want, therefore, to raise with the Minister some matters of importance, mainly from the staff point of view.  I notice that this year we seem to be somewhat nearer to the provision of a central sorting office in Dublin.  That will obviate the necessity for my recapitulating the deficiencies and infirmities of the building which at present serves as the central sorting and delivery office in Dublin.  I notice the Minister indicates that the contract drawings are now being prepared and that he is hopeful that the piled foundations for the structure which are now at the design stage will be ready before the end of next year and that the main building contract will be placed not too long afterwards. It seems to me that the earliest date at which the main building contract will be placed is 1962.  That is on the assumption that these target forecasts are maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, this whole building has a notorious reputation for fractured and frustrated targets.  Various Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs have attempted to give approximate years when the work would commence only to see the years pass by and that old building remain there, defiant of everybody's efforts to replace it by something that would look a credit to our capital city and which would be an efficient edifice in which post office <Col N="1426" /> business could be transacted without all the hardships and inconveniences which are suffered by the staff who have to work in such an unsuitable and outmoded building.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister at this stage would like to give any indication as to when the building will be completed.  I can appreciate his nervousness in not wishing to do so.  I promise I will never mention the matter again if he hazards a guess. That will be an assurance of my good will in the matter.  I wonder whether the Minister would hazard a guess today?  If we start the building in 1962 how long will it take to erect it?  I take it the Office of Public Works will be acting for the Minister and will have an idea as to what it will cost to erect a building which will involve an expenditure of £800,000 because they are familiar with this type of building terrain.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to know whether it is likely to take two, three or four years in which to erect the building or whether we might now compose ourselves and say that the new sorting and delivery office will be ready for occupation in 1965 or 1966 providing existing targets remain and do not follow the pattern of previous targets. I do not know if the Minister would like to venture an estimate of that.  At all events, it is somewhat consoling to know that at last we are getting to the stage at which by the end of 1961 the pile foundations of the structure may be laid.  I hope in the meantime there will not be another change in the site of the building and that the laying of the pile foundations will mean that the post office will be erected on top of the pile foundations.</P>
    <P>This business has had such a long and chequered career that one hesitates to count with any certitude on the inevitable happening.  I suppose the best we can do is to wait and see what is likely to come out of the matter when the pile foundations find their way into the earth.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about a new method of sorting and indicated that there is an increasing number of streets and thoroughfares generally in Dublin. I think he mentioned something over <Col N="1427" /> three thousand.  It is difficult for the staff adequately to remember all these streets and thoroughfares and the offices to which letters for them should be sent for sorting.  It is because of this great expansion of the city and the spreading out of the population that it has been necessary for the Post Office to face up to the necessity of building new offices for sorting and delivery purposes in various parts of the city.  Some of these areas are now teeming reservoirs of human population. I have in mind Finglas.</P>
    <P>I did not hear any mention by the Minister of the Post Office programme in respect of the new office which I understood it is proposed to erect at Finglas.  Will the Minister give us any indication as to whether the work will be commenced there this year and if so when the work is likely to finish there?  The Churchtown office is another building which I think is under way at present and is probably half completed.  Does the Minister anticipate that the Churchtown office will be completed and be ready for operation this year?  I should like some information about these two offices in particular.</P>
    <P>At Newbridge, in County Kildare, the Post Office are engaged in building a new post office and telephone exchange where, of course, it is urgently needed.  The work is in progress.  What is the date in the contract for the completion of that work and when is it expected that the work on the office will be completed?  I do not raise these building matters as an indication, however remote, of criticism against the building section of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>The building section of the Post Office Department has always been enlightened, progressive and anxious to keep abreast of the times.  Unfortunately, it is not its own agent.  Between the normal difficulties of acquisition of land, and so on, the problem of getting attention from the Office of Public Works is one which is sufficient to overload the officials of the building section with more than a fair quota of sorrow.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> My questions on this and my subsequent observations on the Post Office buildings are not intended in the slightest to reflect on the building section of the Department for which I have a very considerable admiration. Has any adequate survey been made of Post Office buildings?  The Post Office is responsible for all the head offices throughout the country and the salaried sub-offices: I suppose there are about 100 of them.  The Post Office has no responsibility for the erection of sub-post office buildings but I take it the Post Office has made some survey of the existing head and salaried sub-offices.  If so, at what places has the Post Office decided new buildings are necessary to meet the considerable expansion of post office business down through the years and in what offices is substantial reconstruction necessary to provide the extended accommodation necessary not only for the public but for the satisfactory transaction of business by the staff?</P>
    <P>The one thing that strikes one in different towns throughout the country is that if you come across an old post office it is generally a dreary, weary institution.  There is a look of drabness and misery about the whole setup. It bears no favourable comparison with modern shops in the town or city. Generally speaking, there is no comparison whatever between the architectural facade of a post office and the banks and shops and other modern buildings.  The Post Office has wares to sell in the form of services.  It ought, therefore&mdash;as indeed it does in the new offices&mdash;endeavour to brighten the fronts of the post offices and modernise them internally in a general way so as to ensure that the Post Office Department and its branches throughout the country have buildings of which the entire service and the public should be proud.</P>
    <P>The Post Office is not yielding a loss.  The Post Office is yielding a surplus of £250,000 per year.  By any standard that is a very substantial surplus.  The Post Office administration ought to assert for itself the right to modernise its buildings and have the facilities available in these places in view of its generally prosperous financial position.  It is entitled, because of <Col N="1429" /> the widespread character of its services, to get from the Government reasonable priority in supplying the essential needs of its own services in the matter of those buildings.  I would ask the Minister how many new offices it will be necessary to build and at what towns and cities extensive reconstructions will be necessary.</P>
    <P>I raised last year, too, I think, the question of giving greater authority to postmasters to undertake repair work on their own initiative instead of their request for repairs having to come through the Post Office centrally, on to the Board of Works and then along a shuttle service of correspondence between the Board of Works and the Post Office Department, resulting in the seemingly interminable delays which take place before even very small repairs can be carried out to a post office.</P>
    <P>A person who becomes a postmaster reaches that position only after long years of satisfactory service and after he has been thoroughly vetted by Post Office boards which are usually fairly hawk-eyed in ascertaining the ability and the standard of competence of the person who passes through the Board. I would suggest to the Minister that there is no point in treating the postmaster as a nincompoop who knows nothing about these matters at all.  If he had to carry out repairs to his own house he would do it creditably.  He ought to be given more authority in regard to carrying out repairs.  These repair jobs ought to be done locally on the Postmaster's initiative without having to create the nightmare of everything having to go to headquarters to be cleared there so as to ensure that everything is as perfect as the people in control in Dublin can make it.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a question about the deliveries.  There is a firm in my constituency which is a first-class firm from the point of view of the employment it gives and because of the fact that about 60 per cent. of its products &mdash;they are relatively new products for this country&mdash;are sent to the export market.  The export market is not just Britain or America.  They send their products to many places throughout <Col N="1430" /> the world.  The firm in question is Irish Ropes.  I have to mention their name in order to explain the extent of my grievance.</P>
    <P>They recently established a branch in England where they are also doing very valuable work selling goods on the English market.  The volume of goods that will be sold there will increase.  If they get a letter from their English headquarters, it arrives here in the morning by the mail boat.  It arrives about 7 o'clock but the day mail from Dublin to Cork via Newbridge has left Dublin at 6.30 with the result that the English letter, arriving at 7 o'clock, is in Dublin and the Cork train has departed at 6.30.</P>
    <P>Newbridge is about 28 miles from Dublin.  What do you think happens the letter?  The letter just stays in Dublin until 6.30 the next morning and the firm does not get it until 24 hours afterwards.  I put it to the Minister that some steps ought to be taken in a case such as that.  I know the Post Office suggested that the firm should get the letter delivered to their Dublin office and get the Dublin office to ring up and tell the Newbridge office what is in the letter.  That is to be taken down by shorthand typists in Newbridge.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Post Office would not make another dispatch to Newbridge.  It would cost very little.  I will not say merely to Newbridge.  They ought to make a dispatch to other places as well if the need for it can be established.  Here is a firm doing its best to get into the British market and to maintain a foothold there.  Yet it finds, because its English letters arrive at 6.30 and after the Cork train has left, it cannot get the letters for another 24 hours.</P>
    <P>It ought to be possible to make up another bag and send it down by a later train to Newbridge, have it collected at Newbridge and delivered. That could be done in a number of other cases where similar circumstances existed.  I see no reason why a firm in Newbridge ought to have its letters read over the phone to its Newbridge office and the details taken down in the year 1960.  Talk about electronic methods of doing things in the Minister's speech!</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> I think this matter has been brought to the notice of the Post Office but all the firm gets by way of enthusiasm and encouragement for its efforts is to be told to have the letters sent to their Dublin office and get them read over the phone even though the letters involved might contain drawings, sketches or other enclosures which could not be properly communicated over the telephone.  I hope the Minister will look into that and get the Post Office to adopt some 1960 remedy in this particular case.</P>
    <P>The question of uniform clothing was another matter I raised last year. I said then&mdash;and I want to repeat it now&mdash;that the uniform for postmen is of a quality which seems to collect every particle of dust in an office. The clothing is supposed to be blue but, in fact, it is such a dust collector that it is more frequently a greyish colour than blue.  That is so because the material has a soft surface.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be a much inferior cloth to the cloth in the Garda uniform. It certainly does not give the postman a smart appearance.  It does not seem to hold its shape.  It seems to collect dust and get untidy.  I think that in a matter of this kind you may have to go through a period of trial and error but some effort ought to be made, in the interests of the appearance of the outdoor force and in the interest of the Post Office service generally, to get some kind of cloth which will give the postmen a better uniform than they have today.  The present uniform is unsuitable.  It is hard to imagine it is not possible, with so many mills in the country, to devise some kind of uniform material which would give better results, a better appearance and eliminate the dust collecting proclivities of the present material.</P>
    <P>In the course of his statement the Minister indicated that telegraph reorganisation was now almost completed and it did not seem likely that any further substantial economies could be effected.  I should like to ask the Minister does that mean now the Post Office is settling down so far as its telegraph service is concerned and <Col N="1432" /> recognising that the present position is going to remain its basic telegraph set-up?  I notice that the Minister says that the fall in telegraph traffic amounted to four per cent. last year. One can appreciate that changes will have to be made if telegraph traffic continues to fall, as it is falling in practically every country in the world.  The more you develop the telephone, as experience has shown, the more you help to kill the telegraph service and the more people who instal telephones the less they will be inclined to use the telegraph service except for purposes where the written word is regarded as essential.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister say whether redundancy in the telegraph service is now at an end or is it still to be assumed that there is redundancy in the telegraph service and, if so, what is its extent?  What steps are the Post Office authorities taking to deal with the matter?  Do they propose to allow it to waste itself out through relirals, deaths, promotions and so on, or have they a special method in mind for dealing with the problem?  Last year I mentioned that this was a matter which affected a lot of people and I urged the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to their interests.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the Minister gave me that assurance and that the Post Office have, particularly in the past twelve months, acted in a reasonable manner and not in a way that was harsh or which imposed needless suffering on the members of the staff, but the staff would like to know is this the end?  They would like to know if they have come out of the crucible, if it is now all over and if they will now be allowed to function without fear of being told that they are redundant and with the prospect of being transferred to other branches of the service to which they do not want to go and with the operations of which they are not familiar.  I should like the Minister to tell us something on that subject when he is concluding.</P>
    <P>I asked a question here on the 26th April to ascertain how many posts had been suppressed in the Post Office Department in 1958-59 and 1959-60, covering a variety of grades from overseer <Col N="1433" /> to junior postman.  The Minister gave me some statistical information in reply.  I should like to ask the Minister some questions arising from his reply.  For example, according to the Minister's reply 28 Post Office clerkships, Grade A, were suppressed in 1958-59; 21 Post Office clerkships Grade B were suppressed in 1958-59, and 30 full time postmen's posts were suppressed in 1959.  In 1959-60 43 Post Office clerkships Grade B were suppressed and 21 postmen's full time posts were suppressed.  I cannot understand how these suppressions have taken place in an expanding service.  I should like to ask the Minister what brought about the suppression of these indoor posts, the clerk posts, and the suppression of the 51 full time postmen's posts in the two years?  It is not clear from the answer whether the 51 outdoor posts were suppressed because that number of full time posts were down-graded from full-time to part-time, which of course would be a very retrogressive policy and something which we thought the Post Office had abandoned in other years.</P>
    <P>It may well be that that is not the explanation but I have a suspicion that it is and that a large number of full-time posts have been reduced from full-time to part-time which, as I said, is against what was expected and against the normal run of Post Office policy in recent years.  I should like to know from the Minister whether, so far as he is concerned, he stands for a policy of cutting back full-time posts to part-time posts with all the hardship, inconvenience and rates of pay associated with these part-time posts. I would hardly imagine that the Minister would adopt this as a general policy and I think it desirable that he should clear the air on the matter.  It may well be that some posts have to go because of fluctuations in work but it is another thing if, for the purpose of achieving economies when they have a surplus of £250,000, the Post Office should embark upon cutting down posts from full-time to part-time.  I hope the Minister's statement will be reassuring on that point.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer to a decision by the Post Office Department to require female telephonists to work <Col N="1434" /> until 11 o'clock at night.  The old practice, in the days when the Post Office had a much more gallant outlook on ladies than it has today, was that womenfolk were never employed after 8 p.m.  During the last war, however, in an effort to assist the Department, a number of telephonists worked until 10 p.m.  The Post Office made virtue out of necessity and said: &ldquo;That is a good idea; they should be kept working until 10 p.m.&rdquo;. Various efforts have been made to induce the Post Office to abandon the employment of female staff after 8 p.m. and to restore the previous and normal practice that women were never employed after 8 p.m.</P>
    <P>Far from being regretful about their attitude the Post Office have now decided that they will employ telephonists until 11 p.m.  In other words, not only do they not propose to go back to 8 p.m. but they are going on to 11 p.m.  I know it can be argued that you can see waitresses working at 11 o'clock at night and that you can see nurses working at night.  That does not seem to be an argument against the complaint at all.  You cannot have male nurses working at night and dealing with all kind of patients of different sexes, but the Post Office have the obvious remedy in this case.  They can find men to do the late work and I can see no reason why they do not get men to do the late work and restore the previous practice.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Post Office, male operators work as efficiently as female operators; from the point of view of the service they give, the service would be as good by male operators as by female operators. There is only one advantage to the Post Office in keeping telephonists on duty until 11 p.m., that is, that they are cheaper and the Post Office employs them because they are cheaper and the Post Office, which can show a substantial surplus on the telephone side of its operations, nevertheless continues to require girls to work at present up to 10 p.m. and unless it abandons its new intention they will be employed until 11 p.m.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that requiring girls to work until 11 p.m. is <Col N="1435" /> objectionable to the girls; it is a retrograde policy and one which is bound to beget the steadfast hostility of these girls.  The telephone service is of vital importance to the public; it is absolutely essential that the highest possible measure of goodwill and co-operation should exist in the operation of a service of that kind, but you cannot get goodwill and co-operation from people by worsening their hours of attendance.  The service should be willing to pay in decent conditions for the goodwill and co-operation and undoubted efficiency which they get from the staff employed in the telephone section of the Department.  This is not just a matter of deciding the issue by reference to what is written in cold, impersonal files or of filling in the squares on duty-charts or looking at red lines or black lines.</P>
    <P>There is a human problem in this matter and I should like the Minister to look into this personally as I believe a solution can be found for the difficulty which will continue to beget the goodwill and co-operation of the telephone staff and, at the same time, provide the public with as good a service as they are getting to-day.  I urge the Minister strongly not to take a decision in this matter which I think would churn up and throw into question a good relationship and a standard of co-operation without which it is not possible to maintain any efficient service.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to raise concerns early morning deliveries in Dublin and elsewhere throughout the country.  At present postmen are required in many cases to attend for duty at 6 a.m.  I do not suppose there is anybody else in the street except postmen at 6 a.m., apart, perhaps from the occasional milkman.  But postmen continue to be required to attend at 6 a.m. and to get out with their delivery and be on the street between 7 and 8 a.m.  If a postman has a small packet to deliver or a registered letter from the income tax authorities or from some beneficent uncle sending a cheque, he cannot put it in the letter-box. He must try to get a member of <Col N="1436" /> the household up and the householder usually appears at the door half-clad having been disturbed from his slumbers just to sign for the Land Commission or the income tax registered letter.</P>
    <P>The Post Office fondly believe that they are conferring a great benefit on citizens by getting them out of bed at 7 or 7.15 or 7.45 in the morning to sign for such letters.  The householder takes the letter and promptly throws it on the table and goes back to finish his sleep but that does not matter to the Post Office.  They think people enjoy getting up to sign for these letters and going back to bed.  I put it to the Minister that in 1960, it is time that there was another look at this whole business. It does seem absurd to deliver letters and to struggle to deliver registered letters and newspapers by knocking at doors at an hour of the morning when every intelligent citizen is asleep, and not merely knocking once, but two or three times, because if the postman does not get rid of the parcel or packet he has to deliver, he must bring it back to his office and take it out again, when the streets are well aired and when the citizen who was resting in the morning has come out of his place of residence at a natural hour.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that that is a matter which ought to be examined. I am quite sure he can give the public an efficient service in the morning without having people on duty at 6 a.m.  If the Minister knows where Walkinstown is and found he had to get to Pearse Street by 6 o'clock in the morning, he would find that in fact he had to be out of bed by 5 a.m. or 4.45 a.m. and that would be his regular life or, if you like, his irregular life which he would lead regularly.  This matter ought to be reconsidered and examined by the administration and the staff side to see if it is possible to evolve a scheme of delivery which will give the public a delivery of letters at a reasonable hour, without at the same time requiring postmen to be out of their beds before 5 o'clock in the morning as a regular arrangement right through the year.</P>
    <P>No other branch of State service, not even the Defence Forces, finds it <Col N="1437" /> necessary to do this.  Even from the point of view of police duties, I venture to say there is a very minimum of police out of bed at 4.45 a.m. and I do not know any other kind of activity in the State that requires such a high percentage of staff to be out of bed so early in the morning. If it were absolutely necessary, one might face up to it, but I am sure that with the application of intelligence to the problem and a willingness to rethink on the whole matter and not just try to justify it by referring to the fact that it has been there for a long time, it would be possible for the staff and the Post Office to come to a satisfactory arrangement which would give reasonable service to the public and tolerable hours of attendance to the staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on the very satisfactory report he has been able to give us in introducing this Vote.  The surplus revealed on the year's working is very substantial and the Department for which the Minister is responsible is probably the only Department of State which runs more or less on a commercial basis and makes a satisfactory profit.  Profit in any undertaking is something that gives satisfaction to all concerned.  However, there are many ways of making a profit and while I do not entirely subscribe to all the points made by the previous speaker, if the profit is obtained at the cost of denying to certain personnel forming part of the organisation, concessions and perquisites to which they are entitled, I think it is a wrong principle. Taking the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as a whole, I think the Minister has done a very good job in the year under review.  But, no matter how good the job, inevitably there will be some complaints and some contentious matters raised here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two aspects in particular to which I should like to refer. It seems inevitable for the telegraph service to lose money.  The position has been discussed year after year here and the loss tends to increase rather than diminish.  The Minister carried out a reorganisation scheme in connection with the telephone service <Col N="1438" /> last July and that must inevitably react on the telegraph service.</P>
    <P>Recently the Department increased the cost of telegrams.  Increasing the cost of something does not always make up for a loss.  It seems to be the method most generally adopted to meet a deficiency but, if my memory serves me correctly, there have been fairly substantial increases in the cost of telegrams over the last five or six years and those increases have certainly not remedied the situation.  We can all of us remember when a telegram cost 1/- or 1/6d.  The same telegram today costs 3/-.  I often wonder if it is entirely wise to increase the cost of telegrams to meet a deficiency in the service.  On the whole, the undertaking is a very successful one and it would not be reasonable, in my opinion, to expect every section to pay its way or make a profit.</P>
    <P>There is a potential market where telegrams of congratulation and condolence are concerned.  I think that type of telegram should be encouraged. It is a medium of communication which would be availed of to a very considerable extent if the charges were a little bit more reasonable.  As far as congratulations and condolence go, the telegram is an ideal form of communication.  The number of telegrams sent will, I believe, seriously decline as a result of the recent increase. I suggest that after a certain time the Minister should review the position to find out what effect exactly these increased charges have.  I think he will find the number of telegrams will decline and I am very doubtful that he will get the extra revenue he anticipates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The more telegrams you handle, the more you lose.  That is the unfortunate aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly looks like that.  The Minister referred to the reorganisation of the telephone system.  That is something upon which the Minister is to be congratulated. The policy of the Post Office is inclined to be conservative.  In the number of years in which they have been in existence they have very rarely thrown out a sprat to catch a <Col N="1439" /> salmon, as it were.  Now they have introduced a businesslike approach to the whole matter.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the success of that approach.  It did occur to me that this reorganisation might adversely affect postage revenue.  It is now more practicable and more expeditious to deal with certain matters by telephone rather than go to the trouble of writing, or dictating, a letter, as the case may be.  The Minister's bold approach is reaping very satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to complaints from certain areas.  No matter what way the Minister zones the country it will be impossible to satisfy everyone, and people will have to adopt a reasonable attitude.  On average, the Minister has done a very good job in a very short time.  There are cases in which subscribers find a certain divergence in telephone charges.  In one direction a phone call may cost 1/- or 1/6d. whereas a phone call over the same distance in another direction may work out much cheaper.  By and large, I think it works out pretty fairly on the whole.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to some congestion brought about as a result of this new arrangement.  I have had some experience of that and I must say there is very little congestion, far less than I thought there would be under the circumstances, remembering the increase, as shown by the returns, in the number of phone calls. I think the capital cost of installation could be reduced if a lower rental were charged in rural areas because, if the rental were reduced, the number of subscribers would increase.  The initial capital cost involved is fairly considerable.  The policy should be to use poles for the greatest possible number of connections thereby reducing the capital cost involved per subscriber. A preferential rate would encourage more rural subscribers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Country people are still somewhat conservative about the telephone. They seem to have a suspicion that installation might in some way increase valuations.  I think the Minister would be well advised, when <Col N="1440" /> replying, to indicate clearly that there is no danger in that direction.  When I have stressed the advantages of the telephone I have been met with the reply that the installation of a phone would increase valuation: &ldquo;It would be like putting on a room, or making some other improvement in the House; we would have the Commissioner of Valuation down on as to increase our valuations.&rdquo;  Many country people are still frightened about that.  The Minister should set their minds at rest by stating specifically that the Commissioner of Valuation does not take cognisance of telephone installations.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the group charge with which I have dealt briefly already, and I notice the estimated cost is £125,000 for the first year.  The Minister said the system worked very satisfactorily for subscribers and I think he indicated that the estimated loss to the Exchequer is fairly well within limits and he has no reason to expect that he will become involved in any deeper financial obligation than was estimated.</P>
    <P>The courtesy of the staff operating the telephone service is first-class. These people have to work under very nerve-wracking conditions and they do a very good job.  I must congratulate the Minister on the fact that the degree of courtesy which is displayed to subscribers has been increasing in recent years.  I wholeheartedly join with Deputy Norton in the appeal he has made that, as far as possible, the operators of telephone exchanges should not be asked to work long hours, that their service should be appreciated as something which is not found in every walk of life.  The general conditions applicable to established officers in the Department are fairly satisfactory but their hours rotate which is another difficulty which most employees would not find pleasant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Palmer and Deputy Norton made a plea for some improvement in the type of uniform issued to the postmen.  I have no complaint to make about that myself; more important than the improvement of postmen's uniforms is the formulation of some system of establishment for them. <Col N="1441" /> Every year when this Estimate comes before us for discussion most Deputies who make a contribution to the debate make an appeal that something should be done for unestablished postmen. The attitude of the Post Office authorities is not very convincing.  They use the argument that these unestablished postmen are not recruited by the Civil Service Commissioners and they cannot expect to get the same security of employment, pension rights, and so on, as those who are recruited through the Civil Service Commission.  The fact that these postmen are not recruited through the Civil Service Commission is no reason why they should be denied the rights enjoyed by other State servants.</P>
    <P>These posts are not so important that they have to be filled through the Civil Service Commission who usually recommend suitable candidates for employment in the higher branches of the State service.  The postmaster in charge of a district is quite competent to decide by interview the suitability of a person to be a postman.  It is quite possible for the Department to lay down minimum qualifications for the appointment of rural or urban postmen and for that person to be appointed from a panel of candidates brought before the local postmaster.</P>
    <P>These unestablished postmen give excellent service.  Every week of the year we take up the newspaper and find that a postman is retiring after 50 years' service and further down the news item we discover that this man is going out at 70 years of age, perhaps, and is lucky if he gets an old age pension.  The Department of Social, Welfare have rather stringent regulations in that connection but I believe these postmen succeed in getting the pension.</P>
    <P>That state of affairs is not good enough.  These unfortunate men do a very hard job for relatively small pay and some more practical approach should be made to this problem.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to try to reorganise these postmen and to bring them in under some scheme of pensions, whether contributory or otherwise.  The Minister probably will suggest that there are other types of <Col N="1442" /> pension for which they might qualify but surely they are entitled to something more than the ordinary old age pension when they retire.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of recruiting temporary postmen.  This is something that causes a good deal of irritation to every Deputy, that is, when a vacancy occurs in a district and the nominees for that vacancy are considered from a list supplied from the local exchange.  There is nothing wrong in that.  We all subscribe to that system as being a good one, but I think it is narrowed down a little too much.</P>
    <P>As far as I understand the requirements are that those who are getting unemployment assistance have first priority.  You could have a most suitable person who would be in receipt of some other form of social assistance, perhaps, home assistance, disability allowance or unemployment benefit, and because he does not happen to be in the top priority he is not considered. The system should be revised to include all people who are on any form of unemployment allowance, whether it be unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  I suppose there is no possibility that the Minister can end the present system of appointing unestablished postmen, but I should like him to look into that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not an Estimate which lends itself to much criticism.  That, in itself, is a tribute to both the Minister and his officials. I should like, on the contrary, to be complimentary to the Minister and his Department, a Department which employs over 16,000 and which has set a headline for other Departments in the matter of expenditure.</P>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on providing in Galway city, following long local agitation, the fine new G.P.O. building.  The building is welcomed both by public and staff and is worthy of the city of Galway. There is one small point.  I notice there is no receiving box for letters on the front of the building.  Possibly that is a detail to be settled at the last minute.  We shall welcome the Minister at the opening ceremony next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to congratulate the Minister <Col N="1443" /> on his intention to increase the size of the print in the telephone directory. That will be welcomed by all.  I have often been called into a phone box by old people who say to me: &ldquo;Try and make out that number for ms, sonny.&rdquo;  They say they have not got their glasses and I often have to tell them that I have not got my glasses, either.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago, I raised the question of a half-day for postal workers and I was told the matter was under active consideration in the Department.  I wonder what is meant by &ldquo;active&rdquo;?  I should like to know when such a concession will be granted to the staffs.</P>
    <P>During the tourist season in Galway, we have quite a heavy mail.  I should like to ask the Minister if the summer train service to Galway is being availed of to expedite postal deliveries and collections.  I raise this merely because it would help our tourist industry in the west.  I should like to see more use made of such slogans as &ldquo;See Ireland First&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ireland for Holidays&rdquo; in stamp cancellations.  I think there is an impression in the Department that unless you can say you have done the Continent, it is not the thing to see Ireland.  I think Ireland has a lot to offer, but we shall leave that for another Vote.</P>
    <P>I should like again to draw the attention of the Department to the need for a letter box in Barna, Galway.  This is an up-and-coming tourist area which caters for large numbers of caravans in the tourist season.  It has been suggested by the postal authorities that the traffic would not justify it, but if they give it a trial, I think they will find there will be a demand.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the new Galway post office building and, in conclusion, to compliment him on the way he has presented this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister, in his opening statement, did not say that, in the near future at least, he will bring in some kind of <Col N="1444" /> pension scheme for our rural postmen. It is a shame to see postmen who have served about 50 years retiring with only 12 months' gratuity. It is high time some Government undertook to bring in some kind of pension scheme for them.  I do not think there are a great many postmen to be provided for.</P>
      <P>While I welcome to some extent the recent group charge in respect of the telephone service, I disagree with it in other ways.  If you live in a country area, you may get a phone call within 25 miles on one side of you for 3d., while on the other side, for a much shorter distance, you have to pay 1/3d.  In that way, it is unfair.  If it is 3d. in one case, that should apply on all sides.</P>
      <P>Speaking on this Estimate last year, I referred to postmen in country areas who asked to have their routes tested. I feel that in certain cases they are not being treated fairly.  It may happen that the person who goes out to do the test arrives on some day of the week when the mail is not heavy.  He may arrive on a very fine, calm day.  In country places, and particularly in the West where you have bad roads and so on, I feel some of them do not get a fair test.  I know of certain cases where some of them have asked for a re-test within a certain time and the answer they got back from the people in charge was not very nice.  I object to any such answer being sent to a postman who has given faithful and honest service and I think it should not be tolerated in any county.  If postmen throughout the country seek to make representations to their T.D.s&mdash;no matter what side of the House they are on&mdash;they are threatened with dismissal and I take a very strong view of any such notice being issued to any postman. If he does not get satisfaction, if he thinks he is being victimised, it is up to him to tell his T.D., no matter what politics he may hold, and it is up to that T.D. to voice his opinion in this House and tell these people they are just human beings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My last remark is that I feel it is high time for the Minister and the Department to make a change in the uniform.  A postman may get a new <Col N="1445" /> uniform but after a couple of months &mdash;even, as a matter of fact, after one wet day&mdash;it is likely to melt off his back, and I sincerely hope that before the Minister introduces his next Vote in a year's time, he will have changed the uniform at present in use.</P>
    <P>I understand there are some places, especially seaside resorts in the west &mdash;I mentioned one in particular&mdash;that have applied on several occasions for public telephone kiosks but they have been told that the local post office is open until a certain hour at night, and that there is a private telephone available somewhere else.  I mentioned the village of Spiddal in particular, but everybody knows that even though there is a public or private telephone in a village, mostly they are in public houses and they also have to close down.</P>

      <P>I am not rising to criticise the Minister because I am satisfied that he and his Department have a very complex job to do because of the variety of services provided. The public appreciate the many services which the Post Office has initiated over the years, such as the telephone service, which is now in practically every house.  That is very helpful <Col N="1446" /> but, like other Deputies, I have a grievance in connection with postmen. To my mind, a postman has a hard job.  Winter or summer, he must slog along on his bicycle, in hail, rain, or snow, and the time has come when he should be allowed to use a motor bike or a motor car.  I know some postmen who have little motor cars of their own but they have to keep them locked up in sheds at home. The most dangerous vehicle on the roads at present is a bike laden with parcels, such as a postman has.  He has to carry maybe 7 cwt. on the handlebars, over bad roads, and he is meeting cars travelling at 50 and 60 miles an hour.  I believe he should be entitled to drive his own car and I would ask the Minister to reconsider the regulation governing that position.</P>
      <P>As regards temporary postmen, there are too many of them and some of them, after 30 years' service, are thrown out on the side of the road with absolutely nothing.  Sometimes they get a miserable gratuity, sometimes nothing at all, and I would ask the Minister to appoint them in a permanent capacity or reduce their numbers.</P>
      <P>Of recent years I notice we have had many cases of pilfering and theft in post offices.  So many of them have arisen in the past four or five years that something must be wrong because that did not happen in the past. Postal officials were always people of good character and integrity and this recent trend has been caused because sub-postmasters are not paid as they should be.  They have a genuine grievance.  As far as I know, some of them start off with £80 a year and it goes up to £100, or sometimes-more. It is not fair to expect people to carry on a service on such small pittances and I urge the Minister to reconsider their position.  They have a great variety of work to do.  They have to be people of character and business ability and, as far as I am aware, they have no allowances for rent, for assistance of any type, and no provision for sickness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 101 other things also wrong.  They get no gratuities on retirement and they have no allowances <Col N="1447" /> for the heating and lighting of their premises.  This is a field in which the Minister can do very good work and it must be remembered that sub-postmasters are very important people. After the parish priest and the schoolmaster, the postmaster comes next in order in a town, and the Minister should do something to ensure that they get a reasonable standard of living and be able to pay proper wages to their staffs.  At present sub-postmasters throughout the country have to employ young girls and can pay them only very small pittances.</P>
    <P>In addition to these grievances, sub-postmasters in the city of Dublin are being menaced by midnight thugs who find post offices are handy places for committing robberies, and some of the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have actually been attacked by them. They are open to grave danger from that type of thug and it is only right that they should have a reasonable living standard and that their premises should be something they can be proud of when transacting their business. Many post offices are only old tumbledown shacks but sub-postmasters cannot have anything else if they are paid only from £80 to £100.  That is scandalous and I think justice should be done to these people.</P>
    <P>They are responsible people but they have to depend on the staffs under them, and they should be put in the position to pay reasonable wages to the assistants they have to employ.  At present sub-postmasters are not allowed anything for the employment of assistants in country areas.  In most cases they have little shops but the business they do in them is merely a bagatelle, and in most cases at present they have to wait a long time for their money to come in.  For these reasons, I would ask the Minister to look after the needs of sub-postmasters.  He is a very reasonable man and if these people have a grievance, I hope he will help them as much as possible during the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very long and wide-embracing introductory statement and, as I said at the outset, he has a hard and onerous task.  I do not think there is any other Department <Col N="1448" /> of State in which a Minister has to tread so warily as in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Over a long number of years, we saw all sorts of trouble happening with Ministers in different Governments in charge of that Department.  They have to walk very cautiously and therefore I know the Minister has not an easy task.  I appreciate that he is a good Minister, doing good work, and I am glad to say that he is a colleague of mine from my own county.  I am proud to say that he is a man who has given long years of service in many fields helping the country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again ask him to look after the sub-postmasters all over the country.  We want our post offices to be places we can be proud of and we should pay our sub-postmasters reasonably well so that they will be able to pay good wages to the assistants they employ.  If we do that, we shall not have this pilfering going on over the years.  That happens simply because these people are not paid and must get money somewhere.  It is very hard on a sub-postmaster who is brought to court as a result of some offence, of which he had not been aware, by an employee.  There may have been pilfering in his office for years and he might not know about it. The Post Office require men of character and integrity.  They can have them but they must pay their staff. I would ask the Minister to see what he can do to ease the position of sub-postmasters who are badly underpaid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Giles and other Deputies who have spoken on behalf of sub-postmasters and their employees in rural Ireland.  The Post Office section of the Government take pride in their efficiency and the fact that they are able to run their services on an economic basis.  The fact is, of course, that they are, without exaggeration, the worst employers in the State in many regards.  That fact is seldom brought home to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers from time to time take refuge behind the argument that sub-postmasters have their union and are in a position to invoke arbitration in <Col N="1449" /> respect of their pay.  That argument is completely fallacious.  I would appeal to this Minister, as a man who always has his ear to the ground, who understands the problems of people in rural Ireland, not to be misled by the ráiméis and patter put up to him by civil servants who are as far removed from the country areas today as their grandfathers who came from rural Ireland and have forgotten all about it.</P>
    <P>It is beyond contradiction that there are girls employed in rural Ireland in sub-post offices at a wage of £1 per week, and perhaps less.  That is happening under the so-called efficient Department of Posts and Telegraphs. There is very little use in appealing to private employers&mdash;who, in many cases, were it not for trade unions, would exploit labour still further&mdash;to give good conditions and good wages to their employees when such an example is set by a Department of State which should be setting good example. Of course, it can be argued that because of the fact that up to very recently the appointment of sub-postmasters was on a political basis and that there was such a large number of applicants in most cases, the Department felt that it was safe to leave the emoluments at the bare minimum. Again I say that it is beyond contradiction that the hours that some of these people have to &ldquo;punch&rdquo; in are disgraceful in a Christian community. Sub-postmasters in many rural areas are not in a position to pay staff to relieve them.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that very few sub-postmasters are totally dependent on their position as such.  Of course, sub-postmasters are not dependent on these positions.  In many cases they could not exist for more than three months on their emoluments from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for working, perhaps, from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.  In many instances they have a little shop attached to the post office. It is well known to this Minister, as a man from rural Ireland, that in many small post offices the most that is sold is sweets, perhaps a few loaves of bread, sugar and biscuits.  In many cases, if they are able to make a profit of 25/- a week they are doing very well while at the same time trying to <Col N="1450" /> keep the post office going.  I am asking this Minister to look into that matter personally.</P>
    <P>The Minister need only visit any rural post office in his own county or in the west or south to check for himself. I think he knows the position already but possibly he is up against the difficulty that races every Minister when he assumes office, the power of the men behind the throne.  Every Deputy, who knows the circumstances in rural Ireland and who feels as I do, has a duty to refer to it in this debate or else to inform the Minister outside the House that he will have the full support of every Deputy in any steps he may take to improve the conditions of employment of sub-postmasters and their assistants.</P>
    <P>The other matter I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister is in connection with telephone charges. There has been a great deal of talk about the reduction that has taken place in the cost of local calls in recent months.  That trend is welcome but the approach to this question is very timid and uninspired.  The argument over the years, in this service as in others, has been that the more people avail themselves of a service the lighter the charge will be on the people using the service.  That is a logical conclusion. If there are 20 people using a line which was used by only four persons five years ago, surely the charge should not have increased.</P>
    <P>It is at the stage when the demand for telephones is increasing that the Minister should take his courage in his hands and decrease the charges.  If he takes the view that he will be snowed under with applications for telephones. so much the better.  If there is an accurate estimate of the date of installation, most applicants will be satisfied.  It is disheartening in a service like the telephone service that there is no reduction in charges arising from the increase in the numbers availing of the service.  For instance, the charge for a telephone call from Roscommon town to Dublin works out at 2/9d.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the charges for the public telephone service are far too <Col N="1451" /> high.  If someone needed to make, say, two or three telephone calls to Dublin, would it not tempt him if he could make, say, two calls at a reduced price.  If the charge for a call from Roscommon to Dublin were reduced to 1/9&mdash;take off 1/&mdash;he could thereby make both calls for the sum of 3/6, rather than the present situation of having to pay 5/6 for the two calls.</P>
    <P>The telephone is no longer a luxury to many people.  I doubt very much if that fact is taken into consideration by the Central Statistics Office, or any other office, in computing the cost of living.  It should be considered, nowadays, because quite apart altogether from the impact on the individual's monetary position, the overall position of the State would improve because of the increased revenue which would accrue, due to the greater demand for the service.</P>
    <P>At any rate, I should like to hear the Minister's comments on this matter because it also applies to other services which do not arise on this Estimate. A serious situation obtains in rural Ireland where we have a decreasing population.  While we have that decreasing population, we have, at the same time, a very healthy and increasing demand for services like the telephone service.  Every effort should be made to ensure that that demand is not stifled or slowed down.  When a certain stage is reached so far as applications are concerned, it appears that in the Department there is a slackening off in relation to further applications.  It is well time then to consider further increasing the attractiveness of the service, and the most sensible way to do that is to examine into the possibilities of a very generous reduction, a big reduction, in the cost of telephone calls.</P>
    <P>There are some genuine and justifiable criticisms to be levelled with regard to delays on the line in many rural areas.  I do not know what that is due to but the position is most aggravating.  Of course, that again is a factor which is bound to slow down the demand for telephone installations in many rural areas.  If a person finds he has to wait, anything from 10 <Col N="1452" /> minutes to 50 minutes to obtain a local call within a distance of 12 miles, he will very soon get fed up waiting.  I do not think anyone could blame him for being inclined to burn the telephone with his comments.</P>
    <P>Whatever about improving the trunk and cross-Channel services&mdash;I agree with that&mdash;we should not neglect to improve communications in the rural areas.  I suppose it is much fairer and much better all round to give a specific example.  I wrote to the Minister some time ago about delays in telephone calls between a place called Ballyforan in Roscommon and the surrounding towns.  It is beyond contradiction that it takes three-quarters of an hour even to make contact between that village and Roscommon, 12 miles away.  That state of affairs has obtained for longer than I care to remember&mdash;I shall put it that way&mdash;and I hope I shall not have to keep on remembering it, but that some attempt will be made in the near future to make available the extra lines needed to improve that service.</P>
    <P>In that locality the Sugar Company has a scheme in operation.  I found, to my misfortune, on a number of occasions when I wanted to make telephone calls, that I had to wait while that company stayed on the line for half an hour.  There is just one line which has to service half the parish.  So far as I can see, because they happen to be a quiet type of people in the locality&mdash;they are civilised, humble and patient&mdash;they will be left in the same position and have to suffer on patiently, unless someone speaks for them. I want the Minister to understand that the fact that I am speaking very mildly on this Estimate may be somewhat deceptive.  If necessary at a later stage, I shall raise this matter on an Adjournment Debate when I shall deal specifically with the case of delays I have noted over a period of 12 months.  I shall give the times concerned and the excuses put forward when the postmaster was queried on them.</P>
    <P>I have often had occasion in Dublin to make telephone calls down the country and when I lifted the receiver <Col N="1453" /> and asked for &ldquo;Long distance&rdquo;, I was often put on to &ldquo;Cross-Channel&rdquo;.  The idea in Dublin seems to be that if you ask for &ldquo;Long distance&rdquo;, you are automatically and without delay put on to &ldquo;Cross-Channel&rdquo;.  It is desirable to have such efficiency, but I do not see why, if I want to ring some allegedly insignificant little village in rural Ireland, I should have to wait for perhaps three-quarters of an hour or an hour to get the call.  The people in the rural areas deserve more consideration than to be left at the tail-end of the queue for any of these services which are being made available.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to see that priority is given in the rural areas on this question of installation and to examine into the possibility of further reductions all round in telephone charges.  Finally, I should like to assure him, as have other Deputies, that he will have the unanimous support of the House in any steps he takes to improve the conditions of sub-postmasters and their assistants in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on the very good job he is doing as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. I have just a few points to make and I shall be brief.  I understand there is great delay in dealing with applications for telephones from Malahide, Rush and Skerries.  The Minister has assured me that trunk lines are being put into those areas and that very little can be done until these trunk lines are in use.  I appeal to him to bear in mind the necessity for early connection in these areas. Other people there will then be encouraged to apply for connection.  I was told recently that it would be six months before certain people in Malahide would get their telephones.  The same applies to Rush and rural Skerries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt various Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs have received representations in regard to part-time postmen or perhaps I should say three-quarter time postmen in rural Ireland. We have a number of such men.  They have no other employment.  They are quasi-permanent in their area. <Col N="1454" /> When they reach what would normally be retiring age they get extension after extension until they are unable to carry on any longer.  I trust the Minister will be able to do something on behalf of these men who have given long years of service and who, when they come to the end, although they have no other employment, must go out without any pension.</P>
    <P>I know the rules are there.  I know that a man must sit for an examination and, if he succeeds, is appointed. I would point out that the men for whom I plead have long years of practical experience and have given good and loyal service to the State.  Various Ministers have been very sympathetic in regard to the problem of part-time postmen and have given them extended periods.  Nevertheless, I should like the whole question to be re-examined with a view to seeing if anything can be done which will be of benefit to such men.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan spoke about the small sub-post offices throughout Ireland.  It is indeed a big problem. I have found that, as a result of the small amount of money sub-postmistresses or sub-postmasters receive for doing the job, they cannot afford to pay an able assistant.  Just as in the case of the part-time postman, this also is a big job.  What can the Minister do about it?  Can the State afford to do anything better?</P>
    <P>A number of people have failed to carry out their work.  That is due, largely, to the small amount of money the sub-postmistresses and sub-postmasters are getting.  There, again, it is a financial consideration.  If the Minister decides to meet the position the question arises of how much it will cost the country.  Very often, Deputies agitate for post offices in their areas. That is especially true of Dublin where a number of new areas have been created.  I have agitated quite often for sub-post offices and then, later, the people concerned say they are not getting enough and cannot afford to pay an assistant.  Perhaps the State might be able to afford more central post offices and adequately-paid staff though I feel sure that from the financial point of view it would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>In a number of small areas it <Col N="1455" /> happens that the sub-postmasters or sub-postmistresses must answer telephone calls on their half-day.  I am glad that that duty is to some extent becoming unnecessary by virtue of the installation of the automatic telephone. We all appreciate that advance and it is very noticeable in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>From time to time there are complaints about the late delivery of letters in certain areas.  I have often wondered whether it would be possible for postmen in rural areas to change their route on certain days so that the same area will not receive a late delivery all the time.  In that way, the deliveries would be spread more equitably over the area of delivery.  In certain County Dublin parishes the post is delivered at say one, two or three o'clock in the day.  In the interests of fair play to all it might be possible for the postman to alternate his delivery routes so that the same area will not receive late delivery of post all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time past, I have been accusing the Minister for Finance, and correctly accusing him, of comparing the records of the Government in which I had the honour to be Minister for Finance and his Government in two entirely different ways.  I have accused him of criticising us on certain figures and of then applying entirely different criteria and entirely different figures to his own administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always taken the line, in doing that, that the manner in which we computed certain, charges and certain revenue was the correct one and that his was the incorrect one.  I want to repeat tonight that that was true and that the allegation made by the Minister in the course of the Budget <Col N="1456" /> debate, when he said that, taking his three years with my three years, his were £2 million better, comparing like with like, is untrue.  In saying that, I want to make it quite clear that when the Minister suggested he had got the figures from the officials of his own Department, I am not questioning the veracity of those officials.  Officials produce the figures on the basis on which they are asked to produce them and the basis on which the Minister must have asked them for those figures was a dishonest basis and an incorrect one.</P>
    <P>The facts are quite simple.  It only needs a little very simple arithmetic and addition.  The Minister stated&mdash;I do not challenge his figure because I agree it is correct&mdash;that over the period of three years from 1954 to 1957, the accumulated deficit, taking particularly into account the year 1956-57, was £7,900,000.  I have no difficulty whatever in showing&mdash;we have each been three years there; I had three years to 31st March, 1957, and the Minister has had three years to 31st March, 1960&mdash;that on the basis upon which he criticised me for having been in deficit £7,900,000, the Minister is at least £12 million in deficit.</P>
    <P>In my belief, the figure, as I shall show, is £13,280,000 but because the Minister would not answer my question today, I am not in a position to prove as conclusively as I would wish the last £1,200,000.  The Minister today refused to answer the question I had on the Order Paper which was purely an arithmetical question because he knew and because he frankly enough admitted in his reply to the Supplementary Question that if he did answer it, he would show that I had caught him out.</P>
    <P>As I say, the figure to compare&mdash; the Minister takes that figure; I do not challenge it&mdash;in respect of my record is £7,900,000.  In 1957-58, the Minister had a deficit of £5,880,000. In addition to that deficit, he had imposed customs duties instead of levies.  A rose by any other name will smell as sweet.  He called certain levies customs duties and they yielded him £692,000.  Remember that in the period when I was Minister for <Col N="1457" /> Finance, I took credit for no proceeds of levy towards balancing current Budgets.</P>
    <P>In the year 1958-59, the Minister went a step further and he not merely took the customs duties he had substituted for levies, £1,535,000, for current purposes but he also took the proceeds of the levies themselves, £1778,000.  In the year 1959-60, he did the same to the tune of £1,586,000 for levies and for customs duties, taken in lieu of levy, £1,855,000. Those figures are on the records of the House and the Minister will have no difficulty whatever if he adds up those figures now with pencil and paper&mdash;I do not expect him to be able to add them up in his head&mdash;in finding that they amount to £11,996,000. There cannot be any argument about them&mdash;deficits less surpluses.  I have given him credit for the surpluses. Deficits less surpluses, plus levy, plus the rose by another name, the customs duties he substituted for levies, make £11,996,000 or £4 million worse than the figures on which he has criticised me.</P>
    <P>That is not the whole story, but, as I say, because the Minister would not answer my question today, I cannot prove so conclusively to the hilt the balance of £1,224,000, but it appears that in the year 1958-59 and in the year 1959-60, the Minister took certain sums for certain subheads of various Votes which I had carried on current account and brought them not to current account but pushed them off, paying for them on the &ldquo;never-never&rdquo;&mdash;pushed them, in fact, to capital account&mdash;Vote 50, subheads O.4, industrial development grant-in-aid, and Q.1, Foras Tionscal grant-in-aid; Vote 53, Universities and Colleges; and Vote 57, grant-in-aid to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  All those totted together means that the Minister is borrowing £1,224,000 over these years for services which we met on current account.  As I say, that is the best computation I can make, the Minister not having answered the question.</P>
    <P>Let me say this.  I shall not quarrel with the Minister if he says that the total figure should not be £1,224,000, <Col N="1458" /> that it should be only £1 million.  Even at £1 million, it means that when you add the total levies he put into current account to the customs duties he substituted for levies to the deficits plus surpluses in the last three years, comparing like with like, the Minister's record is £5 million worse than it was during the previous three years ending on 31st March, 1957.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister and the House that it was the Minister himself who chose the standard of comparison; it was the Minister who chose to attempt by that standard of comparison on every possible occasion to pillory me and the inter-Party Government. I challenge the Minister to contradict the figures that I have given. I challenge the Minister to say in repect of any single one of those figures whether they are not the true and correct figures.  I challenge him to deny that the tots, the subtraction and the addition are not correct.  They are correct with the exception of the one item to which I have referred and about which he has not given me the information.</P>
    <P>The fact is undeniable that, on the basis which the Minister himself chose to pillory me and the inter-Party Government, his record is £5,000,000 worse in the last three years than in the preceding three years.  Those facts cannot be gainsaid and, when they cannot be gainsaid, I suggest that the Minister does himself, the Government, and his high office no good, no honour, in trying to suggest otherwise, as he did try to suggest in his closing speech on the Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>I am not the least bit thin-skinned. So far as I am concerned I believe that when you get into public life you have to take the knocks if you are going to give knocks.  It cannot be a one-way street.  But I believe in truth and the Minister shed all approach to the truth when he took a different line last week.  I suggest in fairness, in honesty and, above all. because of the dignity of his office, he should now either prove my figures wrong or have the manliness to apologise for having misled the House last week.</P>

      <P>I think it does not serve any good purpose for the Deputy to accuse me of trying to conceal any figures; I am not going to accuse the Deputy of giving wrong figures either, but the whole difference between us is whether we should add them up to a certain total or not.  Today I gave the Deputy the sources from which he could find all the figures he needed but he tried to force me to produce others which, in my opinion, had no meaning whatsoever, except, as I said, to support a fictitious case against an imaginary hypothesis.  I certainly did not say, as the Deputy says now, that if he produced the figures I would give the Deputy an opportunity of catching me out.  I am quite sure the Deputy will not lose any opportunity of catching me out at any time.</P>
      <P>This matter arose because last year at Budget time I drew the attention of the Dáil to the fact that there was a balanced Budget.  The Deputy said that in his time he could also balance his Budget if he had placed certain items like the expenditure on bovine tuberculosis and industrial grants as capital expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accusing the Deputy.  What he said was that I had put the expenditure on bovine tuberculosis and industrial grants on the capital side and taken the import levies in as current levies and that therefore the comparison, if you like, between my balancing a Budget and his was not sustainable.  This year when I was able to report again that the Budget for 1959-60 was balanced I thought I might anticipate the Deputy by giving amended figures to <Col N="1460" /> show what the result would be if the Deputy for his time had taken the expenditure on bovine tuberculosis and industrial grants and treated them as capital and taken import levies in as current levies.  The figures I produced showed that even on that basis the operations of the Deputy would not have proved as favourable as those for the last three years.</P>
      <P>When this was pointed out, the Deputy went on to a new claim, in my opinion&mdash;I do not know whether he mentioned it last year&mdash;and that is that the yields from the duties on the many items which were changed from import levies to ordinary duties should also be taken into account in comparing the three year period of office for the Deputy and the three years I have been in office. Perhaps I am as much to blame as the Deputy in this but I do not think it is going to serve any good purpose to say: &ldquo;If you take so-and-so it suits me and if you take so-and-so it suits you.&rdquo;  When you add it up, who is going to come out on top, because the next claim I shall make, if the Deputy produces those figures, is to say that I have lost in some ways about £4,000,000 in income tax and about £7,000,000 in increased social services?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would come back with something else which only proves the absurdity of the whole thing.  I want to say the burden on the Deputy of the capital expenditure, of current expenditure if you like, on bovine tuberculosis and industrial grants was comparatively small.  As a matter of fact, during the three years' term of office of the Deputy, the total amount was £400,000 but in my three years it was £7,500,000.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy did, I am sorry.  However, leaving that aside, I am trying to compare the various items which have been placed as capital by me and as current income and current expenditure by the Deputy.  Leaving all that aside, the Minister for Finance at Budget time gives a forecast of the estimates of revenue for the coming year and he gives a forecast of what he believes will be his expenditure.  The Minister tells the House what is going in as current income or current expenditure and what is going in as outside current income and as capital on the expenditure side.  On that basis he <Col N="1462" /> gives the House his estimate, and if it is correct, of course, it results in a balanced Budget.  Whatever I have taken in on one side or another, the estimate I gave for the last two or three years was correct.  In other words, the Budget was balanced, while the fact is that whatever they may put on one side or the other in three successive years, the estimate given by the Minister for Finance in the inter-Party Government at that time was wrong.  The Budget was not balanced in any of these three years.</P>
      <P>I am not claiming that I am a better financier than Deputy Sweetman but I am claiming that the reason Deputy Sweetman was unsuccessful in balancing his Budgets and why I was successful is that during the three years of Coalition Government the economy was declining and deteriorating and that during the three years when Fianna Fáil were in office the economy was improving.  That is the whole explanation.</P>

      <P>It is strange that economic statistics do not bear that out.</P>
