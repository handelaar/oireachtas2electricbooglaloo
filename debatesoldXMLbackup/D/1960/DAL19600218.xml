      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 3, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 8 (Votes 19 and 21).  It is proposed to interrupt business at 1.30 to take Nos. 13 to 8 and resume the debate on No. 12 after Questions or on conclusion of the discussion on these other items.  Questions will be taken at 3 p.m.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the Solicitors Bill.  The position is that it has been decided that the better course is to draft a fresh Bill, incorporating a number of amendments which have been discussed with the Incorporated Law Society.  The preparation of that Bill is proceeding but I could not say when it is likely to be ready.</P>

      <P>Nineteen amendments have been offered dealing with the hours of general sale in licensed premises.  A number of amendments overlap and if each were to be discussed separately, there would inevitably be repetition of debate.  I suggest, therefore, that the most convenient way for the Committee to deal with all matters at issue is to have separate debates on the following points:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Hours of trading on weekdays excluding the &ldquo;closed hour&rdquo; (Amendments 1 to 7, 1 (a), 17 and 18).</P>
      <P>2.  The &ldquo;closed hour&rdquo; in county boroughs (Amendments 8 and 16).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  The general question of whether in relation to St. Patrick's Day and Sundays the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained or whether licensed <Col N="563" /> premises should be open throughout the country (Amendment 9).  The details of the hours of trading will not arise here.</P>
    <P>4.  The hours of trading in the early afternoon on St. Patrick's Day and Sundays (Amendments 10, 11 and 12).</P>
    <P>5.  The hours of trading in the evening on St. Patrick's Day and Sundays (Amendments 13, 14 and 15).  It is suggested that the debate should also cover Area Exemption Orders (Amendment to amendment 57). </P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the section that provides for repeals, I should like to direct the attention of the House to certain matters that have had to be considered. Two of the provisions included in the Schedule are repeals and closely linked to the proposal about opening hours in Section 4 of the Bill.  These provisions are, first, Section 15 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, which is the <i>bona fide</i> provision, and, secondly, Section 16 of the same Act, which is the area exemption order provision. As the House will notice, both of these sections are included in the fourth line of the Schedule.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell has put down an amendment to retain the area exemption order provision and that amendment will ensure that the question of these orders will come up for discussion at the appropriate time.  I assume that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will in due course have some suggestions to put as to when Deputy O'Donnell's amendment should best be debated.  I need not refer to it further at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, no amendment relating to the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  Therefore, I think that we should consider at this point when it should be open for discussion.  I suggest that the time for any discussion on the <i>bona fide</i><Col N="564" /> provision is now.  I say this because the proposal to abolish the <i>bona fide</i> trade is very closely bound up with the hours of general opening proposed. Not only that, but the natural sequence is, first of all, to come to a decision on the question of the <i>bona fide</i> provision and then to discuss the general opening hours in the light of that decision.</P>
    <P>I think there could be no proper discussion about the suitability of any particular hours of general opening, unless the House, first of all, had come to a decision on the question of abolishing the <i>bona fide</i> provision. The impression I got from the Second Reading debate was that the House was overwhelmingly in favour of the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> provision, but, at the same time, some Deputies may have something to say on the matter.  If the suggestion I have made is acceptable to the House and to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, anything anybody wants to say on that matter should be said now on the section, Section 3, and the approval of the section by the House would be taken as including a decision to abolish the <i>bona fide</i> provision.  Discussion on Section 4 could then be proceeded with in the ordinary course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather imagine that we would become deeply involved if we do not deal with the <i>bona fide</i> provision on the first section.  On Section 4 we shall discuss general hours of opening, and if we have not come to a decision on the section abolishing the <i>bona fide</i> trade, we shall be discussing questions which refer to the <i>bona fide</i> provision which would leave us in a very involved state in which we would not be certain what the hours of general opening would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss the <i>bona fide</i> provision to any extent at all but we do want to discuss whether there should be a differential between the hours for county boroughs <Col N="565" /> and the rural areas.  I think the only point at issue is the question of whether we are to have different hours of opening for the county boroughs and the rural areas.  This Bill proposes to wipe out the differential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the <i>bona fide</i> section.  Does this section propose to repeal that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill dealing with the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade but there is a section to repeal Section 15 of the 1927 Act which is the provision dealing with the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  If we do that, we shall have dealt with the <i>bona fide</i> trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems clear that a decision on the net point of whether <i>bona fide</i> trading should continue or not does not limit the scope of the discussion on Section 4, which relates to various proposals for differential hours between the county boroughs and rural areas.  The net question on Section 3 is whether the system of providing special facilities for persons who are travelling under the <i>bona fide</i> code is to be preserved or abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many views may prevail in regard to this matter and Deputies will have an opportunity of expressing them. Personally I take the view that the <i>bona fide</i> system as defined in the old Act is now an anachronism and that these facilities, in the light of modern transport facilities, are no longer required and are capable of leading to abuses which it is desirable to end. Therefore, personally, I am in favour of abolishing the <i>bona fide</i> principle and of repealing the section in which it is enshrined in the Act of 1927.  On <Col N="566" /> the general question of hours, we can discuss that in detail when we come to consider Section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a decision is taken on Section 3 to abolish the <i>bona fide</i> provision, will that not eliminate any discussion on other sections of a differential between the county boroughs and the rural areas?  Is it not a fact that if you abolish the <i>bona fide</i> provision and then allow the discussion on the question of a differential, you are bringing back the question of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If 10.30 p.m. is to be the closing hour in the county boroughs and 11.30 p.m. the closing hour in the rural areas, you will have a resumption of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the position. The debate will be on whether we decide to have the <i>bona fide</i> provision or not.  If we decide to delete Section 15 from the 1927 Act, it does not preclude any discussion that may be likely to take place on Section 4. The debate will be wide open and it does not matter what proposals may be made to alter the hours.  It will not prevent Deputies from expressing their views on any particular point on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of abolishing the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  I thought the Minister was aiming at preventing duplication of discussion, but if we first take a decision on the <i>bona fide</i> question, it will be open to Deputies to discuss differentials on other sections.  Therefore, there would not be much point in taking a decision on Section 3 as far as the <i>bona fide</i> trade is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we repeal Section 15 of the 1927 Act, all we do is to abolish that way of getting around the ordinary hours of opening.  Having done that, we shall be entitled to say <Col N="567" /> what is to be done about the ordinary hours of opening.  Section 3 proposes to approve of the repeal of certain enactments.  As that section stands, it repeals the whole of one part of the Weights and Measures Act.  If Section 30 is accepted, it will mean a reduction of the extent of the repeal of the Weights and Measures Act.  It would not be open to change in the Schedule.  Is that right?</P>

      <P>On the question of a free vote, if Deputies refer to the statement made by the Taoiseach on Second Reading, they will see he made it very clear there would be no free vote on fundamental issues.  Members of the Opposition will agree with the point of view that a Government are here to govern and, if they come here with studied views in respect of a particular Bill, it has to be taken for granted it will have been fully considered <Col N="568" /> and that in their view these are the things they believe would be best for the people.  When the Taoiseach talks about fundamental issues, we must keep at the back of our minds that those are the issues we are not leaving to a free vote to decide and that the Government will take full responsibility in respect of matters they deem desirable in the interests of the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have formally moved this amendment and I take it that this and consequential amendments involve a discusson on the proposed opening hours in the county boroughs as well as in the rural areas. I moved this amendment because I believe there is no demand for longer opening hours in the county boroughs.</P>
      <P>It is as well to refresh the minds of Deputies on what happened in regard to the Commission.  As Deputies know from reading the Report of the Commission, they were very narrowly divided and, in fact, the issue which divided them was the question of night closing in the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford. As I understand it, at one of the last meetings of the Commission, there was a majority in favour of the existing opening hours.  That was carried by a vote.  I think it was carried by only one vote, but nevertheless it was carried.  There was a later meeting of the Commission &mdash; I notice Deputy Corry is smiling: I gather some of the Cork representatives changed their minds&mdash;and again a narrow majority of one or two decided in favour of the proposed opening hours which are included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether the majority was one way or the other, it was a narrow majority, and a fair interpretation is that the <Col N="569" /> Commission divided more or less evenly on this matter.  So far as one can gather&mdash;there was no evidence produced; at least no substantial evidence &mdash;the Commission decided in favour of extended opening hours in the county boroughs.  In fact, the two major organisations concerned with this matter, the Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' Association and the union representing the employees are equally opposed to them because they consider there is no case for longer hours and that, in fact, a great many problems will arise if the hours are extended.</P>
    <P>Some few years ago when An Tóstal was first instituted, special exemption orders were granted to city publicans on the assumption that An Tóstal would involve increased business late at night.  The result of that experiment was that most publicans found it was not worth their while to apply for the exemption orders because in fact there was no increased business.  The public do not want later or longer drinking hours in the county boroughs.  The people directly concerned, the traders and the employees, are opposed to them for many reasons.  They would involve longer working hours for both, without any compensatory advantage of increased business.  Even if it means some increase in business, it is not considered worthwhile.</P>
    <P>There is the very important consideration that if the proposed hours came into operation, public transport, in many cases, would have ceased when those directly concerned, particularly the employees&mdash;most of the traders live on or adjacent to the premises&mdash; would have no public transport available to bring them home.  The position, therefore, is that so far as one can gather, the only suggestion in favour of later opening hours was that adduced on behalf of Bord Fáilte. While one can recognise the interest of Bord Fáilte in providing adequate facilities for tourists, the available evidence shows that, when the exemption orders were granted in the early years of An Tóstal, those facilities were not wanted and in fact were not availed of to any great extent and that if any special or extra facilities were required <Col N="570" /> for tourists, the better procedure would be to grant area exemption orders for tourist areas.</P>
    <P>One can understand that for a specific festival or event of some sort, there might be some need for extra facilities in a district or districts, but, so far as the city of Dublin and other county boroughs are concerned, there is no evidence whatever that any large number of tourists are anxious to have such facilities.  It is a mistaken view that because tourists have longer drinking hours on the Continent, they should have them here.  One of the attractions for tourists, when they go to a strange place, is to experience the customs and way of life of the people of that place.  It is a mistaken view that because there are longer hours or different hours of drinking in Continental countries, such hours should be applied here.  Such a view ignores the general desire of tourists to avail of the normal customs and facilities of the country.</P>
    <P>Tourists who go to France or other Continental countries like to follow the customs there.  Of course, the weather and the general way of life in those countries are entirely different from those here.  Even on a summer night, few people would be disposed to sit and drink outside a bar in O'Connell Street, whereas on the Continent people do so quite late into the night.  The suggestion that tourists desire these facilities here or would be attracted by them is contrary to practice and experience.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that there is no case for longer opening hours in the city.  Undoubtedly&mdash;this may involve a differential in opening hours&mdash;there is a case for later opening in rural areas, for many reasons.  Conditions of work in rural areas are different from those in urban areas.  In the summer evenings, farm work and so on involves people in being late in the fields.  Again, people have to travel longer distances to the public houses. City life and urban life are different and, for that reason, I believe there is a case for a differential between urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>One of the principles of the Bill as presented here is to try to wipe out <Col N="571" /> the differential.  That differential has existed for a very long time.  Whether the differential is abolished in the Bill or not, it is generally recognised that the custom and practice of country life inevitably mean that people are later at work, particularly in summer months.  From April to September, people living in rural areas wishing to go to a public house would be anxious that facilities would be available at later hours than obtain in urban areas.  That is understandable. It arises from the custom and way of life in the country, where the whole life hinges on a different timetable. Consequently, there is a case for longer opening in the rural areas and, to that extent, I should think that 11 o'clock&mdash;possibly 11.30, but certainly 11 o'clock&mdash;would be more suitable.  There is certainly no justification for applying the hours in the rural areas to city or urban conditions. I feel there is no justification for opening hours longer than the existing opening hours, 10 o'clock in the winter and 10.30 in the summer, in the county boroughs.</P>
    <P>I have moved the amendment, therefore, in the conviction that, in so far as one could get any definite conclusion from the Commission, they were divided on this.  It does not matter which way the vote went in the last division on the matter: the Commission was split almost fifty-fifty.  At one time, there was a slight majority one way; and at another, there was a slight majority the other way.  Having considered the evidence adduced by the licensed grocers and vintners, by the union representing the employees and by the general volume of public opinion in so far as it can express itself through resolutions passed by bodies and organisations, and taking into account the fact that there was no evidence adduced to the Commission in favour of longer opening hours in urban areas, I believe the existing hours should be retained and that some differential should be provided or allowed for rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments that have been put down show that there is great concern about the closing hours in country towns and amongst the people generally.  The Bill will have lost its whole purpose if there is not more rigid control of closing hours, as indicated in the amendments.</P>
      <P>It may be said that there is a certain amount of inconsistency in the Minister's presentation of the Bill in contemplating the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade and, at the same time, having a free for all until 11.30 during the summer months.  I think the Minister can be charged with some inconsistency in that respect.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Cosgrave. I think uniformity is one of the principles of the Bill and we should go very far to maintain that principle, if we want to have respect for the law, because, immediately there is a differential, the practice Deputy McQuillan mentioned this morning will arise, of people going from county boroughs into rural areas in order to get the extra few drinks, and the last state will be worse than the first.  For that reason, I am totally opposed to any differential.  I am convinced that 10.30 is a reasonable hour and gives a fair opportunity to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that modern transport has made it possible for anybody who is anxious to have a drink, whether he is in a town or in a rural area, to have that drink in a matter of minutes, unlike the position in former times when he had to travel long distances and by slow means of transport.  If controls were necessary in the past, they are more urgently necessary today because of the change in our way of life.  The standard of <Col N="573" /> living has improved.  People have more pocket money.  Young people have more money to spend.  They can get all the drink they want at the specified times.  I am not a pussy-foot in any sense of the word.  Those who take drink regularly, within reason, have nothing to fear from the curtailed closing hours.  I have been speaking to many such people and they are all against the prolonged opening hours and I think they are quite right in that.</P>
    <P>The only people agitating for the long hours are the traders themselves and those who want to sit on into the night enjoying a few drinks, against their own best interests and the interests of their families.  We must all remember that our society is divided into all sorts of social groups.  Every boy from 17 years of age up is a member of some club or other, whether sporting, purely social or a vocational group.  There are social functions of all kinds associated with these organisations and the people have many more social contacts than their forebears had and many more opportunities of having a drink. Surely, with all that, there is greater necessity to curtail the hours during which drink is retailed, because of its dangers.</P>
    <P>We have very frequent dances all through the year and every day of the week and, if we are to have the Iicensed premises open until 11.30 at night, you will have people going out from dances in many cases under the influence of drink.  That is already happening in many places; if licensing hours are extended to 11.30 in the summer as provided in the Bill, that abuse will arise.  Those going to dances will not stay at home; they will go to a licensed premises and spend a few hours there before going to the dance. The modern tendency is to drag out all functions into the early hours of the morning and we are encouraging that tendency by making provision here for longer opening hours.  That would be disastrous, I think, to our society and we have a duty to try to preserve our society in the best possible form.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the family.  In thousands of public houses the only <Col N="574" /> livelihood that the family can depend on is the licensed trade, the profit made by retailing liquor, and surely the house that is open all day and run by the family from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. has a long enough day.  That should be sufficiently long for any distributive trade.  Many of those licensed premises are in houses where there is little accommodation and consequently great interference with family privacy. It is bad enough to have that up to 10.30 p.m. but it should not occur after that because it would destroy all family life, as far as I can see.</P>
    <P>In these smaller houses the family may employ a barman or barmaid. They cannot afford to have them in the early part of the day and will employ them for the later part of the day.  I think 10.30 p.m. is late enough for anybody engaged in a distributive trade to work&mdash;the other trades close at regular hours and they have an 8-hour day.  I do not think we should follow the pattern enshrined in this Bill of having prolonged hours for a trade of this type, particularly if we want to have regard for the law governing these things.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the tourist trade during the Second Stage debate but I think tourists do not come here to gorge themselves with drink any more than we would go to another country to do so.  I think visitors will be edified if we have better control over these matters that lead to abuses in our society.  For that reason alone, we should preserve the good name of our country and let foreigners see that we have standards that are edifying and make a good impression.</P>
    <P>We realise that there are many abuses and a good deal of excess drinking in the country.  Every Deputy knows that we frequently find broken homes because of excess drinking.  We see men lose their positions because of drink.  Very frequently, in my own experience, young men overspend and get into debt because of the long drinking hours available.  The present state of affairs is bad enough but if we extend the hours we are creating a danger for the young people who, because of the modern trend of society, <Col N="575" /> have many more opportunities for getting into trouble.</P>
    <P>I was rather disappointed to hear the Minister refer today to the Taoiseach's statement&mdash;which was correct &mdash;that this is the sovereign tribunal. We all agree, but in the last analysis the people are the sovereign tribunal. This is not a political matter; it is purely domestic, and I think there should be a free vote if we are to get a real, valid and true expression of the people's will.  I think that is necessary in a domestic matter of this kind. How are we to enforce the law in regard to this Bill?  Everybody knows at the moment that if anybody wants a drink at almost any hour or any place he can get it.  How can the law be enforced in future if we extend the hours?  If we had a Garda at every public house door there would still be evasion.  The only way is to give this Bill to the people in the best possible form, the form that they want to have enforced.</P>
    <P>I believe the traders will still have a grouse but, if you have no differentiation, all traders will be on the same footing and there will be no excuse for breaking the law.  We have a solemn duty in this matter.  We must consider the home, our society and the future of our young people and for that reason I earnestly appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment and to curtail the opening hours in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have reflected very long on the matter of Sunday hours and I could not make my mind up about what is the right thing to do.  I believe the hours in the Bill are entirely too liberal because with travel so easily available now we would have many more accidents and abuses.  I hope somebody who knows more about the liquor trade and conditions in the city will speak on this important matter and that we shall have control over the Sunday trade and the St. Patrick's Day trade to a greater extent than is provided in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Manley only in respect of his statement that the proposal of Deputy Cosgrave <Col N="576" /> would create differentiation.  I suggest that what Deputy Cosgrave is aiming at here is to resurrect, so to speak, in another way, the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  It would create the situation that Deputy Manley has referred to.  It would mean that people would be leaving the city and going out to the suburbs to continue drinking for the extra hour that Deputy Cosgrave suggests should be provided in this amendment.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies suggested on the Second Reading&mdash;and I have heard it repeated outside the House&mdash;that nobody wants these hours, neither the publicans, the assistants, the traders nor the public.  May I remind the House that a Commission was set up to investigate the whole situation in respect of our licensing laws?</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Commission was a body of very responsible persons, that it was not only a fully representative body of citizens but that it was a cross-section of the people, that every possible view was represented on that Commission.  That Commission sat for a period of 12 months, listening to the evidence produced before them by witnesses, including the clergy, representatives of the Garda Síochána, representatives of the publicans and everybody interested in the licensing laws.  At the end of 12 months, having examined&mdash;I cannot say the exact number of witnesses &mdash;a very large number of witnesses, they came to the conclusion that the hours they recommended were the hours which, in their opinion, were best suited to the needs of the situation they had examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we say that nobody wants these added hours, we leave out of the reckoning the members of the public who can be termed, if you like, the drinkers.  They have no president to represent their point of view; they have no secretary to write letters to the Press setting out their point of view; but they must be a very large percentage of the people, and I find it difficult to reconcile the statements made by the various Deputies, including the two Deputies who have just spoken, when they say you can get drink at any hour you like after the normal licensing hours. <Col N="577" /> If that is so, does it not show that there must have been a demand, that the hours in operation were not sufficient to meet the needs of the people and that the Commission took these facts into consideration in arriving at their decision to extend the hours as proposed in this Bill?</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy Dillon, who asked me not to have a closed mind on this matter, that I have not got a closed mind on it.  I want to hear the views of the House and if I can be convinced in any respect that these hours should be altered in some minor degree, I am prepared to listen to those views, and, if I cannot come to a decision myself, to present the views which have been put before me to the members of the Government.  However, the arguments which I have heard here in respect of no one wanting these hours is almost a reflection on the Commission which sat examining this matter and which, after having listened over a period of 12 months to the views expressed to them by the various witnesses, made these recommendations.</P>
    <P>We are accepting these recommendations and we shall hear the views of the House in due course. Deputy Manley said we shall never be able to enforce them.  That is a view I have heard expressed before Deputy Manley expressed it.  All I can say is that as a Government standing over this Bill, we shall do our best to see that the regulations are enforced.  You will find from some of the amendments which we propose to the Bill that we intend to enforce the Bill as rigorously and as effectively as a Government can, and we hope whoever will succeed us in due course will continue to do the same.</P>
    <P>We propose to place heavy fines on persons found in these establishments after hours.  We intend to inflict fines on the people responsible to a very large degree for causing publicans to remain open, and we intend to impose on offending publicans other penalties, such as endorsements, which will be a very serious matter for them.  By these and other methods we hope to see that the law is respected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> I suggest to Deputies who will be taking part in this discussion that they should have some reference to these points of view, that what the Commission are doing here is being done in the belief that the hours in operation were not enforceable because they were not sufficient to meet the needs of the people.  We are accepting the views of the Commission in the belief that they will meet the needs of the people and that the rigorous enforcement which we propose will not be necessary.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, however, that Deputy Manley's amendment could not be accepted as I am also satisfied that to accept Deputy Cosgrave's amendment would be to give rise to a continuation in another form of the <i>bona fide</i> trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of opinion that uniformity of hours in town and country is necessary.  Whatever hour is decided upon for closing should operate in the city and in the country. Otherwise, I believe there will recur the very abuses we have sought to terminate by the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  Anyone with knowledge of rural conditions will dissent from the Minister's proposition that afterhours drinking is in itself evidence that the existing authorised hours are insufficient. I think it is true to say that if you fixed a closing hour of 1 o'clock in the morning, there would be certain people who would get no satisfaction out of drinking until five minutes past one, and part of the fun is to be in the kitchen, preferably at the back of the public house, drinking surreptitiously and getting away with it.</P>
      <P>I do not think the present hours are insufficient to provide reasonable accommodation for everybody.  I cannot discern any strong demand anywhere in the country for an extension of the existing hours, but, as the Minister says, we have the report of the Commission before us, and if we could arrive at a conclusion based on something approximating to reason and to uniformity of hours in city and country by fixing the closing hour at 11 p.m. all the year round, we would be wise to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> I must confess that a proposal to authorise the opening of public houses in country towns till 11.30 p.m. astonishes me and will produce quite a revolutionary effect on the life of the average rural town.</P>
    <P>I believe 11 o'clock is late enough. I admit the people are entitled to say to me: &ldquo;If you are going to advocate the extension from 10 to 11 p.m. in winter and 10.30 to 11 p.m. in summer, why are you so shocked by a further extension to 11.30 p.m.?&rdquo;  There is not any logical reason for that, except that 11 o'clock seems late enough, if it is not too late, but 11.30 outrages one's instinct in relation to what is reasonable and sensible as a closing hour fixed by statute.</P>
    <P>I throw out the suggestion that if we want to get a uniform hour for closing in town and country, it might well be fixed at 11 p.m. and let that operate everywhere.  I want to say deliberately to the House that it will be frightfully difficult to get effective enforcement of closing hours in rural Ireland.  I think there is force in the contention that the only really effective way in which you will ultimately get unanimous public support for licensing laws controlling hours to operate would be to abolish the hours of opening and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I believe that if that were done, abuses would appear but that when the abuses appeared the public demand for legislation to correct them would be so unanimous or so strong that the legislation resultant from that demand would be enforceable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make the suggestion I am making of 11 o'clock now only on the basis that a really strenuous effort is made to enforce it.  I am in conscience bound to say that with my knowledge of rural Ireland, I believe enforcement will be extremely difficult, not for the reason that it provides insufficient time for drinking but because <Col N="580" /> of this extraordinary predilection a very small minority of the rural population have for drinking after hours. Whatever hour you fix, they will still drink after it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to imply any reflection on the Minister but I think the Dublin mentality is quite different from the rural mentality.  I think most people with knowledge of rural Ireland will tell you that, no matter what branch of trade you are in, whether it is drapery, grocery, or the licensed trade, if you close your shop at seven o'clock, there is a certain minority of your customers who will dash in with their breath in their fist at one minute to seven.  Close the shop at 8 p.m. and in a week exactly the same men and women will be dashing in the door at a minute to 8 p.m.  The only way to persuade people of that kind to come in about 5 o'clock in the afternoon is not to close at all. Then you will find them arriving at quite a reasonable hour.  But so long as there are fixed hours, there is that small minority to anchor themselves to closing hour and to turn up there shortly before it.</P>
    <P>It is not the same minority but it is another minority who will not ever go into a public house until after closing hours.  In my opinion, that minority is not of sufficient dimensions to justify the allegations that there is a widespread desire for longer drinking hours in rural Ireland.  There is not.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that those who are at present going into public houses after closing hours will be deterred from going into public houses after closing hours because the hours are being made longer in this Bill.  But if&mdash;and it is a purely personal opinion expressed by myself in the light of the evidence in the Report of the Commission and of my own personal experience of living in rural Ireland, and I have a good deal of experience of this licensed business and of conditions in rural Ireland&mdash;we could get something approximating to effective enforcement and if we could get uniformity, I think there is a good deal to be said for agreeing, as a kind of compromise, on a uniform closing hour winter and summer of 11 o'clock in the evening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> I want to put a suggestion to the Minister in regard to this problem of enforcement.  I think most people associated with the trade will tell the Minister that if our object is to get licensed premises closed at, say, 11 o'clock, one of the great difficulties the licensed trader has is to get the people out of his shop.  It has been suggested to me that&mdash;I think it is in Scotland, though this may not be true, though whether it is a fact in Scotland or not, I think it is still a good idea&mdash;the obligation should not be on the publican to close his door at 11 o'clock and that to leave his door open should not be an offence, but that the publican should come out from behind his counter at 11 o'clock and leave the door open and say to the dilatory customers: &ldquo;Listen, gentlemen.  I am out from behind the counter.  Therefore, I am committing no offence.  But I am going to leave the door open and all the lights on.  The first Civic Guard walking the street will come and summon you, and you, and you and the penalties are very heavy.  So far as I am concerned, you can stay here all night.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not ignore this suggestion quite so readily.  One of the great difficulties of the licensed trader is to get his customers to leave.  You must remember that many of these people are in a small way of trade.  It does not suit them to quarrel with their customers or to be too rough on them.  None of them will take offence if he is put in a position to say: &ldquo;I do not care if you stay here until 2 o'clock in the morning, but, so long as you are here, I will leave the door open and the lights on and the first Civic Guard who passes will walk in and you are the people who will be prosecuted.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the heavy penalties prescribed here for persons being on licensed premises after 11 o'clock are enforced, you will not get more, but the enforcement becomes <Col N="582" /> very much easier for the Guards, very much easier for the publican and it becomes very much more difficult for the person who wants to stay on a licensed premises after hours to stay there if it is made manifest to him that he is the only person who will come under censure if he is found there.  I think it is a method of enforcement that is worth consideration.</P>
      <P>Subject to these observations, I am in favour of uniform hours.  I am not aware that there is any strong desire for longer hours.  I am certain that 11.30 p.m. is too late to leave public houses open in rural Ireland.  I believe a reasonable compromise might be to fix 11 p.m. as the closing hour in town and country, provided that it shall prove possible, effectively, to enforce this closing hour on all.</P>

      <P>I want to defend the proposal for extending the opening hours to 11.30, particularly in rural Ireland.  I have an open mind as regards the hours for cities.  They do not seem to want extended hours there.  Deputy Manley used all the arguments used by all people who are opposed to drinking. Anyhow, with regard to this extra extension of hours first of all, I want to say there is no extension of drinking hours at all.  There is really a curtailment of drinking hours as they exist at the moment.  At the moment publicans are open for the sale of drink until 12 o'clock midnight.  It only means that a man's customers have to come a few miles, with a few locals always mixed in.</P>
      <P>It is simply closing one's eyes to the facts as they exist to say there are not fairly generous hours of drinking, maybe after 12 o'clock in some cases, but as the publicans stand now their customers can drink until 12 o'clock. The proposed hours will allow them until 11.30 only and those associations who have been complaining about the extended hours which they feel will lead to extra drinking do not seem to appreciate that they involve a curtailment rather than an extension of hours, a curtailment from 12 o'clock.  Every local publican is open until 12 o'clock midnight and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would be all right to talk about the theory and the legal position but the practical side is not too well known to the people who have been raising most objections to the proposed hour.  The feeling in the trade is that drink is bought from sundown until the publicans close. That is the time when the country people come to the village to have a bottle of stout and those are the hours which are most important, so far as rural Ireland is concerned. If there were a proposal to close the publicans for the first six hours of the day it would hardly worry them.  If a publican were to keep a record of his sales and of the times they took place you would find that 90 per cent. of the sales take place from 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock.  I do not see anything wrong with drinking with the door open until 11.30 p.m. as compared with what we have at the moment&mdash;drinking with the door closed until 12 o'clock.  That is really what is proposed in this Bill, nothing more.  In actual practice that is what the difference will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Manley referred to dances. This means shorter hours for people coming to dances as one can see from a decision of the Supreme Court some time ago.  Dancers are now obliged to drink until midnight if they come from a radius of over three miles.  There was a time when once they entered a dance hall it was held to be a residence and they could not go to a local to have a drink.  Since that case at Rosses Point, or some place in Sligo, and the decision was given in favour of the dancers, they can drink until 12 o'clock irrespective of whether they have been in the hall <Col N="584" /> or not, so that Deputy Manley's point is completely wrong.  In the past they had until 12 o'clock.  Now they will only have until 11.30.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody has made a real case against the proposed extension. I was one of those who gave evidence before the Commission but I did not give evidence on my own behalf. I was briefed by a representative body of the entire traders of the county.  Some of the matters on which there was unanimity were that, first of all, the <i>bona fide</i> traffic should be abolished, secondly, that the hours should be extended and thirdly, having the time extended, the law should be rigorously enforced, so that once the door is closed it will remain closed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley spoke about the upset to family life, where a family is in charge of a public house.  There are a good many cases of families in charge of public houses and family life in a public house at present is fairly difficult. I do not think we need close our eyes to the fact that it varies from town to town and village to village, in accordance with the manner in which the law is enforced.  If there is laxity in the enforcement of the law the knocker of the door may be going all night.</P>

The facility of leaving the door open until 11.30 and then closing it and being able to say: &ldquo;Not merely am I closed but my neighbour is closed as well,&rdquo; will mean that life will be better for the publican.  Certainly the time for those people who wish to have drink at night will be shorter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Manley also referred to excessive drinking among the younger age group.  I do not think that is borne out by statistics at the moment. There are more people in total abstinence associations now than ever before.  If young people want to drink to excess they will have no difficulty whatever in getting drink until midnight at the present time.  In fact, it suits their purpose better to have it when the door is closed than when the door is open.  There is no case to be made there that is going to tend to abuses.  We have instances in <Col N="585" /> Donegal where publicans have 23-hour licences.  In at least two towns we have around the clock licences except for one hour.  Killybegs is one place in point.</P>
    <P>Since the licences were granted there has been no evidence over the last three years that there have been any abuses.  In fact, you would find much more evidence of abuses in other towns where extensions do not exist, which might somewhat go to prove Deputy Dillon's point that around the clock opening would not lead to abuses, but I do not know what publican would like to undertake business on that basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon gave us&mdash;and many publicans would have liked to listen to him&mdash;almost a demonstration of how to clear a pub at closing time. It is one of the most difficult tasks there is, to get customers out without insulting them, and making sure that they will come back the next day. Various methods have been adopted and some publicans are reputed to take the bar off the door and run berserk through the public house.  I have heard of many methods but never one like that expounded by Deputy Dillon, to leave the door open, switch off the lights&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Any publican will tell you what would happen.  The period when it is most difficult for the public house is when there is something on and there is a crowd in the town.  It may be the night of a show, a fair, a dance or a sports meeting. You may have the door open one minute after time on those nights and the crowd come in off the streets. What would actually happen is that you would have more customers than you desire.  I am afraid it would not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best means of ensuring that <Col N="586" /> customers will leave at the right time is to have the fine increased and the law enforced.  At the present time, in any public house in the Six Counties, there is no difficulty in having a customer removed when the time comes because the minimum penalty is £50.  You would not dream of spending half a minute over the time, nor would you have a hope of getting into a public house one second after closing time.  I can say from my experience of passing through those towns that it has worked very successfully in that respect.  Everybody is satisfied that there is plenty of time the next day if they want a drink and if they feel nobody else is getting into any other place.  The result is that they have accepted the closing time as closing time.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the coastal towns where there are tourists.  We might as well face up to the facts, as far as the tourists are concerned.  People may talk about attractions and amusements but 90 per cent. of the tourists have a sing-song in the public house at 11 o'clock at night.  The time of 11.30 p.m. as far as the tourists are concerned is much too short.  They would really need 12 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all seem to be in favour of uniformity.  I am not going to press that point.  I would defend the proposals in the Bill because they are adaptable to what is being practised particularly in the coastal towns where the tourist business, either in a big or small way, makes it necessary to have some attraction because in the summer time 11.30 is only twilight.  Those people who are against 11.30 p.m. in rural Ireland should reconsider what <Col N="587" /> the position is at present.  If they have not any practical experience as customers or traders, they should make themselves familiar with the position in rural Ireland at the moment. They will find that no extension is being proposed at all.  It is a curtailment of the existing hours and a very considerable curtailment too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the House has accepted the idea of uniformity or the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> provision, amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 6, if we accept the abolition of that provision, are conflicting.  In the first amendment, Deputy Cosgrave seeks to establish that only in areas outside the county boroughs will the hours of 11 p.m. and 11.30 p.m. be applied and in amendment No. 6, he seeks to suggest that the hour of 10.30 should be applied to county boroughs.  Immediately we recreate the bona fide system.  If you have a differential of one hour between the county boroughs and the rural areas as such you will have a reemergence of this menace which took up so much of the time of the Commission, namely, the dangerous driving and all the evils that follow from the pursuit of drinking under the <i>bona fide</i> system.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I cannot understand where we will get with a free vote.  If Deputy Dillon, as Leader of the Fine Gael Party, wants uniformity and believes in uniformity and believes that 11 p.m. all round is the reasonable hour, how can we reconcile that viewpoint with the suggestion in this amendment that there is no objection to 11.30 p.m. for the rural areas but, as in amendment No. 6, that 10.30 is sufficient for a city area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Commission which sat and discussed all these problems, and I hope I am not being unfair to Deputy Cosgrave when I say that he sought to suggest that the Commission were divided on the problem of more liberal hours. Let me say that the Pioneers, the Garda Síochána and all those elements were in favour of the majority of the provisions in this Bill.  The opposition in the Commission to the <Col N="588" /> hours suggested here came to a great extent from the County Dublin publicans and the County Dublin publicans alone.  Since that, they have organised a certain amount of opposition among the trade unions.  We have the position that the Pioneer representatives on that Commission have signed their names to the Majority Report.  In other words, the Pioneer representatives&mdash;two very intelligent and able men&mdash;have recommended to this House that the hours of opening should be 11.30 p.m. for the four months of summer and 11 p.m. for the other eight months and that the <i>bona fide</i> trade should be abolished.  That is the recommendation of the Pioneers on moral grounds, but the County Dublin publicans, also on moral grounds, insist that there should be a closing time in Dublin city of 10.30 and at 12 o'clock, if possible, in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>We have all heard of the devil quoting Scripture but when I find the Dublin County publicans arguing on moral grounds I think that is a danger signal for all concerned.  I am prepared to listen with greater sympathy to the representations of the Pioneers than I am when approached by representatives of the publicans in County Dublin.  As far as they are concerned, it is not a matter of morals but of £ s. d. and if they had the sincerity and honesty to base their case on that, I would have a lot more sympathy for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon wishes uniformity but he cannot see any demand for the extension of the opening hours in rural Ireland.  Let us state the position clearly as it is at the moment. The closing hours in rural Ireland are 12 o'clock the whole year round, provided an individual is prepared to travel three miles to get a drink after 10.30 p.m.  If passed, this new measure will restrict the opening hours in rural Ireland by one hour per day for eight months of the year. That is to say, instead of 12 o'clock there will be no drinking after 11 o'clock for eight months, and for the other four months the restriction will be half an hour per day making the closing hour 11.30 p.m. for June, <Col N="589" /> July, August and September.  I cannot understand why I am pestered daily by representations from all over the country from Pioneer centres which have the impression that we are giving more time for drinking when, in actual fact, we are curtailing it and when the representatives appointed by the Pioneers themselves are in favour of the hours suggested in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of uniformity and, whatever this House decides, I hope that we shall have agreement in the long run on that.  However, I do suggest that, if uniformity means that we are to restrict the hours further than the measure suggests, such legislation will not be respected by the community.  As Deputy Dillon has pointed out, and quite rightly so, there is an element in the country who will get more pleasure out of a drink at 12 o'clock at night rather than at 10.30 p.m., just because it is illegal, and therefore Deputy Dillon believes things may not be too good if we do not leave the hours alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon on the question of uniformity but Deputy Dillon knows as well as I do that people keep late hours in rural Ireland.  He also knows that if he goes along any night in rural Ireland, from 11 o'clock until 12 o'clock, and knocks on the doors of five or six public houses he will find very respectable people inside having a drink.  Some of them may have travelled three miles in order to have a drink and they are within the law, even though it may be suggested that when that legislation was passed it was not for the purpose of enabling people to go three miles just to get a drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> The law in this regard has been tested.  Men have been taken into Court and they have stated to the Gardaí that they lived more than three miles from the premises concerned.  In some instances the Gardaí have actually used measuring chains to measure the distance between certain persons' homes and a particular public house, but the argument never arose as to whether one of these men travelled to the public house for the purpose of getting a drink or whether he was on a journey and wanted refreshment.</P>
    <P>We must face up to the position as we find it at the moment.  In the summer months the farming community want to have a drink when they are finished their work.  After working in the bog or finishing the harvest it is usually rather late before they get to their local licensed premises.  Surely they are entitled to a break in order to clean themselves and get ready to go?  Very often it is 10 o'clock when they finish work and it may be 10.30 p.m. before they are ready to have a very welcome drop of refreshment.  It is a build-up for them in the hard work they have to do and there is no doubt that a pint to a farmer or to a worker is absolutely essential to help him to carry out his hard labours during the spring, summer and harvest months.  Consequently, that man will have a drink one way or the other, and if he is to have it illegally we in this House are wasting our time.</P>
    <P>As the Garda Síochána representative suggested, we should have legislation that is respected.  The Commissioner of the Garda gave evidence to the Liquor Commission.  I do not want to bore the House with it in detail but I should like to quote a short extract and to state that, when he gave this evidence, the Superintendents and all the higher officers in the Garda Síochána unanimously backed it from their long experience.  He stated: &ldquo;It is well known that it is impossible to secure observance of any law, unless the majority of the citizens are anxious to see it enforced.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Page 5 of the <Col N="591" /> Report of the Commission.  There has been a big build-up of criticism by trade union representatives in this city against any increase in the opening hours here.  There has also been a campaign conducted by a number of publicans in the city and in County Dublin against any change in the opening hours but in the last few months I see that a certain amount of fusion has taken place amongst the publicans themselves.  The County Dublin publicans have been touring Ireland for the last month trying to convince the country publicans that they have the welfare of the rural publicans at heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the pubs on the fringe of the city limits which cater for the bona fide traffic at the moment.  I am talking about the publicans who are really rural publicans and who are in the towns of rural Ireland, apart from the countryside.  These publicans are in favour of uniformity of hours, but the publicans on the fringe of this city are not.  They are in favour of later hours outside the city and in favour of closing the city pubs at 10.30.  We know that the real purpose of that is to have an exodus of people from the city centre at 10.30 p.m. out to these fringe houses until midnight. The evidence is overwhelming that that exodus should be brought to an end as soon as possible in the interests of the people as a whole.  We hear a lot of talk and genuine criticism of our driving laws and the laxity with regard to penalties for careless driving. The evidence is there that the <i>bona fide</i> trade has been the cause of many serious accidents.  If we can help to eliminate danger to life and limb by getting rid of this traffic to the public houses on the fringe of the city, it would be a good day's work.  The best way of doing it is by being fair all round and extending the hours within the city to bring them up to the same level as those of the fringe public houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> I should like the Minister to appreciate this.  He may find a great deal of pressure being brought to bear on him here in the city.  My remarks are not directed towards the Fine Gael Party, but I know that a number of associations are pressing for what they describe as a free vote on this. These associations are doing so, not in the interest of good, sound licensing laws but in the interests of their own selfish groups.  They believe that if they get a free vote, they will be in a position to bring pressure to bear on every individual Deputy to do exactly as they want.  I do not give two hoots for any pressure group and never did, and I shall vote exactly as my conscience dictates, though I know my scalp will be taken off by some of these groups.  I believe it would be unfair, particularly because of the pressure in the city area, to have each section left to a free vote.  If it is, we might as well put this Bill back into a pigeon-hole and let the dust of the next ten years rest on it.</P>
    <P>A large section of the publicans in the city area are anxious to have a change in the present hours to the hours suggested in the Bill, that is, 11.30 p.m. in the summer and 11 p.m. in the other eight months.  The trouble is that those publicans are not the vocal group who bring pressure as an organisation, but there are at least as many in favour of the measure as there are against it.  Lest it be thought for a second that I have any interest in one side or the other, as far as the publicans are concerned, I want to emphasise that my interest is in the public.  That is the one thing we cannot lose sight of.  This measure must be made a good measure in the interests of the community.  We must not lose sight of the people who need a drink for convivial or social purposes.  They are the element we are anxious to facilitate.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have great respect for people who are Pioneers.  That is a noble self-sacrifice, but I do not think there is an onus on any individual Pioneer, who sacrifices the social life that one can get with an occasional drink, to persuade me or to hound me or anybody else to do likewise.  In my <Col N="593" /> humble opinion, the whole virtue of being a Pioneer is lost if it is sought in that position to browbeat others into accepting and doing likewise.  The position in the city is that many men and their wives who come into the city centre would like to have a drink or meet their friends for half an hour or so after the pictures or a show.  At present there is no opportunity whatever for them to have such facilities because of the hours in operation.</P>
    <P>There is a great demand amongst those people to have the hours of 11 p.m. in the winter and 11.30 p.m. in the summer.  If that demand is not there, how can we reconcile the fact that there is such an exodus each night to have a few drinks outside the city area?  Would it not be much better to provide the opportunity within the city area of having a few drinks in comfort rather than moving out?  I hope the Minister will bear in mind that his main interest should be the public rather than any vested interest, whether it is publican, Pioneer or anything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not pretend that it was the injustice done to the country people that brought about the introduction of this Bill.  We know the superiority complex there exists here in regard to the rural community. The Bill was brought before the House 12 years too late.  I sympathise both with the Minister and with the Garda who have the enforcing of it now.  Twelve years ago, I endeavoured in this House to get a measure of justice for the rural people as compared with the city people.  I failed.  The people and the Garda decided for themselves.  The Garda said: &ldquo;I am not going to follow my next-door neighbour who walks into the public house after the gent with the motor car and the spats.  I am not going to walk in and fine Mickey So-and-So, a good neighbour of mine, for being there.  He has as much right to be there as the fellow with the spats.&rdquo;  That is the root of the whole trouble here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first main object of the Bill is uniformity of hours in order to put an end to the scandal that existed <Col N="594" /> outside, not alone Dublin city, but Cork city and, I suppose, every other city.  You had that position in which a gentleman could travel out three miles from the city, call into a publichouse and remain there until 12 o'clock at night, while a fellow living next to the publichouse had to travel three miles further on to be entitled to the same privilege.  When you travel three or four miles for the privilege of getting a drink, it is not one drink you will have.</P>
    <P>Therefore I cannot understand Deputy Cosgrave's attitude to this matter.  If we accept his amendment, we are definitely setting up the very same thing again, with the exception that everybody will be entitled to go into the publichouse together from 10.30 to 11.30 p.m. outside the city boundaries.  That is the only difference. At present only the gentleman from the city can go in.  Neither can I understand Deputy Manley and Deputy Dillon in their attitudes to the matter.  I believe that Deputy Manley, like myself, is half a Pioneer but surely he travels around his constituency and surely he meets the boys in the village and they walk into the publichouse.  If he does that, he will find that there is a very happy atmosphere in any rural publichouse from 10.30 till 12 o'clock.</P>

The Garda, very rightly, are not going to make a distinction between their neighbours and the fellow from three miles away.  It would be wrong if they did.  Perhaps somebody is occasionally summoned for a breach of the licensing laws but it is looked on as a joke.</P>

      <Col N="595" /> I have had many letters and received a number of deputations from Pioneer Total Abstinence Associations in the past 12 months and I cannot understand it.  When that Commission was formed, on the motion of Deputy Everett, it was a Commission set up under the inter-Party Government. All Parties were put on to it and for the first couple of meetings, we had to look at one another and try to find out what our different views were.  We had two representatives of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association on that Commission.  We had men like Deputy Boland and others with very different viewpoints.  Can anybody tell me what induced these two representatives, men who had a viewpoint like Deputy Boland, to sign the majority report?</P>
    <P>For the first time in their lives, they were in a position to hear the two sides of the question.  For the first time in their lives, they heard the opinions of the people, the Garda and everybody else.  The result of that evidence is contained in this Bill which is the result of the majority report of the Commission.  I asked the members of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Associations who came to see me if they were repudiating the actions of their representatives who were put on the Commission by the then Minister for Justice and who signed the majority report.</P>

Men of very prejudiced opinions and very definite convictions about the opening hours signed the <Col N="596" /> majority report.  They were completely changed in their outlook and in their attitude.  Deputy Cosgrave now wants to get back to the position when you had an hour or an hour and a half between the hours in the rural areas and the hours in the city.</P>

      <P>There is a public house in my district and I can pass it at 9 o'clock on any night and there will be only three or four cars stopped outside it.  They do not start coming along until 10 o'clock, until after the city publichouses close.  If you go there at a quarter to twelve, you cannot park a car within a quarter of a mile of it.  That is the fact and if any Deputy doubts it, I invite him down to have a look.</P>
      <P>It was not for the city fellow I was making that distinction.  I was making it for the fellow outside who had a pretty heavy sum of money stuck in a publichouse outside the city.  I thought that such a man should get some return for his money and I was anxious to give it to him.  I have a sympathetic kind of mind at times.  It is all right for Deputies to talk.  They have plenty of time.  They do not work after 3, 4 or 5 o'clock.  They are in an entirely different position from the rural farmer who knows the hours he works and the times at which he stops working. We all know that during the winter months farmers and their helpers work until 9 or 10 o'clock at night.  That is what they are paid for. I do not care what Deputy Larkin or any other city representative may say. City people are in an entirely different position from those men in the rural areas who work until 9 or 10 o'clock at night and then want a drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, taking it up and down, in the general run, the rural public house is the clubhouse of the country man. It is not so much for drink that he goes <Col N="597" /> to the public house.  I have gone into a rural public house at night where there were 15 or 20 lads.  Five of them were drinking stout and the rest were drinking lemonade.  They really went there for a social chat and they are as much entitled to use the public house as a club house as others are entitled to use the Royal Yacht Club or other clubs in Dublin City.  That is the difference.  They are entitled to whatever relaxation they can get because they have to work late hours.  I have often seen men who were tired after a heavy day's work, having finished off their jobs in the farmyard and it was 8, 9 or 10 o'clock before they were able to go out for a couple of hours' relaxation.</P>
    <P>As has already been said, we are not extending hours.  We are curtailing them and we are curtailing them for every public house in the country without exception.  I challenge any Deputy listening to me to travel through his constituency tonight and to come back here and say that in five out of six public houses between the hours of 11.30 and 12, there were not any people drinking.  We all know that.  The publican has to be there to open for a traveller&mdash;for the travelling man, as we call him down my way&mdash;who is entitled to go in and have a drink.  That publican will not say: &ldquo;Well, now, you live 2¾ miles from here; I will not let you in.&rdquo;  He cannot do that.  We are getting rid of that type of thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave speaks for the publicans of Dublin city but they have a remedy.  The trade unions and the publicans themselves do not want to open after 10.30 p.m. but nobody will try to make them.  They can all say: &ldquo;We close at 10.30 p.m.&rdquo;  There would be no trouble in that way at all.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan travels around his own constituency. Perhaps he would tell us how many publicans in North Cork close at 10.30 p.m.?  Perhaps he would tell us, in the town of Bandon in his new constituency, how many public houses <Col N="598" /> close down firmly at 10.30 p.m.?  I should like to hear him.  Thank God, they do not close down in East Cork.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am sorry we have differences here about hours or anything else.  I have sympathy with the Minister and the Garda authorities who will be responsible for the enforcement of the hours now, after 12 years of complete ignoring of the liquor laws because they were unjust. The people did not want them; the Garda did not want them: nobody wanted them.  Members of this House were given opportunities to get rid of them but they did not do so.  Now they have created a tough job for those whose responsibility it will be to see that justice is done.  Now that justice is being done, I believe the new laws will be respected.  If they are not, and if there are any breaches of the laws, I can guarantee that there will be no sympathy for them in Cork.</P>

      <P>May I briefly intervene lest there might be any suggestion of misrepresentation or misunderstanding in respect of the actions of the representatives of the Pioneer Association?  In the course of their observations, on page 27 of the Report of the Commission, they made this statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>However, as the alternative to a general closing hour of 11.30 p.m. was to allow different closing hours in city and country, and so to open the door to abuses attached to <i>bona fide</i> trading, we have agreed to this recommendation so as to secure a uniform closing hour in all areas. We would prefer a general closing hour in all areas at 11 p.m.</P>
      <P>Further, in regard to Sunday opening, they say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>We are not happy in agreeing to the hours, 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., recommended in the Report.  The alternative, however, was to allow different hours of opening in different areas, which would, in our opinion, lead to greater disadvantages than are contained in a uniform opening period of 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.  For this reason, we subscribe to the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the House that we are discussing, not merely amendment No. 1 but, on the suggestion offered by the Chair, amendments from 1 to 7, inclusive, 1a on the Order Paper, and the two others attached to Section 5.  I mention that because the whole of the discussion has turned on the first amendment that Deputy Cosgrave proposed.  Of course, with his amendment No. 1 we must also read his amendment No. 6, in which he desires to retain for the county boroughs the present hours if we accept the other hours for the places which are not the county boroughs.</P>
      <P>It is noticeable that the last speaker considered that there was convincing evidence for that retention of the present hours in the county boroughs.  I refer to pages 34 and 35 of the Report which is part of the Minority Report to which Deputy Corry's name is attached.  They say, after expressing regret that after the arduous task that the Commission set itself, a substantial number of the Commission find themselves in disagreement on the question of extending hours in the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford:</P>
      <P>The Provisional United Trade Union Movement, representing 300,000 workers, submitted a memorandum in favour of 10 p.m. closing.  After hearing the evidence of employers, workers, temperance organisations and consumers we&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is, including Deputy Corry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;reached the conclusion that there was no general demand for <Col N="600" /> longer hours in the county boroughs, although we are prepared to recommend the removal of the present distinction between Summer and Winter and to suggest 10.30 p.m. closing all the year round.</P>
    <P>That is a very valuable phrase, referring to the 300,000 workers and also that after the evidence of employers, workers, temperance organisations and consumers had been considered the Deputy, with a lot of others, was in favour of not extending the present closing hours in the county boroughs.  There are amendments amongst the lot we are discussing which ask for the retention of the present hours.  Amendments No. 2 and No. 4, if taken together, would keep the present hours for the whole country.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of sham, of course, in this debate already. We have been referred by the Minister, in a strong, vigorous way, to what the Commission had reported.  I do not know if it will be contradicted but I am informed that the Commission one week reported in favour of keeping the present hours and within seven days reported as they have reported; that the Commission by a majority at one point, when they came to voting at the end, were in favour of the retention of the present hours and then changed within eight days and brought in the recommendation we have here.</P>
    <P>I read page 11 with a certain amount of amusement when I feel, as I believe I am correctly informed, that the Commission were on a razor edge with regard to what the recommendation would be with regard to the general trading hours.  I am speaking, of course, of the weekday.  I look at page 11 of the Report.  They say:</P>
    <P>As to the closing hours, it was argued by licensed trade representatives and the trade employees' representatives that the present hours in Dublin were adequate; but this argument was more than countered...</P>
    <P>What is the evidence that countered that?</P>
    <P>&mdash;by the evidence of the exodus to the <i>bona-fide</i> houses after closing <Col N="601" /> time, the admission that there was an amount of hurried drinking in the last half-hour and that there were difficulties in clearing the public-houses when closing time came.</P>
    <P>Then they propose 11.30.  There will be the same amount of hurried drinking just prior to 11.30 and it will still be very difficult to get the public-houses closed even when the closing hours are extended to 11.30.</P>
    <P>When I hear these general comments with regard to the exodus to the <i>bona fide</i> areas, I ask myself what evidence was there as to the number of people who join in that exodus to the <i>bona fide</i> areas, I should like also to get some discrimination.  There are those who simply, as Deputy Dillon has said, will go further the longer the hours are permitted; there are some people, as is well known, who do not enjoy a drink unless taken with some taint of illegality about it and there are certainly a number of people who do not enjoy a drink unless taken well into the late hours of the night.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that that argument is seriously put forward in opposition to the evidence that was definitely overwhelming as far as the trade representatives and the trade employees' representatives were concerned that they do not want any extension of the present drinking hours.  I am told to weigh in the balance the recommendation of a Commission who voted one week for retention of the present hours and the next week voted for the hours in this part of the Report.</P>
    <P>The document goes on to say:</P>
    <P>We had convincing evidence from all over the country that the present hours fail to meet actual needs in rural areas.</P>
    <P>They have said earlier, in connection with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, that they think that there is no case for the retention of the <i>bona fide</i> provisions; that they no longer serve the purpose for which they were intended. They say that they are satisfied that it is preferable to increase general hours rather than to retain a system which makes law enforcement difficult, tends <Col N="602" /> to encourage excessive drinking, is responsible for disorder and increases the dangers of the roads.  Am I to read these points together and to say that there is what they mean by &ldquo;convincing evidence that the present hours fail to meet actual needs in rural areas&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The one thing the Commission do not say is anything with regard to the curtailment of hours.  They do not make the case that the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Brennan, and some others have made here today that, in fact, the reality of the situation is that by allowing public-houses to remain open only to 11.30 in the rural areas that is cutting down drinking facilities by half an hour.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered, of course, that before the Act of 1943 drinking had gone on the whole night and it was supposed to be a very severe curtailment of drinking facilities as far as the <i>bona fide</i> traffic was concerned that <i>bona fide</i> drinking was allowed only from 6 in the morning until midnight. I did not on that occasion hear much comment about the cutting down of the rights, so to speak, to drink right through the morning, noon and night.  We are told that that curtailment has not brought about respect for the law and the great argument in this House at the moment is that by abolishing <i>bona fide</i> traffic and having extended hours to 11.30 we are to get such public appreciation of the new situation that it will be easy to enforce the law and that the law will be enforced.</P>
    <P>Very solemn comments made by the Commissioner and the Chief Superintendent, quoted on pages 5 and 6 of this Report, ought to be borne in mind.  I do not propose to read the whole of them but they have said that it is impossible to secure observance of any law, unless the majority of the citizens are anxious to see it enforced.  They have said:</P>
    <P>It is very doubtful whether this can be said of the Licensing Acts.</P>
    <P>They say that no social obloquy is attached to being found in a public-house after hours and nobody feels any stain on his character if so discovered. <Col N="603" /> They then say that penalties are often quite inadequate, that is, the penalties imposed by the court, as a deterrent, and that public representatives have frequently not alone advocated amendment of the law but suggested that enforcement of the law should be relaxed.  They continue that this is unsatisfactory from the angle of the Garda:</P>
    <P>Evasion of the Licensing Acts by people from all walks of life, inadequate penalties for offences and statements by public representatives tend to bring the Licensing Acts into contempt.</P>
    <P>They add:</P>
    <P>And contempt for one law may breed general contempt for the law.</P>
    <P>On page 6 they continue:</P>
    <P>As the public generally do not seem anxious to see the Licensing Acts strictly enforced, the Garda Síochána in most places are expected to exercise what is called &lsquo;discretion&rsquo; in enforcing the law.</P>
    <P>They say that that means that the local sergeant is expected to &lsquo;legislate&rsquo; for local exemptions to suit the needs of the area and they contend, as one would agree, that it is most unfair to have people in the position of sergeants and Guards, subordinate officials, left to determine the degree to which the Licensing Acts should be enforced, that it is bad for the morale of the force that they should be discouraged from securing observance of the law.</P>
    <P>Finally, they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;expecting sergeants and Guards, who are on a low salary scale, to exercise &lsquo;discretion&rsquo; in the enforcement of a law which affects the profits of thousands of licence holders means exposing those men to the temptation of corruption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All that is going to be changed now by curtailing drinking hours, according to the argument put up, from midnight to half-past eleven, by cutting down facilities for drinking, not allowing drinking after a certain hour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> By doing this, we are told there will be no more temptation and no discretion will have to be left to the local sergeant.  For the future, everybody will approve of the licensing laws and, I suppose, people of all walks of life will regard it as something bringing social obloquy on them if they are found in a public house&mdash;where they used go up to midnight&mdash;at 25 minutes to twelve; they will realise they are bringing disgrace on themselves and on their families.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that the whole law will be raised from the contempt into which it has fallen.  This is certainly asking for a mental revolution in the outlook of the people.  I do not believe that will happen or that there will be rigid enforcement of the new law.  I do not believe the people will be so easily brought from their present mistaken view&mdash;I did not realise it was so widespread until I heard the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Brennan, speaking&mdash;unless there is some extraordinary change of attitude. I do not think that will be brought about, and until that comes about, you will have the same situation reproduced over and over again.</P>
    <P>The Minister has talked about fines and endorsements.  I may have mistaken the amendments that are down, but I see no amendments except those that are in some degree relaxing the matter of endorsements.  If I am wrong I should like to be corrected.  I think there is nothing in this legislation to make the endorsement, fine or penalty any more adequate to the crime than before.  I see only one thing &mdash;that there is a minimum fine of £1 and that is the whole foundation for the new code of law.  We are to have a minimum fine of £1 on people found on licensed premises after hours.  But will they be found on licensed premises after hours?  Will the local sergeant do as he has done up to now and use his discretion or is he, in the future, to abandon that discretion and prosecute everybody found on the premises at 11.30 p.m.  I doubt it very much.  I should like to know what Deputies from rural Ireland think about that.  But that is the new proposal&mdash;that there is to be this change <Col N="605" /> and that this <i>bona fide</i> traffic will be abolished.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that it would not have been better to approach this <i>bona fide</i> business from a different angle and put, say, a longer distance limit on the legal <i>bona fide</i> trade, and if necessary, even curtail the hours a bit more, and have them, say, to midnight or some other period.  To 6 a.m. is of course of no great significance, no great matter to those who are engaged in drinking in this way.  That might be a better way to meet the position in drinking in this way.  That might be a better way to meet the position than by abolishing <i>bona fide</i> drinking, and to have in the rural areas curtailment of drinking hours.  But that is the argument being used&mdash;the main argument produced in this House.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am in favour of amendments 2 and 4 which would keep the present hours.  I have seen as far as my post is concerned&mdash;and it is not confined to temperance advocates but includes citizens in the ordinary walks of life&mdash;that the people who are not attached to temperance societies in any way or to any groups that would urge matters from a different point of view, ask the question to which I have not yet seen any real answer: who asks for this change in legislaion?  Certainly, so far as Dublin city and county borough are concerned, nobody wants it.  There is a very big volume of opinion against it in the trade itself, the employees and the people who are not connected in any way with licensing matters.  I think it cannot be denied that the great force of opinion expressed in literature and newspapers has been against this idea of extending the hours to 11.30 p.m.  Personally, I am in favour of the present hours.  I see no reason for the extension.</P>
    <P>One other matter I might mention as a small point.  I think it is closing hours that one must attend to in this debate but opening hours must also be attended to.  Certainly, any provision which has a period&mdash;I am all the time omitting the split hour&mdash; longer than 12 hours will, I understand, cause certain trouble in the labour world.  It would either mean that employees would have to be taken on, which is not likely, or it will mean <Col N="606" /> attempts to enforce longer hours.  The Commission say that there is only a limited trade before noon and that the 10.30 a.m. opening would suffice to meet reasonable requirements.  So far as I am concerned I think whatever is the closing hour, I would measure back 12 hours from that, and that is how I would deal with the opening hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult in the face of the multiplicity of views on the question of hours to get a clear picture of what the different Parties are thinking on this issue.  Views range from those of Deputies like Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy McGilligan, who has just said we should retain the present hours, to those of Deputy Dillon who feels that the all-round hour should be 11 o'clock.  I am sure that there are more people in the Fine Gael Party who agree with the recommendations of the Commission as expressed in this Bill.  I am sure that the same applies to the Labour Party and this brings me to the wisdom or otherwise of what has been said on the issue of a free vote.  It would be much more helpful if we had an official Fine Gael view on this matter representing a majority of their members and also an official Labour view. There are many Deputies in the House who remember previous licensing legislation many years ago when there was a certain amount of what is called free voting on that occasion.  You could not get round the corridors of the House without being almost pulled asunder by different pressure groups from trade unions to representatives of the licensed trade, members of the G.A.A., who alleged the hours would not suit some of their men who worked in Dublin public houses.  The result was that in my view, instead of getting a Bill that would be enforceable and would, as some people have suggested, have got public respect, we ended up with monstrosities so far as hours are concerned, and a law that obviously did not have the support, in the main, of any section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this Commission have worked on this job and have come to <Col N="607" /> the conclusions they reached after hearing evidence from the different sides, I think we should be slow to supersede them here unless there is some very obvious reason that we in our wisdom can see.  They have suggested this to try to get a mean or a balance between rural Ireland and the cities.  Without making a fetish of it, there is a lot to be said for uniformity, and I think that is the general view. The pressure to have a change in the law started as a result of the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  The absurdity of the law as it stood precluded its proper enforcement. I do not think anybody in conscience could subscribe to the anachronism represented by this business.</P>
    <P>There is the extraordinary position that any man with a car can go three miles and get a drink while his neighbour who has not a car or even a bicycle would be breaking the law if he went into his local public house. It brings to mind the old comment: &ldquo;The law is a hass.&rdquo;  If the law was a &ldquo;hass&rdquo; the asininity of it was best expressed by our peculiar licensing laws.  There were all the little anxieties, that if a man travelled a journey of 150 miles to his home town and went into the local hotel or public house to have a drink, he was all right, but if he called at his own house after driving that journey, his journey was at an end and he would be breaking the law if he went out and had a drink. All these things tended to bring the licensing laws into disrepute and tended to alienate public sympathy towards their enforcement.</P>
    <P>It has been said there has not been a demand from the public for this legislation.  I do not want to go over this Report again or the evidence given before the Commission. Evidence was given on page 7 by Chief Superintendent Quinn, Garda Division of County Dublin and County Wicklow, of the large extent of the <i>bona fide</i> trade done in his division and of the influx of visitors after city closing hours, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.  The Garda Síochána say there are a tremendous number of people going out, after the <Col N="608" /> official closing hours, to the different suburbs.  The fact that that is happening is surely clear evidence that there is a demand for later facilities by a large number of people in the city.  It is a question of trying to arrive at an hour that will be reasonable. With all our experience of licensing laws and the different amendments to licensing laws since the 1927 Act, we should aim at a measure that will be, if not generally acceptable, at least largely acceptable and generally enforceable.</P>
    <P>On the question of enforcement, I should refer to something said by Deputy McGilligan.  There is a vast difference in regard to enforcement between the provisions of this Bill and the law as it was.  It was discretionary whether a justice would endorse a licence or not.  The result was that no endorsements were imposed by the district justices.  I think the records of the Department of Justice show that over the past year or two there were only three endorsements in the whole country.  It was purely a discretionary matter and the justices evidently, in view of the seriousness of an endorsement, baulked at the idea of imposing that penalty and substituted a fine.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation and under an amendment to Section 30 tabled in the name of the Minister, it is now provided that endorsements will be compulsory except for a first offence.  The risk of getting an endorsement will have a very salutary effect on the publican.  More effective power is being provided to enforce whatever hours the House, in its wisdom, may fix.</P>
    <P>My own personal view is that the best way of ensuring that there will not be abuses and that there will be enforcement is to devise hours that will, in the main, have the backing of the public for the reason of their suitability.  In thinking of suitability and at the same time trying to preserve uniformity, we have to try to hit on something that will be acceptable both to the city and the country.  This is purely my own view but I would be largely inclined to discount altogether <Col N="609" /> the people in the business or even to discount the unions concerned in the business.  There are certain businesses, such as the catering business, which entail long hours.  Some of us might not like it; I should not like to be in the catering business but long hours are part of the business.  The House should approach this question from the point of view, first, of the public and, secondly, of getting hours that will be largely acceptable to the public and thus having the force of public opinion behind them.  If I could see a convincing argument for closing at 11 p.m. as against 11.30 p.m.  I would be open to persuasion.  However, taking one thing with another, the nearest one can get to uniformity for the whole country is the hour of 11.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>My personal view would be something similar to that expressed by Deputy Dillon.  I would have no licensing at all up to midnight and let the trade regulate the matter between themselves.  That is what happens elsewhere, and it works.  People here are not living in glass-houses.  They can go to the United States and elsewhere and if they want to drink around the clock they can do so.  Some places are open; some are closed.  I saw an article in a newspaper during the past few days to the effect that if one set about the business properly one could drink for the twenty-four hours of the clock in the City of London by taking advantage of the various special opening hours for different markets, and so on.  I think that if you did not have restrictions, as far as hours are concerned, until midnight the business would find its own level and the trade would regulate itself.  Some houses would close earlier, some later.</P>
    <P>I should like to relate to the House an experience I had in connection with An Tóstal.  When I applied I got opening hours until 12 midnight for a town in the west of Ireland, my own town, for the whole period of An Tóstal.  It was one of the few places if not the only place where this did occur.  It is a town with a population between 6,000 and 7,000.  I was assured that when that period was over the town was never quieter.  I was assured by a <Col N="610" /> very experienced Superintendent of the Garda Síochána that they had no trouble.  I was also assured by many of the publicans that they sold less drink than they normally sold, that the regular customers came in for their drinks possibly later than usual and were leisurely in consuming them.</P>
    <P>The only complaints I received after all this long period of late opening until midnight were from one or two of what we would call after-hour houses in the town which never opened up until the others closed, to the effect that their business had virtually disappeared because the clientele that would normally frequent them had time to have sufficient drinks in the ordinary pubs.  That was an experience I had and that has made a tremendous impression on my mind ever since in connection with all this question of the licensing laws.  It is true, as Deputy McGilligan and others say, that there is some restriction in this proposal because in actual fact the <i>bona fide</i> trade went on to 12 o'clock.  Anyone familiar with rural Ireland knows that it is not alone the <i>bona fide</i> trade that went on to that hour; it has been the hour generally.</P>
    <P>Taking rural Ireland, with which I am familiar, particularly in summer, and taking into consideration the fact that you will try to get something that will be suitable both for the farmers and the people at these small seaside resorts, I think what the House should aim at is to hit on an hour that will be acceptable to most of the people concerned throughout the country.  In the arguments and speeches I have heard here, I have not heard anything so far that indicates to me that we can get anything better than that suggested by the Commission and embodied in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputy Manley and to some other Deputies who spoke on the Second Stage and on this Stage about the danger of increased hours leading to increased drinking that I have been listening to this argument in a different form in the courts for many years.  One of the standing objections, particularly by organisations such as the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association or by clergymen <Col N="611" /> opposing, for instance, a new licence is that there are already sufficient drinking facilities in the district and that an extra licence there would lead to more drinking.  I just cannot see that and I have never been able to understand that argument.</P>
    <P>In 90 per cent. of the cases, there is an economic limit to all this business. Whether the pubs close at 10.30 or 12 o'clock, the people who drink in the pubs can and will drink only in so far as they can afford to do so and their drinking is limited by the economic factor.  Whether the public houses close at 10.30 or at 11.30 p.m., it does not change the economic factor that Pat Browne who has 30s. to spend has only 30s. to spend and if he has that amount to spend on drink, that is all he can spend on it, no matter how long the pubs remain open or when they close.  The drinking habits of our people must in the vast majority of cases be controlled by that economic factor and that will operate irrespective of what hours we hit on in this Bill or in this House.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Cosgrave is in error in suggesting that the publicans association are opposed to an extension of the present city hours.  I understand that, while they may have given that impression, in the first instance, they now seem to be in favour, and have so indicated publicly, of an extension to 11 p.m.  Therefore, taking what the trade have to say now in this matter here in Dublin, they are in favour of an extension to 11 p.m.  The proposal in this Bill is 11.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>If we are to finish for all time the absurdities of the <i>bona fide</i> law, we must have unanimity.  We must have the same hours outside Dublin and the county boroughs as operate in the city. To go ahead with the Commission on the question of unanimity, we must have an hour that will suit the country as well.  I think the House could ponder on this for a long time and yet be unable to improve on the suggestions of this Commission who went into this matter very thoroughly.  I do not see any improvement in the amendments tabled in the names of different Deputies.  Everybody seems to have his own ideas as to what the licensing <Col N="612" /> hours should be and as to how long the pubs should remain open but, taking one thing with another, we would be well advised to accept the compromise hour, if you like, which was arrived at by the Commission, 11.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the motives of the different people who signed the majority report.  I do not want to dwell on whether they signed it in order to get unanimity among themselves or because it was more acceptable than some views they might have but which they felt they might not possibly get through.  Whatever the reason, they signed the majority report.  There is little purpose now in trying to analyse why they did so.  There is a majority report.  The argument is open on anything, even on elections, that one should study the number who voted against the proposal.  The fact remains that the majority rule is there.  To take this report in the main, I think we must accept the majority as representing the considered view of all the cross-section of people who made up this Commission.</P>
    <P>As a Commission, I think they did a good and helpful job.  Their Report is very helpful to the members of this House.  From my knowledge of rural Ireland, I should like not alone to have a law which would have the public behind it and which would be enforceable but to have a law which would suit the normal requirements of the majority of our people.  I am convinced that if we do not have that, we are wasting our time in bringing in any legislation here and that we shall have a repetition of the performance which we know to exist throughout the length and breadth of this land&mdash;and anybody who does not admit that is completely out of touch with what is happening throughout rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>If there is a strong view as between 11 and 11.30 p.m., I personally would like to consider it but I am convinced from what I have heard here that the best chance of getting hours under this section that will be acceptable to the greatest number of people is to take the decision of this Commission and stick to 11.30 p.m. in summer and 11 p.m. in winter.</P>

      <P>On this matter of the proposed extension of hours, there appears to have crept into the discussion this morning something which, to my mind, is not factual something which has no basis in fact, so far as the law is concerned.  We have heard Deputy Corry talk about proposals in this Bill which mean a curtailment of the hours in rural areas.  As I understand the position under the existing laws, which apply both to the urban and the rural areas, it is that the hours for the general sale of drink on licensed premises, including hotels and restaurants, are from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. during summer time, and 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. during the rest of the year, save for a period of one hour, from 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m., each day in the county boroughs.  So, in fact, the general law, at present, permits the sale of liquor up to 10 p.m. and 10.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>However, contributors to this debate this morning have argued on the general basis of a situation arising from an admitted flouting of another part of the existing law by practically everyone in the country.  It has been of interest to hear, both this morning and on the Second Stage debate, the completely cynical approach of those who spoke on the question of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  The Minister assures us that if this House agrees to provide extra official hours for drinking, both in the city and in the country, he is convinced there would be increased respect for, and recognition of, the law in this regard.</P>
      <P>Yet when discussing this matter, Deputy after Deputy on both sides of the House can say that the existing law in relation to the <i>bona fide</i> trade is not being recognised and that there has been no genuine attempt made to enforce it.  The Bill, aside from that particular aspect&mdash;and I want first of all to address myself to that problem &mdash;is a proposal to extend drinking hours.  Let there be no doubt about it because it very definitely provides for additional drinking hours both in urban and rural areas, an extension of the hours by one hour each week-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the problem of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic and the proposal arising <Col N="614" /> from the report made to the Commission about the general exodus from places where public houses closed at 10 or 10.30, to outlying areas, even if they were very close, where one could continue to drink until 12 o'clock.  We also have had the problem mentioned by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, and other people, of the utter failure to have the law respected and enforced in other areas.  Surely all that could have been dealt with on the basis of doing away with <i>bona fide</i> trading as such?  Then the situation referred to earlier today would no longer apply, under which decisions as to whether an individual licensee should be prosecuted would be left in the hands of a junior police officer.</P>
    <P>The situation also as to whether a police officer entering a <i>bona fide</i> establishment and finding there people who, he was satisfied, were not entitled to be there should prosecute &mdash;the matter to some extent being left in his own hands&mdash;would not apply because the law would be uniform. The hours for the closing of the public houses and the general sale of drink would apply generally.  In those circumstances it would be the clear duty of the officer to prosecute in any cases where a breach of the law was committed, irrespective, I should trust, of whether the person being prosecuted was a farm labourer, the owner of a small farm, a business man, or a person from this House or its sister Chamber.  If people were treated equally under the law we might start to reach a situation in which there was some respect for the law.  It is quite clear from the statements made here that for many years, as far as law enforcement and respect for the laws passed by this House are concerned, possibly the greatest offenders have been the very people elected to legislate in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>Consequently how could the ordinary man on the street, the farmer, the farm labourer, or anyone else, have any respect for this particular section of the law?  However, the Minister for his own reasons decided not to take the line of action which I think would have been the correct one, and that was to have come to this House and say frankly to the Deputies: <Col N="615" />&ldquo;Look, this <i>bona fide</i> law is a joke and you yourselves, and other people in this country, are making it a joke and I propose to take it off the Statute Book and rely on the general licensing laws&rdquo;.  He has not done that.  He has come here and has proposed a Bill which has as its main purpose the extension of the drinking hours.</P>
    <P>I should like to know where this great demand for extra drinking hours comes from and who will be affected by these iniquitous proposals?  The difficulty in dealing with this question of drinking hours is that it is not just a problem of the person who goes home after taking one or two drinks quite satisfied that he has had his relaxation, or the person who having taken a couple of drinks has to go on drinking because he has no will power to do anything about it, or the person who is in company and feels it incumbent to remain as long as his associates do.  There are many other people affected in our community by this proposal.</P>

    <Title>Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1960&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>When concluding last night, I reminded the House that, over the years, the reply of the Minister for Defence to any question as to why a person was refused or granted a military service pension was that he could not do anything about it, that the decision of the referee was final and binding.  That position has always remained.  We get this unique and, as I said last night, very dangerous situation in which the Minister, under the cover of making financial provision to pay certain increases, avails of the opportunity to insert Section 2 of this Bill to correct what he says are errors in two cases and that he is to constitute himself a referee calling up two of the previous assessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He says in his statement that Section 2 of the Bill is designed to provide power to correct errors which <Col N="616" /> have been made by the referee in setting out his findings in respect of two applications.  He said that the referee, while intending to make an affirmative report, made a nil report.  I think that the Minister should have given us more information as to how that could happen.  He told us that, in the ordinary course of events, the system would have prevented such errors occurring but he does not tell us how the error did occur.  He does not tell whether it was due to the speedy manner in which the referee dealt with the cases, whether it was through illness or the circumstances in which this happened in these two cases.</P>
    <P>Over the years, several Ministers for Defence were satisfied that the referee made a wrong report.  One of my predecessors, the late Dr. O'Higgins, was satisfied in 1948 that previous referees had made errors in the reports and although the previous Government had suspended all action on the Military Service Pensions Act, he brought in an amendment to the Act enabling all the people, who felt they had been refused a certificate and that they were entitled to one, to apply again.  A new referee and assessors were appointed.</P>
    <P>I do not know who those two people are.  I am not to be taken as opposed in any way to their getting what they are entitled to.  I want that to be clear but they had already been refused before.  They were refused prior to 1948 and, under the amending Act, availed of the opportunity to appeal. The Minister tells us they applied under that Act in 1950.  That means that it took eight years.  In 1958 the referee decided the cases.  He then made a nil report again where the Minister now says he should have made an affirmative report.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the House that the referee in making an award takes up the chart in front of him and he signs for the period Easter week 1916 for which there are six years' service.  He sets out 100 per cent. of that time or one and three quarter time.  If the applicant was out three days and could establish three days' service, he gets three years and he puts down a half.  If he was out one day he puts <Col N="617" /> down a sixth of the period.  He does not write &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  He does not write &ldquo;affirmative&rdquo; or anything else.  If he has no service, he writes the word &ldquo;nil&rdquo;.  He does that for each period down to and including 1923.</P>
    <P>How could the referee sign a nil report where he intended and where the Minister assures us he intended to make an affirmative report?  The Minister has not told us.  It would make my position much easier if he showed how this could happen because what happens now is that the Minister is constituting himself a referee.  He is to call the two former assessors in to sit down with him.  For what? To concur in what he is doing.</P>
    <P>Would it not have been much simpler for the Minister to appoint a new referee if he was satisfied that a very grave injustice was being done in these two cases and let the case be re-examined by the referee and the assessors?  Why does he do it only in two cases?  I am sure that, during the time the Minister is there, he has had several reports from people in whom he has confidence that there were applicants entitled to certificates of service who did not get them.  I am certainly sure that behind him in those benches there are Fianna Fáil Deputies who said they were satisfied beyond &ldquo;yea or nay&rdquo; that A, B and C were entitled to certificates of service and for some reason or another the referee gave a nil report when we think he should have given an affirmative report.  They made the case to the Minister on that and the Minister said that was true but the referee did so and so.  That is final and binding.</P>
    <P>In this case the Minister is now to constitute himself the referee in two cases without telling us why.  I would respectfully suggest that this is an amendment to the Military Service Pensions Act.  When he decided to put forward this amendment, he should then have examined the files; I think he should have honoured the pledge I gave in this house that when the present phase, the last phase of the referee and board of assessors was concluded, a new amendment to the <Col N="618" /> Military Service Pensions Act would be introduced, and that he would now, even at this late stage, define &ldquo;service,&rdquo; what they are entitled to get for each period and everything like that, so that each applicant will know what he has to prove.  Since the military pensions system was adopted in 1924, up to the present day, no old I.R.A. man, be he officer, N.C.O., or other rank, knows what he has to prove.  It has been a case of hit or miss during all that time.</P>
    <P>I myself remember being with the board of assessors under the 1924 Act. I was called in as a witness in Longford Military Barracks when a very prominent officer in the Old I.R.A. came in to prove his case.  The Chairman asked him for his identification and then asked: &ldquo;For the period April 17th to March 31st, 1918, what did you do?&rdquo;  The applicant replied: &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; and replied with the same word for each of the periods 1918, 1919, 1920, up to the period between April 1st, 1921, and 11th July, 1921.  Then the bottom of the form was filled in with the one word &ldquo;Nil.&rdquo; I was looking at all this and I said: &ldquo;Wait a moment&mdash;did I not see you take part in such an attack on such a night,&rdquo; and the applicant replied &ldquo;Of course you did.&rdquo;  Were it not that I was present, that applicant would have left, not knowing about the &ldquo;Nil&rdquo; report at the bottom of the page.  In other words, if an applicant was able to make his case, he was all right, but if not, he was sunk.</P>
    <P>When this amendment was being introduced by the Minister he should have availed of the opportunity&mdash;when he found there were grounds for this decision; when he felt he was justified in bringing in this amendment&mdash;to say: &ldquo;My predecessor promised that when this phase of activity of the board of referees was finished, he would amend the Act.  I now propose to do so and, as a first step in two cases in which I have complete evidence, I shall ask the Dáil for authority.&rdquo;  That is, if he wanted it, and I doubt if he did Only a small amendment would be necessary to extend the date of the operations but now this extraordinary step is taken.  In view of that, I should <Col N="619" /> like the Minister to give the information I seek as to the circumstances in which it came about that the referee made such an error.  What is the evidence that he made such an error? Was it through winding up in a hurry?  Was it through illness or what were the circumstances in which it happened?</P>
    <P>As I say, I feel that a very dangerous precedent is established in this Bill by the Minister taking to himself the power to act as a referee in two cases, because, beyond question, there are hundreds of other cases in which a review should have been made but was not made because the decision of the referee was final and binding.  I do not want to impede this Bill.  I do not want to do anything to embarrass the Minister or the Government in any way, but I feel it is such an extraordinary step that the Minister should tell us the circumstances.  If he does not do that, then I am afraid we shall have to divide on the Bill and have another day's work on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied, as Deputy MacEoin has stated, that there are in each battalion area a few outstanding cases where Cothrom na Féinne, so to speak, was not observed in the opinion of many of those who applied for service pensions.  In many cases, that was due to the fact that those who were most intimate with their activities had died in the struggle, or after it, and those who were left had not the knowledge to give them the support necessary for a favourable award.  However, certain restrictions have been put into operation and, even though a few specific cases are mentioned, I presume it is too big a question to go back on again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the things which Bills like this were intended to do have been done, and awards made, and this is just implementing a Budgetary decision, but, to my mind, the restrictions imposed in the cases referred to by Deputy Gilbride and some other Deputies last night concerning disability pensions for wounds sustained in the struggle, or for disease attributable to service, are not just.  The facts <Col N="620" /> are not altered but a certain dated impediment is put on the awards or benefits that might accrue to a man because he was not married before a particular date.</P>
    <P>I believe that goes very close towards depriving a person of human rights.  If he wants to get married, he may get married but if he does not marry before a certain date, he loses certain benefits.  There are a few cases of people who were married and whose wives died before the specified date.  They then married again after the date set out in the Act and, because of that, they are deprived of the benefits which the Act would have conferred on them if their spouses had not died.  I believe the Minister said he was prepared to look into that matter again and I appeal to him to do so because there are anomalies connected with that aspect of the date restriction which ought to be removed.</P>

      <P>The first section of this Bill is, of course, accepted by everybody. It is merely a question of providing for the increases given in the Budget. Deputy MacEoin has been very critical of Section 2.  It is obvious that the Deputy ignored what I said introducing the Bill because he based his remarks on the assumption that I was taking on myself some of the functions of the referee and deciding these cases. I thought I made it perfectly clear that the referee had in fact decided these cases in favour of the applicants, but, due to a clerical error, the form prepared for his signature was negative. Because the referee was ill and, during the last few days of this work, was at home, the system of checking normally pursued was not put into operation and he signed these reports mistakenly.  It is very important that the purpose of this section should not be misunderstood or misrepresented. Deputy MacEoin is right in saying that every Minister always adopted the attitude that the referee's decisions were always held to be final, conclusive and binding.  That is still the attitude. The referee did make favourable decisions for these people but unfortunately there was a clerical error in the form and he signed it in mistake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <P>Did the referee state the amount of service for each period on the requisite form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>He did that in his notebook.  Unfortunately the form prepared was negative and he signed it.  I shall explain the two cases in detail.  The referee found that the persons concerned had the membership and service qualifying them for service certificates and pensions. Unfortunately, the reports to the Minister prepared in the referee's office were wrongly filled up.  They stated that the applicants had not the required membership.  The referee signed these reports and they came to me in that way.  It was by chance that it was discovered later that a mistake had been made.  I could have adopted the attitude that this was what the referee decided and it was just too bad for these people, but I thought it was only common justice that a mistake made in setting out the referee's findings should be rectified.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever about the facts of these two cases.  It is not a case of my trying to change the referee's decision in any way.  I am merely trying to give effect to what he decided.  In one of the cases, there is on the file a certificate by all four members of the advisory committee that the applicant is, in their opinion, qualified.  In the referee's notebook and in those of the members of the advisory committee, there are detailed categorical entries setting out that the applicant qualifies and tabulating his qualifying service.  That is what Deputy MacEoin was referring to.  Those entries are there in the referee's notes and in the notes of the four members of the advisory committee.  How the referee's office staff prepared the negative report in the circumstances can be attributed only to the fact that it was in the last week of their work, that the referee was ill at home and that the notebooks might not have been available for checking.  However, an incorrect report was prepared and the referee signed it, obviously without referring to his notebook which was in the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second case was slightly different. The first case was discovered <Col N="622" /> by accident when the person concerned applied for a medal and in the investigation of his medal application, it was discovered that the referee had, in fact, intended to award him his certificate and a small pension.  As a result of that, a check was made of all the cases decided in the last six months of the period and one other case in which a mistake had been made came to light.  In this case, the referee's original reaction was, apparently, to reject it, and the report was prepared for his signature on that basis.  However, on re-examining the facts of the case at home, he struck out the original entry in his notebook and substituted an entry &ldquo;Qualifies,&rdquo; setting out the qualifying service.  Two members of the advisory committee were with him at the time&mdash;the representative of the Minister for Finance and one of the Old I.R.A. representatives&mdash;and they made corresponding entries in their notebooks.  But again the referee signed the negative report which had already been prepared, and once more the error went undetected until it was too late for him to correct it.</P>
    <P>This could have been rectified without any Bill but for the fact that, unfortunately, the referee died in the meantime.  Since he intended in these two cases to award military service certificates and small pensions&mdash;neither of them exceeded £40&mdash;it is only right that the position should be rectified in respect of these people who have been informed that the Act does not apply to them.  This is the legitimate way of doing that.</P>
    <P>To suggest that we should set in motion once again the elaborate machinery of the referee and the advisory committee is ridiculous since these cases have already been decided by the referee in favour of the applicants. The system that normally applied in the referee's office of checking and cross-checking the files and notebooks to ensure that errors would not occur would, if it had been continued, have eliminated any chance of such errors occurring.  It was because of the dislocation caused by his illness, and the fact that he could not come into the office, that these <Col N="623" /> mistakes occurred.  As a result of the check carried out, we are satisfied there are no other cases.  This section of the Bill specifies the two particular cases that are to be dealt with and no other similar cases can be dealt with under the section.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how anybody can suggest that I am acting wrongly in this.  I looked for legal advice as to what was the best method of correcting the position, and this is the advice I got.  I want to make it quite clear that I am not in any respect interfering with the referee's findings.  All I am doing is taking steps to give effect to the findings he made.  It is quite obvious that these people were intended by the referee to receive service certificates and pensions.  No representations were made to me on behalf of these people and the matter first came to light when the medal application was being investigated.  Then, as a result of the search decided upon in consequence of the discovery of the first error, the second case came to light.</P>
    <P>I fully agree it was always held, and still is held, that the referee's decisions were final and conclusive.  That is the principle I am trying to give effect to in this section.  There is no doubt that the referee did find in favour of these two people.  It is very important that that should not be misunderstood or misrepresented.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin suggested I should reopen the whole business.  Surely there must be cases of people who have the necessary service and who cannot establish that service to the satisfaction of the machinery set up to investigate it, but surely also everybody by now has had a reasonable chance of establishing his case.  There is no reason to believe that if the matter were reopened, these people would do any better.  Practically every application has been dealt with by two different referees.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of setting down a rigid definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;, Deputy MacEoin has said that it was his intention to do so.  The proposed definition has been <Col N="624" /> expressed and if it had been in existence, there is no doubt that it would have qualified many people for awards, but a number would not have qualified.  Deputy MacEoin states that he promised to do this.  I do not want to be too hard in this respect, but Deputy MacEoin knows that he had no approval for it.  I describe that promise as being nothing more than bluff.  There was no intention whatever to reopen these cases.</P>
    <P>He is quite right in saying that people who are in a position to know have stated that they know of people who should have qualified and who did not.  I do not see what more can be done for those people.  They had opportunities to appeal.  Most of them have done so and the decision has gone against them.  We would have to go through all the same machinery of investigation again and there is no reason to believe that they would be any more successful this time than before.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provisions of this Bill, I have explained how the mistakes occurred and that I am not attempting to interfere in any way with the findings of the referee.  The Bill is to give effect to what was undoubtedly the referee's intention.  If the referee were alive, there would be no difficulty about it, but the man is dead, and this is the only way I can see of doing what is necessary.</P>

      <P>Tá soláthar á dhéanamh leis an mBille seo chun pinsin sheirbhíse agus pinsin mhíthreora is iníoctha faoi na hAchtanna um na Connaught Rangers (Pinsin), 1936 go 1957, a mhéadú sé faoin gcéad, is é sin, an céatadán iomchuí de réir scála na méaduithe le haghaidh pinsinéirí, i gcoitinne, a údaraíodh ag an Aire Airgeadais ina Ráiteas ar an gCáinaisnéis in Aibreán, 1959.</P>
      <P>Tá éifeacht ag na méaduithe ón lú Lúnasa, 1959, agus tá siad á n-íoc ón lá sin i leith ar údarás Meastacháin Bhreise a ritheadh sa Teach seo ar an 22ú Iúil, 1959.</P>
      <P>Mura mian le haon Teachta tagairt a dhéanamh do phointe áirithe, ní dóigh liom gur gá a thuilleadh a rá i dtaobh an Bhille.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides that service pensions and disability pensions payable under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts 1936 to 1957 shall be increased by six per cent which is the percentage appropriate in accordance with the scale of increases for State pensioners, generally, authorised by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement of April 1959.</P>
      <P>The increases became effective from 1st August 1959 and they are being paid since that date on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions passed in this House on 22nd July 1959.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the measure calls for any comment, unless any Deputy wishes to raise a point.</P>

We know of many of those forgotten heroes who were allowed to die in local workhouses.  At this late stage, some recognition should be accorded to the wives or families of those who do not come within the scope of this <Col N="627" /> measure in the form of a certificate or medallion of some kind.  People who never fired a shot were given medals and some recognition should be given to those people who are outside the scope of this Bill.  How many people will benefit under this Bill?</P>

    <P>The Bill provides for an increase of £61. 16s. in the pension of £500 per annum payable to the widow of Terence MacSwiney.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £140,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for the increase of the Grant to Local Authorities in Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land (No. 35 of 1925; No. 23 of 1931; No. 23 of 1939; No. 36 of 1946; No. 36 of 1953; No. 18 of 1956; and No. 11 of 1959).</P>
      <P>When the original Estimate for 1959-60 was being prepared, it was not clear what form the agricultural grant would take after 31st March, 1959, on which date the legislation governing the major part of it was due to expire. It was, therefore, felt that it would be prudent to provide only for the same amount of expenditure as was estimated would be incurred in 1958-59. That expenditure was estimated at £5,442,000 but as it included some £599,011 payable from the Central Fund under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1893, the provision to be made in the Estimate for Supplementary Agricultural Grants, 1959-60, was reduced to £4,842,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government later decided that the agricultural grant might continue for three more years on the same basis as up to 31st March, 1959.  The relevant <Col N="630" /> legislation, the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1959, became law on 16 June, 1959.</P>
    <P>Since the Estimate for 1959-60 was prepared, local authority rates, which mainly determine the amount of the agricultural grant, have increased by 3.5 per cent. on average, so the estimate for £4,842,000 is now inadequate. The additional amount needed is estimated by the Department of Local Government at approximately £140,000 &mdash;the sum provided for in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Allowing for the extra £140,000 proposed, the total provision in respect of the agricultural grant for 1959-60 will be £5,582,000.  The latest breakdown of this figure by the Department of Local Government is given hereunder, along with the figures for last year:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £58,560 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for certain Miscellaneous Expenses, including certain Grants-In-Aid, Compensation for Personal Injuries and Compensation and other Payments in connection with Injuries to Property (No. 24 of 1941).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to enable a refund to be made to local authorities, under Section 15 of the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act, 1941, of one-quarter of the compensation recovered <Col N="631" /> from the German Government for damage caused to property by the bombing incidents at the North Strand, Dublin, and Arklow, on the night of 31st May/1st June, 1941.</P>
    <P>Compensation for damage to property as a result of these and other incidents was payable, in the first instance, by the Irish Government.  It was laid down in Section 16 of the 1941 Act that one-quarter of the compensation so paid was to be recouped to the Minister for Finance by the county councils and the county borough corporations (including the borough corporation of Dún Laoghaire) in proportion to their valuations. Provision was made in Section 15 of the Act that the Minister might make a refund to these authorities, in respect of what they paid, out of any compensation the Irish Government might recover from the Government of any other State.</P>
    <P>The Government of the former German Reich accepted responsibility for the damage caused on the occasion of the North Strand and Arklow incidents and undertook to pay compensation for it.  That Government's successor, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, entered into agreements with the Irish Governments on 25th July, 1953, and 28th March, 1958, as a result of which we have been paid £326,852 against a total claim of £481,878 in respect of these two incidents.  In agreeing to the acceptance of a lower sum than that claimed, the Irish Government, in common with other Governments, recognised the reduced capacity of the German Federal Republic to meet claims against the former German Reich owing to the partition of Germany.</P>
    <P>Approximately 72 per cent of our claim was for damage to property and, therefore, the same proportion, £234,286, of what has been recovered, £326,852, can be regarded as compensation for such damage.  Since, in all these cases, one-quarter of the compensation paid by the Minister for Finance for damage to property, but not for deaths or personal injuries, was refunded by the local authorities, <Col N="632" /> it is only proper that one-quarter of the £234,286 received under this head should now be recouped to them. Payments on a similar basis were made to the local authorities in 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1950-51 out of compensation moneys then recovered from foreign Governments.  Some £58,570, therefore, is now payable to the local authorities and this Supplementary Estimate is, with the original token provision of £10, for the purpose of making that payment.</P>
    <P>Provision for the payment could not be made in the original Estimate as the relevant agreements between the Irish and German Governments were presented to the Dáil only in July, 1959.</P>
    <P>Our final claim on the Germans in respect of the North Strand and Arklow bombing incidents was computed as follows: Damage to property £345,408; Deaths (29) and Personal Injuries (102), £102,000; Administrative Expenses, £27,264; Recoupment of Irish Red Cross Society, £7,206. That makes a total of £481,878.</P>
    <P>For each death, we claimed £1,500. For 14 of the injury cases, where the degree of disablement was 50 per cent. or over, we claimed £1,000 and for the remaining 88 cases we claimed £500. The compensation actually paid for damage to property was approximately £306,000 and that for deaths and personal injuries approximately £38,000.</P>
    <P>At this late stage, there cannot be any question of re-examining the adequacy or otherwise of the awards paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refers to payments in respect of damage to property and other consequential matters and also payment of damages in respect of personal injuries.  Am I to understand that those who suffered personal injuries which were evaluated in the agreement at £1,000 and those who suffered injuries which were evaluated in the agreement at £500 actually received these amounts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, will they receive, or have they received, a proportion of these amounts corresponding to the proportion of the total claim agreed <Col N="633" /> by the Federal Government of Germany?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I will put it this way to the Deputy: in making the claim to the German Government in the beginning, it was put down as a round figure, that £1,500 would cover a death, £1,000 would cover a 50 per cent disability or a disability over 50 per cent and £500 would cover disability less than 50 per cent.  In actual fact, when these claims came to be examined, the total paid was £38,000; the total estimate would have been £102,000, so that the Deputy will see from that that little more than one-third was paid for these personal injuries.  I think the amount paid out was just and fair in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It does seem a little odd, does it not, that if on the foot of personal injuries we have recovered by way of claim against a foreign Government a certain global sum, part of that sum should be diverted to other purposes? I distinguish between damage to property and personal injuries.  I could readily consent to the proposition that after the value of property injuries had been determined by our own tribunal, substantial justice was done, but, in regard to personal injuries, would all precedent not suggest that whatever was subsequently recovered from a foreign Government should be given to the recipients of compensation for personal injuries and if we got a sum substantially in excess of what was in fact paid to these persons who suffered personal injuries, is there not a fairly strong case to be made for further payments to these people in proportion to what we actually recovered from the foreign Government responsible for the damage done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say to the Deputy that in making this claim to the German Government, the Irish Government were not disposed to under-estimate, let us say, and they actually estimated the damage to property at £345,000.  The amount paid was actually £306,000.  That was, proportionately, nearer to the mark, I admit, than was the case in respect of personal injuries.  The personal injuries matter appears to have been dealt with <Col N="634" /> on a very arbitrary round figure&mdash; £1,500 for a death, £1,000 where there was over 50 per cent. disability and £500 where the disability was under 50 per cent.  It is fairly obvious that in many of these cases of damage, where it was less than 50 per cent., there was probably no case at all for £500; there might be no case for anything like £500; there might be a case for £50 or £20.  In any case, the personal injuries claims paid amount to £38,000.</P>
      <P>Personally, as Minister for Finance, I have never heard any complaint from anybody on this score.  I do not know whether I could say that everybody was quite satisfied or not, but there has not been any general complaint and, in fact, no complaint as far as I know, so that I think they were fairly well compensated on the whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what will happen?  When will we dispose of the extra money that has been received in respect of personal injuries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the total figure we got back from the Germans was £326,000.  When the State were paying these amounts in respect of damage to properties and personal injuries, they were paid, of course, out of the Exchequer but one-quarter was taken from the local authorities.  Now, the State is recouping the local authorities one-quarter what they got back, not exactly the full amount.  They got one-quarter of the total amount paid out, which was actually something more than the £306,000, and they are giving back now one-quarter of what they got, so that the local authorities will, in the ultimate, between them all, have to stand some few thousands of pounds &mdash;that is all&mdash;out of the total.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported I was dealing with the possible effects of this Bill in one respect, which may or may not have been taken into account&mdash;not just the effect of longer trading hours in regard to those who drink but the wider aspect of the possible effect generally on those compelled to earn their livelihood as employees or as people engaged in the licensed trade, perhaps with their families.  I am also concerned with the effect on a wider and, possibly the most important, section of the community, so far as the House is concerned, the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for an extension of one hour each week night.  It might be of interest to read again some of the reasons adduced by those who presented the majority report of the Commission for recommending that <i>bona fide</i> traffic be done away with. On page 7 of the Report, evidence is <Col N="636" /> reported of Chief Superintendent Quinn, Garda Division of Counties Dublin and Wicklow, in the course of which he gives figures for prosecutions for drunkenness and disorderly conduct. He said that a large proportion of the offenders were persons who had come out from Dublin.  Instancing the dangers of the roads, he pointed out that in 1955 in Dublin, 53 out of a total of 65 prosecutions for driving while drunk involved vehicles alleged to have come from licensed premises catering for <i>bona fide</i> travellers and that in 43 road accidents, vehicles returning from such premises were involved.  This information is related to <i>bona fide</i> hours which were supposed to end at 12 o'clock.  I should be very much interested to hear the Minister explain to what extent a reduction in the drinking hours from midnight to 11.30 p.m. would have an effect on this situation.</P>
    <P>Chief Superintendent Connolly, of the Dublin Metropolitan Area, stated that in the same year there were over 74 prosecutions for drunken driving offences detected in his division and that 45 of these were detected between 10.30 p.m. and 3 a.m.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill is to keep the public-houses open until 11 p.m. and 11.30 p.m.  Some of the prosecutions referred to by Superintendent Connolly involved vehicles returning from outside the city area.  Judge Conroy informed the Commission that it was the experience of the circuit judges that, in the hearing of many civil actions and appeals relating to road traffic cases, there was evidence that the people involved had been drinking late at night and that the same evidence was present in criminal appeals against convictions for assaults following on visits to <i>bona fide</i> houses. That report relates to the situation where the official closing hour was 12 o'clock.  The Minister proposes to remedy that situation by doing one thing which is good and which I would like to support wholeheartedly&mdash; abolishing the <i>bona fide</i> trade&mdash;but whatever good may be achieved by that, the proposal to extend drinking hours generally is certainly a most reactionary and retrograde step.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> The Minister for Lands, I think, referred to the position of those who, of necessity, work in the catering trade and in other trades or industries which may necessitate working odd hours, outside normal working hours, or even outside hours normally worked by the farming community.  His reference was to the need for this, mark you, as if there was in general the same accent on the need in our community for drink as there is for food, clothing and shelter.  What about the need and the right of those engaged in selling drink? Have they no need, no right to relaxation or to a proper family life?</P>
    <P>I want to bring out one aspect of this matter.  For those drinking in a public-house, 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. may not entail a very late hour.  They can leave and go home at that hour, but the people who work in the public-houses or hotels must remain on to perform various duties and leave the establishment ready for the next day's trading.  Their finishing time may be midnight or 12.30 a.m.  The Minister for Lands is very familiar with the rural areas and the small towns.  If I go to one of the smaller towns in a rural area and need a meal and go to a hotel, possibly about 8 o'clock, and ask for a meal, generally I am told&mdash;and it is quite right&mdash;that the staff are entitled to some relaxation and possibly I get a cup of tea and a sandwich or tea and biscuits.  My need is food and refreshment but if I go into the same establishment and ask for a pint of stout or a half of whiskey, I shall get it.</P>
    <P>In speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill I inquired where the demand comes from for these increased drinking hours.  Some Deputy said today that there was evidence presented to the Liquor Commission that when public-houses were closed there was an exodus from the urban areas to the <i>bona fide</i> premises for the additional hour.  Therefore, according to the statement made in this House, the demand is not from people who need a drink, who are not able to sit down and have a quiet drink and then go home; it is a demand from people who have been <Col N="638" /> already drinking from one to two hours.</P>
    <P>I do not drink.  I am a life long teetotaller but I am not blind.  I have observed that one of the most common factors attaching to drink is that the more you have the more you want, and the pitiful tale told about people in the rural community not being able to get relaxation is hardly credible. In referring to this aspect of the matter I have in mind mainly those employed on farms.  Deputies have told us that a very serious hardship would be imposed on this section of our community not only if the Bill is not passed in its present form but even if the new hour were 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. and not the existing position as applies to the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether people ever read in the newspapers of the average wage rate paid to farm labourers.  It is inconceiveable that these citizens would be economically in a position to take advantage of this Bill.  The statement is made also that during the summer months the farming community, including the farm labourers, are working until 8, 9, or 10 o'clock every night.  As far as I know, there is only one pay day in agriculture as there is in industry and the level of payment there would not permit the farm labourer to purchase much drink unless at the expense of the family he is supporting.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made by Deputy McQuillan that people in the urban areas coming out of theatres and picture houses having had their evening's relaxation, are entitled to go into a public-house which is kept open for their pleasure.  I take it Deputy McQuillan will also suggest that in order to complete the evening the people who serve the public in the public transport undertakings should also be required to work later hours. There is no thought for their families, not much regard for the time they can get home or whether they can get relaxation, just because somebody wants to drink at a particular hour in the evening.</P>
    <P>The statement has been made in the course of this debate that extending <Col N="639" /> the drinking hours by one hour in the day would not increase the consumption of liquor.  If that is true, is there any reason to extend the hours?  Why should the hours of 10 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. be altered and the proposed hours of 11 p.m. and 11.30 p.m. be introduced?  According to some Deputies it is purely for the purpose of allowing people who would drink from 9 p.m. to 10 or 10.30 p.m., to drink an hour later.</P>
    <P>There is nothing under the present legislation which prevents a person who wants a drink going into a hotel or a public-house, drinking in comfort and proceeding home, as we all normally do, to our families.  However, if there is this exodus and if there is this difficulty in having public-houses closed under present conditions, will this Bill improve the situation one whit?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to two gentlemen on the Commission who are members of the Total Abstinence Association.  It appears from the correction properly inserted by the Minister that the gentlemen concerned felt they were under an obligation to choose what they considered the lesser of two evils.  However, they are not representatives of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association and it does not appear, while the Association gave evidence, that though the majority report was signed by them, it was signed under very clear and specific conditions.</P>
    <P>We should recognise that if there is some right for people to enjoy themselves, there is a much greater right that such enjoyment should not cause unnecessary hardship to others and should not cause unnecessary difficulty and problems in families and homes. Anyone who goes through the city of Dublin at present can easily note that between 11 and 11.30 p.m. the centre of the city, to all intents and purposes, is dead.  The people have gone home to their families and to get some rest and relaxation to face their tasks the following day.  The last buses are leaving.  People come out of the cinemas and theatres and are on their way home.  In a city of about half a <Col N="640" /> million people, there may be a few late dances.  Go into the residential areas. The lights are out and the people have settled down.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes that that condition should be changed and that instead of, as a regular thing, people being settled down, children gone to bed, mothers having cleared up and set the house ready for the morning, at 11 or 12 o'clock at night the public houses will be closing and the men only then going home.  To whose benefit?  Is it of benefit to the people engaged in tourism?  We are told it is not.</P>
    <P>Deputations that have attended on the various Parties have explained fairly carefully that aside from those in the upper income brackets who grace our shores from time to time, the bulk of the tourists come from across the water.  The largest proportion of those is represented by emigrants coming home for a short holiday and next are people coming for an ordinary holiday, most of whom have the same general habits as ourselves.  If they want a little pleasure or a little relaxation, they take it in the ordinary hours and they get home to their hotels, boarding-houses or families at a reasonable hour.  Therefore, for whom are we catering?</P>
    <P>I think we are all aware that for some years there has been a fairly persistent campaign by certain sections of people who came to speak for the tourist industry for not only a lengthening of the hours but almost for the abolition of licensing laws.  They represent a small section but they appear to be wielding a somewhat unusual amount of influence.  At a time when I think all sides of this House and representatives of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, temperance societies, Safety First organisations, the Garda Síochána and everyone else are congratulating themselves that drunkenness is ceasing to be a problem, we are now proposing deliberately to turn the clock back.</P>
    <P>We have reason to be proud that the young people growing up in this country, the boys and girls of 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 years of age or so, are, generally speaking, much more sober <Col N="641" /> than their counterparts of about 30 years ago.  There are many reasons for this very welcome development, one of which may be that conditions have changed somewhat.  There has been some improvement in social standards.  There has been some improvement in housing.  The public house is not now the only cutlet for a person who is leading a rather miserable existence.</P>
    <P>At this stage, in the absence of any concerted application for extended hours, except the one in this Report that arises out of an abuse of the <i>bona fide</i> law, it is recommended that the hours of general trading be extended.  We are contemplating doing this with very little regard indeed to the general interest.  The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association has gone on record in this connection. I think there is scarcely a Deputy who has not received representations from people associated with that organisation in the various constituencies. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, representing not 300,000 but almost 500,000 workers, is concerned lest the measure before us proved detrimental to the interest of workers, inevitably lengthen their hours, adversely affect their family life and deprive them of reasonable relaxation.  Even the people who drink have not as yet found an advocate for this extension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Facilities are being provided at Dún Laoghaire Pier for the transport of cars to this country by the mailboats and it is hoped that some 2,000 additional cars will be carried inwards in 1960.  An air car ferry service will be operated between Liverpool and Dublin from 25th April, 1960, by an independent British company which expects to carry 3,000 cars each way this year and hopes to increase that figure in subsequent years. The necessary terminal facilities are being provided at Dublin Airport. These developments should bring about a 50 per cent. increase in import of tourists' cars which amounted to 10,371 in 1959.</P>

      <P>I am not able to answer that question at the moment because reorganisation is not completed, but I could give the times that deliveries are made at present, if the Deputy wishes to have that information. The morning deliveries in the Raheny area, that is, the built-up area, are at 7.30 a.m. and 10.55 a.m. and the evening deliveries are at 4.15 p.m. and 5.50 p.m., but we hope to improve the position in the reorganisation that will take place.  Raheny has a rural area attached to it.  The rural area is served by two postmen who start at 7.5 a.m.  They have only one delivery and they finish about 10 a.m.</P>

    <Title>Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1959&mdash;Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> In page 4, line 13, before &ldquo;on&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;if the premises are not situate in a county borough&rdquo;.&mdash; (Deputies Cosgrave and Ryan).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes that we make a variation in the hours of trading as between a county borough, a county, and other areas. If it is now proposed to place the licensing regulations and licensing laws on a basis of general equality I would like to say that I could not support such a variation as is proposed.  I do not see any merit whatsoever in suggesting that, if a closing hour is fixed in one area, a person can then cross a county borough for an extra half hour's drinking.  I do not think there is any basis for that if it is contended that the average person has only a certain amount of money to spend on liquor.  If that is true, the average person in County Dublin would not have more money to justify an extra half hour's drinking, and neither would the average person in County Cork have more money to spend than those in the urban area.</P>
      <P>Aside from that, why should the people engaged in making their living in this trade have additional hardships placed upon them just because they happen to live on one side or other of a local government boundary? Account has to be taken of those engaged in selling liquor, either as employees or as members of a family-run house.  Under present circumstances they are not by any means idle.  The employee works an average day that is spread over 12 hours, with a break for lunch, and on the average that is very much longer than is claimed by the representatives of the farming community in this House for their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody could convince me that a substantial proportion of those engaged in agriculture, who are in a position to employ labour, average a working day spread over 12 hours all around the year.  In certain months of the year they do have a difficult job but when there is no harvesting, and no Spring sowing, are they compelled to earn their livelihood by staying in their places of employment until 10 or 10.30. at night, and then have to <Col N="658" /> make their way home a distance of three, four or five miles?  Of course they are not.  I do not think it would be out of place for me to say to representatives of the people in rural areas: &ldquo;Spare a little thought for the families of people running public houses in the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We in the city do not think it at all wrong that ordinary shops close at 5.30 or 6 o'clock, that furniture stores close at 6.30 and that the average closing hour for chemists is around 7 o'clock.  We believe that, as human beings, the people running these establishments are entitled to a life of their own, and to relax with their families occasionally.  We know there are employments which, of necessity, cause difficulty to those employed in them but surely that necessity cannot devolve from a desire by some people to do their drinking one hour later on a week day evening?</P>
    <P>The minority report says that one of the effects of an extension of the hours was considered to be a disruption of family life but maybe the Deputies in this House, and those people outside it who seek an extension of the hours. would not consider it a disruption of family life if, first of all, the people drinking, secondly, the people employed in providing the drink for them and, thirdly, those employed in other services, as a mass are compelled to return to their homes on an average an hour or an hour and a half later than formerly.  Would that not disrupt family life?  I submit it would and frankly I feel the Minister must feel embarrassed having had to sit here through the Second Stage and again on this Stage to listen to the excuses for elected representatives conniving at open breaches of the law of the land down the years.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan suggested it would be a good thing if the public houses in Dublin were open until 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. so that the people coming from the picture houses could go in for a few drinks instead of going home as they do at present. From that approach, I take it the Deputy would also suggest it would be a good thing if those employed in the public transport services were asked if they would be prepared to work until <Col N="659" /> a later hour in the night to get these people home?  All for what?  To cater for a demand, the existence of which nobody has proved by evidence in this House.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's difficulty.  He feels he could not have gone to his Party and said: &ldquo;Look. This total disregard for the law has been connived at by everybody, but this <i>bona fide</i> traffic is now reaching such a point that I feel I have no alternative but to ask your support in doing away with it.&rdquo;  I do not think he would get his Party to support him on that clear issue.  He is having difficulty trying to balance that outlook with the recommendations of the majority report.  Even that report is qualified under five different headings. Deputy McGilligan told us this morning that his information was that a week before that majority report was adopted, another decision was reached by the Commission but that it was reversed a week later.  It is on this we are asked to agree to extend the hours.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister sometime during the Committee Stage to indicate whether he agrees with the suggestion that his proposal will not mean increased expenditure in public houses; in other words, if this proposal were carried, that the same amount of money would be spent in public houses as is spent with the existing hours.  If that is correct, what is the need for later hours?  I do not drink and I cannot speak for those who do, but I am entitled to make my observations based on discussions I have had with people who do drink.  Where a number of people are having a drink together it is difficult for one of them to be the first to say: &ldquo;I am off home.&rdquo;  There appears to be a fear of some loss of social or personal prestige if four or five people are having a drink and one of them says: &ldquo;I have to go home.&rdquo;  But the danger to the personal ego is avoided under present circumstances because the owner of the public house or his representative announces at a certain time: &ldquo;Time, gentlemen, please.&rdquo;  Therefore, the boys can all go out of the public house holding their heads erect.  None <Col N="660" /> of them has to say: &ldquo;I am getting a bit low in funds.  You will have to excuse me.&rdquo;  None of them has to say: &ldquo;I told the wife I would be home a bit early tonight.&rdquo;  None of them has to say: &ldquo;I have to go because the has are ill.&rdquo;  No the proprietor or the barman says: &ldquo;Time, gentlemen, please,&rdquo; and then they march out.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said by people who like to take a drink that at times the most welcome words they can hear are the words: &ldquo;Time, gentlemen, please.&rdquo;  The Minister should bear that in mind.  I understand it is considered not quite the thing for anybody in this country to go in and have a drink on his own.  If he sees a friend, he has to stand him a drink. If he sees two friends, he has to stand both of them drinks, even though he can ill afford it and even though he may be drinking not on his own money but on the money that should go to his home to keep his wife and family.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about the situation in the rural areas where, it has been made plain by rural Deputies, respect for the law does not exist&mdash;in this respect, anyway.  I am speaking of the areas where <i>bona fide</i> houses operate.  Many of them have been operated on proper lines.  Never theless, the exodus from these places at 12 o'clock at night has resulted in death and injury to people going about their ordinary business.  That only refers to a limited number of places because there are only a limited number of <i>bona fide</i> places outside the Dublin area.  The Minister hopes to have the hours extended to 11.30 p.m.  If that is done, the area around every public house in this county borough will become as dangerous as the area around the <i>bona fide</i> houses at present.</P>
    <P>I shall not refer to the side effects on family life, but I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that we are proud of the fact that drunkenness in this country, particularly among the young people, has been receding.  The young men and women of this country, given a reasonable chance, given opportunities of reasonable incomes, of having a home and reasonable expectation of employment <Col N="661" /> and relaxation, are turning less and less to what was once the only consolation of thousands in this country &mdash;the bottle.  Are we deliberately, as a legislative Assembly, under the proposals of the Minister, to go now into reverse?  I shall conclude by saying that it is my firm conviction that it would be in the interests of everybody and would cause hardship to nobody if the present opening hours of 10 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. were retained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct a misapprehension that appears to exist in Deputy Larkin's mind.  He suggested that the assistants in the various establishments were being forced to work unreasonable hours, hours that did not permit them to have any family life. If he had referred to the statement I made on the Second Stage of the Bill, he probably would not have made that statement.  On that occasion, I said at column 949, Volume 177, of 11th November last:</P>
      <P>The trade unions have been stressing the hardship on the bar men and porters which later hours will entail.  But the conditions of employment for barmen are already safeguarded by the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, and these safeguards would apply just as much when licensed premises keep open for a 70 hour week as in the case of an 80 hour week. Under the 1938 Act, barmen may not be required to work for longer than 11 hours in any day, or for longer than 48 hours in any week &mdash;56 hours, including overtime.  The employment of persons under eighteen years of age between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. is prohibited.  Barmen may not be required to work for more than six hours without a meal interval.  There are provisions for annual holidays and for compensatory leave for work on half-holidays or Sundays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Deputy who has been speaking has not been giving much consideration to the facts contained in the explanatory memorandum which would have answered his queries, nor has he paid much attention <Col N="662" /> to the statement I made on Second Reading&mdash;to the fact that the hours of work of these men were protected by an Act of this House and that anybody who contravened that protection would be brought to book for it.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that the Government did not accept in full the recommendations of the Commission in respect of the weekday hours.  We altered the hours made in the recommendation to the hours contained in this Bill.  I think that was a reasonable compromise.  The Ministers, in their wisdom, thought the hours recommended by the Commission would be unsuitable in relation to the difference between summer and winter time, and I think they did a reasonably good job when they made that compromise. When we talk about 11.30 p.m. being a suitable hour, we had in mind that 11.30 p.m. for the four months of summer was not unreasonable. We all know that during a good summer in this country there is daylight practically up to midnight.</P>
    <P>I want further to emphasise that when we talk about transport not being available after 11.30 p.m., we are assuming that people come from the suburbs into the centre of the city in order to take their drink.  I do not think that is correct.  People drinking in these establishments will be people who live in the precincts of the city and within easy reach of the establishment where they take their drink.  People living in the suburbs will be drinking in their local establishments where they meet their friends.  They will not come into the city unless they have a car.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy knows more about it than I do.  I admit that I have no experience of that.  I made that confession during the Second Reading debate.  I am satisfied that when the Government made that compromise, they were making a genuine effort to meet some part of the case which they knew would be made against closing at 11.30 p.m. all the year round.  The case for 11 o'clock has been made in <Col N="663" /> this House and amendments have been put down to that effect.  As I said, when speaking earlier, I have not a closed mind on the subject and I shall be prepared to hear the case against me.  If, at the end of the debate, I am convinced of the necessity of a change, I shall be prepared to bring the matter to the attention of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this matter this morning, I referred to the Report of the Commission and the Minister said that my remarks might imply a reflection on the Commission. I am not in any way reflecting on the Commission but the Commission was appointed to inquire into the operation of the laws relating to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor and to make recommendations.  The recommendation is in the form of two reports&mdash;a majority report and a minority report.  Twelve members signed the majority report and nine signed the minority report.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, and I think it is general knowledge, at the penultimate meeting of the Commission, a majority voted in favour of the existing hours in the county boroughs.  When the final meeting was held, the matter was again brought before the meeting, probably to some extent in an irregular fashion because, if a decision had been taken, one would imagine that it would have been adhered to.  In any case, the hours were again put to the Commission and they were again carried by the vote given in the report&mdash; 12 votes to nine.  No matter how long one looks at the Commission's recommendations, they appear to have been reasonably divided, but, despite that, the Government propose the hours which are recommended by the majority with, as the Minister said, certain alterations.  In fact, since the Bill was drafted, the Minister has put down amendments dealing with Sunday opening, so that, so far as one can see, there is nothing sacrosanct in any of the hours suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are endeavouring to get is an agreement which will provide for the reasonable requirements of reasonable people.  A lot of talk has been <Col N="664" /> indulged in about people wanting a drink at the last minute, and people wanting certain facilities for particular occasions, but what I think is incontrovertible is the fact that the pattern and habits of drinking in the rural areas differ from those in the urban areas.  Most Deputies who have taken part in the debate have spoken from either an urban or a rural point of view, according to whether they represented a rural or an urban constituency. I represent a constituency which is more or less evenly divided between urban and rural.  I can recognise the peculiar requirements of both areas and the fact that the hours that suit the urban areas do not suit the rural areas.  Everyone is familiar with the fact that in summer time work on the land goes on later and longer than in other periods of the year, and that work on the land continues long after the time when the urban dwellers, in summer or winter, have ceased their employment.  Consequently, it is the natural pattern of life for rural dwellers, whether farmers or farm workers, to go to the public house later than is the case in an urban area. The majority report really decided in favour of later hours in order to preserve uniformity.</P>
    <P>One of the fears expressed here was that if there is a differential between the urban and rural opening hours, what are described as the evils of <i>bona fide</i> trading will arise.  I think many of the views expressed here show a lack of appreciation of the manner in which <i>bona fide</i> houses are conducted.  First of all, they are strictly supervised by the Garda authorities.  The very nature of the trade has brought that position about. As I said initially this morning, I do not want to revive the <i>bona fide</i> hours, but I believe that if we recognise the different pattern of life in urban areas and in rural areas, we must provide some differential.  If the differential is small, it is quite obvious that few people will bother to make the journey from the city area to the rural one in order to have the extra half-hour or possibly an hour.  It will not be worth their while.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, longer drinking <Col N="665" /> hours for city areas and for urban dwellers are asked for neither by the public generally nor by those directly concerned, the traders and the employees. So far as I am concerned, I believe the existing opening hours in the cities and in the county boroughs are quite adequate for the needs of the people.  Experience of the special exemption orders granted in the early years of An Tóstal showed that tourists, or visitors or, for that matter, city dwellers, did not avail of the extended hours.  If special circumstances warrant extra opening hours for particular occasions, then the question of exemption orders might be considered.</P>
    <P>I believe it is unreasonable to try flatly to legislate to impose the same hours on urban and rural areas, when everyone recognises, as this debate has clearly shown, that different conditions obtain in different areas.  If the differential is a small one, there is no danger of any possible abuse, or of any consequences which have been criticised as being due to an attempt to avail of the extra drinking hours in the rural areas which people might be tempted to do if there were a very big differential.  If there is a small differential, it will preserve adequate drinking facilities for the city dwellers, and the city traders and, at the same time, only those who must do so, because of their particular type of work, or their particular conditions&mdash;which are by no means new and which have been an established pattern&mdash;will avail of the longer hours in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>As I say, I represent a constituency in which that distinction is quite marked.  Parts of it are rural where the people do not finish work in time to get in early, particularly in the summer months and where people working on the land, or engaged in their normal occupations, work much later than people in the other part of the constituency, which is an urban area, who finish work within what would be regarded as normal city working hours.  Consequently, I recognise that in order to provide reasonable facilities for reasonable people from both urban and rural areas, it may be necessary to have a <Col N="666" /> small differential.  If that is considered desirable, I see no objection to it.  That small differential will avoid any abuse and, at the same time, cater adequately for the needs of city and country drinkers without trying to impose legislative uniformity which will not, in practice, work to the satisfaction of those who wish to avail of the drinking facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inevitable in a debate on a Bill of this type that one must be prepared to listen to different views from different sides of the House.  I must say that I, for one, am glad we did not have an official Fine Gael view and an official Labour view.  It seems to me that the only opportunity the various groups who are interested in this question have of voicing their opinion in this House is through the individual members of the Parties and the Independents who are not concerned with the Government at the time.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable, as the House generally seems to agree, that if the <i>bona fide</i> trade is to be terminated, some extension of the licensing laws in regard to the closing hours must take place.  Again, I think, in general, the House would agree that it is desirable to have uniformity of closing hours in the urban and the rural areas. There have been differences of opinion as to what the closing hours should be.  I have put down an amendment, which is included in the amendments under discussion, to change the late closing hour from 11.30 p.m. to 11 p.m.  It is obvious from reading the Report that the members of the Commission were not unanimous as to what the closing hour should be and, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, it would have taken very little to have tipped the scales one way or the other.  I suggest to the Minister, who gives the impression that he is open to conviction and argument, that it would be getting closer to a fair compromise to agree on 11 p.m. as the latest closing hour for either the summer or the winter months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that we are discussing the closing hour only for the four summer months and that <Col N="667" /> during the other eight months, the late closing hour will be 11 p.m.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be logical, in the interest of uniformity, and certainly a fairer compromise, that the late closing hour should be 11 p.m. all the year round.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave maintained that the drinking practices in rural areas are different from those in city or urban areas.  I also represent a constituency which is part rural and part city.  It seems to me that the reverse is the case, that when the urban dweller cannot get any more drink after 10.30 p.m., he goes to the rural area where he can drink until 12 midnight.  The argument put forward earlier today, that we are in fact restricting the drinking hours, is not correct because the only people who can drink until that hour in rural areas are the <i>bona fide</i> travellers, so that, in fact, we are extending the hours of drinking in the rural areas from half an hour to one hour, under the terms of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, everybody who visits a public house now and again knows that it is quite impossible to clear the premises at closing time.  One has only to read the national papers and, in greater detail, the local Press, to realise the difficulties of the publican in trying to get his customers out at a reasonable time after the closing hour.  When that has been accomplished, the assistants have to clear up in preparation for the following day and by the time they have gone home and the proprietor has an opportunity of retiring, at least half an hour has elapsed.  Therefore, if the late closing hour were 11 p.m. it would certainly be 11.30 p.m. before the assistants were on their way home and the proprietor had an opportunity to retire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been several suggestions <Col N="668" /> that there was no demand for this Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  That may be true from the point of view that no large body of opinion has evidenced a desire for a change.  Nonetheless, there is a general desire in the country that the difficulties which do occur and the several differences between city and urban areas should be ironed out and that there should be some basis of uniformity as between the urban and rural trade.</P>
    <P>There is also, of course, a large body of possibly unvoiced opinion that the licensing laws should be rigidly enforced.  I do not think that the amendment which the Minister has tabled to a later section of the Bill, to introduce fines of a minimum of £1 and a maximum of £5, will achieve that object.  I suggest that is another reason why the late closing hour should not extend beyond 11 p.m.  If the Minister were talking in terms of fines of £20 or £25 for persons found on premises after the closing hour, we could possibly afford to be rather more lenient in regard to late closing.</P>
    <P>I was not here for his speech but I understand Deputy Dillon suggested that there should be no regulations up to 12 o'clock, that the licensed house proprietors should make their own arrangements, on a regional, town, city or rural area basis.  There is a great deal to be said for that, undoubtedly. In time, things would iron themselves out.  But, if we do have that in mind, I suggest that the first step might be to close at 11 p.m. and to allow that to operate for, say, a reasonable period of years and then by a simple amending Bill a further extension in the licensing laws could be brought in.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to agree on a closing hour of 11 p.m. instead of 11.30 p.m. he would meet many of the views of people not only in the House but also outside.  It would certainly be easier on the assistants and the proprietors involved and would make enforcement of the law easier, which is essential if this Bill is to be a success.</P>

      <P>On Second Reading, I said that we had agreed on uniformity.  Deputy Manley took exception <Col N="669" /> to the Bill.  He painted a picture of drunkenness, of people not obeying the law, suggesting there was no law in rural Ireland.  I want to take point by point.  It is a sad reflection on our people if we have to pass laws to make them do the things they should ordinarily do.  If a man or woman has not the will-power to avoid excessive drinking, the law will not prevent him or her indulging in such drinking.  Deputy Manley nearly went as far as some of the Puritans in the United States did, when they made America dry and made it one of the most corrupt countries in the world.</P>
      <P>I believe in giving people freedom. A man, a woman or a boy should be able to make up their own minds to avoid public-houses.  I do not know of any abuse in county Dublin, despite the accusation made here by Deputy McQuillan that the pressure group, the licensed trade, of county Dublin, were looking after themselves. Of course, they were looking after themselves.  They are people who have put a great deal of money into their houses and are employing large staffs.  What is more, they had to obey the law in county Dublin.  It was not a case of knocking and getting into a public house after 12 o'clock. I do not know of any place in county Dublin where one can do so and I have represented the county for 16 years.  Many wild statements have been made in the House to the effect that the law was not obeyed and that as a result of this Bill, the law would be enforced.  It is a pity that Deputy Manley approached this Bill as he did. Surely our people do not want to be marshalled like that.  I was a Pioneer once, although I am not one now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Things have improved. A number of inter-Party Government speakers have gone away from their own Commission.  Apparently, they do not want it now.  I am delighted to see the Minister again restored to health although I am sorry he has to sit in the House so long because this is going to be a very long debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan made a special attack on county Dublin.  One would imagine that no crime was ever committed, apart from those committed by <Col N="671" /> the publicans of county Dublin.  I thought he was going to suggest a barbed wire encampment into which they should be put.  If he represented county Dublin, I wonder would he say that?  Would he appreciate the difficulties these people have?  What would he say if 100 publicans in his constituency lost their livelihood as a result of this Bill?  If we are honest supporters of puritans, we must be big enough to see everybody's point of view.  If we want to do that, we must look at every angle of the Bill and see whom it will hurt and whom it will help.  Dublin city is getting extended hours and county Dublin is having a half-hour taken off.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of an 11.30 p.m. closing, as in the terms of the Bill.  I would even go a step further to try to save the livelihood of people in county Dublin.  I do not want to embarrass the Minister but I should like to see something done at least to help the people whose livelihood we are trying to take away in county Dublin.  Their houses are well conducted; they must close on time; there are decent men in charge of the houses; they give good employment; they have spent thousands of pounds in reconstructing their premises.</P>
    <P>Taking an auditor's report on about nine or ten houses, their present value, I suppose, would be about £90,000. There are 141 people employed.  In the old days, these <i>bona fide</i> houses grew up around the city, some of them in non-populous areas.  I got statements from quite a number of these publicans and the position is such that in one case on a Saturday night a public house in a non-populous area had taken in £4 before 10 p.m. and £25 afterwards.  These people have to be considered and the only consideration I ask is that the House should give them that hour, until 11.30 p.m. Their property will be depreciated by 50 per cent. as it is.</P>
    <P>In the case of other houses from which I got statements, the amount of money taken in before 10 p.m. is very small.  There is a problem there which I want the House to face.  These people bought their houses dearly.  This trade <Col N="672" /> is something you cannot wipe out overnight and if the House is to deprive 400 or 500 of my people in county Dublin of their livelihood, I think they should be favourably considered.  The only consideration I want for them is an extension to 11.30 p.m.  We have agreed as a Party on uniformity but on this occasion when I see the livelihood of people I have the honour to represent being taken away, I am making this plea.</P>
    <P>When Chief Superintendent Quinn was asked about traffic going out on Sunday, he told the Commission that the volume of Sunday traffic was very light because the hour did not mean a whole lot.  While I am supporting the Minister on his present stand, I believe that if it were agreed by the House that the hours should be reduced&mdash; Deputy Russell said we should close at 11 o'clock&mdash;a number of people would be put out of business.</P>
    <P>County Dublin is one of the biggest tourist areas in Ireland and I suppose in practically all such areas it is bright up to 11 o'clock.  I do not see what harm it would do for a man to have a drink up to 11.30 p.m. in a public house rather than risk the possibility of some shebeen being set up where he could go and drink without supervision and which would carry on for a while until detected by the Garda or somebody else.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will take a serious view of that problem and, before deciding to do anything, will take every phase of Irish life into consideration and in doing so will not make statements regarding areas about which they know nothing, as they have been doing.</P>
    <P>The City of Dublin has its own problem.  County Dublin and every other county have their problems.  I have great pleasure in supporting the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Brennan, who spoke this morning in favour of the 11.30 p.m. closing hour. The only alteration I would suggest is that it should be for the whole year round.  I am making that plea to save the livelihood of a number of workers in County Dublin.  There is one house in County Dublin which employs 12 people.  The proprietors could do <Col N="673" /> without them for six hours during the day but they need them for the evening trade.  They would lose their livelihood.  We have enough people on the unemployment register.</P>

I do not intend to be pushed by any pressure group but when I see the livelihood of people who trusted me over the years being jeopardised, I must defend them to the best of my ability.  It merely remains for me now to appeal to the Minister in relation to the Sunday trade.  Superintendent Quinn said there was very little traffic in that connection, that the hour meant nothing. There again, you have the evidence of a very responsible police officer who had been dealing with Dublin and Wicklow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much against the extension of the closing time till 11.30 p.m.  I should like also to say&mdash;this may come strangely from this side of the House&mdash;that I have sympathy with the Minister and any Minister who has to pilot an intoxicating liquor Bill through this House. The decisions are not easy because it is a very complex matter.  Its complexity arises from the fact that we are trying to do partly by legislation what really lies in the realm of ethics or of moral issues and that naturally makes for wide differences of opinion. There are the total abstinence people, on the one hand, and you have persons who are in favour of the almost unrestricted sale of liquor, on the other hand.  The truth, as in so many instances, lies somewhere in between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in that spirit that I approach this question.  I am glad Deputies <Col N="674" /> I have heard speak have all obviously sincerely tried to make up their minds as to what was in the best interests of the country and of course, in certain instances, in the interests of their own constituency.  I say that, not in the sense that they were necessarily looking at the interests of their own constituency from a selfish point of view but that there are districts where there are varying outlooks.  Deputy Cosgrave has told us of the position in his constituency, which is partly rural and partly urban, and where, therefore, the problem can be argued very well from both points of view. I represent a city constituency and it is from that point of view I should like to speak first.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, in the City of Dublin there has been no demand from the trade for the extension of the hours to 11.30 p.m. from any aspect of the trade, from the assistants or indeed from the public.  None of those sections has asked for it nor indeed have the Guards asked for it.  I believe that even if you do not increase the actual hours in which a licensed house is open&mdash;and I think I am correct in saying that that is in the Minister's proposal&mdash;nevertheless the drinking habits of the public are different.  The busy time of most public houses is from 6 o'clock onwards. If you increase the hours of opening from 10.30 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. and in certain months from 10 p.m. to 11.30 p.m., you increase the period in which the heaviest amount of drinking takes place.</P>
    <P>Although all of us are sensative of appearing to censure our fellow citizens in any way, there is what I might call the ethical or moral issue involved. Sitting here I have been asking myself: why have we closing hours at all?  We have closing hours because in the past we found the heaviest amount of drinking took place in the later hours and that it was not in the public interest or in the family interest to permit that.  We are, as I said, loath to interfere with our fellow citizens on private matters but we do it in all sorts of ways.</P>
    <P>We do not allow persons to carry firearms or to own fireams without <Col N="675" /> pemission from the police.  There are many other instances in which our rights as citizens are presumably interfered with for the common good. That is why we have closing hours. We cannot divest ourselves of a degree of responsibility to our citizens in that respect.  We may stand up and say: &ldquo;We do not wish to interfere with people.&rdquo;  We are always interfering with people and we should be false to many of our principles, if we did not do so.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have referred to <i>bona fide</i> houses because that matter comes within the scope of this amendment. As far as I can understand, they were started in a very different age and for very different reasons. Anything over 50 or 60 years ago, when men had to travel long distances and were off a railway line, they had to travel either on foot or on horse. In cold weather, they probably actually needed alcohol to protect them against severe cold.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, if a motor car has not a heater, which I think all new cars have fitted as standard equipment, it can be purchased and put into the car at no great cost and people can travel in the utmost comfort at all times of the year.  They are not in need of alcohol now as a form of refreshment to save them from the cold.</P>
    <P>We know of the great danger of alcohol when combined with any form of transport.  A very considerable case could be made and has been made in some countries against serving any motorist with alcohol.  I am not proposing that.  I am merely instancing it to show how far the legislation of one period can become dangerous to the habits of the present day.  At one time, it was necessary for a traveller, in bad weather, to be able to get alcohol perhaps to ward off very serious chills and illnesses. The pendulum has swung so much in the other direction that it is not necessary now and is in certain circumstances extremely dangerous.</P>
    <P>Owing to the state of the roads, if a pedestrian is under the influence of drink he is a potential danger mainly <Col N="676" /> to himself and possibly to other road users.  The whole question bristles with complexities.  Each man can only make up his mind and express what he feels.</P>
    <P>Casual people have said to me when I sounded them on the Bill: &ldquo;I am not in favour of extending the hour from 10.30 to 11.30 p.m. because the man of the house may come back having had an extra hour in which to spend money in his pocket which he possibly ought not to spend.&rdquo;  From a family point of view, that is not desirable. I do not see that any real case can be made for the extension to 11.30 p.m.  Therefore, I want to register my very sincere disapprobation of that proposal.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made to extend the time to 11 p.m.  I have no great enthusiasm for that, either.  I do not see the necessity for it.  There has been no great call for it.  I think it is mainly to get a small increase of time but no considerable case has been made for it.  Therefore, in the case of the city of Dublin, I think the 10.30 time limit should remain.</P>
    <P>I would be open to listen to an argument for an alteration in regard to rural Ireland.  The chief argument in favour of an alteration there is that, owing to the early hours of closing, the law has been continuously broken. That is a very poor reason for asking us to extend the time.  This applies to both the city and the country.  No matter what extension we may give, the law will be broken just as much as ever.  I am not making any case about the law being continuously broken but where it is broken, it is broken because people want to drink. If you permit that same type of person to drink for an extra hour, or one-and-a-half hours, he will be just as loath as ever to go.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with publicans, the vast majority of whom conduct their houses in a very reasonable and good fashion.  It is the old Adam in most of us that makes the trouble and causes the difficulty and I think, reluctantly, we must endeavour to the best of our ability to control that.  Therefore, I am not in favour of an extension of the hours.</P>

      <P>It is suggested that there should be a free vote.  I do not accept that because everyone would be lobbied or blackmailed, if you like.  To enact legislation in that manner would be rather dangerous. An example can be found in the case of those who represent county Dublin.  Naturally, they are influenced, rightly or wrongly, by the publicans in county Dublin, and there are quite a number.  Publicans are quite influential people.  In the old days, it was the publicans who ran the elections here.  I understand that half of the candidates for Parliament were publicans.  They are very powerful people and they meet everybody. I am not saying anything against them.  I am pointing out the power they have and the power they would have in relation to representatives from county Dublin.</P>
      <P>There are others, of course, who may be influenced by people from total abstinence associations.  I was approached myself.  They may be unduly prejudiced.  You might meet some of those people who might have the minds of those who were responsible for prohibition in the United States, people with no imagination, because if the people who enacted the legislation had had imagination, and if they had known anything of human nature, they would have foreseen most of what happened, but they decided that, as they felt a certain way, everybody else must feel their way.  That is wrong.  It would be great if that could be the case, but it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view I take is strictly my own view, whether it is right or wrong.  I always think out things for myself.  I do not mind listening to other people <Col N="678" /> but I make my own decisions.  There have been various viewpoints expressed, some by people who never drank.  You could nearly suspect those views.  I do not drink now; I did drink for 20 years but I gave it up.  I can claim to have experience of both sides of the case.  Then you have the views of those who drink. I do not know that those views were expressed here at all.  You also have the publicans who do not want late hours.  The publicans in county Dublin do want the late hours.</P>
    <P>I think 11 o'clock is the best time. I heard the Minister mention a moment ago that most of the people in town late at night would be people who reside in the centre of the city. That is not correct.  All the big dance halls and cinemas are in the centre of the city and on any night of the week, there are probably some 40,000 people in the cinemas and of that number I am certain there are 30,000 who do not live within a quarter of a mile from the cinemas.  Half of those 30,000 are people who live on the fringe and outside the city who come in to see the latest picture.  I have been in show business all my life and I know what I am talking about.  All the big dance halls are in the city and whenever there is a big meeting, a Labour meeting or something else, in the city, you can safely say that a very large number of the people present are people living outside the city.</P>
    <P>The question then arises: what is the best for these people?  As the Report said, we should try to think of their habits.  That is a vital consideration and questions of law and order and of abuses and all the rest, come into it.  Let us take the cinemas.  They all close about 10.30 p.m. or 10.45 p.m. and as against those who want an earlier closing time, the people attending the cinemas would be deprived of a drink.  You would have some 30,000 people coming out of the cinemas and perhaps another 20,000 from the dance halls or meetings of all sorts.  Various meetings go on to 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m.  The closing time as it stands at present actually encourages people to break the law, because I know that people who do come out of the <Col N="679" /> cinemas late and are not able to get a drink down town knock on the door of their &ldquo;local&rdquo; when they go home and get a drink.  It is hard to blame them.  They want a drink and they have no opportunity to drink down town.  They know the local publican and they can knock on the door and get a drink.  We do not want to see that happening.  If a person goes down town now, he gets a drink and takes one or two in his pocket and then goes home.  This business of closing at 10 p.m. or 10.30 p.m. is nonsense.  Those people would encourage a greater evil and encourage people who are always looking for an easy pound to open shebeens.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

      <P>The thing is that we are trying to meet a situation and 11 p.m. would meet it, whereas 11.30 p.m. would be dangerous from the point of view of people getting home. Shutting at 10 p.m. or 10.30 p.m. encourages shebeens and encourages the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  It seems to me that only county Dublin is fighting for the <i>bona fide</i> trade and it seems to be a lost cause, although whether they should get some little compensation or not, I do not know.  It is hard on people who have spent a lot of money, not expecting this development, to find themselves thousands of pounds out of pocket.  We must concern ourselves with the question of whether there should be an 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. closing.  That seems to be the issue.  The other issues are not serious.  I gather the 11 p.m. closing suits all the people in the centre of the city and I would say that some 20,000 to 30,000 people would be in the city then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger of 11.30 p.m. is that most of the buses are full or have gone at that time.  If they have not <Col N="680" /> gone, you will not get on to them. Every night, I see crowds of people who are not allowed on to the Finglas bus.  They have to walk to Finglas at twenty-five minutes past eleven. They will let only some of the people on to the buses and the rest must walk.  What would it be like if the public houses were open to 11.30 p.m.?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot all take taxis.  Then you have the barmen's objection.  They want to get home. Again, you have the question of the habits of the people.  You do not want people rolling home, if they have to walk, at 12 o'clock causing a &ldquo;shindy&rdquo; in the house and waking everybody up.  Even if they got a bus, it would still be late because the practice is to make a cup of tea when one gets home and then go to bed.</P>
      <P>What happens?  At 11 o'clock or 11.30 Radio Éireann is finished.  Television is finished.  The father rolls home and arrives there at 12 o'clock midnight.  There is no tea and he will upset everything.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that 11.30 p.m. should be the time.  There are strong objections to 11.30 p.m. by all the Pioneer Associations, the publicans in the city and their employees.  There are other objections to 11.30 p.m. apart from the arguments I made.  As I said before, I speak with a little experience. I am quite well aware that it would be a great thing if there were no drinking at all.</P>

      <P>If there were no drinking at all, I am afraid a lot of the personnel of the Dáil would not be here.  Some other people would be in their place.  If I had kept on drinking, I certainly would not be in the House and would not be a pain in the neck to all the people here. Thanks to the fact that I do not drink I am here.  If there were no drinking by anyone, there would be more competition. Some people should be <Col N="681" /> thankful that others drink.  I want to repeat again that everyone in the city is against the 11.30 p.m. closing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting the terms of the Bill.  Before this Bill was published, I received&mdash;and I am sure other Deputies received&mdash;deputations from representatives of the licensed trade dealing with matters with which they were concerned in regard to the new licensing regulations. Their concern was mainly on the question of hours.  These deputations were very persistent but after the Bill was published, and until it was introduced in the Dáil, there was a complete lapse in such representations. I gathered from a private conversation with the members of the licensed trade that they were very happy about the proposals in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I listened to several speakers here on this question of a 10.30 p.m. closing and a few of them remarked that these hours are proposed for four months during the summer.  Few thought of the fact that that is really half-past ten.  In fact, according to the time we knew long ago, it is practically ten o'clock.  At any rate, for all ordinary purposes it is 10.30 p.m. and at that time during the summer months we have broad daylight and at that time, as Deputy Sherwin pointed out, people come out from the picture houses; people leave the fields.  The farmers, and sometimes their men, and even people out for walks and that kind of recreation in the countryside might like to adjourn to a public house for any refreshment they thought suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time, ordinary clubs are on the wane, mainly because public houses are making their premises more attractive and, as Deputy Corry said today, people like in the evenings to go into the pub and have a sort of social evening with their friends and talk about things.  The only hour available to them is the hour or the hour and a half after 10 o'clock or 10.30.  I can see nothing in the world unreasonable in 11.30 as the closing hour.  In fact, my own wish would be that the hour would be extended to 12 o'clock because I do not regard 12 <Col N="682" /> o'clock as a late hour during the Summer months.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about the city publicans and the city workers and their objections to the 11 o'clock or 11.30 closing.  We also hear protests from the temperance organisations, using the city publicans and their employees to defeat the 12.30 or the 12 o'clock closing.  There is a very obvious method whereby the publicans, the employees and the temperance organisations can offset the 11.30 closing.</P>
    <P>We know that trade unions are very powerful.  In many ways they get their way because of their organisation.  We also know that the licensed trade is a powerful body.  They have methods of getting their way also.  I rather think that if the licensed trade and their employees, represented by the trade unions, together with the temperance organisations, got together they could, if they chose, arrange that the public houses in the borough could close at whatever hour they wish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>The point to remember is that the law does not require any public house to remain open a minute longer than the publican himself wishes.  I cannot see why we should have only very limited restrictions as far as this Bill is concerned. I tried to examine the effect of restrictions.  My view is that the greater the restrictions the greater the dangers and the greater the abuses.  Let us have regard to what happened in America when licensed houses shut down completely.  That was a case of total restriction.  We had the most awful abuses in consequence.  We have closing hours of 10 p.m. and 10.30 p.m.  We have the abuses simply because the law and the hours are not acceptable to the people generally.  We are aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the temperance organisations I got letters protesting against the proposed hours on the grounds that we were increasing the hours available for drink.  To me at any rate that is the greatest nonsense.  In actual fact, we <Col N="683" /> are reducing the hours available for drinking since the Minister intends to have the law enforced vigorously once the Bill is passed.  Everybody in rural Ireland who keeps his eyes open knows that he can walk into a pub at any time he chooses in any place.  That is common knowledge; the people who say anything else are blinding themselves to the fact that you can walk into a public house almost at any time. The greatest abuse is that many of these publicans will serve people up to 2 o'clock in the morning.  I believe that to be the truth.  I know it to be the truth.  I certainly think that 11.30 p.m. in summer time in rural Ireland is a good hour to close the public houses.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reason in the world for closing at 10.30 p.m.  Those who advocate that are blinding themselves to the facts.  We cannot have restrictions without having trouble.  That is my belief.  Since we are trying to introduce a measure which can be effectively enforced, we are right in insisting <Col N="684" /> upon an hour which will be acceptable to the people generally.  That is a firm conviction of mine.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to this question of the free vote.  I mentioned it already by way of question to Deputy MacEoin.  Deputy Cosgrave, speaking after the Minister had introduced the Bill, stated that his Party had decided to oppose the Bill. That led me to believe that his Party had already made a decision that they would oppose the Bill.  If they had arrived at that decision, why this talk about a free vote?  If the principal speaker for the Party made that statement, had they not already decided to oppose the Bill?</P>
