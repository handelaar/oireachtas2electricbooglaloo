      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The man referred to was not submitted for the work in question as he was over the age limit specified by the employing Authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister venture an opinion as to what will happen to a man like that, a man of 63 years of age?  Is he not to be allowed to work in the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no suggestion of that.  I am over 63 myself and I work in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The work in question requires a man to be physically strong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it because he was not physically strong or that he was 63 that his name was not submitted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the former Minister for Social Welfare knows, we have to suit the conditions laid down by those who come to the labour exchanges. We are not in a position to <Col N="154" /> foist upon them those whom we may wish them to employ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister answer the question?  Is it because the man was not capable of doing the work or is it merely because he was 63 years of age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if in the recruitment of labour for the carrying out of work under the Rural Improvement Scheme he will give consideration to the employment of small farmers who have contributed to the cost of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with a general policy of long standing first preference in employment is given to suitable unemployment assistance recipients and unemployment benefit claimants registered at the local offices of the Department of Social Welfare.  Where a sufficient number of such persons is not available special consideration is given <Col N="155" /> to the landholders who are served by the scheme and have contributed to the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in Cork, and particularly in West Cork which is involved in this case, there is a complaint that small holders of £3 and £4 valuation are passed over even though they have contributed to the cost of the scheme?  Will he now take steps to ensure that these people who are depending on work provided by the county council should be employed in future in these schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy in my reply that in employment under the Rural Improvements Scheme first preference is given to unemployment assistance recipients and only where there are not sufficient numbers of these available is preference given to the contributors to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>For as long as I can remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as I can can remember it is the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has it not always been a distinguishing mark of rural improvement schemes where contributions were made by small farmers who are deemed to come within, the scope of the scheme that they would be given an opportunity of working upon them even to the point of hiring their horses and carts so that in many cases those who had not the ready cash to put down would be given an opportunity of earning, in the course of the improvement scheme, the contribution they were called upon to make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I shall give the order of preference which, so far as I can say, has always been given according to decided policy: first, unemployment assistance recipients; secondly, unemployment benefit claimants; and thirdly, beneficiaries or members of their families who have contributed to the cost of the work, <Col N="156" /> and non-claimants registered at the employment exchange.  They are in third position.  It very often works out that contributors are also registered unemployed, and sometimes these jobs are carried out in the summer in certain areas where there are very few, if any, people registered as unemployed.  In that case the work goes to the contributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are two categories of persons, one consisting of registered unemployment assistance persons who are contributing to the scheme and the other registered unemployed assistance persons who are not contributing to the scheme, would the registered unemployed persons who are not contributing to the scheme get prior consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the registered unemployed person would get the preference provided he was living within the required distance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are two classes, one of whom is contributing and one of whom is not, would the contributor get the preference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the contributor would get it, all other things being equal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the order of approval the Parliamentary Secretary has just quoted applied universally and without alteration?  What is the position in a case where a person offers to contribute to the improvement scheme in the form of his own labour?  Where does he stand in the queue?  Does he stand with the unemployment assistance recipients and the unemployment insurance recipients registered at the local employment exchange?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The contributions are in cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand it is not possible to contribute by labour or by the provision of materials?  That used to be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such provision in the regulations.  Where engineers take it upon themselves to accept free labour that is another <Col N="157" /> matter, but there is no regulation to cover taking free labour as a contributiton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it banned?  Is a contribution in material or labour banned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether there is any regulation which debars a man aged 63 years from being considered for employment on the Kilmore-Ballyteigue drainage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that a man who presented himself at the employment exchange for employment on the Kilmore-Ballyteigue drainage scheme was informed his name could not be submitted because he was 63 years of age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible a person in charge of the work stipulated a particular age for the purpose of getting physically fit men for difficult work.  There is no hard and fast regulation about it, but it is only natural that the person in charge might consider men over 60 not suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say who decides who will be taken on?  Is it the Department of Finance or the Department of Social Welfare?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to misrepresent. I am merely repeating what was told to me.  Will the Minister for Social Welfare suggest what is to happen to this man of 63 years of age? He cannot do clerical work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is difficult and heavy work and it is only natural that the man in charge would not be in favour of taking on men over 60 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not have a notice then saying that men over 60 need not apply?  What will they do?  Emigrate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information published by the Central Statistics Office indicates that there was an increase in gross receipts from all omnibus road services of approximately £166,000 in the first four months of 1960 as compared with the same period of 1959.  Of this increase I understand that £158,000 relates to services operated by C.I.E.  The number of passengers carried both on city and provincial bus services increased.</P>
      <P>C.I.E. estimate that the average percentage increase in the company's passenger fares, as from 18th January, 1960, in Dublin and other major cities and as from 1st February, 1960, in provincial areas, was approximately 7½ per cent.  The gross receipts were increased by a slightly greater percentage.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are at least 25,000 voters personated at every election, on an average of 300 or 400 a time, that the Garda do not act unless instructed by some agent and that, therefore, personation is wholesale?  The proof of that is what happened in the last election.  How many persons were imprisoned for personation in the last general election?  The answer is &ldquo;None&rdquo;.  Personation is treated as a joke, and it as well that we should realise that.  There were 500 personated at the last general election. It is a joke&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that where a local authority houses a person, such as the person mentioned in the question, the local authority will not get a State subsidy for the house? In other words, local authorities&mdash;for instance, the Cork Corporation&mdash;would drop something in the nature of a £400 subsidy on a house given to a person such as the person mentioned by Deputy Corish.  Is that not the fact?  Is that not tantamount to saying to a local authority that they may not rehouse this type of person?</P>

      <P>The lands in question comprise 226 acres in two compact blocks in the townlands of Ballyshane and Killalongford and they were recently allocated to the Forestry Division for afforestation purposes on the division of lands in the Clonmore area.  The Land Commission, in allocating the lands to the Forestry Division, took all relevant considerations into account and decided that the lands were more suitable for planting than for land division purposes.</P>

    <P>The lands have been attached to Ballinglen Forest, where a serious redundancy problem arose last March. It was feared at the time that it would be necessary to lay off 12 men at the Forest, but the acquisition of these lands provided a solution to the problem. It is the normal practice to continue existing Forest staff in employment at new properties, where practicable, <Col N="166" /> instead of laying off the men with service to take on new men.</P>

      <P>Deputies asked yesterday for an indication of what business remains to be done this session, and as far as it is now possible to do so, I shall outline the business to be concluded before the end of the session.

Then there is the Criminal Justice Bill and the Diseases of Animals Bill, and it is proposed to finish the Second Reading of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Bill in this session.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the end.  There are the remainder of the Estimates, a couple of Supplementary Estimates and a Quota Order.  There is the Telephone (Capital) Bill which it is desired to have passed in this session because otherwise the Dáil might have to meet earlier in the next session.  The money which has been provided would be exhausted by the end of October, but that is a non-controversial Bill.  As far as the Local Authority (Temporary Reduction of Valuations) Bill is concerned, I think <Col N="172" /> we shall have to leave it over to the next session, although it can be circulated so that people will be made aware of what is proposed.  It looks as if the Veterinary Surgeons Bill will have to be postponed also.  The Veterinary Council have seen the draft Bill and suggested some amendments which the Department of Agriculture are anxious to consider.</P>
      <P>There are, as far as we can see now, three other Bills which it is desirable to have passed this session.  One, to be introduced by the Minister for Local Government, can, I think, be accurately described as the Cork Opera House Bill.  There is a technical Bill to amend the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Bill, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is preparing legislation for the control of the design of drip-feed oil heaters.  It may be sufficient to give that Bill a Second Reading.  It is desirable, however, that those who trade in those heaters should be aware of what is intended.  I should imagine it would be a non-controversial Bill and once it got its Second Reading, the other Stages would be a formality.</P>

      <P>This is the section by virtue of which the additional penny per packet of 20 cigarettes was imposed in the recent Budget.  I can remember the Minister, or rather the Minister's colleagues, some three years ago wailing and bemoaning in relation to the price of cigarettes.  The Minister put on, I think, 2d. in 1957, and another 1d. came on as a result of an increase in margins following the other impositions which flowed from the Minister's action.  In consequence, the situation now is that the packet of cigarettes costs 4d. more than it did when the Minister took office.  It is difficult to reconcile that with the shrieks and the wails we heard from <Col N="175" /> this side of the House in 1956-57.  However, some people seem to be able to reconcile anything with their previous statements.  Certainly, the mere fact that they have turned their back on one promise such as this is nothing to Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, the increase in the consumption of tobacco last year was purely an increase over the two preceding years.  It is still some one per cent. under the consumption for 1957, ten per cent. under the consumption for 1956 and seven per cent. under the consumption for 1955.  I have said on more than one occasion before that the method by which so much of our State finances and Exchequer revenue is derived from tobacco is a most unhealthy thing.  It means that the Exchequer revenue in any year is at the mercy of a small variation in the consumption of tobacco.</P>
      <P>As well as I can recall, tobacco represents in this coming year, on the estimates I have made, some 27 per cent. of tax revenue.  Perhaps the Minister would be in a position to tell us whether that is correct or what percentage of the revenue as a whole is the customs duty on tobacco?  It is in or about 26 per cent. or 28 per cent.; let us call it 27 per cent.  It is very unhealthy for the State finances to be dependent as to 27 per cent. for its yield of revenue on one item, and particularly an item which might suffer considerable fluctuations, perhaps, for health or similar reasons.  I do not know whether that is something about which the Minister can do very much but it is certainly not healthy and I think it is desirable for us to examine, therefore, with some care the changes in trend in consumption to which I referred.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that tobacco consumption has never got back to the figure of 1953-54.  In the last year available to 31st March last year, there was a reduction of 12 per cent. on the 1953-54 consumption.  I do not know what the experience of other Deputies is but certainly, going around the country, I find more men refusing cigarettes at meetings and that sort of thing than I used to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> I am told, however, as against that, that there is considerably more smoking by women.  I do not know whether the Minister has had any investigation into the trends, whether he has made any analysis or whether the tobacco companies have made any analysis which they made available to him, but, as I say, having regard to the position that tobacco represents 27 per cent. of the whole national tax revenue, any variation in the habits of the people as regards tobacco could cause complete chaos in the national finance account, if that variation were sufficiently large.  It is, therefore, desirable that we should know as much as possible about it.  Before enacting this section, I hope the Minister will give us some information about it.</P>
    <P>The section does not include a provision for the taxation of tobacco stocks.  I presume from what I can learn that prices were increased immediately after the Budget and, therefore, the initial amount that will accrue in respect of the increase after the Budget for stocks in hands then which had passed out from bond will, of course, be there and will enable the companies concerned to meet the charge that will fall upon them when, no doubt, the Minister deals with the tax on tobacco.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the experience in these revenue taxes usually is that, when there is a very big increase in duty, consumption goes down.  There was a very big increase in 1956.  Let us take 1956 and 1957 together.  In 1956, the price of ten cigarettes went up by 5d. and in 1957, it went up another 2d.  That is 7d. altogether.  That had the effect of bringing consumption down.  There was no further increase until this year and consumption has started to go up again. I do not expect that the increase this year will make any appreciable difference in consumption.  If it takes the usual trend, we may expect some increase in consumption&mdash;not, perhaps, this year but after this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to give the Deputy any figure with regard to what percentage tobacco represents in our revenue.  His figure of 27 per cent. may be <Col N="177" /> correct.  We are not, however, likely to be threatened with a complete stoppage of that income.  Consumption may take a different trend over the years and tobacco consumption may go down but it will be fairly gradual, if it does, and we shall not suffer a loss of half or quarter in any one year. On the whole, it is a tax that nobody can find very much fault with.  It is at least a semi-luxury and a person who is not too well off can avoid using tobacco and thus not have to pay tax.  There is a lot to be said for taxes of that kind on semi-luxury commodities such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco.</P>
    <P>With regard to stocks, the usual practice, I believe, of the Revenue Commissioners has always been to disregard stocks and when the tax is taken off, the person who holds stocks to sell at a reduced price suffers the loss. When the tax is increased, the person who holds stocks reaps the advantage. It has always been held that, taking one thing against another, the fairest thing on the whole is to disregard stocks when there is any change of tax. There was a departure from that in some recent cases when a tax was put on tobacco.  It was departed from because of the stringency of the Exchequer situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the history. In 1956, the amount taken in on stocks was £266,000.  In 1957, the amount taken in was £101,000.  It was calculated, therefore, that if we extended the duty to stocks this time, we might have got about £50,000.  We thought it was better if we could afford to go back to the old principle of not touching stocks on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most of them realise that what they had then was worth more than what they have now.  They will have the pleasure of paying the extra 1d. an ounce for their tobacco and this is the Government who complained bitterly that these people were being charged too much three years ago.  I am not quite sure exactly how much the increase on hard-pressed tobacco was <Col N="179" /> since 1957, but I think it works out at about 3d. per ounce.  If I am not right, the Minister will check me very soon.  What is being done now represents half the increase of 1957 and if the present increase is 1d. then that would mean that the increase in 1957 was 2d. and that accordingly hard-pressed tobacco is 3d. dearer than it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in what the Minister says.  This represents an increase of 1d. an ounce, that is about 2d. for half a quarter of tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought of this increase in tax mainly in terms of cigarettes.  It is an interesting thing when one comes to think of many old age pensioners in the country buying half a quarter of tobacco and paying 2d. extra for it.  I do not suppose it is unreasonable to calculate that some old age pensioners would buy two half quarters of tobacco in the week.  Is it not an odd thing how the world has changed?  Very few people in this House would have approved, some years ago, of taxing the old age pensioner to the tune of 4d. a week in the Budget and declaring it to be an insignificant imposition.  When you come to think of it, it is not such an insignificant imposition, is it?  If you are allowing him 28/6d.&mdash;and <i>nota bene</i> I am putting on the 1/- he is to get on 1st August&mdash;4d. additional tax out of that constitutes quite a formidable burden.</P>
      <P>Mark you, another interesting facet of this is that while he has to wait until 1st August to get this 1/-, he has been paying 4d. a week since we passed the Financial Resolutions.  I wonder is that sound practice?  I doubt if it is, but it certainly is not sound practice to do it without even thinking about it.  I wonder if Deputy Browne, when this proposal was first mooted to him, realised that every old person in Enniscorthy who smoked tobacco was to be asked to contribute in this Budget 4d. a week over and above what he had been contributing heretofore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. S. Browne Mr. S. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but when you <Col N="180" /> took off the 1/-, you also increased the tax on tobacco in the same year.  Do not forget that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It fascinates me that Deputy Browne has to look back over a period of 30 years to find a subject on which he feels he can legitimately criticise the Opposition in this House. I sympathise with him in his dilemma but I think he would be told by his more experienced colleagues in the Party that the relevance of events relating to 1931&mdash;30 years ago&mdash;to the proceedings today is remote.  We are dealing with a situation that obtains today and it is worth remembering that the events of which the Deputy speaks relate to a body of our people who are now, the youngest of them, gone to their reward.  The youngest old-age pensioner, the Deputy will readily calculate, in 1930 is now in Heaven unless he has received the centenarians' bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about the old age pensioners for whom we are responsible now, and while I sympathise very largely with Deputy Browne's eager solicitude for old age pensioners of 30 years ago, I cannot help asking myself does he find it easier to take the 4d. off them by subterfuge in 1960 than it was to take the 1/- off them by legislation 30 years ago?  I am not sure that I approve of either course. The fundamental difference between Deputy Browne and myself is that I am prepared to say that I think the course adopted in 1929 and 1930 was a mistake and should not be repeated but Deputy Browne's view is that what was done in 1930 was highly undesirable because everyone understood what we were doing but the desirable thing is to do the same thing but do it in a way that nobody adverts to.  Perhaps Deputy Browne would give us the benefit of his counsel, coming as he does from County Wexford, <Col N="181" /> and tell us what is the fundamental difference between taking 4d. off old age pensioners through tax on his tobacco and taking 1/- off him by reducing his pension?  Is not the net result very much the same?  If you add to that that you have taken 6d. off the old age pensioners through the medium of an imposition of 3d. a 1b. on butter this year, and consider that that 3d. was added to a tax of 7d. a 1b. on butter that was put on before, it now appears that we are taking ?d. off his pension.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne has drawn my attention to a more interesting aspect of the situation.  I feel with him that the reduction of the old age pension in the old days was a mistake and one that none of us would wish to fall into again.  Deputy Browne recalls, and I think recalls rightly, that there is 2d. taken off the pension in this proposal of the Minister; that there was 3d. taken off the pension in the proposal to increase the price of butter&mdash;Deputy Browne is quite right&mdash;and that prior to that&mdash;and here is something which Deputy Browne has forgotten&mdash;7d. was taken off the old age pensions through the medium of an earlier increase in the price of butter.</P>

Deputy Browne might reflect on that when he is thinking on the tax on tobacco.  Would I be permitted to say this?  Deputy Browne will probably agree with me that if we named the essentials for an old age pensioner's life, we would say that they are tea, bread, butter, milk and tobacco.</P>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Browne to examine his conscience when he is troubled in his sleep about the shilling taken off the old age pensioners 31 years ago.  Would he sit up and look at his colleague in the representation of Wexford and brood on how much he has taken off the old age pensioners through the medium of bread, flour, butter and tobacco in the very recent past, in fact in the last couple of years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I can never understand why members of Fine Gael think that an old age pensioner on 29/- a week can find the money to smoke four ounces of tobacco and consume 4 1bs. of butter, and how such pensioners can afford to consume probably more tobacco and butter than any other section of the community.  That is the type of argument that the Leader of the Opposition has to make in order to say something.  It is exaggeration and with no relation whatever to the matter before the House.  It is purely Dillonesque oratory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no subterfuge in this.  It was announced that there would be an increase in the price of tobacco.  It was also announced that there would be increases in the prices of butter and bread and that, in order to compensate old age pensioners for the increase in the price of bread, butter and tobacco, they would get an increase of 1/- a week which was more than sufficient to cover any increase.  The old age pensioner, if he smoked four ounces of tobacco in 1956, paid 4d. an ounce more for it, fourpence an ounce <Col N="183" /> put on by Deputy Sweetman.  He also got a smaller loaf.  That is subterfuge if you like.  They did not increase the price of bread but they gave a smaller loaf.  The old age pensioner was told that he could do with a smaller loaf. Subterfuge, says Deputy Dillon, who was a member of the Government that introduced that subterfuge of a smaller loaf at the same price.  The subterfuge was that they did not increase the price but gave a smaller loaf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always impressed when I see an old campaigner take the floor.  The Minister has rushed to the defence of Deputy Browne.  He is a tough old campaigner and he knows how to cover up the rents in his garment much better than Deputy Browne.  Nevertheless, I would have liked to hear Deputy Browne on this matter, but I cannot allow a certain observation that has been made to pass without comment.  The Minister resents the suggestion of subterfuge, and he says that he announced the tax on tobacco.  He surely did.  How else could he impose it unless he adopted the idea of imposing taxation without any reference to the Budget? He put threepence on the pound of butter without any reference whatever to the Budget.</P>
      <P>He admits that he put threepence on the pound of butter, 20/- on the 10 stone bag of flour and fivepence on the loaf and then he says that there was no subterfuge.  I say that there was subterfuge.  I say that the former Taoiseach went to Belmullet and told the people there that Fine Gael were telling lies about him and his Party.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, if I understand it correctly, is for the purpose of providing new methods whereby the Revenue Commissioners will be able to determine which is rebate petrol and which is petrol used in the ordinary way for road transport purposes. The Minister should give us some broad indication of the new proposals that the Revenue Commissioners propose to adopt.  One of the procedures proposed is that of colouring the petrol.  I presume that a &ldquo;prescribed marker means that a coloured substance will be used, but I think the House should get what I may call a lay description of what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, this proposition has been under consideration for a long time.  Discussions have been going on with the petrol companies, and they are now about to introduce a system that will mark the diesel&mdash;that is the non-taxed diesel&mdash;and it will be kept by the distributors in separate containers.  If, after the diesel is marked, it is found in the fuel tank of a road vehicle, it will be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of an offence.  This would have been brought in sooner if the petrol companies had been in a position to co-operate&mdash;not that they were non-co-operative&mdash;but they found it impossible to make the necessary arrangements.  These arrangements will be made during the year, and this section enables us to make regulations as soon as the preparations are made by the petrol companies. Colouring matter will be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that it will immediately increase considerably the delivery charges for the oil concerns. I think the Minister said this applies only to diesels although I think my argument would apply otherwise, but <Col N="186" /> the present situation is that if a retailer is going to sell rebated diesel and ordinary transport diesel, he orders from the wholesaler who supplies him with what he wants.  I do not know what the appropriate quantity is, but suppose he wants 250 gallons of each, will it mean that two lorries will have to go to him?  Will there be two tankers, one carrying the coloured diesel and one carrying the uncoloured diesel?  The situation at present is that the same tanker can go down carrying both, and deliver 250 gallons in the rebated tank, enter that properly in the customs book showing that it is a rebated delivery, have the customs book ready and properly available to show to the Revenue Commissioners, and there is only one journey for the tanker.  Obviously it is cheaper to send one tanker to deliver 500 gallons than two tankers each to deliver 250 gallons.  So far as I understand it, this will inevitably be the result of the procedure the Minister is now about to introduce.</P>
      <P>I want to be quite fair to the Minister, and I can see some difficulties in the existing procedure.  It is troublesome in relation to proof that rebated diesel has not been improperly used. Undoubtedly, with this colouring method, we will get quite substantial additional transport charges in the delivery of these diesel oils.  If that happens on the one hand, will we, on the other hand, get the benefit of reduced administrative costs?  I presume it is the rebated oil that will be coloured.  At present there are a pretty substantial number of forms and books to be kept, and once the rebated oil is coloured, will that procedure be abolished?  Otherwise, it would seem to me that the situation will be that we shall have further additional transport charges, and get no compensatory cut in administrative costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for dealing with it in this way arises, I suppose, from the fact that the Minister feels there is pretty widespread evasion of the rebate. That may be, but I should have thought the loopholes could have been plugged up, and evasions prevented, without at the same time putting on the industry the additional transport charges that inevitably must <Col N="187" /> arise from this.  I should like the Minister to tell us what cut there can be in administrative costs to offset the increased transport charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say the Deputy has made a very good case with regard to the fact that it would be very difficult to avoid an increase in costs. However, I have good reason to believe that it will be done without increasing the costs.  This is a small proportion of the business of the oil companies, and when we speak of their doing this without increasing the cost, it may be a factor to be dealt with on some future occasion.  It may have some influence on prices, but it will be a very small influence I think. As soon as this scheme gets going, it will be possible to lessen the record keeping, and we hope, when it is running smoothly, to abolish record keeping.  I do not think at the moment we could promise on behalf of the companies that they would abolish it entirely, but they will be able to do so as soon as it is working in a smooth manner.</P>

They are not exactly tricycles within the dictionary meaning because they have two wheels close together behind.  It is proposed to treat the two wheels as one for the purpose of road taxation.  In the Road Traffic Act, 1933, a definition was given that where two wheels were running close together and where the centres were less than 18 inches apart they were treated as one wheel.  We are aiming at the same thing here for road tax. It will mean that the road tax will be £8 on these vehicles.  If the clause were not passed the road tax would be £14 upwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to give me the estimated yield from the Orders that are being included here. There are several different Orders.  It is not merely the levy section alone. There is a special Order for hydrocarbon oil.  I should like the Minister to explain how that arises.  Does it arise purely because of the transference of revenue to a large extent from customs duty to excise following the opening of Whitegate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the first two deal with hydrocarbon oil.  No. 69, which is the first one mentioned, was brought in on the 17th June, 1959.  Under that, the Excise Duty was raised to the customs duty level so as to ensure the same revenue from Whitegate oil.  In January, 1960, an extra 1d. customs duty was imposed in order to protect the Whitegate oil.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot.  I would have to get a question on that because it would take some time to prepare them.  Perhaps I might explain what these are.  The most important of the duties, No. 89, is the Order of the 28th April which made various changes in levies and duties.  It removed a certain number of levies.  It changed a certain number from levies to duties and also took off a certain number of duties.  There is a very long list of items.

The aim there was to bring all levies down to the 45% 30% level.

      <P>The duty on newsprint is suspended, as it were.  Newsprint will be licensed in free of duty unless our own manufactured newsprint starts to fill the market.  To the extent that it fills the market, it will be taken up by the newspapers and the remainder will be licensed in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> The next Order was in respect of newspapers and periodicals.  Back in 1933 a duty was put on daily papers coming in but certain papers were exempt from that duty where the circulation was under 1,000.  That exemption was given specially to allow certain papers in which we thought were valued by certain people here. The <i>Financial Times</i> is one example and the <i>London Times</i> is another.</P>
    <P>These two papers&mdash;I do not know about others&mdash;have gone over the 1,000 circulation mark.  A request was made that the level should be raised and we have raised it to 2,000. Any daily paper under 2,000 circulation is free of duty.  In 1956, a duty was put on papers coming in over the Border.  They would be weekly papers, principally.  A year or two ago, I brought in a measure to exempt these papers from duty.  We imposed, instead, a duty of ¾d. per dozen copies to put them on a level with our weekly papers here which were paying the levy on newsprint.  Now that the levy on newsprint has gone, we are taking off the ¾d.  These are the Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I did not know exactly but under the third, the change from levies to duties means a reduction in income of £550,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have that figure. It was given in the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not any more at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand this.  This has happened for several years running now.  The printed Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure are published on the Friday or Saturday before the Budget.  This year, I think, that was somewhere about the 24th April.  These include an estimate for customs duties; they include a levy <Col N="192" /> estimate at the rates in force on the date the estimates are published which was the 24th April this year.  Then the Minister came along and made an Order on Budget day, three or four days afterwards, on the 27th or 28th April.  In his Budget speech and in his Budget explanatory table he sets out the amount that the Exchequer was to lose from levy revenue at £550,000 but he did not set out&mdash;I think that figure is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that was the reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the amount that was to be lost, the amount of the reduction in, levies, but at the same time in the same Order he imposed certain additional customs duties and those additional duties were not included in the printed estimates of receipts.  They could not be included at the time because the estimates of receipts in relation to customs duties are based on rates of duties in force prior to the Budget.  Therefore, it seems to me that the Minister has taken off the reduction, in the levies in his Budget and that he has not added, as he should have done, the amount of the additional revenue that he will get from the new customs duties that he has added.</P>
      <P>It might be thought that that is not a significant sum but it is happening every year.  In 1957 the amount involved, as found in the outturn, was £692,000; in 1959 the amount involved for the whole lot was £1,535,000, and for the additional Orders that were made that year.  On Budget day, therefore, it was approximately under £1,000,000, about £900,000.  Last year it worked out at about £320,000. Those are all increases that the Minister knew on Budget day would accrue to him but the House was not told about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is either fair or proper because the Minister told the House on Budget day that the Government had made this Order.  It was circulated to us at the time of the Budget.  In his Table explanatory of the Budget he deducted the amount of the reduction in special import levies <Col N="193" /> by that Order.  If he took one part of that Order he should have taken both parts.  The other part of the Order means that there has been an increase in customs duty anticipated revenue, over and above the anticipation, that was there when the Estimates of Receipts were published.</P>
    <P>If that is not the case it means that the Minister, when he was publishing the Estimates, took this additional substantial customs duty into account in the revenue figures.  I do not know whether or not that is the explanation. I would shudder to think it was the explanation because if it were, it would mean that the publication is untrue as it sets out on the front of it: &ldquo;The estimate of revenue for the year 1960-61 is based on the tax rates at present in force.&rdquo; In case there was any doubt about what &ldquo;at present in force&rdquo; meant, it was put in italics to bring it more clearly to our attention.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that what the Minister has been doing all these years is building up a little nest egg for himself in this way.  I am quite sure that the Revenue Commissioners made an estimate of what would be involved in this Order.  I had some experience of the Revenue Commissioners' estimating and when you give them enough time to make an estimate it is amazingly accurate; the variation would not be more than one or two per cent. on the estimate if circumstances remained unchanged in the meantime.  I am positive that in the discussions before the Budget, and in the making up of this Order, the Revenue Commissioners fulfilled their duty and gave the Minister an estimate as to what this reduction meant on the one hand and what the increase meant on the other.  The Minister has given us only half the picture; let us have the other half before we go on with the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I should like to have a little notice to reply to this whole matter.  One must remember that in the case of the bigger items like apparel and clothes, there was both a levy and a customs duty.  We took off the levy and left the customs duty so that we could assume that the revenue would remain much the same <Col N="194" /> there.  Perhaps the estimate showed that more would come in because there would be less to pay but we can assume that is would be much the same.  That arises on some of the bigger headings. As far as my recollection goes I do not think we foresaw very much increase in customs duty as a result of the changes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, I have the figures&mdash;£692,000 in the first year. That is a fair amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave me the figures in reply to questions. I shall give the Minister the figures again.  They were £692,000 in 1957-58; £1,535,000 in 1958-59 and £1,855,000 in 1959-60.  The first figure is a true increase for that year but in the case of the second and third figures you must deduct what you got in the previous year to get the actual increase. It is a cumulative total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may not be very much increase this year.  These figures are for the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>To be quite honest, I think I have stumbled across&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;stumbled&rdquo; deliberately, from my own point of view&mdash;the fact that the Minister built himself into his estimates a nest egg each year without disclosing it at all.  I am quite sure that the Minister has got some estimate of what the additional customs duties will yield this year. Surely the Minister cannot look the Ceann Comhairle in the eye and say that he never saw an estimate for this, that an estimate was never sent across by Revenue to the Department of Finance?  Surely that is not the case? The Minister would be a very bad Minister for Finance if he did not see what the estimate was before he made the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall take a further bet that not merely did the Minister get the global estimate but that he got the estimate for the individual heads and items as well because he must have got it.  He should have got it.  It was proper that <Col N="195" /> he should get it and it was proper that he should consider the estimate for the individual items in order to decide whether it was worth while keeping additional duties in certain respects or whether they could go.  Of course he must have had it to see whether they were matters of substance or not.</P>
    <P>I am not going to be so rude as to suggest to the Minister that he made up his mind on these duties without seeing what the effect of them would be.  Of course, he considered the effect of them and determined that they were to be imposed after seeing that effect.  I do not know but I suspect also that probably as well as these that are now imposed, there were some others put up for consideration, and I am pretty certain that in relation to any others put up for consideration the anticipated yield from them was also put up so that the Minister could decide whether it was better to impose them or better not to bother.</P>
    <P>I am as certain as I am that I am standing here that this total figure is available and that it does not need very much putting together.  I would go even further and say that I would be surprised if it is not in the Minister's brief.  Of course, it may have a little red note attached to it.  I am not interested in it to the nearest £10,000.  I am interested in it only to the nearest £50,000.  That is giving the Minister a pretty wide ambit.  I do think the House is entitled to be told before it is asked to pass Section 22 what the third order there, No. 89, will mean by way of additional cost to the community to the nearest £50,000 or so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got any estimate.  If I had, indeed, I would not mind giving it to the Dáil.  I have a very vivid recollection&mdash;the Deputy is quite right&mdash;of the estimates of the various levies that it was proposed we should remove and I had to give very serious thought to how far we could go there and how far we could afford to go.  Any changes in the big items, like clothes and so on, were by taking off the levy and leaving the customs <Col N="196" /> duty as it was and, therefore, there was no expected increase in income.  I do not remember that there was any duty put on where any substantial income was promised to me in balancing my Budget.  However, I should like to look into that matter and, if possible, deal with it on the next Stage, if the Deputy would be satisfied with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall put down an amendment on Report Stage to delete the order from the section and that will give the opportunity of having a full discussion on it.  I should like the Minister to indicate to the House why it was that in the past four years, including this year, the House has been misled&mdash;and I do not mean misled in an unpleasant sense&mdash;in relation to this matter.  Each year the estimate of receipts and expenses has been published on the basis of the law then in force.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Each year thereafter an Order has been made as an integral part of the Budget adding certain customs duties.  It is not a protective duty that is being made for exclusion purposes.  During the course of the year, most of the duties which would come up are protective and in the nature of exclusions therefore.  The Minister made Orders in 1957, 1959 and 1960.  I cannot remember whether he did make a similar Order in 1958 but he certainly made one in 1957, 1959 and 1960 and I do not want to hold up the House by checking on the 1958 one.  In each case he made as an integral part of his Budget Statement an order imposing certain duties, not for protective purposes but for substitute purposes, instead of levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first one was made in the Budget of 1957 by him.  In none of the three cases was the fact that such an order would substantially vary the Budget figure brought into the Table explanatory of the Budget.  In 1960&mdash;the other day&mdash;one part of the order made was brought in on one side of the Budget Statement; the other part that should have been brought in on the other side was not.  In 1957, it was referred <Col N="197" /> to in the Budget speech but it was not brought into the explanatory Budget Table.  In 1959, the position is that one part of it was brought in to the extent of £220,000 but in regard to the other side of the picture, according to the best calculation I can make, a bigger figure, £320,000, was not brought in.  I do not understand the reason for that.</P>
    <P>The procedure is wrong and the Minister is at fault in failing to report to the House the true and proper balance.  I accept without question that the printed Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure were made out on the basis that is included in that printed document, that is to say, at the rate in force when it was issued.  It is unquestionably a fact that after the publication of that document, the yield from customs revenue as part of the Budget in each of the three years in question was varied and yet the Minister did not include it this year, in 1959 or in 1957.</P>
    <P>The non-inclusion of that item when it is so substantial is pretty misleading. We have before us that in 1957/58 the item that was not included brought in £692,000.  In 1958/59, I cannot tell how much was brought in.  The total amount including what was changed the year before was over £1,500,000. Certainly the change in 1958 that was not brought in to the explanatory Budget table must have represented about £500,000.  It is interesting to find that there are sums of that size which the Minister does not think worth while bringing to account in his Budget Statement.  Again in 1959/60, last year, I believe the figure to have been about £320,000.  I cannot tell what the figure is this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been good enough to say that he will give me the information on Report Stage.  I shall not press any further for the figure for the current year but I ask the Minister to give us also an explanation as to why sums of such magnitude&mdash;and I think the Minister will agree with me that a sum of £500,000 is not a trifle&mdash;were omitted for the three earlier years from the explanatory Budget Table.  There must be some explanation.  Perhaps the Minister wanted to hide away a little nest-egg or maybe nobody thought it <Col N="198" /> could happen.  I blame myself for not having criticised the Minister about the omission long ago, and I suppose if I could not, others could not either. However, it is a fact and I trust we shall have a full and complete explanation on the Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to see also what part of the yield of £1,535,000 in 1958/59 arose from customs duties imposed instead of levies after 5th April, 1958. In the first year, it is clear and cannot be challenged that the amount omitted from the explanatory Budget Table was £692,000 because it is from figures that the Minister himself has given me in answer to Parliamentary Questions. For the second year, I do not know the figure.  For the third year, all I can do is subtract one from the other and we have not yet got the information for this year.  It is immaterial to me whether I put down a Question in that regard or whether the Minister gives us the information on Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good; we shall leave it until then.  The printed Estimates of Receipts this year estimated a receipt of £1,675,000 from levies.  The Budget Statement indicates that of that sum levies to the extent of £555,000 are being remitted.  That leaves a net levy yield this year of £1,120,000, if my arithmetic is correct.  Apart from that, if I take last year's figure for customs duty which is being imposed in lieu of levy, then we see that the amount is £1,855,000.  That means that in this year of grace, 1960/61, we are going to have collected in levy and in quasi-levy, as I would describe the customs duty in lieu of levy, moneys to the extent of something over £3,000,000 by the time we have the additional figure which the Minister has been kind enough to say he will give us on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder did any of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, when they were canvassing the shopkeepers up and down the country in 1957, tell them that three years after they assumed office, they would still be collecting £3,000,000 in levy.  They trooped up and down the country canvassing the shopkeepers and I challenged them to deny that one <Col N="199" /> of the, things on which they obtained votes in all parts of the country, from Enniscorty to Donegal, was the statement that levies were unnecessary and that they would soon see to their removal. Three years afterwards, when everything is going beautifully for them, they are getting something over £3,000,000, approximately 75 per cent. of the amount which I collected and for which they gave me such abuse.</P>
    <P>What would the shopkeepers have said in 1957 when the Fianna Fáil canvassers knocked on their door and told them: &ldquo;We are sorry we shall be able to remit only 3d. out of every shilling. That is the best we shall be able to do for at least four years&rdquo;&mdash;because these figures will be operative until next year's Budget?  I do not think the shopkeepers would have paid much attention to them.</P>
    <P>Recently having forgotten to buy a message my wife asked me to get that morning, I went into a shop in Crumlin, a shop in which I had never been before.  It was about Budget time.  I heard the shopkeeper having an argument with another customer about the price of something.  The customer was reminding the shopkeeper that he had told his customers in 1957, when he was working for Fianna Fáil, that the duty would come off.  It was not, in fact, a duty.  She was being unfair in calling it a duty.  It was a levy. I waited until the customer had gone out and I asked the shopkeeper whether it was true that he had said the levy would come off and he told me that he had been led to believe by the Fianna Fáil organisation, of which he was then a part, that the levies would be taken off immediately Fianna Fáil became the Government.  He also told me that, because they failed to keep their promise, he had left them and would never support them again.</P>
    <P>It was not just a question of intention, in case certain Deputies might be tempted to say it was; they had promised they would do this.  They announced that it would be done if they were returned to office.  Here we are, three years later and running <Col N="200" /> into the fourth year, and next April something over £3,000,000 will have been taken out of the pockets of the people in levy and quasi-levy.  This is a rather interesting sidelight on yet another promise which put Fianna Fáil into government.  Again, we have the broken promise.  The people involved are mainly the shopkeepers. Shopkeepers were very important to Fianna Fáil at the last general election because they were vocal.  I do not blame them for being vocal if they felt things were hurting them.  But it was not a question then of just one vote; it was a question of all the customers being influenced.</P>

To put it another way, could three sums under £5,000 be exempted under this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I ask this question is that we are all familiar with the fact that it becomes the duty of any prudent family solicitor, on perusing the relevant sections of a Finance Bill of this character, to advise his clients to the best of his ability to take the maximum advantage of our law and we ought at least foresee, in the light of our proposed legislation, what a prudent family solicitor could do for the benefit of his clients under the terms of that legislation.  I think it would be true to say that 99 per cent. of Deputies would look at Sections 23 and 24 and interpret them as meaning to operate to exempt the first £5,000 of estate from certain estate duties.  It now looks as if, by a full user of the exemptions provided, a skilful family solicitor could provide that approximately £14,900 of estate may pass without liability to these taxes.</P>
      <P>It is even suggested that, by further examination of the section, within the law an even larger sum might secure this exemption.  We are all in favour of reducing taxation but, when we put our hands to taxation, I think the main care requisite for the purpose is to know the extent to which we propose to make the reduction because we have got to bear in mind that, if we are reducing taxation for one section of the community, we are increasing it for others.  We ought to try to spread the burden equitably.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us had he in mind when originally introducing this section that it could operate to relieve an estate of £15,000 from succession duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I saw it in that light.  What I did say was that £5,000 would apply where £2,000 did apply before and I had in this the possibility of £5,000 on each side, settled <Col N="204" /> and unsettled.  The example the Deputy has given me now is a bit new.  I am told that could happen too.  It could go to £15,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like a little bit more elucidation on this.  When a person dies, for the purposes of calculating estate duty the title under which that person, or rather the next person becomes entitled to the fund, means that they may or may not be treated as what is called a separate estate.  Am I to understand the effect of subsection (4)  is that each separate title under which funds pass now carries an exemption, provided that the fund in the case of that separate title does not exceed £5,000?</P>
      <P>The position, of course, is not that we are exempting duty for the first £5,000 because if the estate is of £6,000 it does not mean that duty is paid only on the £1,000 excess.  Duty is paid on the whole £6,000 once it goes over £5,000 but, if there are three or four separate titles under which money passes on the death of a person and not one of those four exceeds £5,000 of itself, is there any duty payable even though the total of all four may be in excess of £5,000?  If this exemption is to be a separate estate exemption then I think that the number of settlements that could be involved is legion. It would be just as well that we should be reasonably clear.  Section 14 of the Finance Act of 1951, as far as my recollection goes because I have not got the section before me, was the separate estate section.  I am sure Deputy Booth will remember that from his erstwhile days.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister explain why you can go to £15,000 and not further?  I thought you could go to £10,000 or else go <i>ad infinitum.</i> I can see the point of the argument up to two, but I cannot see the argument of beyond two being restricted. You either have settled estate or free estate.  It is quite clear that if it is neither settled estate nor estate exceeding £5,000, there is exemption.  Beyond that I am not happy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) before paragraph (b) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  The description of &lsquo;goods&rsquo;; in section 10 of the Act as amended by this Act shall include &lsquo;services&rsquo; and the expression &lsquo;goods&rsquo; shall include the produce of agriculture, horticulture and fisheries; and the expression &lsquo;services&rsquo; shall mean services whether rendered by an individual or a company in consideration of which payments are made or agreed to be made by a body or person resident outside the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to widen the scope of the definition of &ldquo;goods&rdquo; in the Act of 1956 so as to include goods of a non-manufacturing character and also to include services. I dealt very shortly with this point in the speech I made on the Budget debate.  It seems to me that the whole purpose of the incentives that were <Col N="207" /> given under the 1956 Act was to provide some sort of urge to people to get abroad and seek for new markets for any class of goods, although in the Act itself, they were confined merely to goods of the type that could be described as manufacturing goods. In principle, and particularly now that the experiment&mdash;if it can be called such&mdash;that was initiated in the Act of 1956 has been proved so successful to the economy of the country, I think there is a strong case to be made for the widening of the scope to include agricultural goods, goods that could be described as horticulture and also fisheries.</P>
    <P>If, for instance, a man gets out and by his own exertions and initiative, gets a market abroad in any country in the world, say for cheese manufactured in Ireland, he may develop through his initiative a very valuable export market.  I have spoken in this House on more than one occasion on the desirability of increasing the manufacture of different kinds of cheeses. It has been done successfully since the War in some of the continental countries, particularly Denmark.  If a person gets a new market for that, surely he will be conferring a great benefit upon the State and the economy of the country and would be entitled, in equity, to the same incentive as is given for manufacturing goods.  I quite appreciate that when goods are manufactured in the ordinary way by the effort of Irish industry, that gives increased employment.  But, similarly, in the case of processing of agricultural and horticultural goods, there will undoubtedly be, in the first place, money brought into the country which will be spread throughout the country and there will of course be a certain amount of employment, increasing as the market develops.</P>
    <P>I do not see that there is any case in principle against this amendment and there may be a very good case in practice for it.  I took the case of cheese, but I could also instance the case of honey.  I am taking some examples outside the ordinary agricultural exports of the traditional character, <Col N="208" /> examples such as cheese, honey and even apples.  If he could have an export trade in apples or&mdash;perhaps this is not of very great import but it illustrates the point, because I want rather to keep off the ordinary traditional agricultural exports&mdash;take the case of a person who starts a fox fur or mink farm.  Passing through the country recently, I saw a notice on a door indicating a mink farm.  In my view, the raising of fur bearing animals is within the definition of agriculture. I have a very considerable body of authority for that proposition.  If somebody produced furs from minks, reared and cultured in the country, it would form an export trade of a very valuable character.  Surely there is a case for extending the benefits of the Act in that respect?</P>
    <P>In the second portion of the amendment, it is suggested that the word &ldquo;goods&rdquo; should be widened to include &ldquo;services&rdquo;.  I do not want to name a particular firm, individual or individuals, who would come within the scope of the amendment, for obvious reasons.  Casting the cloak of anonymity over the person I have in mind, there is a company operating in the city of Dublin which does a very valuable and a very considerable professional business of a very scientific character throughout the country.  The particular individual who is the motive power in that happens to be a man of wide learning and scientific achievements. He is engaged as the expert not merely in this country but abroad. He goes abroad with his expert knowledge and applies the remedies, which his company has been formed to disseminate in Ireland, in England.  The result is that he, with his services rendered in England, gets money in England or elsewhere as the result of his services for an Irish company operating from Ireland.</P>
    <P>He or his company ought not to be deprived of their initiative.  It is a matter of considerable initiative, enterprise and scientific achievement. Matters of that kind could be multiplied, though not very widely.  Other examples could be given.  Let me take a case in which services are provided. Suppose a distinguished author writes <Col N="209" /> a book in Ireland, has it published in America and that it becomes a good book or even a best seller.  The amount of royalties that come from that foreign country to this country as a result of that man's services is every bit as valuable to this country, in principle at all events, as the export of sewing machines or articles of that kind.  I think what I have said covers most of the underlying principles in this amendment.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that it might be possible to let all sorts of scientific people here, even those people who specialise in such modern crafts as radio and television, operate from here and export their goods and services abroad.  In that case they would be conferring precisely the same benefits on the Irish economy as is done by the export of manufactured goods to a very considerable extent.  In those circumstances, they should get the same incentive as is given manufactured goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Costello was speaking in the debate on the Financial Resolutions he mentioned four points&mdash;I took a note of them at the time&mdash;in relation to which he thought we should extend this export relief provision. First of all, he thought that the relief should not be confined to goods manufactured from Irish material but should extend to goods manufactured here from imported materials.  The Deputy was mistaken there.  The relief does apply to goods manufactured here from imported materials.  He has, therefore, not put down the amendment to cover that particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment under discussion covers the two points be made.  It also covers the case where a painter or a writer sells the product of his brains abroad.  His fourth point which concerned the passing on of the relief to shareholders is dealt with by amendments Nos. 8 and 9.  Therefore, on these two points, No. 2 and No. 3, made by the Deputy in that debate, agricultural produce if manufactured, comes under the provisions of this scheme for the relief of tax on exports.  The Deputy mentioned cheese. <Col N="210" /> Cheese would certainly come under it. Butter, cheese, condensed milk, canned meat, canned or frozen fruit, vegetables and fish would come under it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say dressed meat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I would be doubtful about that.  I do not know.  The only agricultural produce that does not come under it are livestock.  There would be a certain doubt in the case of dressed meat.  I would be inclined to think that it would not come under it but here there would be a certain doubt.  I think, therefore, that the points made by the Deputy in advancing his argument in regard to agricultural produce and horticultural produce are already covered.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned a fox farm. Last year, we added to the list a fish farm.  I presume that in a fox farm the object is to produce furs and have them treated before export.  That would undoubtedly be regarded as an exporting business and would rank for the benefit of this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned honey.  I would be very doubtful about honey. There is no manufacture in honey, as far as the human being is concerned. I do not think we could bring this in as manufacture in order to qualify honey for the benefit of export in this case.  In any event, I think honey does not arise because up to the moment I think we are able to use our own honey and we have hardly got enough even as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the case of an author.  That is fraught with many difficulties.  It is quite true, of course, as the Deputy says, that if an author produces a very good book, it may bring in a very considerable sum of money in royalties&mdash;perhaps, more than is brought in by some of the manufacturers with whom we are dealing under this Bill.  It is very hard to know where to draw the line becuase if we are to come down to the product of human skill, or however it may be defined, it will be very hard to draw the line.  For instance, if you had a very eminent physician <Col N="211" /> and a person comes in from outside to be treated and goes out cured, that would not be covered.  If we try to bring human skill into it at all, I would be very doubtful about the possibility of covering the case of an author or any income from a source of that kind.</P>
      <P>I am thinking of the agricultural and horticultural side.  We have practically covered everything the Deputy has in mind.  But on the other side the services to which the Deputy referred would, I am afraid, give rise to endless difficulty.  It would certainly require very much more consideration than I could give it since receiving the amendment or at this stage.  I would, therefore, have to resist the amendment as far as that part of it is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this section, I am glad to note that it is a development founded&mdash;as, indeed, the whole of Part IV of this Bill is founded&mdash;on the Finance Act, 1956. I thought the Minister would give us a little dissertation for the benefit of the Deputies behind him when he was introducing this Part of the Bill and pay tribute to the fertile mind that first produced the principles on which these concessions are founded.  I repeat, the relevant reference is the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956.  We hear a great deal of oratory at present about expanding industrial exports, and I note that Part IV of this Bill is designed further to expand these exports which derive apparently from some change in the inducements provided under the law enacted by this Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part IV of this Bill emphasises that the foundation of all this structure is the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) <Col N="212" /> Act of 1956.  Knowing the habitually generous&mdash;and I speak ironically&mdash;attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party and its Members, I would have expected the Minister to embark on a discussion on this Part of the Bill and pay a glowing tribute to Deputy Sweetman who was Minister for Finance and responsible for the introduction of the Finance Act of 1956. In fact, I think he might have cast his eye from the Front Bench to the second row and said that the administration responsible for this brainwave deserved well of the country, that he was following in their footsteps and was glad to report a considerable expansion in industrial exports which in some manner compensated for the catastrophic fall in agricultural exports which had eventuated since the present Government took office.</P>

      <P>Having, I hope, moved the Minister to paying tribute which is overdue, I should like to ask him one or two specific questions.  When dealing with the amendment which Deputy Costello submitted, he explained that as he understands the legislation at present, it does apply to a number of processed exports which derive from agriculture and horticulture and he mentioned that it would <Col N="213" /> in his judgment cover most of the articles to which Deputy Costello referred.  Amongst the articles which Deputy Costello mentioned were apples.  Apples are processed as the Minister knows in the constituency next to his own, in Dungarvan, and there is a considerable volume of exports. It occurs to me does the operation through which we put the apples at Dungarvan amount to processing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that. I should be inclined to say &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister's difficulty.  It is hard to answer, because it is an expensive process.  You have to collect the apples; they are wrapped; they are stored in an expensive gas storage and they are packed. I do not think packing apples for transport can be described as processing. I could make a case that wrapping them is processing, but I could make an even stronger case that the storage, which as the Minister knows is a very expensive operation, being gas storage, is certainly processing.  I am faced with this difficulty that, by analogy, if you acknowledge these procedures to be manufacturing processes and render these apples when exported liable to the benefits envisaged in the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956, as amended by this Bill, you come slap up against the problem of eggs.  Does the storage of eggs qualify them?  I do not doubt that the manufacture of liquid eggs and their export would be recognised as a manufacturing process, but does the actual storage of eggs qualify them?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider this specific question of apples.  I think there is a processing there which ought to benefit that product if the Minister's interpretation of the proposed legislation which he has given us is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>Without in any way questioning your ruling, Sir, there are one or two points I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  The first amendment was concerned with the power of giving a company authority to create new shares which would not attract the benefit of the relief in income tax.  It is obvious that if a company were getting that benefit from 1956 onwards people might have bought shares in that company on the basis of getting that relief.  The object is to enable a company to issue additional shares which would deliberately have as one of their conditions that the relief would not be passed on. That is the point I want to make.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to subsection (2) and to contrast subsection (2)  of Section 31 with subsection (6) of Section 9.  The Minister, when he was insisting on retaining subsection (6) of Section 9, said that he did so because he wanted to keep the section <Col N="216" /> as it was in order to remit the question of penalties to the Income Tax Commission. In subsection (2) of Section 31 he takes an entirely different attitude. There is no question of a continuing penalty here at all.</P>
      <P>I think that in relation to Section 31 there is no need for a penalty at all because the penalty that will arise if the books are not produced in support of the claim is that the company will lose the relief.  I do not understand how there is any necessity for any penalty at all in Section 31.  If the documents and the records are to be produced because the company is getting a relief, is it not well settled in our income tax laws that if a person has to produce books and documents for the purpose of getting a relief and does not produce them when he is asked to do so, he does not have a penalty imposed on him but he loses the relief?  I do not see why that well-settled practice has been departed from.</P>

There is, as the Deputy says, power in the Revenue Commissioners not to allow the relief if the person does not produce the documents, but the Commissioners are afraid that there might be certain circumstances where they could not refuse the company although, at the same time, some official of the company might refuse to produce some documents.  That may or may not alter matters, but from my own point of view I should like to see this going in.</P>

    <P>A person might claim certain exemption from income tax on the grounds that he had exported his goods and had not told the whole truth.  When the Revenue Commissioners suspected that he had not told the truth, he might say that he would not produce the documents, but the he would withdraw the claim for relief. I think that in a case like that such a person should be penalised.  He should not have the opportunity of trying to defraud the Revenue Commissioners and then, when found out, just sliding out of it.  It is a different thing from income tax.  This is a case where a company is claiming the <Col N="217" /> advantage of this law, and I think we need not be as careful about the company's feelings as we would be in the case of an individual.</P>

      <P>Surely the general provision is here in the income tax Acts by virtue of which anyone who submits a false return is liable to a penalty?  Surely those general provisions could carry over into this and if anybody put in a false claim or a fraudulent claim they would be amenable under the general provisions rather than under this provision and the penalty provided would be much more substantial?  So far as a company might be concerned the penalty of £50 provided for here might be very small when compared with the amount of tax relief that would be available to a substantial company.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Minister's argument is a good one. It seems to me that a much better line of country is that if an official of a company will not produce the documents required, he should be told that the company will not get the relief. That is a far greater penalty than the £50.  It would be a very small export business, indeed, where the tax relief would amount to only £50.  There would also be the stigma of prosecution and the deterring effect on other people that a prosecution might have but all that would be trifling compared to the loss of the relief.  There does not seem to me to be much force in what the Minister has said having regard to the penal powers of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 33 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 6 (1) of the Finance Act, 1946 is hereby amended by the addition after the word &lsquo;minerals&rsquo;, where it occurs in the definition of &lsquo;mine&rsquo;, of the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;or an open pit or open cast excavation made for the purpose of getting any of the minerals specified in the Schedule to the Finance (Profits of Certain Mines) (Temporary Relief from Taxation) Act, 1956, the Minerals Development Act, 1940, or any mineral added to such Schedule pursuant to the provisions of the said Act&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is similar in terms to an amendment put down by Deputy Sweetman to the Finance Bill last year and supported by me on that occasion.  Briefly, it seeks to extend to open-cast mining the same privileges and allowances as are at present enjoyed by underground mining operations. In subsection (1), Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1946, there is a definition of the word &ldquo;mine&rdquo;.  A mine is stated to be an underground excavation made for the purpose of getting minerals.</P>
      <P>My amendment would have the effect of extending that definition to ensure, as I have stated already, that the benefits accruing to the operations of mining by underground methods will be extended to the same operations where open-cast methods are employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should explain the difference between underground mining, which enjoys benefits under the present legislation, and open-cast mining which I wish to include in the same benefits.  Underground mining is generally understood to include sinking shafts, driving tunnels underground from the shafts, extracting ores by underground operations, and bringing <Col N="219" /> that ore through the tunnels and through the shafts generally for further processing or treatment.  Open-cast mining is generally understood to mean the excavation of a quarry-like opening generally on a sloping site, and the taking out of the ore in one operation.  Open-cast mining might be described as carrying out, in one operation, what underground mining does in two operations, sinking shafts, extending underground tunnels and then excavating the ore.</P>
    <P>I took the trouble of looking back at the discussions which ensued on this section of the Finance Bill last year, and at that time the Minister undertook to give consideration to the case made by Deputy Sweetman and supported by me.  I feel the time is now very opportune to include in this Finance Bill the concession which I am seeking for open-cast mining operations.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the open-cast method of mining is a cheaper method than the underground method of mining, and there is certainly some substance in that argument.  However, it is also true to say that in preparing for the open-cast operation, considerable expenses are involved which are not incurred in the underground operations.  There is, first of all, the question of the acquisition of the surface rights from the land owners.  Naturally that must be done on a far wider basis.  If one is going to open a very large quarry, or make a pit-like opening on the side of a hill or a mountain, obviously one takes in a greater expanse of land than if one is merely sinking a shaft which may measure only ten feet square.</P>
    <P>There is a further point.  The open-cast method generally entails the employment of a substantial number of very expensive mechanical contrivances &mdash;dumpers and mechanical shovels&mdash; and approach roads and possibly bridges have to be built taking in a very large area before the operation itself can be properly undertaken. Therefore, I think it is correct to say that even though at first sight the underground operation may appear to be more expensive and generally is, in <Col N="220" /> fact, taking the operation <i>in toto</i>, and the preparations for the actual mining, the open-cast operation is also a very expensive undertaking.  There is also the fact that certain types of ore bodies, due to their very nature, can be mined economically only by the open-cast method.  I think the Minister would agree it would be very unfair to penalise an operation of this kind just because it was not economical to excavate the ore by the underground method.</P>
    <P>In the United States and Canada, no distinction is made between open-cast mining or underground mining and, indeed, so far as I am aware, no distinction is made between any types of excavation in either of those countries. As the Minister is aware, in recent years, certain American and Canadian interests have taken a deep interest in mininig in this country.  It is very desirable that we should bring our legislation into line with that of the United States and Canada and thereby encourage these outside interests to come in and invest substantial sums of capital in developing mining in this country.</P>
    <P>There is the further point, too, that recent exploration work in certain areas has disclosed the fact that there are substantial reserves of ore bodies containing certain types of ores and minerals which I think I am correct in saying were not visualised when the 1940 and 1946 Acts were under consideration. Having regard to that type of mineral&mdash;barytes is one&mdash;we should bring our legislation into line with the normal practice outside the country.</P>
    <P>To obviate any objection that might be raised on the grounds that if a concession such as this is granted, it might be taken to apply to quarry owners or sand pits, I should like to make it clear that it is intended to apply only to such minerals as are described in the Acts concerned.  I feel the Minister should accept the amendment and I know, from my personal knowledge, that a concession of this kind would be of considerable benefit to the expansion of mining in this country.  I therefore ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, when I <Col N="221" /> put down an amendment somewhat of this nature, Deputy Russell came to my assistance.  I am glad to be able to return the compliment now.  We hear these days, and correctly so, that one of the most vital needs to any increase in the standard of living is an increase of productivity.  Unless we succeed in increasing productivity in every aspect of our national economic life we shall not increase our standard of living.  The sooner we all face that situation and realise and accept it the better.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, therefore, that it should be axiomatic from that to say that any mining operation should be carried on by the most efficient method. For certain mines, underground working may be the most efficient.  For others, open cast mining may be the most efficient.  I suggest it is wrong that we should have the deterrent against open cast mining that exists at present by reason of the fact that it does not qualify for the tax relief. The Minister is entitled to say I did not include it when I was introducing the Bill in the initial stages.  That is perfectly correct.  When we were introducing these two Bills in 1956 we were to a large extent pioneering inasmuch as we were attempting to see how far tax inducements of this nature would assist the drive for greater production.</P>
      <P>I never suggested then and I do not suggest now that the measures we then introduced were the be-all and the end-all of the matter.  We did not suggest in any way that they were complete, that they were perfect or that they were the last word.  I concede to the Minister that, in many respects, he has improved the measures since then. Experience has shown that it is desirable to extend and to amend the provisions we then started out on.  That is inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever anybody in any walk of life starts something new he never gets it right the first time.  As experience accumulates one sees the necessity to expand, to correct, to amend.  We are all agreed that in present circumstances we must increase productivity. This is one of the ways in which it <Col N="222" /> must be done.  It would be quite wrong to endeavour to induce a person to win minerals by underground mining if in fact open cast mining were the correct method.</P>
    <P>It might well be that, to win certain minerals, open cast mining would be less expensive and more efficient than underground mining but that if it had to suffer income tax open cast mining would be more expensive than the underground mining.  To leave the position as it is would mean that in such circumstances the person concerned, because of the tax provision, would probably win the minerals underground even though it was not the most efficient method but because the underground method carries a tax concession it is slightly cheaper than the open cast method.</P>
    <P>That is a bad thing to do in the national interest.  It will not improve our overall economic position.  Apart from all that, I think we are all clear that the type of mineral wealth we have is virtually everywhere a rather low grade mineral.  If it were a high grade mineral we would not have had to introduce the tax concession in 1956 to induce people to mine.  We have only low grade deposit in practically every mineral if not in every mineral. That being so, it is even more desirable that we should endeavour by every possible means to ensure that the minerals are won by the most efficient method.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that a case may be made&mdash;I think it is a spurious case&mdash; that in the open cast method a person is better able to foresee the results than in underground mining.  I admit frankly that that case was made to me in 1956 and that I was somewhat influenced by it.  But, thinking it over, and with the experience before me now of what has happened in the interval, particularly in relation to Avoca, the important thing to consider is not what lies before the person in the production end but what will lie at the marketing end.</P>
    <P>Whether you work underground or open cast, the elements of the cost of production of your mineral can reasonably be foreseen.  Modern <Col N="223" /> methods enable us to plot the way in which a seem of minerals runs. There is not the same element of speculation as to what will be at the other end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Party have always used the argument, in relation to Avoca, that they have found everything that was there and that its development thereafter was not a hazard.  The Fianna Fáil Party always used that argument when they wanted to claim credit for what was done at Avoca.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</P>
    <P>If that is so in relation to the present day, then the methods of assessing the field of minerals, the run of the seams and the percentage of ore in them are so accurate that there is not the same difficulty and chanciness in doing underground work as there was before.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister should accept this amendment because it is becoming clearer every day that, at the present-day prices of minerals on the international market, our deposits are of a nature that will be marginal at all times.  They will not be won unless there is quite a considerable inducement because of their marginal nature.  The gamble in relation to a mining venture in Ireland is not so much a gamble as to whether the minerals are there but as to what is likely to be the price of the minerals when they have been brought to the processing stage for sale.</P>
    <P>A case might be made, perhaps, if we were considering open-cast mining under, say, some of the really fertile soil.  The Minister could then say, I think, that the difference between underground working and open-cast working was that the fertile soil remained there in the second case and would be of national use during the process of working the minerals.  We all know that is not the case in regard to any minerals of any consequence in Ireland; they occur either on the sides of a mountain or hill or on ground that is virtually useless for anything else except possibly for <Col N="224" /> planting but even that is doubtful. Certainly, the usefulness of the ground beneath which underground workings are carried out is so trifling as not to warrant consideration.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Russell's amendment is a good one; just as I thought my own amendment was a good one last year. I did not check the exact wording but I think it is virtually the same.  I press the Minister very strongly, first in the interests of productivity, secondly, in the interests of getting out the minerals and also to satisfy the sentiment there is in this country about mineral production.  There has always been a sort of sentimental feeling that &ldquo;there's gold in them thar hills&rdquo;.  I am not suggesting that there is gold but there are other minerals to be won and we should all like to see such minerals as may be there produced.  Any inducement that can be given towards that end should be made available.</P>
    <P>Very often in these cases, the reason a Minister does not give away on an amendment like this is that he feels he is giving away some revenue.  I do not think the Minister is giving away any revenue in this case.  He can circumscribe the relaxation in favour of open-cast mining to make sure it does not include any salvage working, if that is what he is afraid of.  Unless he gives this concession for open-cast mining in relation to the minerals visualised by Deputy Russell in putting down this amendment we shall not have that work at all.  The minerals will remain there and, even if found, will not be won and the consequent employment for the people who would be engaged in this work will not be made available.  If our minerals were of such a high grade that we could be satisfied that they would be won without the inducement offered in this amendment I could understand the Minister resisting it.  That is not the case.  The fact is that as we all know, as the Minister knows and as everyone who studies any of the reports knows, such minerals as are available are of a very marginal ore percentage. They are so marginal that if the price goes down at all there is a danger of a complete stoppage of operations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> I do not believe there is any justification for believing that any single mineral would be found in Ireland in such a way that experts on the subject would tell us that a variation in the cost of production or a variation in what they might find at the end of the tunnel is not what deters them from going ahead with the job.  What deters them is the price of the finished product.  For copper, it may be £200 today, £240 next week, £300 a fortnight afterwards and back again to £175 three months after that.  That is what puts the element of gamble into mining.  That is what, above all in Ireland where our ores are low grade, acts as a deterrent to development.  I think it was to offset that deterrent that the Bill was originally introduced by us in 1956 when the concessions were first given.  The concessions have proved themselves in the three or four years since then; they have also been improved in that period by the Minister and the Minister would be wise to add to that improvement now by allowing open cast mining this concession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy in the opening of his speech said I might scold him for not including this in his original Act.  I must say I have no intention of doing so; I have sufficient experience to know that in initiating legislation, especially in a new field like this, one can never cover all contingencies that it might appear afterwards should have been covered and legislation invariably requires amendment as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, Deputy Sweetman introduced amendments much like the amendment that Deputy Russell has now introduced.  I stated then that I had an open mind on the matter but if I did, I was not aware that there was any case in which the relief of underground excavation was causing any concern.  Recently, I was told that advances have been made in open-cast technology and there are now actually many more cases where open-cast mining would be attempted rather than underground work as a result of these advances and it is possible that open-cast mining might be <Col N="226" /> resorted to in this country, although as I said last year, I did not know of any case where open-cast mining would be operated.</P>
    <P>I agree with both Deputies who have spoken that if it is more profitable to use open-cast mining rather than excavation we should do whatever is necessary to encourage that development and, to whatever extent there is any risk, there is less risk in the case of open-cast than in the case of other forms of mining.  In addition to this, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has now told me that he has a case where he may ask for this relief for open-cast mining.  I am therefore inclined to agree that an amendment should be made to the Finance Act on the lines suggested by Deputy Russell.</P>
    <P>I had no time, however, to consider the form or the scope of the amendment or to what minerals it might apply.  We would have to give some consideration to the question of the minerals to which it would apply.  I am, therefore, suggesting to the Deputies that if the amendment were withdrawn, I would undertake to have a clause in the next Finance Bill, the Finance Bill, 1961, but it will be retrospective to include any work done during this financial year, 1960-61. That is the best I can do at the moment.  It is better in a case of this kind to give it proper consideration and so on and to include whatever minerals we think should be included. At the same time, we are not preventing any work that is going on or injuring anybody if we make it apply to the present financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>Except that if you do not define the minerals to which it will apply, nobody will know.  I could see the Minister's point of view in relation to the detailed working out of the clause but you would have to say categorically whether it will apply to copper, lead, zinc, tin&mdash;at least give certain minerals to which it will definitely apply&mdash;because unless you do that, the people concerned will not know until this time next year whether it will apply to them or not.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 36 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment, as and from the passing of this Act, stamp duty shall not be payable by an Irish citizen in respect of houses the market value of which at the date of purchase does not exceed £2,500.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is self-explanatory. It is to relieve houses the market value of which at the date of purchase does not exceed £2,500 of the <Col N="228" /> present rates of stamp duty.  I say &ldquo;rates&rdquo; because there are several rates within that limit.  The question of stamp duty on the purchase of property goes back quite a long time.  I think I am correct in saying that in the Finance Act, 1909-10, stamp duty on the transfer of property was introduced for the first time.  That was at a figure of one per cent. on all transactions, irrespective of the amount involved. In the Finance Act, 1947, certain changes were made in that respect, including the exemption from any tax up to a figure of £500.  Purchases over £1,000 were subject to stamp duty at the rate of five per cent. and provision was made to charge 25 per cent. in the case of non-nationals.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Act, 1951, some further changes were made.  The duty up to £500 remained the same and the charge on the value of houses in excess of £1,000 was reduced from five per cent. to three per cent.  In the Finance Act, 1954, some further changes were made which had the effect of introducing a sliding scale up to £2,500 and above that continuing the charge of three per cent.  In the Finance Act, 1956, there were certain further amendments, the chief one being the abolition of the 25 per cent. tax for non-Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>I feel the time is now opportune for the Minister to make a further concession and, as suggested in my amendment, exempt purchases the value of which does not exceed £2,500 from any stamp duty whatsoever.  I particularly have in mind the number of houses which are being purchased at the present time by young married couples.  Quite a number of houses built under the S.D.A. loans change hands from time to time and, as the thing stands at present, if the house is purchased by private treaty, the purchaser has to pay on the value of the goodwill, that is, the actual value of the house plus the outstanding amount of loan due to the corporation or county council.  This represents quite a substantial amount to a young couple whose finances may not be too strong at the time.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister favourably to consider the amendment.  If the house <Col N="229" /> is purchased on the open market, in addition to paying the stamp duty, the purchaser has to pay auctioneer's fees.</P>
    <P>In England, houses which do not exceed £3,500 in value are free of stamp duty.  I have not gone as far as that figure in my amendment.  I took the view that a reasonable start to cover the major portion of house property sold in this country would be £2,500.  In asking the Minister to accept the amendment, I feel sure that it would be a very valuable inducement towards a broadening of house ownership and would be of great benefit to a section of the community we would all like to see becoming house owners at an early stage, particularly young married couples.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Russell has given some account of the changes that were made in stamp duty.  Since the war, changes in stamp duty have been substantial on these smaller properties. I am afraid I cannot agree to accept the amendment because it appears to be almost impossible to frame any section or clause that would include houses and not include land. If we ever do anything of this kind, we shall have to take land and houses together and deal with them at the same time.  I have no objection to that at all if we could afford to do it, but it does make the thing a bit more costly than the amendment proposed by Deputy Russell would cost, if it were possible to implement it.  I calculate that if we had to include land as well it would cost the Exchequer about £200,000.  Anyway it would be impossible at this stage to consider it.  I have attempted to balance the Budget and I could hardly afford to provide a sum of £200,000 at this early stage of the year.</P>

It is one of those items that are considered to some extent in nearly every Budget.  It was dealt with, as the Deputy has outlined, in 1947, 1951 and 1954 and appears to be due to be dealt with soon again in some Budget. The best I can promise the Deputy, therefore, is to consider this matter next year if times are a little better than they have been this year.  I did give a definite undertaking in the last case to consider including a matter in the next Finance Bill, but in this case I can only express a hope that I can consider it next year.</P>

      <P>This is a desirable innovation but I would press the Minister to go considerably further and in relation to many other aspects to provide that the fees that are payable can be paid by adhesive stamps rather than by impressed stamps.  This section <Col N="231" /> provides that probate registrars can stamp their documents by adhesive stamps instead of impressed stamps.  At the Four Courts there is an enormous amount of time wasted in queuing up to get impressed stamps put on legal documents.  I am not talking of the big stamp duty on conveyances but of the half-crown stamp that has to be impressed on an affidavit before it is filed.  The Minister could ease the situation in this way.  Everybody comes at peak periods and cannot do otherwise because the clerk is in the court when the court is sitting.  When the court rises at lunchtime every clerk down from the different courts always has some documents to stamp.  They must all rush to get them stamped as they cannot be stamped over the valley period.  A great deal of this irritation and frustration could be avoided if the Minister would extend the use of adhesive stamps.  I know certain representations not necessarily on this Bill or on this part of the Bill but on a fairly wide scale, will be made in that connection to the Minister and I hope when he does receive these representatives he will give their suggestions his sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a point that arises in relation to the care and management of taxes.  I intended to raise it on an earlier section but forgot. However, I think I am in order in raising it now.  The people who were employed in Radio Éireann were, until the 31st May, civil servants.  Accordingly under the procedure for collecting income tax from civil servants they were subject to deduction of income tax from their pay up to the 31st May. On the 1st June they became employees of the new Television authority.</P>
      <P>As such they cease to be civil servants, so far as I can understand the situation, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act.  It seems to me there is a considerable difference in their position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the ordinary employee.  The ordinary employee has had half his tax, his July instalment, remitted because of starting P.A.Y.E. in October.  The civil servant does not come under P.A.Y.E. at all because he has always suffered tax by deduction. These people are in the position now that for two months of this year, they were civil servants and for the four months before P.A.Y.E. starts, they are not.  I want to know what provisions the Revenue Commissioners will make under the care and management section for these people to ensure that they will not be treated worse than if the Television Authority date had been 31st March.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point on this section.  The section states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>All taxes and duties imposed by this Act are hereby placed under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>It used happily to be the case that the Revenue Commissioners were responsible for collecting taxes but now they have passed over a considerable part of the collection of taxes to the employers under the P.A.Y.E. system. For the first time, it is laid down that employers are to act as income tax collectors for no reward at all.  I think this House has completely failed correctly to evaluate the consequence of that procedure.  I do not know what economy will accrue to the Revenue Commissioners in their administration of taxes by the operation of P.A.Y.E. but I imagine it must be substantial because the income tax collector in rural Ireland, and until recently in the urban areas, too, got his remuneration on the basis of the number of assessments for which he was responsible. Now a large number will be taken off his roster and these people will pay hereafter through the medium of P.A.Y.E. and he will therefore be no longer responsible for their assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the employer will be faced with the necessity of employing additional staff.  I know of one case in the city of Dublin where an employer has about 120 employees liable under P.A.Y.E.  He approached the problem with some apprehension. and he ultimately made up his mind he would have to get a junior clerk to do the work.  The junior clerk was in receipt of £6 or £7 a week.  He was charged with responsibility for P.A.Y.E., but it became manifest at a very early stage in the proceedings that he was quite unable to deal with P.A.Y.E.  The employer was told that he would have to get a responsible <Col N="234" /> person to deal with this work or the whole thing would go haywire and, if it went haywire, he might find himself in trouble.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear&mdash;I think it is due to the Revenue Commissioners to make it clear&mdash;I have myself found, and most people with whom I have spoken have found, that the officers of the Revenue Commissioners down the country have been extraordinarily co-operative, helpful and courteous in their efforts to assist individual employers to understand how the thing should be done.  I should like to pay that tribute to them.  I was so much impressed in my own personal experience that I directed the responsible person to write to the Revenue Commissioners expressing our appreciation of the help we had received. Nevertheless, we have to face the fact that, if you charge an employer employing 120 men with responsibility for collecting this tax, and he finds it involves the employment of a senior clerk in order to do it right, it is unreasonable to lay a charge of anything between £300 and £400 a year on an employer to relieve the Revenue Commissioners of work they did heretofore and give the employer no compensation to help him meet the charge upon him.</P>
    <P>I am told that in Great Britain there is a provision whereby employers who discharge their duties under P.A.Y.E. can recover from the Inland Revenue some compensation related to the number of assessments they collect.  I would urge on the Minister that he ought favourably to consider devising a similar scheme for here.  I admit that the procedures in Great Britain are very much more complicated than they are here.  Our Revenue Commissioners, fortified by the British experience, ingeniously evolved a very much simpler system, or so I am told, and the volume of work here probably will not be as great as in Great Britain. But there is work involved and, where there is a considerable number of employees, the work involves a disbursement of a substantial annual sum and I put it to the Minister that he <Col N="235" /> ought to take some steps to compensate employers.  There must be some corresponding economy in the cost to the Revenue Commissioners in employers collecting this not insubstantial volume of revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be very much saving to the Revenue Commissioners as a result of the change over to P.A.Y.E.  Eventually there may be, but there will certainly not be any saving for a few years.  I have examined these forms, and, making a fair guess at the time it should take to make an entry for each employee, I do not think it would employ a person full-time at all in the case of 120 people.  There might be a little bit of trouble in the initial stages but, once experience is gained, it should not take an intelligent junior clerk more than half a day.  There is a ready reckoner supplied.  There are only three or four columns to fill in&mdash; wages paid to date, amount deducted, and what should be deducted now to make up the total tax due.  I should think the work in the case of 120 employees would not occupy more than a Friday afternoon or a Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy said, we have had, of course, the experience of the system in England, including the experience that employers are paid there.  Our Revenue Commissioners were naturally inclined to follow the British pattern but I met some of the organisations which speak for employers and I found they were averse to being paid.  First of all they did not want to be tacit tax gatherers for the Government and, secondly, they did not want the responsibility that might go with payment.  One or two accepted it voluntarily and carried it out to the best of their ability but would not accept payment.  Therefore, I do not think we should be asked to consider any compensation for employers for any extra duties that may fall upon them in these cases, and I honestly believe the extra duties will be very small when things get moving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill deals with two matters, firstly, the General Cattle Diseases Fund&mdash;an old Fund which we now think it is time to abolish&mdash;and secondly, the substitution for the purposes of the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme of the word &ldquo;attested&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;accredited&rdquo;, which is the term which has been in use up to the present.  These two matters are not directly connected except that they both come under the Diseases of Animals Acts; since they are comparatively simple provisions, however, it was thought well to deal with them in the one Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The General Cattle Diseases Fund was set up under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878 and was continued by the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894.  The purpose of the Fund was to even out the cost to local authorities of dealing with outbreaks of animal disease or, in other words, to prevent the whole cost of dealing <Col N="239" /> with a local outbreak of animal disease from falling on the one local authority. The local authorities then had to deal with a number of animal diseases such as pleuro-pneumonia and cattle plague which have long since been eradicated. Nowadays, their expenditure on Diseases of Animals Acts work is in respect, firstly, of the employment of veterinary inspectors, who are mostly part-time, and, secondly, in respect of sheep dipping.</P>
    <P>The Fund is managed by the Department of Agriculture and it is mainly made up from assessments on the rates of a halfpenny in the £1 made at the request of the Minister for Agriculture by all local authorities from time to time, on a county at large basis. Each local authority pays into the Fund on the basis of ½d. in the £1 assessment whenever made and each receives back half of its expenditure under the headings I have mentioned &mdash;salaries of veterinary inspectors and sheep dipping.  The total expenditure of all local authorities on these items is now at the rate of about £50,000 per year and of this sum about £25,000 is recouped from the Fund to the local authorities, the other £25,000 being met directly from the rates. However, in the process of paying into the Fund and being recouped again from it, many local authorities in recent years get back from the Fund roughly what they pay into it.  I felt, therefore, that there was not much sense in maintaining a rather elaborate system of accountancy and procedure where only a comparatively small amount of money is involved&mdash;about one-sixteenth of 1% of total local authority revenue expenditure&mdash;and the end result is much the same as if the Fund was never there.  I would like to stress that the abolition of the Fund will involve no extra cost to local authorities as a whole, but to some individual authorities the cost will be a little more and to others a little less than at present.  In no case will it exceed a ld. in the £ and in all but two it will be considerably less than ½d.</P>
    <P>The Fund also receives additional revenue from two other sources, <Col N="240" /> namely an insignificant sum from the proceeds of fines imposed for offences against the Diseases of Animals Acts, together with as annual contribution from the Exchequer in respect of compensation for animals slaughtered under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order, 1926, which the local authorities operate.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear at this point that this Order covers animals suffering from certain types of clinical tuberculosis and has no connection with the general Scheme for the Eredication of Bovine Tuberculosis. In fact, as eradication under that scheme progresses, the calls on the local authorities for compensation under the 1926 Order will gradually diminish and will ultimately disappear altogether.  In the current financial year, expenditure under the Order from the Exchequer is estimated at £37,000 and a further contribution of £2,000, approximately, will be made from the Fund.  When the Fund disappears, all expenditure then to be met under the Order will be paid directly from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for keeping the Fund open until 31st March, 1963 and for replenishing it in the meantime to pay outstanding claims.  At the present time the Fund is in debt, as there are arrears to be met, but present indications are that about four assessments of one halfpenny in the £ each would be sufficient to pay outstanding demands on the Fund and to keep it going until it is wound up. The Bill provides for total assessments amounting to a maximum of 4d. in the £, altogether, so as to meet any unforeseen contingencies, but the total assessments to be made up to the 31st March, 1963, should not exceed 2d. unless some very exceptional situation arises.  With regard to Section 3 of the Bill providing for disposal of any balance in the Fund at 31st March, 1963, I do not think any significant amount is likely to be left in the Fund by that time as assessments will be made only as needed.</P>
    <P>As regards the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Tuberculosis) Act, 1957, the amendment proposed is a very simple <Col N="241" /> one providing merely for the alteration of the word &ldquo;accredited&rdquo;, which appears in the 1957 Act, to the word &ldquo;attested&rdquo;.  I have had strong representations both from farmers' representatives and trade interests that describing Irish cattle as &ldquo;accredited&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;attested&rdquo; would have an adverse effect on their sale in Britain since British buyers may harbour the suspicion that the difference in nomenclature connotes some difference also in status.  In view, therefore, of the representations I have received and because of the necessity to ensure that no obstacle is placed in the way of our cattle export trade, I thought it well that the same description should apply to our attested cattle as to similar cattle in Britain.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can make out from what the Minister says, the Bill is not, in so far as it applies to the Diseases of Animals Act, going to make any very remarkable change at all; and it occurs to me to wonder why he brought it in at all.  The general Cattle Diseases Fund, which has existed since 1878, provided a source from which certain protective payments could be made where it became necessary to slaughter livestock in order to prevent the spread of disease.  I suppose it is a somewhat analogous situation that theoretically, which has been true up to now, even so grave a disease as foot and mouth disease was the responsibility of the local authority of the county where the outbreak took place.  In fact, with the outbreak of any serious pandemic disease of that kind, the Department of Agriculture took over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister certifies to the House that the new departure represents some administrative economy or will work better than the existing system, I certainly would not recommend to the House to refuse him the provisions of the Bill.  The original design was to provide that if there were a severe outbreak of disease in one particular county and that the other 31 counties which then constituted the State had no disease to meet, the charge would be spread out over the whole country.  I <Col N="242" /> gather from what the Minister says now that the charge will be made an Exchequer charge?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quarrel with that arrangement if the Minister says it is a more convenient one, but I avail of this occasion to say that since it has now become the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture in effect to carry the farmers' insurance against foot and mouth disease, swine fever and clinical tuberculosis, as distinguished from tuberculosis defined for the purpose of the T.B. Eradication Scheme, I think he ought seriously to consider including hereafter the matter I mentioned to him today as another hazard to which the livestock industry is susceptible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I avail of this occasion to press on him a view with which I cannot but think he must have sympathy.  I agree with him that the incidence of death from lightning among livestock is very small, looked at on the administrative scale, but there is no livestock catastrophe which can hit an individual farmer more disastrously.  It may be a very little thing if I have it to tell that in one administrative county only ten cattle were killed in the past 12 months by lightning, but if I go on to say that those ten cattle were all killed on one man's land, then what seems a trivial thing, looked at from the point of view of the administrative <Col N="243" /> county, means the difference between survival and virtual destitution for one individual.</P>
    <P>I think it is a sound practice in this day and age when we are introducing Bills to spread the cost of social services over the whole community, the cost of contributory pensions and the cost of voluntary health insurance, that we should spread the cost of protecting an individual from acts of God of that kind, which may mean utter ruin for their families if there is no source to which they can turn for protection.</P>
    <P>It might be argued that every man ought to insure against lightning.  I suppose some logical argument could be made for that claim.  Knowing our neighbours as we do, we know that people do not insure against lightning. The truth is that 999 out of every 1,000 farmers never had a beast killed by lightning.  Nevertheless, we should not close our eyes to the fact that where it does eventuate, it can cause complete disaster.  I would urge the Minister to prepare a schedule of the contingencies against which the Exchequer will stand ready to indemnify farmers and stipulate foot and mouth disease and swine fever.  He should add to that death by lightning.</P>
    <P>I should like some further explanation, however, of the new situation. Under the old Diseases of Animals Act and its machinery, the diseases provided against were scheduled.  What is the Minister to do thereafter?  Is he going to issue a new schedule of diseases in respect of which he is prepared to pay compensation?  If he is going to accept that wide charge on the Exchequer, he is going to find himself, in my judgment, deprived of a very substantial present protection from extravagant proposals.</P>
    <P>We might as well face this fact. Professional men can get the strangest complexes.  If you listen to all the doctors told you, we would all get into glass cases and end up by living on sterilised food on the ground that there were so many germs and diseases and threats to our health knocking <Col N="244" /> about that nobody ought to start out of their strictly aseptic surroundings. We are now threatened with fluoridation of the water.  We are warned not to smoke.  We are warned not to eat. We are told we ought to keep thin and if we are thin, we are told to get fat and if we are fat, we are told to get thin.  It becomes a kind of obsession.</P>
    <P>I often listen to Deputy Dr. Browne with some amusement because he particularly typifies that point of view, that everybody ought to be in a cradle and his life indefinitely extended without any regard to how he lives his life at all.  Now against that kind of extravagance you have the instinctive rebellion of reasonable men who eventually turn to the doctors and say: &ldquo;Go to blazes.  Our sole purpose in life is not to survive.  We want to live as well as survive&rdquo; but the same kind of daft extremism is beginning to manifest itself in the veterinary profession.</P>
    <P>We now have so many drugs, remedies and threats to animal health that farming is becoming more and more complex and in a considerable degree more complex than it need be.  I venture to make this prophecy. We have all bought, in Great Britain, Holland, America and elsewhere, the proposition about the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  That procedure has cost countless millions at home and abroad.  Some day we shall find that we have reached the point where the veterinary profession will say that that objective has been attained.  They have said it already.  They are in the process of saying it in other countries, and we trust that they will say it here.  The very day we do it we shall discover that it has become urgently necessary to eliminate some other disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They are at it already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I could nearly name the diseases.  Johne's disease is one. As soon as we eliminate that, an application will be made to the Minister for Agriculture that, inasmuch as the Exchequer is now paying this, the next disease to be added to the list should be Johne's disease.  Nobody knows, until he becomes familiar with modem veterinary science, the litany <Col N="245" /> of livestock diseases that are now known.  There seems to me to be no end to it.  If you are an island country, the case is made that you have the difficulty of a country with a land frontier.  Since rabies in dogs was eliminated here and in Great Britain, because they are island countries, this business of eliminating animal diseases has become a vastly expensive procedure. So long as this constituted a charge directly on the farming community itself, under the operation of the system obtaining under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1878, as amended by the Act of 1894, there was always the local reaction which said: &ldquo;Look, we have spent as much as we intend to spend on this and we are not going to have the rates raised a shilling in the pound in order to meet the expense of elaborate campaigns to eliminate other diseases of which nobody ever heard until recently.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the Minister is asked to add a new range of animal diseases and when he has got rid of Johne's disease, what is he going to do when some subsequent diseases are nominated? Where will he turn for defence against the creation of an endless litany?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is in this difficulty.  In the last analysis the Minister for the time being must take the final decision.  I often said in this House before that it is a very grave responsibility for the political head of the Department of Agriculture in a matter relating to highly technical subjects such as animal diseases to reject the advice of his technical advisers.  If the profession seeks an interview, comes in as a professional body and makes a case that a new disease should be inserted in the schedule of diseases for eradication, and the Minister turns to his own technical staff and hands them the memorandum submitted by the professional body and the technical staff say: &ldquo;We agree with that recommendation&rdquo;, it is very hard for the Minister to say: &ldquo;I do not and I am not going to give effect to it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is in an entirely different position if he is in a position to say: &ldquo;Well, I am advised that the technical experts of the Department think this would be a desirable thing to do but the plain <Col N="246" /> fact is that the local authorities will not do it for me.  I can advise them and tell them your opinion but they simply will not meet this cost.&rdquo; He is not going to have that line of defence hereafter and, mark you, the Minister for Finance who is now to be the financial authority will find himself in a very different position because it is not easy for him to say: &ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture finds that the safety of the livestock population requires a certain expenditure for the eradication of a particular disease; nevertheless, I will not provide the money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not see any Minister for Finance being in a position to do that and therefore I wonder if indeed the Minister is wise in winding up this fund at all.  As I say, it is largely a matter in which the House must be guided by the Minister's own view and if he says that certain administrative economies will result, there is certainly no great matter of principle involved.  It is merely a question of administration. I should be glad to hear his reaction to the two questions I raised with him. First: what principles are guiding him hereafter in the scheduling of diseases to be covered by the Exchequer expenditure envisaged; and secondly, does he not think it reasonable to include in that schedule, with the diseases already mentioned, the hazard of death by lightning?</P>
    <P>As the Minister says, this Bill deals with two really distinct matters.  The second matter is covered by Section 5 and opens up a very much wider field.  I really think it would be wrong to allow this occasion to pass without informing the Minister of some misgiving that I feel in regard to the whole situation relating to bovine tuberculosis eradication.  I do not think that we on this side of the House can be charged with having minimised the dimensions of this problem at any time and I do not want to suggest for a moment that the task of completing the eradication of bovine tuberculosis is anything but a formidable one. However, I am bound to say that I am disappointed with the rate of progress. There were two methods of approach <Col N="247" /> to this problem when the eradication of bovine tuberculosis was first turned upon.  One was to start operations in the most intensive centres of infection, which were the dairy counties and for that view, I thought there was a powerful argument.  It occurred to me that with the traditional pattern of our livestock trade&mdash;our suck calves coming out of the intensive areas and passing up to the west of Ireland, where they are reared as stores, and then to the eastern counties for finishing prior to export&mdash;unless you cleared up the source of infection, you were going to have a continuous stream of infection coming out of those areas into the area you were proceeding to clear up.  However, a very strong case was made for the other point of view, that there was no attempting the impossible and that if you launched into a campaign in Tipperary, Limerick, North Cork and South Kilkenny in the beginning, you would simply fall into a quagmire and never get anywhere at all.</P>
    <P>Therefore we decided that we should start on Clare and Sligo where the incidence was relatively low and that we would aim at clearing up these areas and ridding them altogether with a view to declaring them accredited areas.  At the same time, we did tackle one area in the vicinity of Bansha which was the very centre of the area of high infection.  I think the Bansha area was too small to make it an administrative business to clear up tuberculosis and though we made very good initial progress in the area, we very quickly slipped back.  But the progress so far as I know in Clare and Sligo was encouraging, especially in Sligo.  Then we decided that we would have to think of a larger area, if we were to arrive, at any reasonably early date, at an accredited area of reasonable dimensions where we would have a reasonable prospect of maintaining freedom from tuberculosis. With this end in view, the decision was taken to embark on the campaign of clearing up the whole area west of the Shannon and using the Shannon River as a kind of natural barrier against the reintroduction of the disease.  In <Col N="248" /> 1954, we started in Sligo and in Clare. This is 1960 and we still have no area in the country which can be described as accredited or, as it will be under the new Bill, attested, and I think the time has come when the Minister should tell us why.</P>
    <P>Is it through some default on the part of the farmers, or through some default on the part of his establishment, or is it due to some default on the part of the profession?  I have heard a great many complaints that the incomes of veterinary surgeons under the scheme have been very high. I think those complaints are entirely misconceived.  I think the desire of the Minister for Agriculture is to see the income of veterinary surgeons increasing very much because that in itself is evidence that the job is being done.</P>
    <P>It would have been quite easy for the veterinary profession to lie down on the job and to stretch out this business interminably in the confident anticipation that they would enjoy a yearly income from it which would be comfortable and adequate, but that would have been the very reverse of what any reasonable Minister for Agriculture would desire.  It is far better from the point of view of the Minister for Agriculture that the veterinary surgeon by employing a well-organised body of support should earn the highest possible income as a result of superior diligence in carrying out the necessary testing in his area.</P>
    <P>Is there any lack of intelligence on the part of the veterinary surgeons? How can it be that after six years from the time you started counties Clare and Sligo that were so low when we started...</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Clare was not low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in the medium range.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It was from 22 to 24 or 25 per cent. for cows and that is not low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much lower than the bad areas where it is 40 or 50. We thought 8 per cent. low, 20 to 25 medium and up to 40 per cent. bad. Look at county Sligo.  When we began, the situation there was something in <Col N="249" /> the order of 8 per cent.  When are we going to be in a position to say that Sligo and the surrounding area is an attested or accredited area or do we have to wait until the whole area west of the Shannon has been completed? I do not think the Minister can charge me with being unreasonably critical in the past three years but I feel that there is cause for anxiety that progress is not being achieved at the rate we were entitled to expect.</P>
      <P>I think that may be mainly due to some failure on the part of the Department in its public relations.  I do not underestimate the difficulty of communicating clearly to farmers and their employees all the requirements to which they must conform if they are to do their best to contribute to the success of the scheme and I think the Minister will remember me asking him on more than one occasion if he would state clearly and precisely what he wanted the farmers to do.  There was a circular sent out setting out three or four matters which the Minister wanted the farmers to do.  One was to get his cattle tested; the second was to buy no beast in a fair that had not got a green tag; and the third was not to bring his purchased animal into a herd already tested without having it tested afresh.</P>
      <P>I have done my best to follow these instructions.  My recollection is that I had one test; then I had a second test; and then I was inclined to ask: &ldquo;Where do we go from here?&rdquo; All the cattle had green tags on their ears. There was some talk of using blue cards but we never seemed to have reached that stage.  If that is my position, and I think I am doing my best to understand what is required of me, is there not some failure of public relations that it cannot be stated more precisely and more clearly what the next developments are to be?  I think nothing is more inimical to the successful issue of all our efforts than a situation where a considerable body of farmers do not know the next step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder how many Deputies could state clearly what is required of farmers west of the Shannon so that they might co-operate 100 per cent. <Col N="250" /> with the bovine tuberculosis scheme and, given that 100 per cent. co-operation, what are the prospects of their benefiting from the results?  I am bound to confess that I do not know the answers to those two questions myself.  I have no clear picture of what more I can do to help in the work of bovine tuberculosis eradication and I have no clear picture of what explicit benefit is to accrue to us in the clearance areas west of the Shannon, if everybody gives 100 per cent. co-operation. In so far as these facts are true, I am disappointed in the administration of this scheme by the Department of Agriculture and I say that with profound reluctance.</P>
    <P>I understand that in certain counties a number of farms have become attested.  I cannot vouch for these facts, but they were cited to me.  One man had his farm attested and that put him in the position that he was entitled to sell cattle off his farm to an English buyer and, provided they were transported from this country to Great Britain in a properly decontaminated conveyance, they could go straight into an attested area in Britain.  This man tells me that he sold some 20 beasts which conformed to all the requirements and that he applied to C.I.E. who provided the necessary transport to carry the cattle to the port of embarkation.</P>
    <P>But he learned after consultation with the Department of Agriculture that there was no suitable shipping transport from the port of Dublin and that the only place from which the cattle could be shipped was from the port of Belfast.  He then took transport for his cattle from his farm in the midlands to Belfast and, I think, the charge was of the order of £3 per head.  The lorries arrived late and the cattle were loaded, but when they got to the frontier post, or rather to Dundalk, it was discovered that they were late to comply with the frontier formalities.</P>
    <P>He finally got a telephone message from the driver of the lorry to say that they were stuck in Dundalk.  The cattle had been 12 or 14 hours on the journey without water, the frontier authorities would not let them go on <Col N="251" /> and what were they to do?  He told them that the best thing to do was to water the cattle and bring them back, which they did.  I am not blaming the Department of Agriculture for that &ldquo;cuffuffle,&rdquo; but nothing is better calculated to hinder the development of acredited farms than an experience of that kind.  I am firmly convinced that one experience of that kind is more talked of than the safe dispatch and delivery of ten times the number of cattle affected by this incident.</P>
    <P>If we are to proceed with the accreditation of individual farms throughout the country, it does seem to me a matter of urgent concern that facilities should be available for a farmer with certainty and safety to get his cattle delivered into Great Britain. Otherwise, the whole process of accreditation will become simply a matter of expense and annoyance to the farmer, with no approximate hope of a certain profit as a result of his exertions.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister categorically: (1) Is he in a position to state what does he want us west of the Shannon to do better to help; (2) is there any immediate prospect of that area becoming what will hereafter be known as an attested area; (3) if there is, what procedure has he in mind to provide suitable transport facilities for cattle from that area, which will enable them to proceed into attested areas in Great Britain; (4) will he tell us what is the precise significance of the green tag and for those of us who have attained that status for all the cattle on our farms where do we go from there; (5) can he tell us if we go to a fair and buy six cattle, all of them with green tags, what does the presence of the green tag in their ear mean?  I have been told that people have bought, say, ten cattle with green tags and, to put it mildly, when they had these cattle tested on arrival home not all of them were found to be non-reactors.</P>
    <P>The sixth question is&mdash;I think I should mention this because I think the &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; know it, and it is <Col N="252" /> better that the problem should be faced than that it should be protected by discreet silence&mdash;is it true that if you want to frustrate the test, and deceive the veterinary profession, one way of doing it is to get your cattle injected with the tuberculin reagent, and then notify the veterinary surgeon to come and make a test within a month of that injection, in the certainty that cattle who have received the first injection will not react if tested during the month after receiving the injection? If that is so, how are we to arrive at a reliable conclusion at any stage that the cattle which are not reacting are, in fact, free from any tubercular infection?</P>
    <P>Those are specific questions which I address to the Minister.  Perhaps the most urgent and vital question is one he may find hard to answer, yet it should be asked.  We have now delineated the area west of the Shannon which I understand consists of Donegal, Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway, Clare&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And Leitrim.  Can the Minister with any degree of certainty forecast when that area will be an attested area as defined in this new Bill; (2) if he finds himself unable to do so, will he give an authoritative statement when he is closing on this Bill, as to what degree of co-operation on the part of the farmers he feels to be lacking, and what is it that farmers who want to co-operate should do that they are not now doing; (3) can he say with any degree of certainty if we do attain to attested status in that area, are there any cut and dried plans to provide effective transport facilities to open the British market to us for attested stock which the Department will undertake to protect from the kind of incident I have described to him in the case of the man who had to ship his cattle from the midlands to Great Britain via Belfast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having raised this question, I do not want to conclude without assuring the Minister again that we on this side of the House are prepared to give him every assistance that it is in our power to afford.  We accept the fact that <Col N="253" /> once Great Britain adopted the programme of eradication of bovine T.B., there was no action open to our Minister for Agriculture but to follow suit, and to seek to achieve attested status for the whole country at the earliest possible date.  I should add that I am obliged to tell him, in my judgment he may lack some co-operation that would be available to him if he could make it clearer to the people exactly what he wants.</P>
    <P>Now that disposes of the area west of the Shannon.  Let us suppose the Minister is in a position to give us a reassuring reply in regard to that area. What news has he for us of the area broadly contained in Waterford, Kilkenny, Cork, Tipperary, Limerick and Kerry?  I hear disquieting reports from those areas.  I hear it is suggested that in certain areas the farmers are not co-operating and are beginning to lose faith in the whole programme.  That would be a deplorable development.  I wish I heard, as opposed to those kind of rumours, some indication from the Minister or anyone else that specific tangible progress is being made.  I am sorry I do not think it is.  However, I do not want to paint a gloomier picture than the facts justify.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to concede at once that I have not at my disposal the information requisite to form a reliable judgment.  I do not want anything I say here to be taken as an informed opinion that there has been any breakdown of the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme in the Munster counties.  I have no doubt whatever that I am right in calling on the Minister to give the House and the country some reliable information on the situation. I do not know what it is.  I very much doubt if any Deputy representative of rural interests knows what it is It is a matter of considerable urgency that they be fully informed.</P>
    <P>I do not know the merits of the arguments which induced the Minister for Agriculture to adopt Deputy Corry's scheme for the purchase of reactors in certain southern counties. When I inaugurated the scheme, I accepted the liability of the Minister for Agriculture to face the job of <Col N="254" /> taking over reactors, paying fair compensation and disposing of them to the best advantage.  That scheme was maintained by the late Senator Moylan and, I think, by the present Minister until he was urged by, I believe, Deputy Corry and a few more in that area to offer an alternative scheme whereunder he would give a grant of £15 in respect of each reactor sold by the farmer to a canning factory.</P>
    <P>I think those who propounded that scheme to the Minister thought they would make a fortune out of it.  The scheme is not worth it and is giving rise to a great deal of dissatisfaction. It may be the reason many farmers in those areas fail to collaborate as energetically in this task as the Minister would be entitled to expect them to collaborate.  Would I be far wrong in suggesting that this scheme has been tried long enough?  If it has not worked, it ought to be wound up and the Minister should proceed on the original basis in these areas as he has in other areas.</P>
    <P>The scheme whereunder the Minister accepted responsibility for buying reactors has resulted in the farmers being paid on a liberal basis.  I have not heard any substantiated complaint from a farmer that he has been unreasonably treated by the Department of Agriculture where he has sought to eliminate reactors from his herd.  Let us be frank.  I have heard that neighbours have suggested that farmers have been paid too much.  If there is a fault in that direction, I believe successive Ministers for Agriculture have deliberately desired to err in that direction rather than the other&mdash; certainly I did.  The structure of the scheme I left after me made it almost inevitable for my successors to err in the same direction, if error there was to be.</P>
    <P>In the past 18 months, there has been a very substantial decline in the market value of store cattle.  It is probable that the valuers acting for the Minister for Agriculture have not been following that change in values too rigorously.  In so far as they have erred, I think the Minister has been correct.  To attempt to err in the other direction would have made the implementation <Col N="255" /> of the scheme impossible. In any case, if a small farmer, particularly, is trying to collaborate with the Minister and to eliminate all the reactors in his herd and gets something a little over and above the bare market value of the cattle he eliminates, it is no more than a help to meet the dislocation and loss that enthusiastic co-operation with the Minister must inevitably involve.</P>
    <P>Despite the queries that have been raised as to the valuations put upon cattle by the Department of Agriculture, I believe the straight scheme of the Minister's agents purchasing the cattle and subsequently disposing of them either to the canner or to the feeder is a more flexible and satisfactory arrangement from the point of view of the Department of Agriculture, the Treasury and the farmers.</P>
    <P>If that view is correct, I suggest the Minister ought to face the annoyance of winding up the £15 per head arrangement, to say it has not proved a success and that he prefers a uniform procedure which I believe would most expeditiously produce the result we require.  There is a real danger of livestock disease eradication becoming an international problem.  Our Government ought to consider approaching the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations or some similar international body to query this whole matter and to see that responsible Departments of Agriculture throughout the world will make up their mind as to what limits should be put to what otherwise would become an extremely disastrous snowball move. ment which in the end could easily result in a virtual complete disruption of the international livestock trade.</P>
    <P>There is no country in the world to which the international trade in livestock is more vitally important than it is to us.  The Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme has already presented very serious difficulties and involved this country in very heavy financial loss.  I do not want to see that reproduced <i>ad infinitum.</i>  It is time that responsible authorities in the various countries associated with the United Nations considered this problem. <Col N="256" /> It has truly been said by wise statesmen in the past that war is too important a business to be left to Generals. It might be said with a certain amount of justification that the whole question of livestock disease is too important to be left to the veterinary surgeons. Generals have their place in the successful prosecution of war: veterinary surgeons have their place in the proper control of animal diseases; but the generals should not be encouraged to arrogate to themselves the functions of determining overriding policy nor should the veterinary profession be persuaded by themselves or by others to undertake responsibilities of that character which they are not really equipped to perform.</P>
    <P>Subject to those comments, we do not propose to oppose this Bill and we avail of the occasion to assure the Minister of our earnest desire to help in any way we can in the completion of the task which he has undertaken in the eradication of bovine T.B.  But to those good wishes and assurances of support we feel it right to add that we want more information and we believe the country wants it also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can read the intention of the Minister in this Bill, it is aimed at centralising completely the control of the eradication of disease.  It seems that there is some argument in favour of that, but I want to add my word of warning to what Deputy Dillon has said.  He stressed the fact that we are possibly facing a sort of international school of thought on diseases of animals generally and that it may ultimately have a snowball effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with the eradication of bovine T.B.&mdash;which is a subject in which every rural Deputy is particularly interested&mdash;I want to ask the Minister does he envisage in presentday world agricultural conditions and with the numerous international organisations we have dealing with that subject, a general attempt to clean up and eradicate entirely from livestock all forms of disease?  If that is the case, it seems that we shall be faced here with the question of fluke.  In all the reports prepared by the committees set up by the Minister to consider <Col N="257" /> marketing of livestock, it was brought out that one of the things that militated against us in export was the presence of fluke.  Are we to find ourselves facing an international situation in regard to animal diseases in which fluke may play as prominent a part as bovine T.B.?</P>
    <P>We have a record which no other country has with regard to entire freedom from foot and mouth disease: we have taken precautions which no other country has taken and we have managed to maintain our position.  As a result, we are in the position that we can export livestock on the hoof into other countries and they are absolutely satisfied they can take them in without putting the stock into quarantine for the period necessary in the case of stock from other countries.</P>
    <P>What will be our position in regard to livestock diseases?  Are we to have recurring every year a sort of international school of thought and all countries coming together and saying: &ldquo;We must eradicate such and such disease&rdquo;?  I admit that there has been an active attack on bovine T.B. in several countries over an extended period but I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that we are spending vast sums of money, have spent and will continue to spend them in future and, as Deputy Dillon very properly asked, are we getting value for that money?  By introducing this Bill, in which the Minister changes the term &ldquo;accredited&rdquo; to &ldquo;attested&rdquo; will we achieve anything as regards marketing our stock and in the eyes of the world, if it is necessary to prove that we are attested?</P>
    <P>That brings me to the attested area or, as it was known up to this, the accredited area west of the Shannon.  I intervene in this debate for the express purpose of trying to make clear to the Minister and his officials that, in my opinion, everything is not going according to plan.  We can only judge things as we see them in our own counties. A question that is posed to me at least once a week in my constituency in Wexford concerns the high incidence of reactors.  Quite recently&mdash;in the past few weeks&mdash;three or four people <Col N="258" /> came to me and told me they had had their herds tested.  These are people who supply milk and live by the sale of it, whether in liquid form to the creameries or to the cheese factory which we will have in that constituency.  One man told me that he had a herd of 18 cattle.  Of those, 14 went down, two were doubtful and that left very few that were right.  He wanted to know what to do&mdash;would he trade them in?  I admit that the price the Department is offering is generous but what he really wanted was to achieve continuity in his trade. He wanted to be able to sell milk as heretofore, to be able to employ the people he was employing heretofore, and carry on his husbandry.  He wanted to know where he could get replacements.  I should like the Minister, when he is replying to the debate, to answer that question.</P>
    <P>We are told that very rapid progress has been made in the area west of the Shannon, that there are attested herds practically everywhere and that the area is almost free of bovine tuberculosis. I have not been able in my capacity as a public representative to advise people to buy cattle west of the Shannon and I shall tell the House why.  It is because I know of several cases where people sold their herds and bought cattle in this area and the majority of them went down when tested.  They went out again and bought so-called attested cattle and brought them back and again they went down.  I know of two specific instances where people bought attested cattle every one of which went down when tested.</P>
    <P>I am not attributing any blame for that to the Minister or his officials.  The point I want to make is that if farmers in Leinster, Munster and other counties outside the clearance area are to follow the official advice they are getting from the Government and the Department of Agriculture to eradicate tuberculosis in their herds they want to be sure of replacements.  From the instances I have known I would say that as high a figure as 60 per cent. of the replacements have been reactors.  That poses the question, is there something wrong?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> I do not think the blame rests with the veterinary profession.  In that connection I am referring to the official scheme conducted by the Department of Agriculture.  The officials directly responsible for that would be the veterinary surgeons employed by the Department.  I do not think that the veterinary surgeons are to blame because I do not think the Department has sufficient personnel to conduct the scheme.  I do not know what the number is but I do know that up to a few months ago they had nothing like sufficient staff to superintend a scheme. In such a big scheme there must be official supervision of the tests carried out.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise this matter is that as I read the Bill the Minister's idea is to bring the scheme up from local level to central control.  It might be necessary to do that because it is a big scheme, a national scheme, in which there is a lot of money involved and because there might be undue hardship imposed in certain areas as against others but decentralisation is necessary for efficiency in connection with any matter concerned with agricultural life.</P>
    <P>The Minister must give this matter due consideration.  In this Bill he is removing the responsibilities of the committees of agriculture, who have played their part in Irish agricultural life, and is bringing the matter under the direct control of the Department. Therefore, he must be able to assure the House that he can give the proper supervision at local level.  That is where the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme has fallen down.  The mere introduction of a Bill substituting the word &ldquo;attested&rdquo; for &ldquo;accredited&rdquo; will not achieve the objective.</P>
    <P>There is considerable anxiety among the rural community.  I do not know if the Minister appreciates that but, speaking for my own constituency, I can assure him that that is the case and I have no doubt that other Deputies from rural areas could confirm that there is considerable anxiety and confusion.</P>
    <P>I know people who did everything that it was possible for them to do to have accredited herds.  They bought <Col N="260" /> cattle in the so-called attested area; they bought attested cattle; they bought cattle at attested sales.  The cattle proved to be reactors.  That proves that there is something wrong with the scheme.  There is no use in spending huge sums of money unless we get a return for it.  Admittedly, if we wish to conserve our store cattle trade there is no alternative to attestation. There is no use in continuing on the present lines unless the Minister can assure the House that what has been said is wrong.  There is no use in his merely saying it is wrong.  He must give facts.  He must tell us how many attested herds there are in the country.  He must tell us why cattle that came from the area west of the Shannon and the other attested areas failed to pass the test.</P>
    <P>If he does that he may be able to restore confidence in a scheme which I regret to have to say has been badly administered so far, due to lack of sufficient qualified personnel, due perhaps to having too many people instead of a small expert committee in the Department directed by professional experts to see that the work is properly done.  By having such an expert committee the Minister would be doing greater service to the people and to the taxpayer who, in the final analysis, are paying the money to enable us to maintain the store cattle trade which is so vital to our economic life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody who reads this Bill and who considers the whole problem of bovine tuberculosis that arises under it can be altogether happy about the situation. Before dealing with that matter I want to refer to the estimate that the Minister has given of cost in relation to the Diseases of Animals Act itself.  The Minister is aware that I was here all the afternoon on the Finance Bill and that, therefore, if I was to sustain body and soul, I had not the opportunity of listening to him personally.  However, I am grateful to him for his courtesy in circulating a copy of his speech and I assume that he did not add anything to the script that adverts to the problems that I wish to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> In relation to the Fund, the Minister has said the Bill makes provision for keeping the Fund open until 31st March, 1963, and for replenishing it in the meantime to pay outstanding claims.  He has told us that at the present time the Fund is in debt as there are arrears to be met, but it appears that four assessments of a halfpenny each would be sufficient to pay outstanding demands on the Fund and to keep it going until it is wound up.  He then goes on to refer to a maximum of fourpence in the £ and this is what I want to query: &ldquo;the assessments made up to 31st March, 1963, should not exceed twopence.&rdquo; Does he mean that twopence to be the total of four halfpence or does he mean that it might reach to the sum of twopence in the £ in the last financial year mentioned, that is to say, 1962-63 to which he has referred?</P>
    <P>I am always rather suspicious about estimates that Ministers make of what payments are likely to arise for local authorities.  I am always rather suspicious when Ministers of any Government, but particularly of this Government for the reason I shall mention in a moment, make any estimates of what the local authorities are likely to meet.  Whenever I hear an estimate of that sort I cannot help throwing my mind back to the time when the present Minister for Finance was Minister for Health and introduced what is now the Health Act.  I cannot help remembering the unequivocal assurances he gave at that time that, so far as it was humanly possible for him and the officers of his Department to make any estimate of cost, the costs of the administration of the Health Act were not likely under any circumstances whatsoever to exceed 2/- in the £.  It was not merely the cost of the increased health services but the total cost of all health services, he said, were not likely to reach more than 2/-.  However, let me give him the benefit of the doubt; he said at that time that the costs for local authorities were not likely to reach 2/- in the £.  We all know what the Health Act charges cost us now. They have gone away beyond 2/-; in fact I think they have gone to about <Col N="262" /> 18/- in the £, nine times what the Minister estimated.</P>
    <P>Admittedly the Minister for Agriculture has pitched his sights a good deal lower but, still bearing in mind that previous example that I have in front of me, I am wondering whether the estimating of this Minister will be any more accurate than that of the then Minister for Health in relation to the Health Act.  Time will tell in this case as it did in that one.  I hope this Minister is correct and that we will not see in this case as we did in the other what one might term a surcharge skying up the estimate.  So much for the Fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister passed over very lightly the change made in this Bill of the wording in relation to those herds that have successfully eradicated bovine tuberculosis.  I do not think any of us will quarrel with the actual change in the word but I agree completely with Deputy Esmonde that we want something considerably more than a change in the word.  The success or failure of the bovine eradication scheme means not merely success or failure in maintaining our store cattle export trade but it means success or failure in our being able to keep our economy as a viable economy.</P>
    <P>If we fail to maintain our store cattle trade, then it does not matter what we do in relation to industrialisation or anything else.  Our standard of living will go down seriously and substantially.  It does not matter to us whether it is wise for the British to go in for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  The fact is when they have eradicated it, if we are to keep our store trade, if we need to keep our store trade, and we do, we must follow suit.</P>
    <P>I have heard some people argue that it is unnecessary and undesirable to proceed with the eradication of bovine T.B. for several reasons.  They are wrong but it is as well that some of their reasons should be mentioned so as to be exposed.  I have heard doctors suggest that all of us have some immunisation from tuberculosis by reason of having contracted tuberculosis to a greater or lesser degree at <Col N="263" /> some time in our lives.  Perhaps that contraction arose from meat that we may have eaten; in the vast majority of cases it is not sufficient to do any harm but it does act as an immuniser. They have suggested that, in that respect, the vast advances made in medical science in dealing with it, the successful efforts that have been achieved here in overcoming human T.B. make it unnecessary for us to do this.  They have even gone so far as to say that as bovine T.B. is completely eradicated it may mean that the people in these islands will be more susceptible to the human disease because we shall not have acquired the immunisation we would get otherwise. I am not a doctor and not competent to offer any opinion but if that is so, it is surely something that is easily met by medical science in the same way as the medical profession has already met and combated the disease itself.</P>
    <P>In pressing ahead with the eradication of bovine tuberculosis the first essential&mdash;I think that, though the Minister and I may not agree on many subjects, he will agree with me on this &mdash;is to get the right psychological approach on the part of the people as a whole.  No scheme of this nature can possibly hope to succeed unless the people concerned&mdash;the farmers&mdash; are seriously and absolutely persuaded of the vital necessity for the success of the scheme.  The mere change suggested in this Bill is not sufficient to ensure that and I suggest that the Bill should have provided considerably more than it does.</P>
    <P>I came across a case the other day which shows the difficulties in the way, difficulties which can be overcome. As far as I can understand the position&mdash;if I have misunderstood it I am sure the Minister will be very quick to contradict me&mdash;if a herd owner at present takes his herd through the fourteen-day test and forthwith removes any that are doubtful or are reactors, and then goes on to keep them for the next 60 days for the next test, approaching thereby in the direction of having an attested herd within the meaning of this Bill, and if, <Col N="264" /> on the second test, in which, let us say, 50 cattle are involved, he finds he has one reactor and one doubtful, he then has 48 that have passed.  He removes forthwith the doubtful beast and the reactor.  If his cattle are coming to the stage at that point at which they are fit for sale and, if kept, will either go back or become too heavy, he is unable to sell the remaining 48 as 14-day tested cattle.</P>

      <P>As I said, when a herd owner is on his journey to become attested now, instead of accredited, when he has had his first 14-day test and has removed the reactors or doubtful animals, he waits 60 days.  It is at the end of that he has the second test and again removes doubtful animals or reactors.  If the remainder of his herd at that stage are getting over-heavy, or ready for sale and he desires to sell them, because the Minister has made no order in relation thereto, he cannot sell them as 14-day tested cattle.  When he was altering the scheme, the Minister should have clearly brought in a regulation by virtue of which that could be done.  In the present situation, I understand it can be done only by an <i>ex post facto</i> breach of the order&mdash;the tagging could only be done by a veterinary surgeon after the testing had been completed. I do not know why the Minister did not include such a provision <Col N="267" /> in Section 5, and in fact I am not certain he could not have covered it already by another Order.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that is certainly one of the examples which shows it is quite useless merely changing nomenclature if, at the same time, you are building up grievances.  As I said already, if you build up a grievance in relation to a scheme, you will not get it through. You must depend on goodwill and co-operation all around, but let me say that to the extent to which this change introduces something that will get a measure of more ready co-operation from the farming community, the Bill is welcome and the Minister is to be commended on it.  However, it is not merely enough to do that.  The Minister must do more than that.  He must try to ensure that the reasons, the purposes and the objectives will be readily understood by the people in order to induce them to have their herds become attested and that they will understand why there should be a change from &ldquo;accredited&rdquo; to &ldquo;attested&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not think that enough people realise the absolute necessity for this if the whole national economy is to survive and I was surprised that when introducing the Bill the Minister did not give us better particulars as to what was likely to eventuate from the scheme in the near future.  I am not suggesting that he should have gone into the entire history of the matter but he has said that he agrees it is absolutely necessary to ensure that no obstacle is placed in the way of our cattle export trade.  I should have liked him to develop that phrase still further, to make it clear what other obstacles he thought existed, and generally why he felt people were not taking as full advantage of the scheme as they should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By bringing in a Bill with just a change in nomenclature, the Minister makes the implication that he considers there is no other change necessary in the scheme and the purpose of discussion on Second Reading is to indicate whether the House considers the Minister is right in dealing only with the matters that are included in the Bill. There is the clear implication in the Minister's introductory statement that <Col N="268" /> the only thing worrying him in relation to the scheme as a whole is a change of nomenclature, and I do not think the people in the country accept that that is the situation.  I have heard a great deal of argument to the contrary and it cuts right across political thought.  The argument does not follow political party lines at all.  Some of the Minister's supporters say the scheme is breaking down and I have heard some of my supporters arguing that it is not.  It is not a question of political thought at all, but all of them agree that there is a necessity to do something more to tighten it up than merely changing &ldquo;accredited&rdquo; to &ldquo;attested&rdquo;. In so far as the Minister has implied that that is all he considers is necessary, I do not think he is fulfilling his duties in relation to the scheme.</P>

      <P>Other thoughts occur to one, as they did to me to-night.  I said to myself: &ldquo;The local elections are on to-morrow and the Vote for the Department of Local Government is to be taken.  Perhaps it might be a good idea for them that the Minister's speech should not be heard to-night&rdquo;.  A further thought occurred <Col N="269" /> to my mind that perhaps the shadow Minister might not be present to take up the running after the Minister had made his speech.  These later thoughts were more favourable to the Opposition than the one that originally occurred to me.</P>

      <P>I should like to have mercy thrust upon me but I am not the sort of fellow to seek it.  Once when I was Chief Whip, a member of our Party who was a great disciplinarian, the late Alderman Tom Kelly, came to me and said: &ldquo;Can I leave the House?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;You cannot, Tom.  You must stay here because there is likely to be a division.&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;I have taken the shilling anyhow and I suppose I must do the work.&rdquo; So it is with Ministers &mdash;they cannot look for mercy if it is not extended to them.</P>
      <P>I have been seeking to cover a very wide field, one that I had not intended to cover in dealing with this very simple measure.  However, I would not mind doing so even if I am unprepared, but I am not following that line because for the past few days, I have been preparing my Estimate speech, a very long, dryish kind of speech, as are all Estimate speeches dealing with these matters.  I would not like to deny myself the opportunity of making that speech, which I have spent so much time preparing with the assistance of my officials and for that reason, I shall confine myself to what is in this little measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I want to assure the House that when it was first suggested to me that we might abolish this Diseases of Animals Fund, I was quite critical of <Col N="270" /> the proposal until I was completely satisfied that, by doing so, we would not be imposing any further burden upon the local authorities or the rate-payers at large.  Having satisfied myself in that regard, I had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that it was wasteful and cumbersome to maintain a Fund such as this, made up almost entirely of the rates struck from time to time at the request of the Minister under the different Acts since the Act of 1878 under which this Fund was established.</P>
    <P>I went into the figures during all that period, saw the contributions made to the Fund by the different local authorities and saw the various amounts paid out of the Fund to these same local authorities.  I admit that when the Fund was set up in 1878, the picture was entirely different because then the schedule of diseases for which the local authorities were responsible was much more formidable. However, that is no longer the case.  There is no question of adding to or subtracting from the list of diseases for which the local authorities are responsible.  That being so, I was satisfied that the best course was to wind up the Fund and transfer whatever responsibility remained for the payment of part-time veterinary inspectors, in some cases part-time sheep-dipping officers and the responsibility for the administration of the sheep-dipping Order.  There was no point in maintaining such a Fund because of its cumbersome nature and the waste that must arise from it.</P>
    <P>These very limited responsibilities were discharged from the rates, and I doubt if they were discharged very effectively.  I have a suspicion that the Sheep-dipping Order was not very effectively operated.  It has been suggested to me that in some counties the return of the number of sheep dipped fell far short of the total numbers of sheep in the counties concerned.  I have often thought in regard to these part-time services for which local bodies pay fairly substantial sums that the people they are designed to benefit do not benefit to the extent to which they are entitled.  Indeed, it is a matter I should like to pursue further to ensure <Col N="271" /> that the work done by those appointed will be effectively carried out.</P>
    <P>I come now to the proposal in this measure to change the term &ldquo;accredited&rdquo; to &ldquo;attested&rdquo;, which gave Deputies opposite a right to wander.  I shall not suggest that any member of the House was out of order at any time.  This is only a slight change, but it is a fairly important change.  However, Deputies opposite who may have been a bit &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;, if I may use the term, to find material to keep things going over the required period were, perhaps, given an opportunity because of the fact that I was in any way tampering with the Bovine T.B. Eradication Scheme under the 1957 Act.  I and, I think, my predecessor, have been urging this change.  It should be a very simple matter to change the word &ldquo;accredited' to &ldquo;attested.&rdquo; I do not know how the term &ldquo;accredited&rdquo; came to be chosen in the first place.  I feel I would have been very hesitant myself in accepting that word, having regard to the fact that the word &ldquo;attested&rdquo; was applied in Britain.  Although both words mean the same thing, our choice of the word &ldquo;accredited&rdquo; was bound to create a good deal of confusion without serving any purpose whatever.  People in the trade who have more experience than I have have been urging us to make that change and it is in response to all these requests that we took advantage of this occasion to effect it.</P>
    <P>I want again to assure the House that I have no desire whatever to refuse to cover the whole field, but it is only a matter of waiting for a couple of days.  Why should I deprive myself of the opportunity of delivering the long, dry speech I have been preparing? Why should I deprive myself of all the publicity and all the opportunity I shall have of replying to all I shall hear?  Even if Deputy Dillon has to say again what he said this evening, we all repeat ourselves and it will not do a bit of harm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,166,890 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing and Miscellaneous Grants.</P>
      <P>The total Vote for my Department for the year 1960-61 is £5,131,890.  As it appears in the Book of Estimates, it shows an increase of £651,400 on the Vote for the previous financial year but Deputies will recall that a Supplementary Estimate of £195,000 for grants under the Housing Acts was passed towards the close of that year. The net increase of this Estimate over that of last year is, therefore, £456,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief increases are £215,000 in the provision for contributions towards housing loan charges of local authorities; £395,000 in the provision for grants to private persons etc., for the purchase, erection, reconstruction and improvement of dwelling houses; and <Col N="274" /> £41,000 in the provision for contributions towards loan charges of sanitary authorities.</P>
    <P>The cumulative increase in the provision of grants for private persons' housing is now £795,000 in excess of the corresponding provision made before the passing of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1958.  This reflects the continuing stimulus which housing activity is receiving from the increased grants and the widened scope of their application in respect of repair, improvement and sanitation works, as well as the loan facilities for such works, for which the Act of 1958 made provision.</P>
    <P>The erection of new houses by private enterprise has also increased to quite an exceptional degree.  These increases are reflected in the figures for 1959/60 in respect of both grants allocated and grants paid under every head of erection and reconstruction. The numbers of grants approved showed increases as compared with the previous year of 52.3 per cent.  for new houses, 42.9 per cent.  for reconstruction, repair or improvement of houses and 57.2 per cent.  for water and sewerage grants, while the numbers of grants finally paid showed increases of 21.5 per cent. for new houses, 20.4 per cent. for reconstruction, etc., and 23.4 per cent. for water supply and sewerage facilities.</P>
    <P>There is very considerable scope for works for the conservation or improvement of existing houses, including the provision of piped water supplies and sewerage facilities for rural houses.  In this latter type of work, there is a growing tendency towards co-operation by groups of persons in the provision of private water supply schemes in outlying rural areas.  I have written and spoken in favour of this development, particularly in areas which would not normally be served by public supplies, and I have found that the people concerned are quick to appreciate that co-operative effort can be a solution to their problem in relation to water supply.  I am continuing the drive for expansion of these operations and I have sought the co-operation of sanitary authorities in examining the proposals and supervising <Col N="275" /> their maintenance so as to ensure that they will work satisfactorily and that they can be assimilated in due course into any public water supply systems that may be provided for the areas in question.</P>
    <P>Apart from the continuance for another two years by the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1960, of the general grant facilities as extended by the Act of 1958, it has been found possible to modify certain administrative restrictions governing the allocation of second or further reconstruction or improvement grants where works of this nature become urgently necessary. Payment of a second or further grant in respect of the same house has been subject to a restriction as to a period, usually 15 years, that must elapse between the completion of one job and the commencement of another.  I found that rigid application of this restriction was giving rise to hardships where it had become essential to carry out further work before the expiration of the 15 year period.  In order to alleviate such hardships, limited grants are now available for some of the more urgent works which are likely to arise. Such works can be classified as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P> 1.  Provision of extra bedrooms to relieve permanent overcrowding. There may be a waiting period of 5 years between the two works and the grants are subject to a maximum of £50 per essential room.  An extension to the floor area of the house must be involved.</P>
    <P>2.  Provision of bathrooms by way of extension to floor area.  There may be a waiting period of up to 5 years between the two works and the grants are subject to a maximum of £50.  The bathroom must be fitted out as such.</P>
    <P>3.  Other works (other than maintenance works) which are certified to be urgently necessary to conserve the house and to be necessary because of damage caused by fire, wind, rain, flooding or other cause outside the applicant's control. </P>
    <P>These grants are made available under Section 12 of the Housing (Amendment) <Col N="276" /> Act, 1954, and are of course subject to the other qualifications for such grants.</P>
    <P>In the light of the diminishing volume of housing needs requiring to be met by local authorities, it might be anticipated that progress under this head would have shown a decline but, on the contrary, in the year ended 31st March last, the housing authorities completed 2,070 dwellings as compared with 1,812 in the preceding financial year.  In addition 342 houses were acquired and reconstructed by Waterford Corporation in that period</P>
    <P>Estimates submitted by housing authorities indicate that they expect to commence work on over 3,000 dwellings in the current financial year. While such estimates may be subject to revision in the light of actual progress being made in the course of the year, these figures reveal a further substantial increase in the size of the local authority housing programme.  It is one of my chief concerns to ensure that this projected housing is directed to its best social and economic purpose by relieving genuine housing need as represented particularly by those families living in the remaining pockets of unfit houses which still exist in various areas.</P>
    <P>In a recent circular letter to housing authorities I reminded them that the stage now appears to have been reached in most areas where the remaining housing problems require to be dealt with by way of an intimate examination of these problems by officers of the housing authorities in consultation, where appropriate, with officers of my Department.  I suggested that such examination should extend to the numbers of unfit houses still remaining and the works necessary to render fit any houses that can be made fit at reasonable expense. Such an examination will be expected to be made, irrespective of whether the occupants have applied for rehousing or not.  I also suggested that owners and occupiers of repairable houses should be urged to make use of the reconstruction, repair and improvement grants available.</P>
    <P>Other activities recommended in the <Col N="277" /> letter included the organisation and supervision of co-operative housing and the provision by the housing authorities of sites for persons anxious and willing to construct houses for themselves.  I have asked housing authorities to give special examination to the question of under-occupation in local authority dwellings with a view to taking all steps practicable, where need is found to exist, to ensure that the available accommodation is used to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>The Estimate contains a provision of £386,000 for subsidy towards the annual loan repayments in respect of sanitary services works, principally water and sewerage schemes.  It shows an increase of £41,000 over the sum provided for 1959/60.</P>
    <P>In my statement on the Estimates last year, I mentioned the decline in the volume of work in progress on sanitary services schemes caused by the interruption of planning in 1956. This continued during the last financial year.  The estimated cost of schemes in progress at 31st March last was £4,228,000 as compared with £5,130,000 on 31st March, 1959.  The value of work actually executed on these schemes fell from approximately £1,400,000 in 1958/59 to £1,000,000 in 1959/60.  The planning and execution of sanitary services works generally spans a number of years, so that any curtailment of programmes produces effects which are evident over a long period.  The results of corrective action are equally slow to mature.  It is hoped, however, that the present financial year will show an upturn in the trend of expenditure on the works. My aim is to attain a level of expenditure of about three million pounds a year so as to ensure that the programme will be completed within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>In order to secure an expansion in the programme of works on these schemes, the Government decided to raise, for schemes commenced or for loans sanctioned after 18th September, 1959, the standard rates of State subsidy and to make other financial changes designed to lighten the <Col N="278" /> impact on the ratepayers of the cost of such schemes.  The new rates of Exchequer contribution to loan charges on water and sewerage schemes are 60 per cent. in Gaeltacht areas, former congested districts, and urban districts under £25,000 valuation; 50 per cent. in other areas, and 40 per cent.  in Dublin city.  These rates represent increases of from 16? per cent. to 5 per cent. in the several separate rates of subsidy formerly applicable to water supply and sewerage schemes in the various areas mentioned.  In addition, 25 per cent. capital grants are available from Roinn na Gaeltachta for schemes in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. The other financial changes are an extension of the maximum period for the repayment of loans from 30 to 50 years; the authorisation of repayment by the annuity system, instead of the instalment system, at the option of the local authority; and the inclusion of the costs of acquiring land, water rights, etc., in the capital cost of the scheme for the purpose of calculating subsidy.</P>
    <P>These financial changes will enable local authorities to go forward confidently with the planning and execution of water supply and sewerage schemes.  I am particularly concerned that attention should now be concentrated on expanding sanitary services in rural areas with a view not alone to the advancement of public health, but to raising living standards and the furtherance of agricultural efficiency, particularly in livestock production. The present position is that 88 per cent. of persons living outside towns and villages do not enjoy the benefits of a piped water supply, and the urgent need for improvement of this position is, as I mentioned when announcing the revised financial terms for water and sewerage schemes, the next objective of social policy.</P>
    <P>County councils have been asked to prepare comprehensive programmes for the extension of piped water supplies to rural areas, taking account of the need, in many areas, for reliance either wholly or partly on private piped water supplies and sewerage facilities installed with the aid of State and local <Col N="279" /> authority grants.  An essential preliminary to the adoption of such programmes is a detailed survey of the existing sanitary services position in each area, the water sources available, and the possibilities of developing these sources in the most effective way for the service of the inhabitants.  Detailed directions were issued last year on this matter.  I would urge all county councils to proceed with the completion of these surveys without delay. The work involved may call for some redeployment or augmentation of county engineering staffs as a temporary measure, and I am prepared to facilitate councils in this matter. The further planning and execution of programmes, and the proper operation and maintenance of the schemes, may require more permanent arrangements, and I would suggest that county councils may find many advantages in specialising their engineering staffs. Specialised branches of work, such as sanitary services, housing and roads, might, where that is not the case already, usefully be assigned to individual Chief Assistant or Assistant County Engineers.  The recruitment of design staff should also be considered where a substantial programme of work is foreseen, and where the existing county engineering staff offers no room for design work.</P>
    <P>There are problems connected with water utilisation, and the disposal of waste water, which call for special examination.  The demands on water resources for domestic consumption, industrial development, agriculture and inland fisheries may set up conflicts of interest in particular cases while, on the other hand, drainage operations and the disposal of sewage and trade wastes may give rise to water pollution, with prejudicial effects on domestic water supplies or fisheries.  These problems require joint consideration by a number of departments and I have, accordingly, after consultation with the other Ministers concerned, set up a committee of representatives of the Departments of Finance, Lands, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, Transport and Power, Health, and my own Department, <Col N="280" /> to consider the whole question of water utilisation, in the light of information available as to the water resources of the State.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress was made during the past year in carrying out a number of major sanitary services schemes.  The North Dublin Regional Water Supply Scheme serving districts along the Northern boundary of the city, was completed and is now in operation.  The North Dublin Drainage Scheme, serving many of the north city suburbs, is in partial operation. The Whitegate Regional Water Supply Scheme, County Cork, has been completed. It serves the oil refinery mainly but also a number of small towns and villages in the vicinity and a considerable rural area.  The South County Wexford Regional Water Supply Scheme, which was begun in 1958/59, is now about 90 per cent. completed. The Lough Mourne Water Supply Scheme, County Donegal, has been completed and serves Lifford, Raphoe, Castlefin, Convoy, Killygordon, Ballindrait Cross Roads, Porthall and neighbouring areas.  In addition it has been connected for standby purposes in cases of emergency for St. Johnston, Stranorlar and Ballybofey.  Further extensions of the scheme have been approved to serve Millsessiagh, Coneyboro, Sessiaghoneill and Carrigans and it is expected that the last named extension will be used in due course to serve the Monereagh, Tonagh, Cross, Churchtown, Castle-third and Derrymore districts.  A survey of the whole area with a view to ascertaining what other areas can be usefully served has recently been completed and is under consideration. I understand that, as a result, a number of further extensions will be proposed.</P>
    <P>During the year a number of schemes were commenced, the largest being two new contracts entered into by Kildare County Council for regional water supply schemes which will serve several areas including Johnstown, Kill and Rathangan.  Work on a main drainage scheme for Bandon, County Cork, and its vicinity oegan in January, 1960. An important water supply improvement scheme from the economic point of view was commenced during the <Col N="281" /> year in order to improve the supply to the Centre Park Road Industrial Area, Cork, and is half-way to completion.</P>
    <P>The fire service continues to improve generally.  I should like to congratulate the Limerick City and neighbouring Fire Brigades, including the Cork City Brigade, on the efficiency and promptness with which they dealt with the very large fire which occurred last year in Todd and Co's premises.  Apart from the fire fighting skill displayed, the occasion was a heartening demonstration of inter-brigade co-operation.</P>
    <P>The taking of preventive action is an important aspect of the fire service. I have recently set up an expert committee to revise the Fire Protection Standards for certain buildings which were drawn up some twelve years ago and which now require to be reviewed and revised where necessary in the light of experience.  The committee is made up of representatives of my Department, the Departments of Health, Education and defence, the Office of public Works, and local authority fire officers.</P>
    <P>I have been giving a good deal of thought to open spaces in new building estates which are left in an unsightly and neglected state.  The present situation cannot be allowed to continue. There are two problems, first, to ensure that the developer leaves the open space in a tidy and plantable condition and secondly, to provide that the local authority will then take it over and maintain it.  The present law is not satisfactory and I am now considering the details of new legislation to ensure that local authorities have power to require a developer to discharge his obligations, and that they have the legal obligation to take over and maintain these open spaces.</P>
    <P>It is my view that this obligation of local authorities should be related to their general responsibility for safeguarding and extending the amenities of their areas and should embrace also neglected or derelict open spaces in private or local authority ownership which have been allowed to fall into an objectionable condition.</P>
    <P>I have had under consideration for some time the increasing use of holiday caravans and the consequent need <Col N="282" /> for suitable caravan sites.  This development will oblige sanitary authorities to take measures for the prevention of danger to public health and injury to amenities.  There may be a serious hazard to health in concentrations of such vehicles on sites that are inadequately provided with water supplies, sewage disposal systems and other services.  I should like to see every reasonable encouragement given to the use of caravans as an important element in the development of tourist traffic, but the use of unsuitable sites or the misuse of any site would harm rather than help this objective.</P>
    <P>There are adequate powers of control vested in sanitary authorities under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948.  Hitherto my Department has acted only on request from sanitary authorities to have the relevant control provisions brought into operation but I have now decided that, unless the initiative is taken locally, I shall declare the statutory provisions to be in operation in all areas where caravan parks or caravan sites have been or are likely to be provided. I am also having a memorandum issued to sanitary authorities for their guidance in considering applications for licensing of sites and in attaching conditions to licences granted.  In enforcing compliance with the standards I can see that a certain financial burden may fall on developers and I am advising sanitary authorities to co-operate as far as possible with private developers in the provision of services where such co-operation may prove necessary or desirable.  The memorandum on standards will specify conditions in relation to a number of matters such as density of temporary dwellings on a site, layout of the site, water supply, sanitary conveniences, general maintenance, behaviour, supervision and fire precautions.</P>
    <P>The most striking development in road matters in recent years has been the growth in the number of motor vehicles.  In 1949 there were less than 123,000 vehicles licensed and about 173,000 drivers.  Ten years later these figures had increased to over 278,000 vehicles and over 305,000 drivers.  The <Col N="283" /> increase has been most striking in the case of small motor cycles and tractors, but the numbers of the main classes of vehicles, private cars and goods vehicles, have about doubled in the 10-year period.  These figures reflect the growing importance of roads in internal transport: incidentally, they afford some indication of the general level of prosperity and economic activity.</P>
    <P>The growth in road traffic has created a correspondingly increased demand on the road system, including the network of county roads that has had to be improved to take the mechanised transport that now serves the farming community.  In most areas considerable headway has been made and a good spinal system of county roads provided.  As one comes to the less-trafficked county roads, it is possible to reduce standards of construction, and so reduce costs.  A further substantial reduction in costs has been secured by the use of modern methods and new materials.  The overall result is that the completion of the county road programme can be achieved in most areas in a reasonable time.  It may not be necessary to provide dust-free surfaces on all county roads, many of which can be maintained in good condition for motor traffic by the use of modern maintenance methods, at no extra charge over present upkeep costs.</P>
    <P>I should like to I give some figures to indicate the present stage of progress. We have approximately 40,000 miles of county roads of which about 40 per cent.  have been made dust-free. Four counties have over 80 per cent.  in this condition, a further six over 50 per cent., and a further 10 over 25 per cent.  The annual increment is 1,600 miles, so that at the end of three years approximately 50 per cent.  will have dust-free surfaces and at the end of six years over 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>Although main roads number in miles only 10,000, they carry the heaviest concentration of traffic, particularly the main arterial routes. Traffic counts taken on trunk roads <Col N="284" /> in recent years gave figures as high as 3,618 vehicles per 12-hour period, and 1,500 vehicles per peak hour.  Calculations made in particular cases show that any improvement effected yields considerable savings in time, fuel consumption and wear and tear of vehicles and tyres.  Accident statistics have shown also that better roads mean less accidents.  In view, however, of the limited amount of capital available for investment in the whole system, and the needs of the county roads to which I have referred, main road improvement work is restricted to cases where the road was deteriorating under the weight of traffic or where accident records showed a serious hazard.  The amount of main road realignment work carried out at present is therefore restricted, the limited funds available for main road improvement being largely spent on widening and strengthening.  Some useful works have been carried out, however, and in each case they were specifically approved by the elected body in accordance with the procedure which I introduced in 1958.</P>
    <P>Apart from the grants available under the Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1959, the Road Fund grants for the present year as originally notified were on the same basis as in the past few years.  Amounting to approximately £5,000,000 they included a county road improvement grant of £2,400,000, a main road improvement grant of £1,000,000, a main road upkeep grant of 40 per cent. of approved expenditure, £400,000 for the tourist road scheme, £150,000 for bridge schemes and £150,000 for the county boroughs and Dún Laoghaire.  Recent returns of motor taxation indicate that a higher income for the benefit of the Road Fund may be expected, due chiefly to the growth in the number of vehicles taxed.  Furthermore, with the assistance of money advanced by the Government, by way of loan and by careful administration, we have reduced the proportion of commitments that had reached such a disturbing volume some years ago.  These improvements in the position of the Fund have enabled me to allocate extra grants amounting to about <Col N="285" /> £400,000 in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>Out of this amount, an improvement grant of £50,000 is being allocated for urban roads, divided on a mileage basis.  This is the first time that Urban District Councils have received any grants from the Road Fund for their urban roads.  The county and main road improvement grants already allocated to the county councils are being increased by 1/12th.</P>
    <P>The main road upkeep grant is being extended to the county borough corporations and the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire.  Up to now these municipalities have received no grant towards road upkeep.  The grant should help them to improve the maintenance of their streets and so to meet more effectively the need of present-day traffic and prevent costly deterioration.</P>
    <P>A number of developments indicate that the time has come to assess the merits of the existing system of distributing Road Fund grants.  The tourist road scheme is due to terminate this year.  The county road improvement schemes are near completion in some counties.  Traffic has reached a high level and continues to grow.  I have, therefore, instituted a comprehensive, objective review of the grants system.  It may be that this review will suggest sweeping changes.  It may be that it will merely confirm the value of the existing system.  Naturally, the Minister for Finance and myself will have to consider the matter fully before deciding on any new system, or on retaining the existing one.</P>
    <P>The Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1959, provided for special assistance to the Road Fund over a period of five years to the extent of a maximum of £400,000 per annum, half being a loan and half a free grant.  This was designed to deal with urgent problems created by railway crossings and the improvement of access to certain major industrial undertakings.  Requests for grants far in excess of the maximum of £2 millions have been received, as one would expect, and it has been necessary to restrict the allocations to cases which clearly complied with the preordained conditions, <Col N="286" /> namely, that being outside the scope of the road authority's normal programme they could not be undertaken under the funds normally available to the local authorities concerned, that they must be urgent and that they must relate, in the case of railway closings, to closings that have occurred recently.</P>
    <P>On the basis of these conditions it has been necessary to refuse a number of requests for grants.  The full sum of £2 millions has for all practical purposes now been allocated, £1,400,000 to eight counties affected by railway closings, and the balance for public roads serving industrial etc., undertakings such as the Shannon Airport area, Cork Airport, the Whitegate refinery, a number of coal mines, the Wicklow copper mine, and gypsum mines.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into questions of motor taxation, because on the issue of unladen weight a full debate was held on the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) (Amendment) Act, 1960, and further minor amendments of the motor tax law have been included in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I now come to road traffic.  The growth in road traffic has naturally accentuated the problems of road safety and traffic congestion.  The Government are fully alive to these problems and are intent on their solution within the shortest possible time. In so far as legislation can help, the necessary provisions will be made in the forthcoming Road Traffic Bill. The Government's preliminary proposals in the White Paper have, on the whole, been well received.  Suggestions on individual items have been made, and these are at present being considered.  Every effort will be made to bring the legislation before the House as quickly as possible, but it will be appreciated that a lengthy Bill of this type, which is intended to modernise and codify the whole Road Traffic law, will take some time to draft.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself will need to be implemented by various regulations and byelaws.  Progress has already been made in the review of existing regulations. Where necessary and where the <Col N="287" /> powers are available, these can be amended prior to the enactment of the Bill.  Thus, in April, 1959, I made regulations and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána made byelaws which enabled us to introduce the new type of pedestrian crossing, giving a pedestrian the right of way where zebra markings and flashing beacons are provided.  Dublin Corporation have already provided 46 of these crossings with the assistance of a grant from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>While a lot can be done by way of legislation and regulation, and while the Garda Síochána can play their part by way of enforcement, a worthwhile reduction of accidents can be secured and maintained only if every individual road-user plays his part.  Propaganda has been used from time to time, and will continue to be used, to foster the proper outlook among road-users&mdash;a sense of consideration for others, an awareness of the need for care at all times. Coupled with these qualities there must be inculcated a thorough knowledge of the rules of road behaviour. At the moment the preparation of an illustrated folder is in hands which will deal with a particular aspect of the Rules of the Road, namely, the duties and rights of road-users at pedestrian crossings.  It is hoped that others will follow.</P>
    <P>On traffic congestion, the powers to deal with this rest primarily, and quite rightly, with the Garda Síochána, who make the necessary byelaws and have the responsibility for enforcing them.  The local authorities provide the signs, markings and other devices. They are consulted before byelaws are made.  It is necessary to have a number of authorities in the picture because a number of interests are involved. Proper co-ordination can eliminate any confusion and delays that might arise in the implementation of sound ideas for the abatement of congestion, which can create a serious economic loss.  With this in view, I have arranged that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the Dublin Corporation should each <Col N="288" /> assign a senior officer to work on the informal co-ordination of their functions, in association with the senior Assistant Secretary of my Department in order to expedite decisions on all the improvements that may be found possible in advance of the long-term measures on which the Corporation is seeking expert advice.</P>
    <P>In most counties the high standard of rate collection of previous years was maintained, the percentage of the rate warrants collected at the 31st March, 1960, being 97.2 per cent. as compared with 97.4 per cent. at the corresponding date in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The wages and salary increases recently granted to local authority employees made some increases in the rates unavoidable.  The rates struck by most county councils therefore show some increase this year&mdash;the average county rate for the current year being 38/11d. as against 38/- last year.</P>
    <P>During the last financial year the total revenue expenditure of local authorities, excluding vocational education committees, committees of agriculture and harbour authorities was approximately £53.03 millions.  The figure for the present financial year has been estimated at £54.7 millions.  Of the £53.03 millions for last year, the State contributed £22.35 millions or 42.1 per cent. by way of grants and the State's share of the estimated expenditure in the year 1960/61 is £23.6 millions or 43.1 per cent. of the total.  When account is taken of other miscellaneous receipts such as rents from property, and repayments by borrowers of loans made to them under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, <i>et cetera</i>, the net amounts falling on local rates last year and this year are estimated to be £21.42 millions or 40.4 per cent. and £21.9 million or 40 per cent. respectively. The State is therefore contributing more towards the cost of local services than the local authorities themselves are levying by way of rates.  This position, which has now prevailed for a number of years, compares very faourably for the local authorities with that obtaining in pre-war years when State grants came to only 75 per cent. <Col N="289" /> approximately of the total amount of rates collected.</P>
    <P>While total revenue expenditure has been increasing the downward trend in the level of capital expenditure has continued.  The decrease in the year 1959/60 has however not been so marked as in the previous few years. Capital expenditure in that year was approximately £8.52 millions as against £8.82 millions in 1958/59 and £10.303 millions in 1957/58.</P>
    <P>The total indebtedness of local authorities after deducting sums for debt redemption was £145 millions at 31st March last.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Approximately an hour ago, a former Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Agriculture, talked about the time spent in preparing dry speeches for Estimates.  If ever we heard a dry speech on an Estimate, we have just listened to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I beginning to hurt already?  Sitting back and listening carefully, what are the two things that strike one about the speech we have just heard?  The two things that struck me were that the Minister advised local authorities to set up sections of engineering staff specialising in various branches and to recruit more engineers.  I thought we had reached the stage where we knew what is urgent in local authorities without seeking the advice or recommendations of the Minister to increase the already over-burdened rates by the recruitment of additional professional men to the staffs of local authorities. That was the first point that struck me.  The second was that the Minister has set up another committee, an inter-Departmental committee, to deal with many aspects of the provision of water and sewerage schemes for rural dwellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those were the only two things that <Col N="290" /> struck me about the entire speech of the Minister.  I had hoped he would say something about his intention in regard to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Last year on the Estimates we had a token provision of £5. We all hoped that that token provision might suggest a Supplementary Estimate later and that some scheme to revive that Act would be introduced by the Minister.  Last December, some Deputies tabled a motion requesting the Minister to provide moneys under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and it was debated here for almost two days and the Minister at that time told us that his colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance would introduce a scheme to replace the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  We have heard nothing about it since.</P>
    <P>That Act as every Deputy from rural Ireland knows, was most valuable. It was introduced by one of the Minister's predecessors, the late Deputy Murphy, when he was Minister for Local Government.  It gave considerable employment and it was never more badly needed in rural Ireland than it is today.  The number of people employed on road works is falling each year.  Under minor relief schemes, no provision is made for drainage such as that which could have been provided under the Local (Works) Act and I beg the Minister to put aside his prejudice against the Act, which was a most useful one and of considerable benefit to all local authorities.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister could not tell us more about his intention in regard to the Road Traffic Bill.  He says now that he has received proposals and that they are being considered but that they will take some time to draft.  The Government, were they to run their full term, have only about 20 months or less to run, and if we have not yet drafted the proposals, there is no hope of getting a Road Traffic Act during the lifetime of the present Dáil.  I am surprised that the Minister should make such a statement because in 1957&mdash; that is a good while ago&mdash;when I had the privilege of introducing the Estimate for Local Government during the <Col N="291" /> course of the debate the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, intervened and said, as reported at column 1417, volume 157:</P>
    <P>It may be of assistance to the Minister in this matter</P>
    <P>&mdash;he was referring to road traffic&mdash;</P>
    <P>to get from the representative of the Party in opposition an indication of the things we think should be done in order to bring about an improvement in the situation.  First of all, there is the question of driving.  We have come to the conclusion that it is wrong to allow a situation to continue in which any person can get a licence to take a vehicle on the road without being subjected to some test&mdash;first of all, a test of his competency to control the vehicle, and secondly a test of his knowledge of the road regulations.</P>
    <P>It is evident from the Taoiseach's speech of 5th June, 1956, that the Fianna Fáil Party had then considered this entire matter and that they had decided on the major amendments which they should and would introduce to the Road Traffic Bill.  I assured Deputy Lemass at the time that the problem was one which was worrying the then Government, so much that a sub-committee of the Cabinet, consisting of two Ministers and the Parliamentary Secretary, were actively engaged in the drafting of a Road Traffic Bill.  He accepted my assurance and it was given in the knowledge that such a Bill was then in draft.  Here we find ourselves four years later and the Minister says that proposals for the amendment of road traffic legislation will take some time to consider and draft.</P>
    <P>We have not even yet reached the drafting stage: we are merely at the considering stage.  I am afraid we may throw our hats at an amendment of the road traffic legislation during the life of the present Dáil.  This is a very serious problem because the Minister has told us that for a number of years past the number of motor vehicles on the roads has increased from over 100,000 to over 300,000 <Col N="292" /> and is still increasing.  Despite that, we are still considering proposals that have been received.  I charge the Minister with wilful neglect so far as road traffic legislation is concerned.  I think he should have accepted the advice of his leader and given the matter consideration even prior to consideration of the amendment of the Constitution&mdash;which we spent months debating here&mdash;and also priority over other legislation of which we have heard quite a lot, for instance, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that there are increased grants from the Road Fund. We would expect that.  The Road Fund is increasing annually and it is but right that there should be increased grants.  He has given the mileage of county and main roads which require repairs.  I might say in passing that I am surprised to see a system now creeping in, particularly in some northern counties, of applying some material to the roads which is causing considerable dust and giving rise to complaint from many motorists, particularly from visitors to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is stone from Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to Donegal.  I am referring particularly to county Cavan.  It appears that whatever material is being added for drying purposes is causing the trouble.</P>
      <P>I know motorists who have arrived in Dublin and who have had their clothes and cars completely covered, to the depth of over an inch on the car, with dust.  That is a matter which the Department should look into very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I am surprised that the Minister has gone back to this old policy of constructing boulevards.  He has rightly indicated the number of county roads which needs repairs, tar and the application of some dust-free dressing. There is a number of them as yet. Even some of the main roads, particularly in County Clare, have not yet seen a coat of tar.  I would have liked to see the Minister under his Estimate give a greater grant towards these <Col N="293" /> county roads and forget about constructing the boulevards for which Fianna Fáil appear to have such a liking.</P>
    <P>I was very glad indeed to read the election manifesto of some of the Sinn Féin candidates who have as one of the items in their programme the policy of the inter-Party Government, namely, the expenditure of more money on county roads and less on the building of speedways.  It is a good thing to see that others are in agreement with the policy initiated by us when in office.  It is certainly a policy which should be and, I am sure, will be acceptable to the people, particularly to members of local authorities in rural Ireland who are aware of these serious problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us about the grants now available for the installation of water and sewerage in private dwellings throughout rural Ireland.  I wonder has he experience of applying for such grants or of the delay in procuring them.  Has he any experience of the expense incurred by the local authority and the State in providing such grants?</P>
    <P>I know a person in rural Ireland who applied for a sewerage and water grant in the month of October last. The job was completed in the month of February, sanction having been received in the month of December. Inspectors visited his house on five different occasions before a grant of £70 would be paid to him.  I am willing to bet that the expense of bringing those gentlemen to his house on five different occasions far exceeds the amount of the grant which he will get.</P>
    <P>There should be some liaison between the local authority and the Department to obviate overlapping in visiting and inspecting for the purposes of those grants.  For instance, I understand it is necessary that the applicant's house should be over 100 feet from the main water supply in order that he may receive a grant and that a certificate must be produced from the local authority that such is the position, that when that certificate has been obtained after a visit by a <Col N="294" /> local authority inspector, the Department's inspector arrives.  It should not be too difficult for him to be in a position to certify that the dwelling house is over 100 feet from the main supply and that the applicant is therefore eligible for the grant.  The expense incurred in providing these facilities is out of all proportion to the good done by the provision of the grants.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has any experience of the delay at the moment in procuring individual grants for building houses in rural Ireland. Prior to the Minister's assuming office we had appointed officers in each locality.  Appointed officers made the preliminary inspection.  They knew the locality.  They assisted the applicant.  For all that the applicant was required to pay a fee of only £2.2.0.  Today the applicant must still pay the £2.2.0. but he does not receive the services which were provided by the appointed officer.  We find that persons are refraining from seeking these grants owing to the difficulty which they would have in completing specifications and plans and the expense they would incur in employing architects.  I would appeal to the Minister to revert to the old system of having local appointed officers and thus speed up the erection of new houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister has talked a great deal about the progress in building.  He has thrown out generalities.  To get the facts one must refer to the figures which the Minister gave in connection with this matter.  It is very significant indeed that the progress suggested by the Minister is not indicated when the figures are compared.  For instance, take new houses built in the State in the years from 1952 to 1959.  In 1952, by the end of the financial year, 12,674 houses were built.  In 1953, 14,060 houses were built; in 1954, 11,179; in 1955, 10,490; in 1956, 9,837.  In 1957, the last year in which the inter-Party Government were in office, 10,969 houses were built.  Now let us take the first year of the Fianna Fáil Government. In 1958, 7,480 houses were built. In their second year, 1959, 4,893 houses were built&mdash;65 per cent. less than the <Col N="295" /> number of houses built in the last year of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that this innocent Deputy from Galway has told me that.  Does the Deputy know that for years and years, day in and day out, I preached that from those benches and that the present Minister sitting over here&mdash;he was then a back bencher&mdash;said that I was sabotaging the whole housing programme?  Deputy Briscoe said the very same thing.  I said at that time that it was much better to taper off the building as we reached saturation and not continue building, suddenly come to a stop and throw all those in the building trade out of employment.  Those were the words I used: &ldquo;taper it off&rdquo;.  This Minister and Deputy Briscoe told me it would take 10 years to satisfy the demand for houses but the Deputy, in his innocence, was unaware of that when he threw out this interjection.</P>
      <P>Let us take the reconstruction of houses.  In 1952, 2,292 houses were reconstructed: in 1953 2,573; and in 1954, 4,244.  These were three years of Fianna Fáil Government.  The inter-Party Government came into office and under a Fine Gael Minister, what happened?  In 1955, 4,889 houses, an increase of nearly 650, were reconstructed; in 1956, 6,494 houses were reconstructed; and in the last year in which the inter-Party Government were in office, 8,147 houses were reconstructed. Fianna Fáil then returned to office and for the year ending March, 1958, the number fell to 7,162 and in 1959, it came down to 6,909.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take the all-over expenditure for the years 1955 to 1959, we find that for the financial year ending March, 1955, the total amount spent was £1,995,000; for 1956, £2,447,000; and for the last year in which the inter-Party Government were in office, <Col N="296" /> £2,167,000 was spent.  When Fianna Fáil came back to office, the figure dropped from over £2,000,000 to £1,500,000 and in 1959, it dropped from £1,527,000 to £1,230,000.  I understand the estimate for this year is £1,700,000, far below the amount expended in the days of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>There is no use in our generalising. These are figures furnished by the Minister's Department and from these we shall see what has occurred.  Take my own county.  There is an Irish expression which says: Is glas iad na cnuic i bhfad uainn&mdash;distant hills are green.  When a Minister of State says: &ldquo;We are prosperous.  We are on the right road&rdquo;, I always say: &ldquo;Look at your own parish, your own townland and see how things are there.&rdquo; Therefore, I ask the Minister to look at his own county, in Donegal.  What do we find?  We find in Donegal in the year 1953-54 the total number of houses built, private and local authority, was 207; in 1954-55, 306; in 1955-56, 299; and in 1956-57, 249.  Then the Minister came into office and in his first year in office, it fell to 170.  He may have an excuse; he was only taking over. In the second year, 1958-59, the number fell to 157 and in 1959-60, it fell to an all-time low level of 138 houses.  Is glas iad na cnuic i bhfad uainn, but when you get very near those hills, taking our own county of Donegal and find there is a fall from the last year of the inter-Party Government in the erection of private and local authority houses from 249 to 138, it makes one think.</P>

Thank goodness, one of them has gone.  He is not around this House very much now.  He is one of those who were busy black-guarding me about not paying grants. One of those is Deputy Briscoe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> Will the Deputy now listen to what is the position in regard to road workers in Donegal?  In 1953-54, there were 1,109 road workers in Donegal; in 1954-55, there were 1,198; in 1955-56, there were 1,149; and in the last year in which I was in charge of the Department, there were 997. The figure fell to 913 in 1957-58, to 903 in 1958-59 and it is up by 30 this year to 936.  Does that paint any picture in relation to all these increased grants of which the Minister speaks, grants for road work, grants for the building of houses?  Where are the houses being built?  Where is the money being spent?  Where is the alternative employment to that given under the Local Authorities (Works) Act?  I cannot find it anywhere.  We used to hear quite a lot about financing of the Dublin Corporation in relation to houses.  I was glad that the Minister ignored it today.  I should have done it, too, but Deputy Briscoe, if I may use the expression, yapped about it so much in this House that sometimes he annoyed me.</P>
    <P>Let us take a few figures.  Expenditure from the Local Loans Fund and what was left over from capital issues <Col N="298" /> of Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation in 1956-57 was £14.4 million.  In 1957-58, the first year of the present Government, when Fianna Fáil alleged they paid the debts of the Inter-Party Government, the amount was £11.8 million&mdash;from £14.4 million to £11.8 million.  In 1958-59, it was £6.5 million and in 1959-60, it is the same, £6.5 million.  Each year it has been less than half the expenditure of the inter-Party Government in their last two years of office, 1955-56 and 1956-57.</P>
    <P>I remember distinctly, not only in this House but at conference after conference in the Custom House, begging local authorities to continue planning these long-term schemes of regional water supplies and sanitary services.  I remember distinctly in this House and in the council chambers Fianna Fáil Deputies advising their local authorities: &ldquo;Stop planning. There is no money to pay for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23rd June, 1960.</P>
