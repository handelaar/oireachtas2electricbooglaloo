      <P>I gave the Taoiseach notice last night that I would ask him about No. 8 on to-day's Order Paper, the motion dealing with the closing of the Waterford-Tramore railway, which stands in the names of my colleague, Deputy Kyne, and myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree to give Government time for the discussion of a motion relating to a specific decision by the Board of C.I.E. which they are fully empowered to take.  However, if the Party opposite desire to put down a motion to permit of a discussion on the general policy of C.I.E., I shall be prepared to provide Government time for it in the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make this suggestion to the Taoiseach?  This matter was discussed in the House previously, and I understood the Taoiseach to indicate that if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges determined this motion was in order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Taoiseach to say that, in that event, the Government's refusal to provide time would be reconsidered.  The <Col N="1228" /> matter was discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and it was determined that the motion was in order.  In those circumstances, I put it to the Taoiseach that if a statutory power is to be exercised which would produce an irrevocable result and an application is made from the responsible Leader of the Opposition Party for Government time to discuss the motion, then, in view of the irrevocable consequences of acting upon it, the Taoiseach and the Government ought to provide the time, even though they do not like the motion and do not approve of its terms.  When there is an application for Government time from a responsible Leader of the Opposition in an irrevocable situation, the Government ought to make it available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the Dáil procedures for discussing the activities of various statutory boards was discussed here previously and I indicated on that occasion that a motion to discuss the annual report of such a board, or some other such motion which would permit of the general activities of any of these boards to be debated in the Dáil, would be something the Government would be prepared to facilitate.  That is the position in regard to the Board of C.I.E. as well as every other statutory board.  A motion of that kind, which would permit Deputies to raise any matter affecting the administration in which they are interested, would be one for which I think the Government should provide time and for which we would be prepared to provide time.</P>
      <P>However, I think it is not reasonable to ask the Government to take an action which would imply a departure from its own position.  As to whether or not these particular motions are appropriate for discussion in Private Member's time is not relevant on this point.  The point is that if Deputies will put down a motion, such as the Dáil has discussed previously in relation to statutory boards, the Government would regard themselves as obliged to provide time for its discussion.</P>

      <P>There is no motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach claim that we should put down a motion only in the form approved by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no particular objection if the Government meet the motion in the time provided by saying: &ldquo;We refuse to make any answer to this motion because we do not think its form is one that ought to be raised in Dáil Éireann.  We will fight that out in debate.&rdquo;  But surely, if the propriety of a motion is called in question and is referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, who say the motion is all right, and the Leader of the Opposition asks the Government for time, normally, whether the Government agree with me or not, they ought to give time? The assumption is that I lack responsibility, but the corresponding assumption is that if the Opposition and the Leader of the Labour Party act responsibly, the Government will meet their request.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the Taoiseach does not like the form of this motion and does not think it is a proper form. O.K. But the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have not adopted the Taoiseach's view.  In that situation I am asking for Government time to discuss this motion.  I fully concede the Taoiseach's right to say, when we come to discuss it: &ldquo;I do not think it is in proper form and I shall not discuss it with you.&rdquo;  Let him give his reasons.  That is another story.  But the Taoiseach ought to give time, otherwise it will be impossible for the Opposition to collaborate with the Government in getting the business of this House done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am asked to give Government time for a motion, it must not be a motion in a form which involves the Government in acceptance of the principle that the Dáil has the right to override the decisions of C.I.E. in these matters.  I do not think it is an insoluble difficulty.  If a Deputy would put down a motion, which need not involve any departure from their position either, I shall provide Government time for it.  Even a simple motion, such as that the Dáil should discuss the administration of C.I.E., will satisfy the reasonable requirements of the Government in this matter.  We shall give Government time for that debate and discuss fully the issues of policy that arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is asking us to put down a motion in a form suggested by him.  I do not think that we should be asked to do that.  This matter was taken to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which decided that the motion was in order.  In view of that I come back to this House and suggest that in fairness, and in order to get the business of the House done, we should be given Government time to discuss the motion.  The Taoiseach then says that he will not give us Government time unless the motion is in the form in which he says it should be.  You cannot get the business of the House done in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>To make this matter clear, Sir, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges decided that, as Standing Orders are at present, these motions are in order.  The Committee refused to accept the view put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that they be ruled out of Order. The decision is that, as Standing Orders are, the motions are in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the issue of policy should be discussed in relation to specific discussions of the C.I.E. Board.  The motion should be one that would raise a question of policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no particular axe to grind in this matter.  The Taoiseach's view is that the motion is out of order and the difference of opinion between him and the Opposition is that he does not consider it a motion for which he should give Government time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the reason we have an argument on this is that when the Bill was passing through the House certain Deputies got the idea, whether they were right or wrong, that on the question of the closing of C.I.E. lines the Taoiseach is alleged to have said that before any lines were closed local interests would be given an opportunity of putting their case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may be correct in that.  The legislation does not provide for this sort of representation but we took it from the Taoiseach's statement on the Bill when it was passing through the House that he agreed that local interests should have an opportunity of discussing the closing of the railways.  If the Taoiseach spent five minutes before the House this morning in clarifying the position the whole matter would be cleared up quickly.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to provide for the acquisition of derelict sites by local authorities, to enable local authorities to require the execution of works on derelict sites by the owners and, in certain circumstances, to execute works on derelict sites at the expense of the owners, to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid and to repeal the Acquisition of Derelict Sites Act, 1940.</P>

      <P>It may be appropriate at this stage to raise a matter which has particular reference to the Money Resolution and on which the Minister may be in a position to give us some information now.  Certainly, in my constituency and in other areas, it was anticipated that the Derelict Sites Bill would provide, not only facilities for local authorities to deal with derelict sites, but for the owners of derelict sites to receive some grant or assistance where they individually desired to put the site to rights themselves.</P>

The question that has been raised by the Deputy in regard to grants to private owners of derelict sites for the purpose of putting them in order has been dealt with under the Supplementary Estimate and the grants scheme.  The answer I think the Deputy wants is that there are grants available to private owners of derelict sites to help and encourage them to put them into proper condition but is is not under this Money Resolution.</P>

The Supplementary Estimate and the grants scheme, as I explained at the time we introduced it here and announced it in the first instance, are not really tied to the Bill now before the House. Rather, it is a scheme which could apply under the existing law in regard to derelict sites clearance but it will be more widely usable by virtue of the terms of this Bill, if and when it <Col N="1236" /> becomes law.  If the Bill never became law, there is a grants scheme which, to some extent, can be used and which gives grants to private owners for the clearance of derelict sites.</P>

      <P>It must arise somewhere. This Bill deals with derelict sites.  I will put it in order for you, Sir.  Section 1 defines &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo;. That gives rise to a situation which may result in the local authority acquiring the site or entering upon the site to carry out works.  I envisage the circumstances of a citizen who does not want his site acquired, who does not want to allow a situation to mature which would authorise the local authority to enter upon his site to carry out works, who wants to carry out the works himself.  Can the Minister tell us what assistance he is prepared to give to a person who wants to avoid the consequences of Section 1 of this Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very happy about one point that arises in this connection.  The House is quite clear that sites upon which there are old, dilapidated, ruined buildings are to be cleared and that that clearance will mean that the site will no longer be a derelict site.  I can visualise the situation in which an owner has a site on which there are no buildings.  The definition in line 26 is land &ldquo;on which either there are no buildings...&rdquo;  The owner has some plans to deal with the site, to build there.  As I understand the situation, if there are no buildings on that site and unless he builds and completes his building within one month, under subsection (1) of Section 2, he loses the site for building purposes.</P>
      <P>That does not seem to me to be at all what was intended.  It seems to me that there is some confusion, either in my mind or in the drafting, and I am quite prepared to admit that it could be in one or the other.  It does seem to me that if a person has a site on which there are no buildings at the passing of this Act &mdash; and I think I am right in saying to the Minister that whatever is defined in this Bill is operative as at the passing of the Act&mdash; which is the subject of unpleasant trespass, which brings clause 2 of paragraph (a) of Section 1 into operation, that there is debris thereon or insanitary material, then that is automatically a derelict site.  The owner has a genuine intention of which he can satisfy the local authority beyond question of erecting substantial buildings on it, but is perhaps waiting to get possession of an adjoining site so that the whole can be developed in the interests of good estate management, as the phrase goes in the Rent Restrictions Act and in the Landlord and Tenant Act, as one entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that under the provisions of subsection (1) unless he completes his building within a month he has lost the site completely.  I assume I am right in saying to the Minister that nobody ever intended that.  What I think should be the position is that if there is a site of that <Col N="1239" /> sort which is going to be utilised for development and which, because of the manner of the drafting in connection with the phrase &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; comes within the purview, then there should be something in Section 2 to provide that the rights of that person would be protected by, if you like, fencing off the site pending development.  I would think that the joint operation of the two sections needs considerable clarification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension in this regard when he thinks of such circumstances arising and suggests that the force of subsection (1) of Section 2 indicates that whatever remedial operations were required would have to be carried out, even if it came to building on the site, within a month.  The effect of subsection (1) of Section 2 is that notice may be given to the owner of the site that the local authority would wish him to do something with the site and requesting from him an offer as to what he is prepared voluntarily to do with the assistance of the grants I have already mentioned here to-day. The notice inviting the owner to make this offer gives him not less than one month in which to make the offer as to what he intends to do.</P>
      <P>Having received that offer the local authority may then consider whether the offer meets their requirements to abate the nuisance or to remedy whatever may be the cause of the dereliction of the site.  If satisfied, they will then expect him, in accordance with his offer and possibly in accordance with further negotiation and stipulation by the local authority, to carry out the remedial works or whatever substantial works he may have proposed to carry out.  However, there is no question that he will be required within a month to build houses on the site or any such thing.  That is not the effect of the provision, as the Deputy fears.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming the Minister's interpretation is correct, I am still worried about another point.  If an owner makes an offer and the local authority decide they will not accept that offer, there is no specific right in the Bill of appeal against the local authority's refusal to accept the offer. The intention is, and I think the interpretation will be, that if the local authority do not accept the offer, then they move to Section 3 where there is an appeal against them.  That might create disadvantage.  When an owner makes an offer he has to wait, <i>ad infinitum,</i> without decision by the local authority as to whether they will accept the offer or not.</P>
      <P>As far as I can follow the method, the only way he will know what the position is in regard to the offer is that the local authority will accept the offer or produce something under Section 3.  I do not think it is fair that an owner should be left up in the air like that.  Just as there is an obligation on the owner to make the offer within a period of a month, there should also be an obligation on the local authority within a similar time to say, one way or the other, whether they will accept the offer or adopt the procedure visualised in Section 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I do not know whether the point I wish to make is appropriate on this section.  Has the <Col N="1241" /> Minister considered whether he should make this a function of the council or the county manager?  The reason I raise this point is that there is no provision here which says that this function is the function of the members or of an official, in this case, the county manager.  I would urge the Minister to consider seriously the addition of a section which would deem this function to be a function of the local authority.</P>
      <P>As I said on the Second Reading, it may be that the manager will consult the local authority in relation to the deeming of a site to be derelict. We ought to face up to the question of local administration generally.  We are getting into a pretty difficult position to this extent: we elect, say, on a corporation, 12, 15 or 24 members as the case may be.  If it is to be a managerial function the manager decides that a site is derelict and that it should be repaired or demolished.  I do not mean any disrespect to any particular manager but some of these managers come from other counties. They have not the same knowledge of local conditions, or the same interest in many cases, as the elected members, although I do not say they have a deliberate disinterest.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably tell me that before a manager declares a site derelict he will consult with his engineer, with this or that technician or with this or that professional man. I say that is not enough.  He should consult with the local members of the council, those born and reared in the town and who have the feeling of the town.  This obtains not alone in respect of derelict sites but in respect of many other matters in the Department of Local Government and in the Department of Health.  Therefore, I urge the Minister, in respect of this piece of legislation, to make the function a reserved function to the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We often talk about the character of villages, towns and cities and of the general character of the countryside. There may be an occasion when a manager would deem a certain area to be derelict but which the local people would not want to see demolished. Under this measure, the <Col N="1242" /> manager has a right to say that the place should be demolished or should be put into a fit condition or should be changed to some degree.</P>
    <P>It seems that we are getting away from the idea of local government. The stress is not on &ldquo;local&rdquo; any more.  Without disrespect to any county or city manager, they have not and could not have the same interest in the areas for which they are responsible as the locally-elected members. In respect, therefore, of this piece of legislation and having regard to the power given to county and city managers, I urge the Minister to consider the insertion of a section making this a reserved function to the council members.  Failing that, he should tell us he will advise the county and city managers that they should consult the local people before taking any serious step in respect of derelict sites.  If he does that, I shall be reassured that the manager will not kick over the traces, so to speak, and that if a site is to be deemed derelict he will consult with the council.  That being so, I do not think anybody can kick up a great fuss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to clarify part of the section.  Am I to understand that, where there are buildings which it is desirable to move, the local authority must, in the first instance, decide whether these buildings must go.  When I asked the Minister about this earlier, I gathered the impression that either in this Bill or in some previous enactment a person carrying out the demolition of unsightly buildings in rural areas, in which I am interested, can apply for a grant and get it to cover the cost.  Is that so?</P>

      <P>The Minister &mdash; but the procedure would be that the owner would apply on a specified form and it would go through to the local authority. May I deal with the other point raised by the Deputy?  The owner makes the application and it goes to the local authority.  If the proposals contained in that application for a grant for the removal or improvement of a derelict site are accepted by the local authority, they will forward the application to the Department of Local Government.  If the local authority rejects the application, the instructions in the outline of the grant scheme state: &ldquo;If the local authority reject an application, they will state their reasons or suggest amendments of the proposals which would make them acceptable.&rdquo;  That direction in the outline of the grant scheme brings under notice the weakness in the instructions or in the outline scheme. The relevant instruction is as follows: &ldquo;If the proposals are acceptable&rdquo;&mdash; that is, proposals in an application made on the prescribed form and submitted to the local authority for resubmission to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not under Section 2.  If the proposals are acceptable to the local authority, they will forward the application to the Department of Local Government and inform the applicant. If the local authority reject the application, they will state their reasons or suggest amendments of the proposals which would make them acceptable. There is, I think, a weakness there which has been shown up by what Deputy Sweetman has already raised, in that it does not state that in the case of rejection of the application by the local authority, they will state their reasons to the Minister.  In other words, it is desirable that they would still send forward the application with the reasons for their rejection.  It is intended that the Minister would be the deciding factor about the grants.  We shall have to amend that section.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The answer to Deputy Blowick is that the proposal is made on a specified form as outlined in the scheme rather than in the Bill.  The Bill does not govern this scheme of grants.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  That being so, and being an unlikely happening, first of all we will realise that the local authorities felt that the site in question was a derelict site. Because of that belief, they ask the owner to make an offer as to what he is prepared to do to relieve or improve the appearance of the site.  The Deputy's point is if the owner in answer to that request makes an offer whch is not acceptable to the local authorities or which they just do not accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Supposing it does happen, what is the Deputy's point then?  We must then leave Section 2 and revert to the application by the owner for a grant under the grants scheme, proposing in that application what he wishes or proposes to do.  I take it that it would be likely in all cases to be similar to what he had already offered to the council but the council did not do anything about it. If they do not move, then undoubtedly he would have to apply in the ordinary way under the grants scheme, and, as a private individual or owner, submit his application to the local authorities.  That application would be dealt with as I outlined in paragraph 9 of the Derelict Sites Grant Scheme. They would then submit that application to the Department, amend it, accept it, or recommend it for rejection. <Col N="1246" /> In any event, that would come to the Department and to the Minister who would then decide to allocate or not allocate a grant.  Possibly he might even suggest that some amendment to the proposals might be necessary in order that a grant should be payable. By and large, that would be the answer so far as the operations of Section 2 of the Bill are concerned.</P>

I know places in County Kildare where there are &mdash; I will not say how many &mdash; some derelict sites and the local authority in relation to those sites have not made up their mind what they want to do about them, because they would be radically affected by the ultimate plans for the trunk road in that area.  I can quite easily visualise in those circumstances the local authority, even a good one like the Kildare County Council, just parking it until such time as they came to a decision on the trunk road.  That seems rather unfair, that a person is held in suspense&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Who owns the sites? Are they private sites under private ownership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They are private sites.  There is some doubt as to whether the trunk road is going to go north or south of the area.  If it goes north, these sites will be available for building development; if it goes south they will not because the road will go through them.  It seems to me to be unfair that the owner of those sites could be put in the position in which either he has got to go to the expense of incurring pretty substantial architect's or engineer's fees to see about development, until the county council have made up their minds about the road, or that he may be in danger of losing the site entirely under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am worried about is that the situation may arise where an owner who could be served with a request under Section 2 would reply: &ldquo;I propose to develop this land as a building site, if and when town planning permission is available for me. But I know the council cannot give <Col N="1247" /> me town planning permission until they have decided which way the by-pass road is going to go&rdquo;.  That seems to me to create a situation in which the man is left like Mohammed's coffin. There should be an obligation on the council to come to finality.  We all know once you get into the realm of town planning &mdash; I understand a new Bill in that regard is to come before the House next session &mdash; that local authorities, the Department of Local Government and whatever Minister for Local Government may be there at the time, may find the matter so involved that the easiest way out and sometimes, in fact, the only way out, is to do nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can visualise the case which the Deputy has in mind. Undoubtedly it does seem to present somewhat insuperable difficulties, but assuming that this is a site which, if cleared, could be used for rebuilding or for a building scheme, the first thing that that owner obviously must do in his own interests is to apply for this much-maligned town planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing it is in an area where the Town Planning Act has not been adopted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to say, but there is quite an easy way out there.  Assuming that it is in an area where it does operate and he applies for that permission, the council can either object or give permission. They may not just sit there and do nothing about it.  Having given their decision, and we will take it because of their doubts it is an adverse decision, the owner then has the right of appeal within 30 days of getting this notice of refusal, the right of appeal to the Minister.  In this case, apparently, it is a question of road construction that is at issue.  In such case I do not think the difficulty is at all as insuperable as might be envisaged because the question of the road rests between the Department and the local authority concerned.  That being so, and an appeal pending with the Department of Local Government, it <Col N="1248" /> follows that with their being pushed to give a decision on that appeal, they have at their disposal the necessary co-operation from the local authority. They can come down to the particular point and decide whether the road is going north or south and then, all other things being satisfactory, they can give a decision on the appeal, in so far as the building is concerned.</P>
      <P>While I can see the weight of the hypothetical case, although it may appear very real, I do not think that the difficulty is as insuperable as would seem at first glance.  I am not afraid&mdash;and I say this although I may be faced with the actual case &mdash; that it is one on which we could not reach a satisfactory conclusion without unduly long delay.</P>
      <P>In special circumstances, the fear the Deputy has is that as a result of the operations of this Bill, and because of the line of the road, the owner of a piece of perhaps valuable land may become dispossessed.  In those circumstances, and considering the Act, the grant scheme and the line of the road, plus the actual appeal under the town planning regulations, all of which are under the control of the same Department and the same Minister, I think the Deputy can take it quite definitely that this set of circumstances would not be allowed by one Minister to force a situation where an individual owner would become a substantial loser as a result of the various difficulties and the various processes that would have to be carried on under the various Acts.  The one and the same Minister, in such a set of circumstances governed by different Acts, would not allow the owner to be deprived of what could be valuable land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be worried about what the Minister is saying except for the definition of derelict sites which says: &ldquo;any land on which either there are no buildings,&rdquo; and so forth.  That seems to mean that if you have a piece of virgin land on which somebody dumps a lorry load of refuse, then it is derelict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, if the <Col N="1249" /> owner undumps the lorry load of refuse, it would become other than a derelict site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If, immediately after the dumping, the local authority started the operation of Section 2, the whole thing is in a chain.  If there were a provision in the section about a specified period of time, my worry would disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if they start the operation of the section very speedily, where does it ultimately get them&mdash; right through the question of coming to the Department on the proposition to acquire, the owner of the land having failed to take remedial measures such as removing what had originally caused the objection.  Naturally, if the site were worth anything to the owner, it would be more than the cost of removing the load of refuse.  Finally, the matter would have to come on appeal to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (2) of Section 8?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (4) of Section 8 which deals with objections to compulsory acquisition.  Deputy Corish raised the question of these derelict sites procedures and the giving of operational powers to county managers under this Bill.  They objected very strenuously to that and said that these powers should be part of the reserved functions of the elected representatives. In his enthusiasm, Deputy Corish seems to forget that we are dealing here with derelict sites acquisition in the last analysis and that a site which is allowed to reach the stage, through the non-cooperation and non-action of the owner must be taken to be a site on which the owner does not put much value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being so&mdash;and whether it is so or not &mdash; by and large, we are dealing with derelict sites, which, in the great <Col N="1250" /> majority of cases, would be land that would not be of any great value ultimately. On the other hand, the powers vested in the managers for the acquisition of land for many other purposes under various other Acts deal with land that might be of very great value. Yet these powers have been vested in the managers for very many years and there have been no great complaints of any grave abuses being brought to the notice of the Department.  County managers over the years have had the power to acquire land for housing, roads and for health and other local authority needs.  These, presumably, are likely to be much more valuable sites than will be dealt with under the Derelict Sites Bill when it becomes law.  Despite that, there has been no public clamour in this House or elsewhere that there were abuses of these powers which the managers have had for so long.</P>
    <P>Now we have the suggestion that in dealing with derelict sites, the powers in respect of the acquisition of such pieces of land in specified circumstances should not be given to the county managers, but should be given, as a reserved function, to the elected representatives.  Frankly, I cannot reconcile the two situations.  While the over-all powers for the acquisition of land for various other purposes are still willingly left with the county managers, I certainly can see no reason whatsoever why the power to acquire, in the last analysis &mdash; and it will be the last analysis &mdash; should be objected to as being an extraordinary power to confer.</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) of Section 2 states that the local authority may require the owner to carry out appropriate works on the land at his expense or to acquire the land, but subsection (1) refers to land on which there are no buildings.  What appropriate work could the owner carry out on an open site on which there are no buildings as provided for under subsection (1)?  Yet on failure to carry out such works, the local authority could acquire the site.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was Minister for Agriculture one of my difficulties was, when a local authority developed a site, that they sometimes left a quarter of an acre or a couple of roods which were a derelict site and became a nest of buachalláns which proceeded to infest the whole surrounding neighbourhood.  I prosecuted one or two local authorities under the Noxious Weeds Acts.  I remember on one occasion stopping at a Garda barracks and asking the Guards to prosecute the county manager <i>in persona.</i> Where a piece of ground, having no buildings and, indeed, no rubbish on it, is suffered to become a bed of noxious weeds and no effective measures are taken to correct that situation, it is very difficult to have anything done if the owner is absent abroad in England or America.  It may be very hard to establish that there is anybody who is a tenant of the site.  In fact, very often there is not a tenant of the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, I think it would be worth considering whether, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, such a site might not be declared to be a derelict site and the local authorities have the power to go in and cut the weeds.  The procedure available to the Minister for Agriculture to prosecute is usually sufficient, where the ownership occupancy of the land is clear or certain but if the land is in the hands of an absent owner or if the ownership is doubtful, damage is done by allowing the weeds to continue there.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might consult the Minister for Agriculture adding that modification to the second paragraph of the definition of a derelict site &ldquo;which is likely to become injurious to health or to the amenities of the neighbourhood by reason of its objectionable or neglected condition or by reason of the deposit or collection thereon of debris, rubbish or insanitary material.&rdquo;  Possibly the words &ldquo;neglected condition&rdquo; might cover the matter I have in mind but it is something which I think the Minister might <Col N="1254" /> bear in mind and consult the Minister for Agriculture in regard to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition is one of the most pressing and general problems in certain townland areas.  A small portion of the site may be left there as a kind of open space. It is under the authority of nobody. It may be left there in anticipation of the widening of a certain road junction ultimately.  It may be left there because the owner cannot fit in a house and keep in line with the east-west and the north-south existing building lines.  It is, therefore, left there.  That is private property.  The other, as Deputy Dillon indicated, is more or less public property because the site has been taken over by the Council and built on.  Certain portions are left as open spaces.  Afterwards, they become infested with weeds of every kind.  People begin to dump refuse on them, and then the rats come.  Nobody seems to have any authority to do anything about them.  The Minister should include these places specifically so that it will be somebody's function to rid the community of such nuisance.</P>

      <P>Could the River Liffey be considered a derelict site? When the tide is out, it is full of rubbish. Go down to Capel Street Bridge and there is a whiff from which you will get away as quickly as you can. Could the City Manager compel the Dublin Port and Docks Board to clean the river, or, if they refused, to have it done at their expense?  If the canals, which are being closed, become full of rubbish and weeds, will they be considered derelict sites?  Will the City Manager have the same powers with regard to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to Deputy Corish's remarks that local councils should have reserved powers.  I do not agree with that because local representatives are subject to all sorts of influences and half the time never get any work done.  Local councillors should have only advisory powers.  We see what happens in the appointment of rate collectors &mdash; there is nothing but wangling.  The manager, who has the responsibility, should be allowed to <Col N="1255" /> deal with these matters.  However, in all cases, he should consult the members of the local authority.  He should not be too high-handed because there may be cases of persons who are financially unable to do anything about a derelict site.  While I recognise the importance of getting the work done, there should be some check provided in the form of consultation between the manager and the local representatives before any severe action is taken.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to places where there are no buildings.  Am I to take it that where buildings are occupied, you can have all the functions you like?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition told us that a gap remained in this legislation.  He referred to the case where the owner of a site is either unknown or cannot be got at&mdash; the case in which the site is not derelict within the definition of the Act, but yet is infested with weeds.  He suggested that we should get agreement with the Minister for Agriculture to enable local authorities to acquire such sites.  The loudest objection to the Bill on Second Stage was that lands infested with weeds could be acquired because of that reason alone.  There was a real furore and it was said that was going beyond the bounds of reasonableness.</P>
      <P>I admit a very genuine case can be made in many instances.  There can be many objectionable sites about which no one is doing anything.  But I do not think we could introduce a section into the Bill that would be acceptable to the Leader of the Opposition and would not give rise to the danger that such wider application could be badly abused.  I am afraid we could not meet that case without realising the fears expressed on the Second Stage.  I cannot say what we can do, but I shall go so far as to say that we are conscious of the fact that local authorities have a responsibility to clean up their own property.  We have, in fact, specifically referred to that in the circular concerning derelict sites which went out on 7th of this month.</P>
      <P>I shall read for the House the relevant lines:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> I am to add that the Minister looks to local authorities to give a lead to the public in the matter of maintaining property in good condition. The clearance of existing derelict sites will have but limited effect if other property is permitted to become unsightly because of fly-posting or lack of painting and cleaning.</P>
    <P>That shows that we recognise that it is not always the private property owner who is the greatest offender. But, besides private property owners and local authorities, there are other agencies, not private, who have not given a very good example.  We are looking to local authorities who may have lagged in the past to give good example and to make a real effort in the future really to clean up their property.  We also expect that all other public bodies, agencies and property owners, no matter who they are, will do likewise.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Sherwin's remark about occupied houses, I have already made it quite clear that occupied houses are not intended to come within the jurisdiction of this Bill. Occupied houses are dealt with under the Housing Acts, not under the derelict sites legislation, and will continue to be dealt with in that way.  So far as the canals are concerned, I understand that C.I.E., although they may have ceased to operate them as waterways, are statutorily compelled to maintain them in a reasonable state. In other words, if they became obnoxious, they will come within the terms of the obligations C.I.E. have undertaken. However, should C.I.E. not live up to these obligations and should the canals become obnoxious and a danger to the community, this legislation would apply to them as it applies to other property throughout the country.</P>

      <P>In subsection (3) of Section 9, the vesting order is, in fact, an order divesting the owner of his property and vesting it in the local authority.  In paragraph 8 of subsection (3), it should be stated that the order should be served by registered post.  It is a most important document and the Minister knows that people sometimes do not pay very much attention to a notice sent by ordinary post.  If a person gets a notice by registered post, it is a matter of very considerable importance.  I think that the notice under this section should be registered.</P>

      <P>This amendment is a drafting amendment but it has been suggested to us by the Land Commission, who pointed out that only the words &ldquo;annual sum&rdquo; appear in line 11, Section 10, subsection (2).  To cover the payments in question, the words &ldquo;purchase annuity, payment in lieu of rent&rdquo; which appear in lines 4 and 5 should be included.  The Land Commission have pointed out that these words have a particular meaning in the Land Purchase Acts.  It is their belief that the words &ldquo;annual sum&rdquo; are not in themselves sufficient to cover the expression as given in lines 4 and 5 and it is for that reason that we want to put in the additional words here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of this section is to provide local authorities with a way of dealing with titled derelict sites where they do not know who the owner is.  Unless there was some way of having a vesting order of this sort, they would find it very difficult to cope with the situation. There is a more or less similar power in one of the Housing Acts &mdash; I do not know which one it is &mdash; under which the acquisition price being fixed can be lodged in court, if title is <Col N="1260" /> not made.  The title passes by means of a vesting declaration.  The Minister has adopted a different procedure here to deal with the same point, the point being in either case that the title of the reputed owner of the site, be it housing or derelict, is not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The method is adopted, therefore, of the local authority making a vesting order in one case, lodging the compensation in court in a housing case, but in a derelict sites case, adopting the different procedure envisaged by Sections 10 and 11.  I should like the Minister to explain to the House why it is that he did not adopt the procedure already there for him and, shall I say, hammered out over the years in relation to the Housing Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the immediate answers in that case &mdash; whether or not it would be regarded as a very satisfactory one &mdash; is that it is generally similar to Section 6 of the Act of 1940. In other words, it is the procedure which was in existence in the 1940 Derelict Sites Act and no good reason was seen as to why it should not be continued in this Bill rather than change the procedure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Fifth Stage, I want to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that we have the gravest reservations in regard to the contents of Sections 5 and 8 where the appeal against certain decisions, either under Section 3 of the Bill or decisions in relation to the compulsory acquisition of derelict sites under Section 8, allow of no appeal to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely difficult for us in Dáil Éireann to bear in mind, as we should bear in mind, the impact of our legislation on individual citizens.  The Minister was born and reared in the country, so he ought to understand this problem more fully than those who are not familiar with rural conditions <Col N="1262" /> would be expected to do.  Questions of property in land in rural Ireland give rise to atavistic feelings.  A person living in the city may attach considerable importance to the ownership of property but he does it more from a businesslike point of view and measures his loss by compulsory acquisition by the financial obligations which he believes that procedure involves.</P>
    <P>A wholly different pattern of conduct obtains in rural Ireland.  It is still true in rural Ireland that you can start a family feud that will carry on for generations from the trespass of a hen and that is largely because people have a deep sentimental affection, quite apart from economic considerations, for land they conceive to be their own.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, if a local authority is dealing with an elderly or a cantankerous person and they finally reach an impasse on the question of whether a site is derelict or not, if the person is an ardent supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party and we happen to be in office, far from bringing any consolation to his mind, his sense of grievance is deeply exaggerated if he brings his appeal against the decision of a local authority to acquire his site to a Fine Gael Minister for Local Government and the local authority is upheld by a political Minister, even though it is manifest to everybody that the Minister is acting in a perfectly detached and objective way.  If the individual has the right to go to the court, however, in more than 80 per cent. of the cases, if he goes to a reliable solicitor, explains his case and instructs the solicitor to appeal to the court, the solicitor will be able to dissuade him and point out that on the merits he has not a leg to stand on, that if he goes to court, he will be turned down because the local authority is acting reasonably and he is acting unreasonably.</P>
    <P>In the remaining 20 per cent. of the cases where the owner is of so cantankerous a disposition that he will not be advised even by his own solicitor, if he goes to court and gets a hearing and makes his case and the judge decides that the local authority is acting reasonably and that the site is truly <Col N="1263" /> derelict or that the circumstances justify compulsory acquisition of the site, it may leave a sense of indignation but the deep sense of bitter grievance that might be there rarely, if ever, survives following on a judicial decision.</P>
    <P>I do most strongly urge upon the Minister that to leave it in the last analysis to the political head of a Department of State to determine whether a person's property should be compulsorily acquired is a thoroughly bad arrangement, not only on the practical, pragmatic grounds which I now outline to the House but on the broader general principle that the courts in our system of government are there to be interposed between the humblest and most insignificant citizen of the State and the full power and majesty of the Executive of the Government.</P>
    <P>The court is the one arena where the humblest citizen can go in person, if he is not able to employ a solicitor or counsel, and place his affairs in its hands, knowing that under our Constitution the court is not only entitled but bound to treat the State and the individual on a basis of absolute equality.  I am not suggesting to the House that simple people, down the country, work all that out in their own minds, but it is part of their life that they do feel that access to the court gives them effective protection against any ulterior influence that may be operated.</P>
    <P>You will hear some people say&mdash; irresponsible people in my judgment &mdash;that the court is fixed, and so forth. Ninety-nine point nine per cent. of the people do not believe that; they believe that if they have access to the court they will get justice and that there is no power in the State capable of operating against our Judiciary.  It is not peculiar to this country and I do not think we ought to delude ourselves that it is peculiar to our country &mdash; it is pretty general throughout the world &mdash;that the political head of the Department cannot be as objective in matters of this kind as it would appear to reasonable men he ought to be.</P>
    <P>Where the question of compulsory <Col N="1264" /> acquisition of a person's land is involved, I put it strongly to the House that no matter who is in office&mdash; whether I, the Taoiseach or Deputy Corish is in office &mdash; no one of us, because we elect to engage in the public life of this country should be constituted by Act of this Parliament to be the court of appeal to which an aggrieved citizen has his only recourse. There ought to be set above us a higher authority, to wit, the Judiciary, who, if we, acting as the Executive of the people, as political heads of Government, challenge a citizen's fundamental right, will protect that right and compel us to justify under the terms of the legislation in this House what we propose to do, with the guarantee that if the humblest citizen of the State can demonstrate that we are acting capriciously or arbitrarily the court will be in a position to say: &ldquo;The statute does not authorise you to do that and the Order you have made, in so far as it fails to conform to the statute under which you sought to act, is null and void.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I press this matter in regard to this Bill on its merits, but I press it also for an additional reason, that the temptation on all of us to secure expedition in the despatch of public business operates as a powerful drag on every executive to by-pass the courts.  I agree, and I sympathise with people who are trying to get work done, that if they allow everybody access to the courts it is liable to beget a flood of obstructive and delaying litigation which makes the achievement of the ultimate objective far more difficult.  On balance, however, I urge most strenuously that we should not concede in any legislation this principle that the citizen shall not have access to the courts.  If we once do it in regard to derelict sites or in regard to any other matter we open a floodgate which the natural inclination of any Executive will press further and further open.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a satisfactory business, even in respect of the Town Planning Acts, that the ultimate authority is the political head of the Department.  Amending legislation is urgently necessary in regard to town planning and we can discuss that whole <Col N="1265" /> problem when the revised legislation comes before us.  The point I am trying to make is that in respect of legislation in relation to the Bill we are now considering, particularly where the acquisition of land is involved, people ought to have a right to go to the court.</P>
    <P>Under Section 5 the appeal is in respect of the definition of a derelict site and the power of the local authority to require certain works to be carried out.  If we wanted to be on absolutely firm ground it would be better to allow appeal to the courts in respect of the definition of a derelict site.  The world changes and one has to change with it.</P>
    <P>I would concede some ground in respect of Section 3, if I could establish an inflexible principle that where acquisition of land is involved the appeal would be to the courts.  I would prefer that both in respect of Section 3 and Section 8 there should be an appeal to the courts but, whatever the ultimate decision is in respect of Section 3, I most strenuously urge on the Minister on behalf of our Party that in respect of Section 8, the courts should be restored and an appeal lie to them by anybody on whom the section operates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised that on the Fifth Stage the Leader of the Opposition was allowed to go into the detailed principles of appeals by aggrieved parties generally, without specific reference to the Bill before the House.  The contention of Deputy Dillon was that it is the fundamental right of our humblest citizen, if he feels aggrieved, to have redress and appeal to the Courts of Justice in this country. The Minister must bear in mind the suggestion that 20 per cent. of our citizens, if they are aggrieved, cannot be persuaded but that if they are not members of the Party of the political head of the Department to which the appeal would be made they would not get justice.  That is the contention of the Minister.  Deputy Dillon's suggestion is that the appeal would be to the court &mdash; to the district court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion by some of Deputy Dillon's colleagues and other members of this House in this debate was that there should be appeal to the district court.  The Deputy has in mind the circuit court. Deputy Dillon's contention is that the political head of a Department should not have the power of deciding such issues.  He went on a very broad principle. Surely Deputy Dillon recalls that when he was Minister for Agriculture he dealt with specific appeals which arose from certain regulations made by his Department?  He dealt with them and adjudicated on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy full details on another occasion.  In this instance, bearing still in mind Deputy Dillon's contention that the most humble of our citizens should have the right of recourse to the courts, I would point out that if the most humble of our citizens had recourse to the courts it could cost him a lot of money to engage solicitors and counsel to represent him.  What we are talking about in the main in this instance is hardly worth a hat of craps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an expression we use in the south to indicate that the value of what we are talking about is very limited.  Surely the Deputy will agree from his experience as a former Minister of State that when a Minister is adjudicating on appeals &mdash; town planning appeals or appeals in relation to property, and so on &mdash; although he is the final arbiter, in the main he <Col N="1267" /> takes the considered advice of his officials?  If an inspector from his Department is sent down the country to examine an appeal about a certain site and comes back and reports that these are the facts, in the main the Minister agrees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon admitted that, in 99.9 cases out of 100, people will accept a decision of the courts but that only about 80 per cent. of the people might accept, without feeling a certain suspicion, the decision of the political head of a Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that Deputy Dillon missed in this specific instance before the House.  The person who has the site is given ample time under the Bill to rectify the position and to turn the derelict site into a proper site.  In other words, notice has to be served on him under the section.  If the local authority allege that I have a derelict site, they have to take certain steps.  One is to serve notice on me and to give me an opportunity to abate the alleged nuisance.  If I accept that and abate the alleged nuisance, if I remove the pig's head, the two broken car springs and the burst mattress cited by Deputy Dillon, then the site ceases to be a derelict site.  In other words, if I remedy the alleged nuisance, if I remove the cause or the alleged cause which in the opinion of the local authority is injurious to public health, then the site automatically ceases to be a derelict site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I am an owner of a derelict site it is in my own hands, without any appeal to the court, to abate that nuisance.  Then I am under no compliment to anyone, either to the Minister or to the political head of the Department in question.  Deputy Dillon is most solicitous now for the rights of our most humble citizen to appeal to the courts should he feel aggrieved.  Not so many years ago the famous or infamous Greyhound <Col N="1268" /> Industry Bill was debated here for many long months.  The present Tánaiste, Deputy MacEntee, and myself took a prominent part in that debate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks on this measure will be brief.  First of all, the power of the local authority is vested in the county manager and it is a peculiarity of our legislation that little or no confidence seems to be reposed in our elected representatives. This Bill is in keeping with the attitude which seems to be firmly held by members of the Government.  We have Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Dillon mentioning the rights of people to go to the courts if they feel aggrieved.  I propose to deal with that a little later on.  In such a matter as this, my main objection is that this should not be a managerial function and that the functions of this measure should be vested in the local representatives, because I believe that with their local knowledge of sites which may come within the scope of this measure, they would be much more capable of adjudicating on these matters rather than the county manager who has to be guided by reports of subordinate officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is indeed very surprising that the present Minister for Local Government lost confidence in the elected representatives of local authorities when he framed this measure and excluded them from any functions whatever attaching to it.  It is all very fine for Deputy Dillon or Deputy O'Malley to speak about the rights of aggrieved parties to avail of the courts to rectify any grievance they may have. Every one of us knows the cost of court proceedings and that they are exorbitant. It is impossible for the average citizen who resorts to court proceedings, regarding derelict sites or any matter, to ascertain what the eventual <Col N="1270" /> cost will be.  We know that lawyers are very costly people to consult and it is beyond the reach of many of our ordinary citizens to have anything to do with them.  I do not see that it is much of a safeguard for the owners of derelict sites to tell them that if they feel aggrieved by the decision of the county manager they can go to the courts.  These people may have a right to go to the courts but the cost of the proceedings will preclude them from doing that.  The better way of dealing with the matter would have been for the Minister in the first instance to give the local representatives the right to adjudicate on these matters and the question of going to the courts for aggrieved parties would not then arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The two relevant points raised were by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Murphy.  To Deputy Dillon I would say, as I said on this question when it was raised on the Second Stage, that what is now proposed in regard to appealing to the Minister is not inconsistent with other land acquisition procedure where valuable property is in question.  In the main only property of a relatively small value, by virtue of its having being allowed to become derelict, will, in fact, come to be dealt with by acquisition.  Acquisition is not the intention of the Bill at all; it is only an end product when everything else has failed.  Only when efforts to get a voluntary offer or effort from the owner have failed, and when he has failed to obey a requisition as to what he should do to retain the property himself, will the Government avail of acquisition.  In that event the owner will have had every opportunity to retain his property, and we would have given him a grant to help him put it into a proper state of repair. Then it must be obvious that the only remaining case for acquisition would be a site that is worthless.  Yet we speak of the Minister holding the appellate functions in matters such as this and we are even told that the circuit court should be invoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Murphy said, and as other Deputies said on the Second Stage, access to the courts is undoubtedly open to all and every citizen but at what price?  But leaving that aside, <Col N="1271" /> the fact is that we deal with these and similar matters, under this similar procedure of appeal to the Minister, on far more important and far more valuable property than would ever be envisaged as falling under the terms of this Bill.  In fact, we have even a better example.  We have the example where appeal to the circuit court and to the Minister is optional to the aggrieved parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>But the fact is where they have the option the appeal through the court is rare and in the main appeals are made to the Minister and are being made to the Minister. Only in property that is really valuable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right, as long as he has the alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under compulsory purchase orders objections to acquisition are made to the Minister and not to the court and if there is access to the courts it is purely on a matter of non-compliance with the Act, really a point of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is alleged that the local authority is acting outside the ambit of the Act there is an appeal to the court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Where such an option has been available in the past and up to the present, the number of appeals to the court rather than to the Minister have been the rarest of the rare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is grand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It merely indicates that something for which the Deputy has made a very strong case is not really a thing that has had any real appeal <Col N="1272" /> to the persons concerned even in important matters and in cases.</P>
      <P>I say that it is only as an end product of the Bill that acquisition will arise.  It can arise only after the owner, with the encouragement of grants of up to £100 or half the cost, has failed to do anything to put the site into proper or acceptable condition, where he has refused to take an offer from the local authority which would give him a year to bring the site into condition.</P>
      <P>Having failed to do anything, on a requisition to do specified works, it is only then the question of compulsory acquisition of the site by the council will arise.  Having had all those various facilities and offers made available to him, the site must be less than useless&mdash;it must be really a liability&mdash;if he is to allow the last procedure under this Bill to be operated against him.</P>
      <P>It is on the question of appeal against these acquisitions that the Minister will have the say and if such a situation is to arise, 99 times out of 100, the site must be worthless in order that the appeal should be allowed to arise.  This right of appeal, which is available under other legislation dealing with more valuable sites, is surely a suitable safeguard despite the fact that no matter which Minister is in power, his appointment is a political one.  Our whole system here is a political Party system.</P>
      <P>If that is so, we must grow up and realise that when Ministers are placed in the position of dealing with appeals on matters affecting the rights of the individual as against the claims of the local authority, I do not think there is anybody in the House who, finding himself in those circumstances, would not be on the side of the individual as against the body corporate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all cases, I can only say that anybody in public life, anybody in this House, reaching a Ministerial position and having to deal with appeals of that sort would be immediately sympathetic with the individual as against the public body.  That is my feeling and, as I have already said, I cannot see the merit at all in Deputy Dillon's <Col N="1273" /> argument in the light of this operation and the manner in which the operation of the acquisition of derelict sites and subsequent appeals will arise.</P>
    <P>In so far as Deputy M.P. Murphy is concerned, he seems to assume or presume that I have lost all confidence in the local bodies&mdash;the elected representatives&mdash;because I do not in this Bill give to the elected representatives the powers in relation to acquisition rather than to the county managers. That matter was discussed on the Second Stage, and from both sides of the House, when this suggestion was made, came condemnation of the idea as not being a good one and possibly an unworkable idea.  It was thought that the idea might even be open to certain abuses which members from both sides outlined.  That, however, is not my argument.</P>
    <P>My argument as to why the county managers should have these powers is again that they have and have had powers over the past number of years under various other Acts.  These powers have given them the right of acquisition of much more valuable sites than will be concerned under the operation of this Bill.  County managers have had them since the beginning of the county managerial system 20 years ago.  They have applied these powers in cases of acquisition of land for housing, for roads, for the health necessities of local communities and in most cases the sites were much more valuable than those contemplated for acquisition under this Bill.  Not only have the managers exercised these powers in thousands of cases involving valuable properties, but in all those years there has not been any clamour here or publicly outside for an over-all change.  Neither have there been instances of county managers abusing those powers and acting in a manner contrary to the spirit of the Acts which conferred the powers.</P>
    <P>If there has been any such public clamour I am not aware of it.  Not being aware of it, I must assume it has not arisen in those cases in which valuable sites were concerned.  When we come down to acquisition, which will be the end product only of this <Col N="1274" /> Bill, why should the county managers also not have the powers?  Why pick out one swallow and make a summer out of it, as Deputy M.P. Murphy is trying to do here?  If and when a time arrives when it is believed the county managers should not have the power to operate these functions, the proper approach would be not to isolate the Derelict Sites Act but to take all the Acts which have given these powers to county managers together and decide to take all the powers under all the Acts away from county managers.  That is the consistent approach, but Deputy M.P. Murphy is not being consistent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do we refer to the marketing of milk?  The only marketing of milk that I know goes on in this country is the sale of milk.  This is in the text of the Financial Resolution we are now considering, No. 5 on the Order Paper.  You have paragraphs (a) and (b) and then the text continues:</P>
      <P>under any Act of the present session to make further provision in relation to the marketing of milk and milk products and the improvement and development of such marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> I should like to be clear as to what these levies mean.  Can they attach to all milk, including milk sold in the Dublin Milk Board area, the Cork Milk Board area and other areas where liquid milk is sold for human consumption?  That is one question.</P>
    <P>The second question I want to ask is this.  Can the Minister give us any indication of the probable or contemplated size of the levy?  It may be that the Minister is obliged to say: &ldquo;No, I have not the faintest notion&rdquo; but at present there is a levy, I think, of 1d. per gallon on milk to meet one-third of the cost of an export subsidy on butter, the Government contributing two-thirds of the cost.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether, under the procedure envisaged in this Financial Resolution, it is possible for that levy to grow and, if so, is there any upward limit on the levy which can be made on creamery milk as it stands today at 1d.?  Can this Resolution raise it to 2d. next year and 3d. the year after?  Or does the Minister intend to say that the purpose of this Resolution is to maintain the existing levy of 1d. per gallon and that there is no prospect of it rising any further? I see nothing in this Financial Resolution which limits the levy but I do see in the Resolution the possibility of making this levy 2d., 3d., or 4d. as the quantity of milk converted into butter, cheese or dried milk for export expands.</P>
    <P>We ought to be clear in our minds before we pass a Resolution of this kind what it means.  It is for that reason I raise this matter on two distinct issues.  Is it possible to attach the levy to all milk that is creamery milk and milk for human consumption in liquid form on the domestic market? That is one question.  The second question is this.  Is there any upward limit on the size of the levy which could be made on each gallon of milk under this Financial Resolution or are we to anticipate that the levy which now stands at 1d. per gallon is likely to be increased to 2d., 3d. or even 4d. a gallon as the quantity manufactured and exported tends to expand?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no levy being <Col N="1278" /> collected at the moment.  No levy has been collected, I think, since July, 1959.  In the second place, it is not the intention and there is no provision made in the Bill for the collection of a levy on creamery milk.  Thirdly, the contribution that the Board may call upon the milk suppliers to creameries to make will be influenced from time to time by two factors.  One is that provided here where the State will meet two-thirds of the cost of any losses.  That, of course, means that one-third will be met by the producers. The amount of that one-third, or whether there would be any deduction at all, would depend upon the profitability and the price that could be obtained for milk products, whatever milk products we had to export.</P>

      <P>I am particularly anxious to explain this to Deputy Batt Donegan on whom I look as a dairy farmer of standing in county Cork.  I want him to understand, when the levy begins to expand, that the crucial moment when he took the great decision boldly to shoulder that burden for the rest of the dairy farmers in his constituency throughout the province of Munster, is now. Now is the moment when Deputy Donegan and his colleagues are bracing their shoulders to bear this burden.  This Money Resolution, taken in conjunction with the Bill, makes provision that in no circumstances may the Minister for Agriculture contribute more than two-thirds of the export subsidy required to dispose of the expanding production of creamery milk.  We are all hopeful that, having established An Bord Bainne, we shall get further markets and we are substantially agreed amongst ourselves that getting further markets is an essential pre-requisite to expanding production.  The Fianna Fáil Government claim that as production expands the surplus over and above the domestic demand must be sold abroad.  The theory is that whatever the burden of cost that has to be borne, the dairy farmers will bear their fair share of it.  I do no not think I am going beyond the strict relevance of this Money Resolution.</P>

In any case, these two valiant soldiers are here to face the music and I want to know what music they will have to face.  As production expands, as our exportable surplus grows one-third of the necessary funds will be paid by the dairy farmers of the country.  Many Deputies coming from urban constituencies will shrug their shoulders and say why should they not pay it?  I shall make the case that it is an unjust and inequitable burden.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am submitting to the House that the limitation imposed by the Bill on the right of the Minister to contribute to the Central Fund is specifically stated to be two-thirds; it cannot be more and it may be less. The Minister might announce at any time that he is going to contribute half.  But there is an upward limit, not a specific proportion but an upward limit, on his discretion of two-thirds of the total cost.  That leaves a gap of one-third to be filled, and I think I am entitled to comment on that fact.  If the Bill said the Minister may meet the entire cost of the export subsidy then a different situation might arise.  Then, I could only deal with the moneys payable from the Central Fund <Col N="1286" /> but here is a provision whereby the Minister can meet only two-thirds of the cost.</P>
      <P>I think a lot of people are inclined to say: &ldquo;Why should he meet any more, why should not the dairy farmers carry one-third of the expenditure&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

I am not here to plead that I have passed the buck of my responsibility to the committee, the commission, the board or anybody else.  We are the Oireachtas and that is a responsibility that nobody can take from our shoulders except the people who sent us here.  I was not sent here to say: &ldquo;Oh, the Advisory Committee said that, so now we are all safe.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to make this case.  The only section of the community that has been required to meet the increased cost of living in this country from a diminishing income is the farmers. Does the House think it equitable that with our eyes wide open and in the condition in which our farmers stand at present, we should accept, as manifestly and incontrovertibly correct, that one-third of the entire burden of finding further export markets for the increased production which we urge upon them is to be borne by the farmers themselves?  There is no other section of the community upon which that demand is made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am saying.  I think the Ceann Comhairle, with his nimble mind, ought to be able to jump a step ahead of what I <Col N="1287" /> am saying and see the argument I am making and not call me to order in the middle of the argument that I am formulating.  That was the next phrase I was going to utter.  This demand has not been made on any other section of the community. Civil servants, Gardaí, local authority employees and everybody in receipt of wages and salaries, have been encouraged by the Government to get the various organisations concerned to seek appropriate adjustments in their incomes to meet the increased cost of living&mdash;and remember the increased cost of living is directly attributable to Government decision in respect of the prices of bread, of butter and of flour.  The only section of the community in the country at present who are told: &ldquo;You must accept and bear that increased burden with everybody else but you must take whatever income you get to help you to bear it&rdquo; are the farmers and in the period in which the income of everybody else was deliberately raised to meet the cost, the farmers' income has dropped by £19,000,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>The farmers are receiving £19,000,000 less than they were getting in 1957, when the increase in the cost of living was initiated.  That increased cost of living now amounts to&mdash;I think&mdash;21 points.  It was 17, and four more points have gone on in the last cost-of-living figure published three days ago.  Now, this Financial Resolution says to the dairy farmers of the country: &ldquo;Redouble your efforts; further expand your output but take notice that it will be the obligation of the Milk Board under this Bill to market it; we will give them authority under Financial Resolution to make the levy and we are providing under this Resolution that the Minister may not contribute from the Central Fund more than two-thirds of the cost.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite and their colleagues have a duty to point out to their constituents that they must brace themselves for the reintroduction of the levy on creamery milk and for the knowledge that, in respect of themselves, instead of getting any help to <Col N="1288" /> bear the burden of the increased cost of living, they must face the prospect of getting less for what they produce, the more they produce of it.  That is an important fact that every Deputy ought to have in mind when dealing with this Money Resolution.</P>
    <P>I do not believe Deputy Donegan or Deputy Doherty regards this as a fair or equitable arrangement, and they really ought to tell us what they think.  I would not complain had we taken measures to ensure that the cost of living for our farmers was kept stable, as we sought to keep it stable. I foresaw, and so did the Government of which I was a member, the very development which has taken place, namely, that if we let the cost of living run away, every organised element in our community would, rightly and justly, claim that incomes ought to be appropriately adjusted and the one section of the community which would be left at the mercy of the waves would be the farmers, with special reference to the small farmers. And that is the situation that has arisen.  They are getting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall not press the matter further.  I want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that, as the cost of living rises, we are giving notice to the farmers that the cost of the levy to them on creamery milk will also rise.  The Minister by this Money Resolution is strictly restricted to a maximum contribution of two-thirds of the cost of the export subsidy. The farmers will have to bear the balance.  I do not think it is fair to tell the farmers that they must meet an increased cost of living of 21 points and, at the same time, experience a reduction in their total annual income of £19,000,000 per annum; and inform them also, in that context, that we are going to levy, and levy again, on any <Col N="1289" /> increased quantities of creamery milk they may in future produce.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have his chance of replying.  A few moments ago we heard him say that the Advisory Committee recommended this.  That bears out the fears we expressed on the Second Reading.  We said then that we were fearful that this was intended purely as a &ldquo;passing of the buck&rdquo; measure and we would, in future, be denied the forum of this House to make inquiries into the administration of the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that the levy, which he imposed for the first time in this State on the production of milk to creameries, has been suspended.  I should like to know how the levy extracted was used, for what purpose, and the consequences that flowed from it, plus the manner in which the moneys collected were expended.  I believe we should vote the full 100 per cent. cost of the subsidisation of any exportable surplus we have.  I want to show now some of the effects that will flow from the enactment of this measure, if the House passes it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The milk suppliers to creameries had a guaranteed price until the present Minister introduced his levy. The levy is at the moment in a state of suspension but it is proposed to put it back once more on the backs of our primary producers through the medium of this Money Resolution.  Is the Minister satisfied that there will not be <Col N="1290" /> grave uneasiness, to put it mildly, amongst the milk producers at the loss of the guaranteed price, remembering that the guarantee was given to them as an inducement to produce more.  It would be in the interests of everybody if more were produced either industrially or agriculturally because we should thereby achieve a higher standard of living for the country as a whole.  We must admit that on the road towards higher production we have experienced very, very grave difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Ceann Comhairle I will relate what I am saying to the charge on the Central Fund. I hold that the entire charge should fall on the Central Fund, and not just two-thirds of it.  If the farmers produce more, it is quite obvious that they will suffer a reduction in their incomes under this proposed scheme.  The Minister created another board on another occasion, An Bord Gráin.  He imposed a levy on wheat growing.  We all know what happened.  We are dealing now with another board, An Bord Bainne.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is travelling very far beyond the scope of this Money Resolution.  We are dealing with the charge that will fall on the Central Fund in the administration of this Bill. If the Deputy wishes to refer to any particular charge on the dairy farmers that should fall relevantly for discussion on the particular section imposing the charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  There are only two parties who can create this fund&mdash;the State and the farmers.  It is intended under this that the State will provide not more than two-thirds of the cost.  The farmers will have to pay one-third at least.  That burden on the farmers will be detrimental to their future and the future of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the charge on the Central Fund is insufficient.  We all hope the results it is claimed will result will be harvested but there will be a very heavy charge for the subsidisation of this board.  We are being asked now to confine the State to a contribution of not more than two-thirds of the cost. We consider that inequitable because the other contribution of one-third which will be sought from the farmers is something that is not imposed on the backs of other producers.  It is inequitable that the House should give the Minister this opportunity of relieving the Government of their responsibilities and transfer those responsibilities on to the backs of people who are unable to carry them.</P>

      <P>Speaking as a representative of the dairy farmers who will be engaged in the production of this milk, I would very much like to see the State indemnify us against any losses that may be incurred by this Board, but there is another side to the picture.  One of the things we hope this Board will do is to provide a marketing organisation abroad to deal efficiently with our produce.  Therefore, in justice, I do not think we <Col N="1294" /> could expect it to operate without some contribution from the dairy industry in the form of bearing a share of the losses that may occur, if any.</P>
      <P>By and large, I think the dairy farmers would much prefer to be in a position to operate independently rather than to have to come to the State for a contribution to carry on their business.  I think that, generally, they would be satisfied if the State bears two-thirds of any losses that may arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 4 I must say that I do not approve of setting up those State-sponsored bodies and giving them similar powers and functions as were given to bodies set up under other Acts.  One of my main reasons for objecting is that we have <Col N="1297" /> found from experience, that when permission from this House was given to establish these bodies, we were informed that it might be in the interest of all concerned that they should take over the functions previously centred in this House and that they would be much better able to administer whatever authority was given to them.</P>
      <P>The question of milk and the disposal of milk and milk products has been a very controversial one in this country for some years past.  We have had frequent discussion in this House on the matter and I think that these discussions served a very useful purpose. It is only right and proper that any member of this House should, if he thought it necessary, ask questions regarding this important industry.  The Minister has told us to-day that on the passage of this Bill through the House this controversy on the question of milk and milk products will never arise again because no questions will be answered on the basis that it will be a matter for the board.</P>
      <P>We must be terribly careful in this House before we give authority to any group of persons to carry out such important duties as are being handed over under this measure.  We are told that these bodies are completely autonomous and independent of the House and that they can do as they like without being required to report back to us except for an annual report which will give us little or no right to raise questions in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of boards and commissions have, up to this, served useful purposes for Ministers and Governments.  This is not the first time a board has been established to deal with the problem of milk.  There was a previous board under the name of a commission but it had not the power or functions that the proposed board will have to deal with the price of milk.  That board was in existence some four years ago, I think.  The board served its purpose, so far as Ministers for Agriculture were concerned at the time, because when the question of increasing the price of milk was raised in this House we were told that the commission was sitting and <Col N="1298" /> that their report was awaited.  After four years the Report was hatched out and we know the kind of chicken we got.</P>

I think the actual sum was in the region of £40,000 but in any case was not less than £30,000.  That was wanton waste of public funds.  The Report of the Commission was never referred to by the Minister in this House in any formal fashion.  No good whatsoever came out of it.</P>

      <P>It was a measure that kept Deputies quiet for four years and kept the interested organisations throughout the country quiet, awaiting the outcome of the Commission and hoping that when the Report would be available there would be no more problems so far as milk was concerned.</P>
      <P>A similar situation is developing at the present time.  The Minister would hardly get away with setting up another commission similar to the one that was set up in 1955 or 1956.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, 1952.  He has thought out a better plan.  He says, &ldquo;I think we will try a board&rdquo; and he has given us this Bill and established a Board to deal with this important industry.  He has also made it quite clear to us that we will have no further functions in the matter and no opportunity of raising questions in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the tendency of Government in that direction continues there should be an appraisal of our whole system in this country.  Some time ago we established <Col N="1299" /> a Minister for the Gaeltacht and a few weeks following the establishment of that post, at the usual expense to public funds, a measure was introduced in the House vesting all its functions in a State-sponsored body. Then we established a similar post of Minister for Transport and Power and at the same time vested all the functions coming within that Ministry in State-sponsored bodies who are completely independent of this House. Now, the Minister for Agriculture is following suit and is divesting himself of important functions relating to one of the most important items in the whole agricultural field and he is now saying, &ldquo;We will get rid of that so far as the House is concerned and hand it over to a Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We all know how Boards are made up.  Probably we will get some capable men and fair representation with, of course, a few political cronies thrown in.  That is the usual set-up in a Board and possibly the selection of boards in that manner not confined to any particular Government and the political people may be just as good as any of the others.  I do not approve of that system and I completely disagree with handing over our functions here as elected representatives of the people to bodies such as the body that it is proposed to set up under this Bill.</P>
    <P>We must assume when the Minister feels that it is necessary to set up a Board that he is dissatisfied with the services being rendered by the officers of his Department who are dealing with these matters at the present time.  I cannot see the need for the establishment of such a Board.  The Minister has just told us that he will transfer the very same officers who are at present dealing with these questions in his Department to an Bord Bainne and that it is the same personnel who will be dealing with these problems, with the addition of the newly appointed members of the Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My main disagreement with this measure, which I <Col N="1300" /> voice as forcefully and as firmly as I can, is with the setting up of these boards and giving autonomous powers and making them completely independent of this House.  That should not be the case.  If the Minister found it necessary to establish a board or a body to deal with this question he could establish the board making it subordinate to this House and ensure that any question which might be troubling members of the House would be relevant to be raised here to be answered by the Minister to the best of his ability.  I completely and entirely disagree with the establishment of this Board on this basis.  I can envisage farmer Deputies in this House in future years raising questions about milk and milk prices and being told that it is not relevant and that the matter is entirely for the Board.</P>
      <P>If we continue to hand over powers to State-sponsored bodies, there is no longer any need for 14 Ministers of State and a number of Ministries could be grouped.  Seeing that Ministers are not utilising their functions at the present time, in the majority of cases, but are handing them over to boards, possibly the Ministry of Transport and Power and the Ministry of Agriculture could be grouped together.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, is it not a fact that the Board which is to be set up under the terms of this Bill is a board which has been recommended by the very competent committee that examined this whole question? I should like to point out that the committee was representative of the producers interests and they considered that this solution was worthy of experiment On Second Reading I made the point that the producers have for a long time felt that the experiment <Col N="1301" /> of a board is well worth undertaking. What is the point in the objection to the setting-up of a board on the part of producers when they have asked for that themselves?</P>

      <P>A levy is here being imposed on the producers of milk so as to export the surplus produce to foreign markets.  That was not the position in the past.  The cost was borne 100 per cent. by the Exchequer.  I want to safeguard the producers.  If the producers have a case to make and if they come to me as their elected representative I feel that I should be perfectly entitled to ask questions here on behalf of the producers if they feel that the Board is not doing its duty.  A case can be made to have that matter brought before Dáil Éireann.  It would help the board to do a better job; it would help to keep it in its proper place instead of its being so high and mighty that you could not even ask a question. Boards are not infallible.  They can and do make mistakes.  We want to ensure that this board will not make mistakes and that it will be kept on the right road for the marketing of our produce.  This board should be composed chiefly of good salesmen, men who will go abroad and get markets for our dairy produce.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment A1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 28, to delete &ldquo;nine&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;eleven&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The substance of my amendment is to provide for an increase of the board membership from nine to eleven in order to provide that two additional members would be elected, one to represent the Irish Cream Exporters Association and one for the Irish Creamery Managers' Association.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister pointed out that under a separate section provision is made whereby creameries generally can elect a member who would be specifically interested in the export of cream, but I would suggest that the correct procedure would be to select a member from the Cream Exporters' Association which I understand represents practically all the creameries in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the sucess of this association in a very short period of years in securing a very valuable foothold on the British market&mdash;something like eight per cent. of the total British sales of cream&mdash;a person specifically elected from that association would be a very useful addition to the Board.  This association has shown very commendable initiative in establishing this outlet for a non-subsidised dairy product and by so <Col N="1308" /> doing has saved a considerable amount of money to the Exchequer.  They have given a lead to the other sections of the dairying industry and certainly if the board is now to take over their activities&mdash;which means in effect their goodwill and the services they have given to their customers&mdash;it would be only right they should be directly represented on the board.  If the Minister cannot see his way to accede to this request I suggest he should allow this successful association to continue its exploitation of the market on its own.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second part of my contention, I would like the Minister to make room on the board for a nominee of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association.  I do not know what views the Minister holds on an organisation like that being represented, but I do suggest that a body which caters for the technical and administrative side of the industry should be represented on the board.  I would ask the Minister to accept my amendment in that regard.</P>
    <P>I think it very desirable that apart from the producers and those with marketing experience and the other interests involved that there should be somebody there specifically charged with knowledge of the technical side of the business and also with the management and administrative side of it. For that reason I ask the Minister to accept as the second extra member a nominee of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with these two amendments, there is a great deal to be said for recognising in our legislation the success and energy of voluntary organisations that have made a material contribution to desirable economic ends by their own exertions.  I told the story on the Second Stage of this Bill&mdash;and I do not propose to repeat it&mdash;of my personal conversion to the machinery that had been voluntarily set up by the cream exporters' organisation. That organisation, by its constitution, represents practically all the creameries and certainly it represents all the creameries that want to join it and share in its benefits.  It is true that it was practically the only branch of the <Col N="1309" /> dairy produce industry that was exporting dairy produce without any State subsidy of any kind and making a profit which it was distributing to creameries.</P>
      <P>There was a board drawn from the participating creameries who operated this down through the years.  The proposal in subsection (8) of Section 9 is that the creameries in electing one of their representatives must choose one from the south, one from the north and one member representative of the cream exporting creameries. That is no more than to say that they should be representative of the creameries because all creameries, or very nearly all, are associated with the cream exporters' organisation.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister with propriety could have gone a step further and said that one of the persons to be elected shall be a member of the cream exporters' committee or whatever that body was that actually operated the cream marketing scheme thus ensuring that there would be on An Bord Bainne a member of the voluntary body which built up that measure of co-operation within the co-operative movement and successfully exploited that market for cream in Britain to the great advantage of our own farmers, as opposed to the other system which resulted in serious losses to our farmers when fierce competition beats down the price of fresh cream in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would have been a suitable thing to see that one of the members of that voluntary body represented the cream exporting creameries and it would be a good headline hereafter that where a voluntary body put its shoulder to the wheel and got something done without coming and dumping their problem on the Minister's doorstep, he was prepared to recognise the public spirit and success of their exertions if and when a situation arose in which it was deemed expedient to merge their activities in a larger activity such as is envisaged in this Bill.  I think the Minister would have been wise to recognise the identity of the executive that operated that cream scheme and <Col N="1310" /> put one of the members on the board in the initial stage.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the view expressed here on the second amendment&mdash;I think I mentioned it on the Second Stage of the Bill&mdash;that there is a great volume of technical experience and wisdom in the Irish Creamery Managers' Association.  It may well be that this process of election will throw up some creamery manager as representative of some of the creamery groups mentioned but I do not think it would have been any harm to have some member of this board representative of the Irish creamery managers who would be in a position to advise the board on what is practical from their point of view and what is not and on the special administrative difficulties that might arise in the event of certain decisions being taken by the board.</P>
    <P>We have all had experience of boards functioning and planning to take decisions which subsequently turned out to be in practice impossible to operate.  It is not only boards that have that experience; Ministers, managing directors, executives of every kind may often contemplate embarking on a course of conduct which appears to be expeditious and efficient and, perhaps, a short cut and it is only when they consult their administrative assistants that it is pointed out to them that everybody has wanted to do that for years but that it gives rise to this difficulty and that difficulty and that, by the time you have surmounted these administrative difficulties, you discover that the remedy you are now proposing is worse than the disease you are trying to remedy.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of advice that I think a representative of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association could advantageously be present to give at meetings of a board of this kind.  I sympathise with the Minister in his desire to refrain from expanding the membership of this board indefinitely &mdash;and there is that danger.  The Minister was recommended to establish a board of eight; he has himself expanded it to nine in order to make provision, as I understand it, for the cream exporters and naturally he will be reluctant to expand it to 10 for the <Col N="1311" /> reason that he will say: &ldquo;If I add another now some other interest will come forward and claim that type of additional representation too.&rdquo;  With that difficulty I sympathise but I think the Minister would be entitled to say &ldquo;I am not giving this extra place to a representative body purely for the purpose of representation; I am giving it because I think it is desirable to have on this board a representative of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association who would be charged, not to speak for the creamery or district he was sent up to represent whether it be the south or the north or the cream exporting creameries, but who would be charged to bring before the board in the discharge of his duty the vocational and technical views of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association with all the accumulated experience they possess.</P>
    <P>In short, I am not asking for representation for the Irish Creamery Managers' Association; I am asking for the addition of a representative of the Irish Creamery Managers' Association to the board on behalf of the board itself for I believe that the presence of such a representative would make the efficient despatch of their business easier and more successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there is any grave reason for discussing at length these two amendments the purpose of which is to increase the size of the board so as to achieve or secure representation for two interests. There are a few things that have to be considered when a board is being set up.  One must consider the size of it and the interests to be represented. From those two aspects alone, I think a board of nine is large enough.  It certainly looks large enough when one examines the interests each member is selected, or elected, to represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the points made by Deputy Russell, I really do not understand their meaning or their purpose, and neither do I understand some of the publicity and some of the allegations in that publicity relative to the charge that the cream exporters are not represented on the board.  As the Leader of the Opposition has stated, I <Col N="1312" /> deliberately increased the number in order to give such representation. Having done so, it is not easy to understand why one should be charged with denying representation to them.  It is not correct to say that because the election of this representative was not confined to the 30 or 40 creameries participating in the production of cream for export they have no representation.</P>
    <P>I made the gesture.  All the creameries in the country are at liberty to be members of that association.  As far as I know almost 98 per cent.  of them are members.  All of them, irrespective of whether or not they produce cream for export, participate in any profits that accrue from that effort.  Surely it is not unreasonable&mdash;I certainly did not consider it unreasonable when I was taking the decision&mdash;that they should all be given a vote as to who would directly represent them as far as cream is concerned on a board constituted of nine members.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the matter from that angle it is difficult to see how anyone could resist agreeing with me as to the lack of reason behind the case that is being made.  I suspect that this case is really a two-edged sword. It is a two-edged weapon.  It was made by Creamery Managers' Association in the first instance.  As a result of my decision not to give that representation on this board, they came to see me and, in the course of our discussions, we covered this question of the representation of the cream producers and the representation for creamery managers.  It was as a result of that discussion that I decided to give them representation on the board for the cream producers.  We had long and protracted arguments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the creamery managers association, I explained perhaps too briefly, my attitude in that regard in my concluding speech on the Second Reading.  I had several reasons for taking the decision I did.  I told the creamery managers during the course of our interview that I regarded them as a decent body of men, quite competent in the main but, as an association, they were really a trade union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not mind if what passed between us was chiselled out on Nelson's Pillar.  I have said here on more than one occasion that I have no objection to their being an association for the purpose of looking after their own interests but I could not understand why, as an association designed for that purpose, they were entitled in any very special way to representation on a board which will have in all probability possibly two, three, or four creamery managers.  I expressed my dislike the other night of, and my displeasure at, the thought that a board such as this would be controlled by a majority of creamery managers.  I should not regard that as as a good thing at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the justice of their claim for representation, there are other people who must be considered. There are the chocolate crumb interests.  Provision is made for the selection of such a representative and it is quite possible that a creamery manager might be the representative of that industry.  There are comparatively few people engaged in the powdered milk industry.  It is possible they might select a creamery manager as their representative.  That would be two creamery managers straightaway. It is possible a creamery manager might be nominated for the South or for the North.  It is probable that he would secure election because of his <Col N="1314" /> being better known than an ordinary person.</P>
    <P>This decision was not arrived at hastily.  First of all, I met the cream producers and the Creamery Managers' Association.  There is certain designated representation for them so far as the board is concerned.  The representative of the cream producers will be elected by the members of the association, all of whom will benefit. Why would they not be interested in the future?  I have told you of our discussions with the Creamery Managers' Association.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>By the co-operative societies of the country.  I do not think there is any case whatever.  The board is large and representative enough.  Not only can they elect creamery managers, but when they make a decision as to whom they will employ to run their affairs, they can employ a creamery manager if they wish.  The Association is all right to serve the purpose for which it was established, but I do not think it is entitled to such special consideration as is pleaded here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no knowledge of them, ulterior or otherwise.  The Minister is, perhaps, better advised on that than I am.  I am concerned with the representations I got from constituents of mine in the most important dairying area in the country.  In spite of the Minister's remarks, the Irish Cream Exporters' Association do not appear to be satisfied they are adequately represented on this board. For that reason I put down this amendment.  Even though the Minister says he has met them fairly, the problem remains that the Association do not regard themselves as adequately represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> I should like to say this to the Minister.  After all, the other interests represented on the Board, the manufacturers of cheese and chocolate crumb, are mainly nominated by the manufacturers concerned, an association of the manufacturers or some organisation representing the manufacturers.  Therefore, I do not think it is unfair or unreasonable to suggest that the Association, which the Minister himself says represents 98 per cent. of the interests concerned, should have the right of nomination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The simplest way would be to write it into the Bill.  In regard to the Creamery Managers' Association, I made the point, and was subsequently supported by Deputy Dillon, that the only good reason for having the representatives of the creamery managers on this board would be because of their technical knowledge, administrative experience and their general ability in management of the creamery industry, and not for any other ulterior purpose.  I do not know how seriously the Minister feels that this board might be controlled by the Creamery Managers' Association.  I should like to say quite explicitly that I certainly would not like to see the board controlled by the Creamery Managers' Association, but I think the Minister's fears in that regard are completely unfounded.  I cannot but regard his suggestion as untenable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> The fact that the managers belong to a trade union should not preclude them from membership.  If a creamery manager, as such, would be a useful adjunct to the board, he should go on the board.  I quite agree the Minister may have his point of view that a board of nine is large enough.  If he has that view, that is the end of it. But the expansion of the board by one or two extra members should not be prevented if, in so doing, the board can be strengthened, made more efficient and more competent to carry out the very onerous duties we all agree will fall on its shoulders.  If it is not successful, it will be a very big blow to the dairy industry in general. For that reason, the board would be much improved by the addition of these two extra members.  I would advise the Minister that the Advisory Committee did suggest that a nominee of the Creamery Managers' Association would be one of the representatives on the board.  I would like to ask the Minister to reconsider his decision and allow these two extra representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>From reading the provisions of the Bill, I think the Minister has shown very great confidence in the Cream Exporters' Association.  He increased the membership of the board from eight to nine in order to give that organisation an opportunity of being represented.  To my mind, there appears to be only one difference of opinion.  From the way subsection (8) of Section 9 is drafted, it appears the Minister is satisfied that the Cream Exporters Association would have the effective representation intended for them. Reading that section, I think there is some little doubt, which may cause trouble, about the association getting someone competent to represent it.  If the Minister would re-examine that, he might be able to clear the matter up for the Report Stage.  These people have the representation, but they have not got direct representation.  Other organisations have got direct representation, and that is what the Cream Exporters' Association is looking for. The Minister seems to think that the other method is equitable.  I think <Col N="1317" /> if the Minister cleared up the matter I have referred to, the Association would be quite satisfied.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the public had a right-of-way for <Col N="1320" /> the last 70 years to the foreshore where this wall has been erected.  In view of that and in view of the serious damage likely to be done to tourism will the Parliamentary Secretary not consider it his business to take some steps in the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet seen the report referred to; excerpts from it, published in the newspapers, have been brought to my notice.</P>
      <P>I am informed by British Railways that on the Holyhead/Dún Laoghaire route the number of scheduled extra sailings inwards in the 1960 pre-Christmas period is 12, compared with 9 in 1959.  The number of extra scheduled sailings outwards is 5 in each year.  On this basis capacity would be available in the pre-Christmas period, 1960, for some 42,675 passengers inwards which compares with 27,164, the actual number carried during the corresponding period in 1959.  I am now informed, however, that two of the inward extra sailings for the coming Christmas have been cancelled because of lack of demand. Additional sailings will also be provided on the Rosslare/Fishguard route.  The operating companies have assured me that if intending travellers comply with the sailing ticket requirements, to which considerable publicity has been given, the accommodation should be more than adequate and no avoidable hardship should be encountered by passengers.</P>
      <P>The position is complicated this year by the foot and mouth disease precautions.  Full publicity has been given to the co-operation which is required of passengers arriving in this country and, if they comply, there should be no serious inconvenience to travellers at the point of disembarkation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that I have lost no opportunity of impressing upon British Railways the need to improve the standard of comfort on the trains and on their vessels.  I have had several personal discussions with the new Chairman of the London Midland <Col N="1323" /> Region Board who has expressed his determination to secure improvement in the service.  Many detailed proposals have been discussed with British Railways by the officers of my Department and of Bord Fáilte, which I hope will lead to further improvements.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that, although each year we are told that there should be no further hardships and that conditions should be improved, we still have those dreadful conditions for Irish people coming back and forth.  Would the Minister consider it advisable to take up the problem with the British Transport Commission which controls the entire system so that he could ensure that none of the conditions complained of would be allowed to arise again? Only yesterday the matter was raised in the House of Lords.</P>

These discussions take place on many occasons and fairly frequently.  Every possible step has been taken, as I have said, and I hope that the new Chairman of the Midland Board will be able to carry out improvements in the service. I should also mention, however, that it may be unusual but in the past year some of the most unpleasant experiences have not occurred during the actual great peak.  They have occurred either before or after it.  That applies in particular, if I remember rightly, to last Christmas.  Some of the most unpleasant occurrences, of passengers being left behind, have not taken place on crisis days but on days shortly before or after.</P>

Nevertheless, one can make comparisons with the very great volume of traffic between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead, which is in fact the second port so far as the volume of traffic is concerned, Dover being the first.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was announced in the public Press on 2nd December, 1960, that the Government had appointed an import quota of 125,000 pairs of leather footwear for the period 1st January, 1961, to 31st December, 1961, and that in addition, applications <Col N="1326" /> for supplementary licences to import footwear would be considered.</P>

      <P>Licences to import leather footwear may be granted only to persons whose names are entered in the Register of Importers maintained in accordance with the Leather Footwear Quota Order.  The Control of Imports (Amendment) Act, 1937, provides that an applicant for registration must carry on or propose to carry on a business in connection with which or as part of which it is, in the opinion of the Minister, necessary or usual to import goods of a description to which the relevant Quota Order applies.

      <P>A fresh survey of all the principal mineral localities of South Kerry (south of a line from Killorglin to Killarney) has been made in recent years by the Geological Survey Office. The areas surveyed included Ross Island, Muckross, Valentia Island, and Coad area near Caherdaniel, and the Kenmare Valley.  Information, additional to that already available, resulted from the survey.  This information is not in a form in which I could include it in this reply, but it is available at the Survey Office to all interested parties.</P>

    <P>Since November, 1959, three areas, namely, part of Valentia Island, the Coad area near Caherdaniel and an area between Kenmare and Kilgarvan, have been prospected by Irish Base <Col N="1328" /> Metals Ltd., Balbriggan, Co. Dublin, under the authority of prospecting licences granted by me.  The Company have stated that they have carried out a considerable amount of exploration in the area between Kenmare and Kilgarvan, and in accordance with the terms of their licence they have furnished in confidence information as to the results. They have, however, made no statement in regard to any possibilities of the mines being reopened.</P>

My present information is that the volume of the extra traffic will not be substantial and it is not clear that it will necessitate any special improvement works which cannot be executed under the Council's normal improvement grants.

      <P>On 31st August, 1960, a Garda report was received from the Department of Justice indicating that the accused persons had appeared before a special sitting of the Clonmel District Court on the 22nd and 23rd August, 1960, and had been returned for trial at Clonmel Circuit Court on the 18th October, 1960.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>At that date, subsequent to receiving that report and as a result of being clear in my mind that it was not a question of suggesting that they were connected with this case, I would then in the normal circumstances have gone ahead and confirmed the appointments which I later did. The real reason I did not was out of courtesy to the Deputy in respect to a reply I had given to him earlier in June.  The Deputy may ask why I did not then&mdash;as I should have done at a later date without awaiting the conclusion of the court case&mdash;sanction these appointments.  The reasons are these: In September, and up to the end of the first half year from the <Col N="1339" /> point of view of rate collection&mdash;the six months from the beginning of April to the end of September&mdash;there was nothing those people who had been proposed could have done, had their appointments been confirmed, in so far as the collection of the half year's rates was concerned.  The second consideration&mdash;a far more pressing one&mdash; was when the local Council disregarded the fact that the Council for the Tipperary South Riding had already made three appointments for the three permanent vacancies.  They proceeded at a later meeting, on November 2nd, to send out three temporary rate collectors to do the job.</P>
      <P>There were no vacancies at that time for three temporary rate collectors or for anybody else and it was because of that, together with the fact that matters could not only have been very complicated by this proposal to appoint temporary collectors where no vacancies existed, but that it could have complicated an undertaking by the South Riding Co. Council who had already proposed three people for the permanent vacancies.  The three men appointed to the permanent jobs by the South Riding Co. Council could have taken legal action to ascertain why the jobs given to them were given to somebody else.  That was going on in the second half year of the rate collection period and it was getting on into the total collection period.  That fact, together with other factors, forced my hand and I was left no choice.  I did not willingly do it at the time and I certainly did not intend any discourtesy to the Deputy or to the House. There was nothing to preclude sanction to three appointments already made by the South Riding Co. Council.</P>

      <P>I was reasonable in dealing with this matter.  Had I not been so reasonable, these questions might not now be arising.  Had I proceeded to do as I wanted to at the time the proposals came up, there being no knowledge as to why I should not do so, I should then have proceeded with the sanction were it not that I had told Deputy Mulcahy that in courtesy I was prepared to wait.  I have now told him the reasons why I did not go the whole hog.  I was in a position without question&mdash;and I do not think the Deputy is questioning the right of a Minister, to confirm these appointments at the first time of asking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not reflecting on either the Minister's graciousness or his actions in this matter, but is he not aware that in answering questions in the House on this specific case he revealed to this House that the statutes, as they stand, dealing with councils appear to be such that if a <Col N="1342" /> council, at a particular meeting, passes a resolution making an appointment and sends on that resolution to the Minister&mdash;as, in this case, the council did&mdash;the Minister on the one hand and the council on the other have no powers to rescind the making of that appointment, although reasons of public interest might in various ways disclose themselves to suggest that the appointment ought not to be made? Therefore, I am asking the Minister if he will meet us in relation to the position as opened to the House by stating what are the statutory provisions, what is the statute and what are the terms of the statute, that would preclude a public body, having passed a resolution making an appointment and having sent it to the Minister, rescinding that appointment if there appeared to be public reasons dictating that action?  I am dealing with a detached question now on the facts in relation to the alleged law that the Minister has put before the House and the position in which the House therefore is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I assure the Deputy in relation to all his very grave fears that there is a perfectly straightforward method of dealing with what he fears could arise.  It is this.  The council having made its appointment, selected its people in the prescribed manner and having then submitted the name or names to the Department of Local Government, have ceased and have completed their function so far as that or those particular appointments are concerned.  At that stage the Minister may accept by sanction or reject by disapproval the person or persons concerned and back they go to the council to start all over again. What fear the Deputy may then have that something should emerge after the council have made their selection which would make it incumbent on the council and the Minister not to appoint a particular candidate &mdash; what that something could be that the Deputy has in mind that could arise and that would not operate in the Minister's mind to refuse sanction and yet would bring about a reversal by the council of their earlier decision is something beyond me.  I cannot visualise such a <Col N="1343" /> happening ever taking place.  If it did and goes further, if, for instance, the council were wrong and the Minister was wrong and a year later it was found that they were in fact both wrong, there is a perfectly logical way of unloading the undesirable and that is by the manager then doing as he is required to do.  He is required to furnish a certificate of suitability at the end of a year which is regarded as probationary.  If, at the end of that year the manager operating his functions in his own way, does not certify that person, surely that is the last safeguard anybody would seek?  If that were not sufficient, if subsequent to the final certificate on any rate collector, that rate collector proved unworthy, unsuitable or unsatisfactory in character or otherwise, he can be removed. Rate collectors have been removed and I have no doubt that unfortunately it will arise that certain of them may have to be removed in the future.</P>

      <P>In accordance with United Nations principles, once the Irish Contingent was made available to the Force in the Congo, all members of it received their orders exclusively from the United Nations and the day-to-day measures and dispositions necessary to achieve the purpose of the Force are determined by the Supreme Commander, the Army authorities here having no function in such matters.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances communication between the Contingent and the authorities at home must be restricted to matters of routine administration and all reports and communications must be in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Supreme Commander, acting for the Secretary-General of the United Nations.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands what is the present position in regard to the scheme for <Col N="1351" /> the provision of new housing for persons in the Shannon Valley who suffer from flooding; how many houses are envisaged; how many have been completed, and when the scheme is likely to be finalised; whether he is aware that houses of people in the Clonowen area of Athlone are under water to the extent of one foot in places; and, if so, why alternative accommodation under the new housing scheme has not been found for people in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme provides for a maximum of 76 housing projects. The number completed is 31.  An additional 18 are under construction and are expected to be completed within a few months.  Some farmers in Clonowen have so far failed to co-operate in the scheme and cannot be helped until they do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in the Clonowen area of Bunniribba there are three.  Houses which have been flooded for the last ten days to a depth of one foot?  In the village of Cunny two Houses have been flooded, and there are young children in the houses. In the village of Drumlosh another house has been flooded over the same period.  So far, the Land Commission have made no proposal and no effort to give alternative accommodation to a number of these farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's allegations.  In the Clonowen area some of the people have failed to co-operate.  The scheme is rather like a rearrangement scheme and needs the co-operation of the people concerned.  Some will not migrate although holdings have, been offered to them.  We also have some people there who will not accept the sites suggested by the Land Commission, and want to build on sites which, in the view of the Land Commission, would be again flooded.  That is one of the problems in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay, but I must tell the Minister that <Col N="1352" /> his information is inaccurate.  With regard to the three houses I have mentioned in the Bunniribba area, there should be no difficulty with regard to alternative sites for the simple reason that the Land Commission have not made my proposals to these people since the original scheme was envisaged. How can it be suggested then that these people have failed to co-operate with the Land Commission? The Minister's point with regard to one or two not co-operating is perfectly correct, but I suggest it is unfair to blame all the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose six licensed cheese manufacturers put up nominations and a seventh licensed manufacturer does not put up a nomination, does that mean the Minister says: &ldquo;Well, you have not all duly nominated somebody; therefore, I shall make the nomination myself&rdquo;? Or is the position that if <Col N="1360" /> any licensed cheese manufacturer makes a nomination, and there is no other nomination, that person will be the representative of the cheese manufacturers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise what that means?  Let us say there are ten licensed cheese manufacturers. The tenth manufacturer himself wishes to be nominated.  He seeks the consent of the other nine. He cannot get it because they want somebody else.  He goes to the Minister and says: &ldquo;The other nine fellows will not nominate me.  Will you nominate me if I succeed in frustrating the other nine by refusing to join in nominating their candidate?&rdquo; The Minister says &ldquo;Yes, I will.&rdquo;  All that tenth manufacturer has to do is to say to the other line: &ldquo;Whoever you nominate, I shall not agree to him.&rdquo;  Therefore, when the due date passes, the right to nominate falls to the Minister and the Minister himself can nominate No. 10 although the other nine manufacturers want to nominate someone else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is something in the argument the Deputy has advanced, it is desirable to bring home to the organisations concerned that they must have some kind of arrangement between themselves for exchanging representation.  If there were three or four interests involved and they were obliged to nominate one person, they could say: &ldquo;We have agreed among ourselves that one concern will represent the various manufacturers on the Board.&rdquo;  The next time a vacancy occurred, another concern would have the representation.  I think it is better to force them into doing that than to have all the trouble and strife that would result from any other plan.</P>

      <P>The Minister is reserving the function of filling casual vacancies that may arise on the board. Those casual vacancies will be filled in the very same way as the original position was filled and the probability is that these casual vacancies may be filled by henchmen, if I may use that term, of the Government Party.  Whilst I agree that a Minister is a very responsible person and is entitled to have rather elaborate functions, our experience has been that, in the filling of vacancies by Ministers of State, the political qualifications of the applicants are the main ones concerned, and while I agree that the political qualifications of a person should not preclude him from the right to become a member of the board, at the same time, other qualifications should be taken into account as well.</P>

The only thing I can say in this regard is that the Minister for Agriculture, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, will have regard to the recommendations of the advisory body.</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) of this section provides:</P>
      <P>A grant under this section shall not be used to defray more than two-thirds of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) any loss incurred by the Board in relation to the export of milk products by the Board, or</P>
      <P>(b) any subsidy, grant, or other like payment made by the Board in relation to the export of milk products,</P>
      <P>and a purpose or condition which is inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection shall not be specified under subsection (2) or (3) of this section.</P>
      <P>This is the section which declares that the maximum contribution the Exchequer could make to the export subsidy is two-thirds of its cost and this is the section which provides that as our exports of dairy produce expand&mdash;I am glad to see that Deputy Clohessy is listening closely&mdash;the levy on creamery milk will grow.  Deputy Donegan says he thinks that is a most equitable arrangement and that no reasonable dairy farmer will object to it.  They will all cheerfully pay up and like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is an equitable arrangement.  I do not think it is reasonable to say that the dairy farmers should carry the whole burden of the cost of expanding the exports which the country urgently requires to balance its external trade.  It is notorious to anybody who knows his business that the international market in dairy produce is honeycombed with subsidies and State assistance of every <Col N="1372" /> sort and kind.  I admit that in respect of the subsidies provided by Denmark and Holland it is extremely difficult to detect the method by which they are supplied but it is well known to anyone who is dealing with international markets in dairy produce that extensive subsidies are provided and their dimensions are virtually unascertainable except by experts of the Government administration in those countries.  It is true that they present an exterior of being without subsidy of any kind and I am sorry to say that it has become the practice frequently to uphold these pretensions to our people as a justification for suggesting that the farmers are a kind of burden on the community here.</P>
    <P>This section now adopts the principle that in the future the more dairy produce the dairy farmers produce the more they will have to pay by way of levy in order to meet the cost of getting into the extra markets which they are now being urged to cater for. Deputy Donegan says he thinks that is fair and just and right.  I do not think it is.  Deputy Clohessy sits in silence.  Deputy Moher has entered the symposium and Deputy Ó Briain is smiling benevolently on this trinity of wisdom.</P>

And that is what we are told about it now and I can sympathise with the Minister and his colleagues who want to talk about anything else on earth but Section 31. I was delighted when the Deputy from Cork got up this morning to make his valiant intervention but I could not help feeling he had all the exterior appearance of a Christian martyr marching out and submitting to be tied to the stake.  As he braced his shoulders he looked down upon Deputy Moher and said to himself: &ldquo;I spoke and you did not.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It struck me very forcibly that Deputy Donegan was raising the cry of martyrdom and saying to himself: &ldquo;How can man die better than facing fearful odds?&rdquo;  I praise him for his values.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will not.  I guaranteed that it would never come lower.  Mind you, then the bob was worth more than 1/6d.  Now.  We were casually asked from these benches what 1/- was worth before Fianna Fáil got cracking.  A shilling in 1949 money is worth about 1/6d.  today. That was guaranteed as a minimum with freedom to get the best price the dairy farmers could.  They were the days when butter was selling on the British market for 470 shillings a cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil innocents will believe anything they swallow.  I believe Deputies Donegan and Clohessy believe all those stories.  I do not believe Deputy Moher believes them; he is far too shrewd a practitioner.  But it was he who told Deputies Donegan and Clohessy that story.  It was like <Col N="1374" /> the 84/- a barrel for wheat.  Deputy Moher told them that too.  That was what got him elected in East Cork. Then he wept on Deputy Corry's shoulders saying he was completely misled.  He is now misleading Deputies Donegan and Clohessy.  But bear in mind we are arguing about the events in 1949.  Some other time we can continue that argument.  I am talking about 1960 and 1961 now.  If this Bill provided a maximum levy there would be something to be said for it.  But obviously it does not do that.  Section 31 provides a maximum for the contributions which the Minister may make but it puts no ceiling whatever on the levy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No ceiling either way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only the mind of the Minister for Agriculture that could think of a ceiling under the floor.  That is the kind of mentality we are dealing with here.  When I speak of a ceiling I am talking about something on top. The Minister thinks the farmers of this country are like files that can walk on the ceiling.  There is a floor and the floor is that there should be no levy if there are no exports.  There is no ceiling on the fact that if exports of butter expand the levy on milk will go up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are getting your full market price in Britain you will not have a levy.  I would suggest to Deputy Moher and to Deputy Clohessy and the Deputy from Cork that they think of that closely and get all the consolation they can from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So we have got to that stage now.  All I am concerned with is what the dairy farmers will be called upon to pay and Section 31 is the instrument designed to extract from them a steadily growing levy on the price of milk.  I would remind the Minister that An Bord Gráin was <Col N="1375" /> established by legislation of this House for the economic marketing of the grain crops in this country.  The immediate consequence of that legislation was as levy of 4/6d. a barrel on the price of wheat which I had fixed and which the Fianna Fáil Party described as the cruellest imposition which was ever placed down on the suffering heads of the tillage farmers of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil hearts bled all over Ireland about the cruelly inadequate price I fixed for millable wheat. The setting up of An Bord Gráin meant that there was an immediate price reduction on wheat of 4/6d. per barrel.  Now the Minister is about to establish An Bord Bainne and Section 31 of the Bill, designed to do that, is also the section designed to do for milk what An Bord Gráil did for wheat last year and the year before.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the valiant soul of Deputy Donegan rises to meet the challenge of these events.  I admire his spirit of self sacrifice but I would remind him that his function here is not to play the role of Joan of Are going to the stake for the cause; his role here is to defend equity and justice for the agricultural community and I say it is not fair or just to require the agricultural community to carry all the increased costs and then to say they, alone in their circumstances, will be required to accept less and less for the labour that they do.  Warm as is my personal regard for Deputy Donegan, I think he does himself less than justice in appearing to proclaim that he thinks that the farmers are the only section, of the community for whom that kind of treatment is good enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know, under this section, if there is no export of anything from the country in the line of milk or milk products, would there be any levy then collected to maintain this Board?  This Board is going to cost a lot of money and is the money to provide for the running expenses of the Board to be met by the two-thirds which is being put up by the Minister or by the one-third which is being put up by the suppliers? <Col N="1376" /> There is bound to be a considerable amount of expense before any exports take place.  The nine members of the Board will cost £9,000 and their buildings and equipment will cost more and I should not like to have the producers asked to meet the first burden in that respect by putting a levy on them to pay the overhead expenses of the Board.</P>
      <P>I want to know from the Minister will this two-thirds balance that expenditure in the first instance?  I join with Deputy Dillon in saying that it is not fair to impose the complete one-third levy.  If the Minister could alter subsection 4 of Section 31, which reads &ldquo;a grant under this section shall not be used to defray more than two-thirds ...&rdquo;, to read &ldquo;a grant under this section shall not be used to defray less than two-thirds...&rdquo;, there might be some benefit in it.  The Minister might then see his way to increase the contribution from the State.  Under the subsection he cannot increase it. If the Minister could alter that subsection by substituting the word &ldquo;less&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;more&rdquo; it would be a safeguard for the farmers to ensure that they would not be maintain, perhaps too heavily, to maintain their exports.</P>
      <P>I should like to see exports growing but we must try to instil that confidence lacking so much in dairy farmers so that they will increase production. When we get a market, there will be continuity of supplies to enable us to hold our grip on that market.  I think the time has come when the Government should do a little more for the dairy farmer.  When we send out our agents to look for markets abroad for industry we do not ask the industrialists to pay a levy.  Industry is always highly protected.  Only last week we sent out agents to foreign countries to seek export markets and our industrialists did not have to pay a levy. If the Minister provided that the Exchequer would not pay less than two-thirds I think the House would then accept.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>These levies will enable the Board to meet its expenses, including the dairy industry's proportion of the deficit arising out of the export of milk products.  There are also provisions in Sections 36 and 37 for levies on butter sales and stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can very easily understand the consequential provisos mentioned in Sections 36 and 37 if the principle contained in Section 35 is accepted.  I want to draw the attention of the House to this important fact.  We have been keeping continually under our control in Parliament the whole question of levying farmers' milk, and any Minister for Agriculture who proposed such a levy had put upon him the obligation of coming before Dáil Éireann and justifying it to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Earlier to-day, on the question of the status of the Milk Board after the passage of this Bill, the Minister for Agriculture, I understood facetiously, interjected that after the passage of this Bill he would answer the Parliament for none of the things done in pursuit of the powers conferred on the Milk Board by this Bill. I do not know whether the Minister meant that seriously or not.  Perhaps he would say now did he mean that seriously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, if we enact legislation here giving powers to such a body, it will remain their responsibility to operate within the limits of the laws laid down by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, observe what we are being asked to do.  We are being asked now to confer on this body the power to levy anything they like on creamery milk, and nobody can raise the question in Dáil Éireann ever again.  Does any Deputy in this House want to do that?  Do we want to confer on a statutory body a power to levy any sum it likes on all the creamery milk delivered to any creamery in Ireland?  If any Deputy raises it here, he can be told it is none of his business and, if he has any inquiries to make, to address them to <Col N="1381" /> the Milk Board, that the Minister is not responsible and will not answer him.</P>
      <P>I think that is a crazy provision. Does Deputy Batt Donegan think it is proper for any Minister for Agricultural to say that he disowns hereafter all responsibility for the net price payable to farmers for milk delivered to creameries throughout the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  When the Board meets losses, for certain of those losses the Minister said that, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, he can contribute up to two-thirds of the amount, but that any other losses, over and above two-thirds of the export subsidy, must be met by the board and that the board is to recover those losses by means of a levy on creamery milk.</P>

      <P>That is a different matter <Col N="1382" /> altogether.  We could talk about this for months but I do not think it would do very much good.  The basis upon which this Board will operate is clearly defined here.  Any losses sustained by the Board will be met on the basis of not more than two to one.  I shall have to come to the House to seek its approval for my share, which is not more than two-thirds of whatever is necessary.  In view of the picture that would unfold of the activities of the Board and the amount of its surplus, surely there is no question of Deputies being unable to discuss these matters?  We may talk about the West Cork Railway or whatever we like, but when we discuss here and pass legislation empowering a Board to do certain things, if Ministers and others in this House want to have their fingers in the pie, that board could not function profitable.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out to the House that if the Minister's interjection was to be literally interpreted, the passage of this section would mean that hereafter no question could be asked in this House as to the propriety of the levy which the board propose to make on creamery milk.  I want to remind the House of the fact that it is only 12 months ago since An Bord Gráin levied 4/6d. a barrel on wheat. The ground on which that levy was made was that there was an exportable surplus of millable wheat which the Board had to deal with.  It transpired there was no exportable surplus.  The matter was raised in this House and, after a good deal of wriggling and twisting, the Minister for Agriculture finally announced he was going to refund 4/6d.  If nobody had raised it in this House it would never have been refunded.  It was refunded and it was a very substantial sum of money.</P>

One could feel the rustles among the trinity behind him when he made that statement.  I do not include Deputy Seán Flanagan as being one of the trinity.  He is a Roscommon man like myself and we have not much to do with creameries, although we have one in Ballaghaderreen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then went on to say that although he had already said that the levy could not be discussed he thought that when he came into the House with a Supplementary Estimate to pay his two-thirds these matters could be raised.  I want to say that we should not, by passing Section 35, accept for one moment the proposal that the action of the Board in making a levy is not subject to review by this House.  We should assert most emphatically that if a Deputy representative of the farmers of this country believes that this levy has been made <i>ultra vires</i> the Bill that he should have the right to raise <Col N="1384" /> the matter here and query the Minister for Agriculture on what has been done.</P>
    <P>I think it would be most deplorable that we should accept the principle that Ministers should have the right, by setting up boards, to exonerate themselves from their liability to answer Parliamentary questions.  That is a tendency that is growing.  One of the greatest bulwarks of liberty is the institution of the Parliamentary Question. We have all seen the ludicrous spectacle of a Minister for Transport and Power who is responsible for C.I.E. and the E.S.B. coming into this House day after day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the way that the simple man is led agley although I would not describe Deputy Moher as a simple man.  The Minister for Transport and Power, when he is questioned with regard to the activities of the E.S.B. or C.I.E., makes the answer that he has no function in the matter. The Minister for Agriculture now seeks to set up an Board Bainne to exonerate himself from answering for the things for which he has traditionally answered down through the years.  I think the House ought to carefully watch Section 35 in order that we may retain our right to keep these matters under review and to require the Minister for Agriculture to answer for them to Dáil Éireann.  We ought to assert that Dáil Éireann does not delegate that right to any Board or anybody else but insists on its right to have the Minister for Agriculture of the day answer to Dáil Éireann for any tax or levy that may be put on the creameries of this country.</P>

      <P>This section confers too much power on the Board, It states that the Board may, whenever it thinks fit, make an order fixing a rate of milk levy.  That indicates clearly that that Board will have the sole responsibility for determining the amount of the levy and if any member of this House is dissatisfied with the matter there will be no use raising it here because the Minister will say that he had no hand in determining the <Col N="1385" /> levy which was put on by the Board to which this House gave the power.</P>
      <P>An issue of such importance as this has been introduced at a most inopportune time when the House is just coming up to the recess.  I think that should not be the case.  I think that at this stage it would not be any harm at all if the Minister reconsidered the advisability of adjourning this matter until after the Christmas recess.  In so far as Section 35 is concerned, I do not agree with giving the Board such wide powers and I must again protest at the bringing in of this measure just prior to the rising of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned my name and I find myself in the unlikely position of being a metaphysical improbability&mdash;I am in the middle of what Deputy Dillon described as the trinity.  May I say that, as a lawyer, I share the misgivings of other members of this House at the continuing process of the past thirty or forty years whereby Parliament divests itself of its functions in various ways.  The practical outcome of a practice of this nature is that a member of Parliament is directed to a board rather than to a Minister.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the Minister for Agriculture of an occasion here when I asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he was prepared to stand over the attitude of one of these bodies in refusing to give me and other representatives of my constituency an interview unless and until we withdrew an application for a break down of the figures on which that particular Board had made its decision. The Minister told me that he did stand behind the decision of the board, and that he stood over the attitude of the board.  I am afraid we have to face the fact that once we do give these powers to bodies, even if it is right to give them, we then find ourselves in the position that even though we are members of Parliament they can refuse, and do in fact refuse, to give us information which can only be described as reasonably requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two sides to this question. There is, indeed, the point well taken <Col N="1386" /> by the Minister that you either set up a board and give it functions or you do not set up a board and give it functions.  But, the trend of legislation in this country over the past few years has in fact progressively denied to members of this House the opportunity, if not the right, of being furnished with information that they are entitled to as such.  They are not in theory denied the opportunity because the Minister will say to you that you can write to the secretary of the board and that he is obliged to furnish you with the information.  In point of fact they do not furnish you with the information, do not justify their decision if you ask them to justify it and, if you press the issue, they are inclined to tell you, with some show of authority, that the Legislature gave them these powers and that they propose to exercise them.</P>
    <P>In Section 34, to which we have already agreed, which concerns the establishment of regional and advisory committees, there is something which very properly was left entirely within the discretion of the board but in the matter of a levy, while in theory the obligations of the board are clearly set forth and while the intentions of the Legislature and of the Minister are clearly set forth in the Bill and in this debate, the fact remains that, so long as this section is allowed to go through, a matter as vital as putting a levy on milk can be done, not merely without consultation with the Minister or this House but, in effect and in practice, without the possibility of reasonable inquiry even by Members of Parliament. Ultimately, if members of this House are not entitled to be furnished with information by this and similar boards one can readily imagine the ordinary member of the public will get very short shrift indeed.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think that if he put in the words &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister&rdquo; that would set up a sort of class warfare between his Department and the officers and members of the board being created by this Bill?  Perhaps he does but even if there would be some unnecessary friction it would be preferable to continuing this process of vesting functions, <Col N="1387" /> more and more of them in successive boards, each time removing a little bit of the effectiveness and value of the members of this House.  Ultimately, we are watch dogs for the rights of citizens.  It is humiliating and infuriating to be told that you cannot get information anywhere because one person has no function and the other will not give it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan has expressed views that are held by a very large number of Deputies. Day after day, week after week we have all come up against the frustration of trying to extract from State bodies information that we are told is obtainable by communicating with them.  We could give several examples where such bodies have denied audience to members of this Dáil unless they were prepared to conform to terms set out by the body.  It has certainly gone well beyond the stage which could reasonably be regarded as sufficient to excite criticism and create disturbance.</P>
      <P>On occasions when the House acceded to requests from Ministers to set up boards such as the one contemplated in this Bill certain verbal assurances were given by the Minister seeking the support of the House but we found in practice that the verbal assurance was very far from observed when it came to the actual effort to meet these bodies.  It is because of these very disturbing experiences that we are so concerned by yet another development and the creation of still another board which may remove from this House more and more of the duties, obligations and responsibilities normally attaching to public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We consider that the imposition of this levy on the milk producer is unjust and unfair and is depriving this section of the community of a facility that is afforded to every other section. The Minister for Agriculture should be the watchdog of agricultural interests in the Government.  If this were part and parcel of a general scheme to pass back to various sections of the community charges heretofore borne by the State, whereby, <Col N="1388" /> for example, the industrialists would be obliged to pay a levy to assist in the marketing of their products, it might be all very well but we find that industrialists are helped, and rightly so; we do not begrudge them any facilities that the State affords them in the marketing of their surplus goods.  It is a good thing for the country that there should be an expansion of industrial and agricultural exports.  But, we do not see any evidence of any contribution being levied upon the industrialists in the same way as the agriculturist is now being charged to the extent of one-third of the cost of subsidising exports.</P>
    <P>If the Government persist in their action in this regard it will aggravate the fear that exists in too many minds to-day.  It is a mistaken fear but, nevertheless, it exists and must be rooted out if we are to make progress. The fear is there to-day that if these people work harder and produce more and answer the call from all sides, in the long run they will suffer a reduction in their incomes.  That is the principle on which we opposed the levy in relation to An Bord Gráin and that is why we oppose it in relation to An Bord Bainne.  We see in it a removal of the firm guarantee of price which farmers had for some years and which had a dramatic effect in increasing production.  As well as that, the Government are absolved from their obligations in this respect, obligations that were borne under most difficult conditions by their predecessors. There was never a question of shedding the responsibility that the Government had to bear in relation to the problem.</P>
    <P>We are fearful of the Government's pursuing this policy of taking away responsibility from the members of the Oireachtas, transferring them to outside boards and making these so independent a that they are not answerable to anybody.  The effect is to take away from the lawfully elected representatives of the people the forum they have always had here for extracting by Parliamentary Question information in the interest of the public.</P>

When this board is set up and they strike a levy, even if it is more than they are entitled to do, we cannot take any action on it.

      <P>I want to emphasise that up to the present moment the Minister was responsible for the levies on the cold storage of butter.  The day this Bill is passed and becomes law, this is the function of the board and it is part of the day-to-day operation of the board.  We will be told that that is so and we cannot discuss the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the statement of the two previous speakers.  In a nutshell, what it boils down to is that this board, as far as the levy on milk goes, has the function and the Minister is completely divesting himself of authority.  It is only begging the question to say that they have to come to the House.  Under Section 35, the board can, whenever they think fit, make an order fixing the milk levy or revoking the milk levy. The board will have, under this Act&mdash; and I have no doubt the Bill will be steamrolled through the House&mdash;the power to do what they want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only begging the question to say that Section 62 covers this point. I have had experience of similar provisions to those contained in Section 62 under other legislation and there were many occasions when, in respect <Col N="1394" /> of actions taken by other boards, I could not even get a reply to a Parliamentary Question.  I was told by the Minister that it was the day-to-day administration of the board and that the Minister had no function at all. what makes it so serious is that the milk industry is fundamental to the whole agricultural industry and the agricultural industry itself is fundamental to our entire economy.</P>
    <P>It has been rightly stated here today that the duty of the Minister for Agriculture is to protect the agricultural community.  I do not see there is any protection whatever for the agricultural community in introducing a Bill like this and the imposition of a levy as is provided for in this section. Perhaps some of the Government Deputies who may deign to speak on this section will argue that the Minister is conferring some kind of a favour on the agricultural community by imposing this levy.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is doing is empowering the board to impose any levy they want on farmers.  The Minister's argument is that the farming community have every protection and that he must come back to the House to get the money to finance the operation of this section.  I see in it the old story where the levy is imposed first.  In this case the money is to be taken off the farmers seven days after the last day of the month.  At the same time, the Minister is trying to put across to us that the money must be voted here by the House.  He forgets that this board can do what they like.</P>
    <P>In other words, it is creating another monopolistic body.  I think the Minister should find it easy to accept the view that the board should be under proper Parliamentary control.  We spent most of yesterday debating another measure in which we were endeavouring to divest Parliamentary control.  What is the point in having an Irish Parliament if it has no say? We are building up a political situation here where we have a series of boards who control everything.  That is not the principle of a democratic State.  I await with interest the Minister's views on this section.  As far as <Col N="1395" /> I can read it, it is entirely in the hands of the board to do exactly what it likes about milk subsidies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the merits or demerits of the levy that this board may find they will have to impose, I have never known a board more weighted in favour of the actual producers. If Deputies care to study the Bill they will find that the board is practically in the hands of the producers, apart from one representative from the Department of Agriculture, and I cannot see why, if there is difficulty about the price of milk, those people cannot settle it themselves without having it brought in here on a political issue.</P>
      <P>I do not say that the board, as suggested in the Bill, is a really good one, but the issue of whether there will be or will not be a levy is another matter.  I cannot see why this board, weighted as it is in favour of the producers, would be guilty of doing anything wrong about the price of milk.  There is the provision under which the operations of the board must come before the House in certain circumstances and I do not see how any Deputy can be precluded from making observations in the House on the board.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donegan is in a peculiar frame of mind today. How can he, representing a rural community, come in here and say that everything will be all right under this board?  Is not that what we were told when previous boards were appointed&mdash;that the right personnel would be appointed to them?  That is not how these boards have turned out. These boards that we set up here act in the most dictatorial fashion.  Here we have a Fianna Fáil farmer from North Cork telling us that he is quite satisfied to hand over the important powers which this Bill confers on the Board without any worry whatever and says that when the nine appointees will be known they are bound to be men who will deal with the matter more effectively than it will be dealt with in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is safeguarding his own interests because here and there through the Bill in the various sections are subsections which give him the right to ensure that there will be a number of Party nominees on the job.  We have too much of that here and it has been stressed again and again by various speakers in discussing the advisability of setting up such boards at all.  I think it is completely out of place, judging by our knowledge and experience of the dictatorial boards that have been set up in the past, to say that everything will be all right as Deputy Donegan suggests.</P>
      <P>When we set up a board such as the Milk Board, the Grain Board, C.I.E. or the E.S.B. we give them certain functions and a complete monopoly in a certain field.  In the case of C.I.E. we removed the competition from them and threw a mantle of protection around them, backed up by State and public funds.  We do the same for the E.S.B. and we shall do the same with An Bord Bainne that is now visualised. Whatever activities they are responsible for, whether the members of this House approve or otherwise, they will not be open for discussion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I completely disagree with the statements of the previous speaker that the fixing of a levy on milk should be a matter reserved entirely to the board. Section 62 is the usual section embodied in such legislation and, as we know, it means nothing except when the Government of the day is anxious to change legislation. It is quite useless so far as Opposition members are concerned to invoke the aid of Section 62 of this Bill.  That is only a cover-up.  As Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde said, that section appears in almost every Act.  The whole matter that we are debating here on the eve of Christmas, as so many Deputies have said, is that we are handing over power for the past number of years to this board that board and the other board and I think, that they have been found wanting in their activities.  We were told by the Taoiseach the other day <Col N="1397" /> that he has no power whatever over the C.I.E. Board at present and that what C.I.E. does, and how they do it, is a matter for themselves and that this Parliament, this House and he himself, as Leader of the Government, have no function whatever.  We must be very wary about these boards and I propose to well at some length on the setting up of these boards in tonight's debate if I have an opportunity of contributing to it.  This is a big question and I entirely disagree with Section 35 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of Deputy Donegan in particular to the complete delusion under which he is labouring.  He believes that this board, being largely representative of producers, can confidently be relied upon to protect the interest of producers and to ensure that no unreasonable levy will be made upon the milk delivered by the producer to the creameries.  I do not think Deputy Donegan has read the Bill because if he looks at Section 42&mdash;he has the Bill before him&mdash;he will see that:</P>
      <P>(1) The Minister may from time to time give the Board a direction in writing requiring it&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to make and carry out during such period or periods as may be specified in the direction a scheme for the payment to the registered proprietors of creameries of allowances towards the cost of the cold storage, by or on behalf of the proprietors, of butter, or</P>
      <P>(b) to suspend, or provide for the cesser of, as from a date specified in the direction, in whole or in part, of a scheme under this subsection and payments thereunder.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (2):</P>
      <P>The Board shall comply with a direction under subsection (1) of this section.</P>
      <P>Section 43 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board shall purchase at the price which stands fixed for the time being under subsection (2) of this Section and is appropriate in relation <Col N="1398" /> to the purchase of all butter which&mdash;&mdash;and the butter is then described.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of that Section says:</P>
    <P>The Government may from time to time fix the price of butter for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section or may fix two or more prices varying in accordance with either or both of the following, that is to say, the quantity of butter sold and the method of packing the butter, and may specify a date or dates as on and from which purchases shall be made at the price or prices so fixed and the Minister shall notify the Board in writing of the price or prices so fixed and the date or dates also specified.</P>
    <P>Now we come to Section 44 which reads:</P>
    <P>Wherever the Board sells butter which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) is intended for consumption in the State, and</P>
    <P>(b) is of a kind which conforms with the provisions in relation to creamery butter of the Dairy Produce Acts, 1924 to 1947, and the regulations made thereunder or is important butter,</P>
    <P>the sale shall be made at the price which stands fixed for the time being under subsection (2) of this section in relation to such sale and is appropriate in relation to the sale.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>The Government may from time to time fix the price of butter for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section or may fix two or more prices varying in accordance with either or both of the following, that is to say, the quantity of butter sold and the method of packing the butter, and may specify a date or dates as on and from which the price or prices so fixed shall apply and the Minister shall notify the Board in writing of the price or prices so fixed and the date or dates so specified.</P>
    <P>Section 45 transfers the funds of the Dairy Produce Fund to the company but if Deputy Donegan studies these sections he will discover that the <Col N="1399" /> board, in fact, has no discretion in regard to the amount of the levy it is required to make.  But the Minister is in the glorious position that he claims today the right to say if anybody asks him why did the board levy 2d. or 3d. per gallon on milk his answer will be: &ldquo;That is none of my business; go and ask the board.&rdquo;  But in the section of the Bill he has the right to direct the board to do a series of things which involve them in the obligation to raise from a source other than the treasury the funds necessary to carry out the Minister's direction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>But that does not include the milk levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These sections include a section in which the board is obliged to buy butter at certain prices and the butter will then be disposed of by the board.  In regard to the domestic market the Minister will fix the prices at which the butter is to be disposed of in the domestic market but in respect of any butter over and above that the board must sell it wherever and however it can but it must raise sufficient to liquidate the losses after two-thirds of the losses have been made good.  I do not think Deputy Donegan understands the Bill.  What we are claiming now is, that in that section, where events which the board itself cannot foresee, can bring in a statutory obligation upon the board to impose a levy on milk, we in this House should be entitled to raise the query: &ldquo;Why, or how, does the new board claim the right to levy 2d. or 3d. a gallon on creamery milk?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in this House should be entitled to raise the query why, and how it is, the Milk Board claim the right to levy 2d. or 3d. a gallon on creamery milk? The Minister says &ldquo;No.  Once you have passed this Bill no one in Dáil Éireann will have the right to ask that question.  It will be a matter within the discretion of the board.&rdquo;  I want to point out to Deputy Donegan it is not within the discretion of the board because the Minister takes power, by order addressed to the <Col N="1400" /> board, to fix the price at which it will but butter, and to fix the price at which it will sell butter on the home market and he leaves with the board the obligation of selling the rest of the butter, and all the other dairy produce which it may have had to purchase, for whatever price it can get, plus the residual obligation of making good any loss sustained by it in that operation after it has received from the Treasury two-thirds of whatever the total loss may be.</P>
    <P>Now, that simply means that we are creating a board and we are telling the farmers that it is absolutely essential from the point of view of the national economy, and this is something with which I entirely agree, to expand production. I make the case that, if it is in the national interest to expand production and that creates a marketing problem, it is contrary to sanity to say to the people whom you are asking to expand production: &ldquo;The more you expand the less you will get.&rdquo;  I want to compare the procedure here envisaged <i>vis-á-vis</i> the creamery milk suppliers with the procedure we adopted in the 1956 Finance Act when we were dealing with industrial exporters, and I want to defend what we did.</P>
    <P>I am always being challenged&mdash;even by my own supporters&mdash;with having no interest in anybody but the farmers. I should like to compare now what we did for the industrialists in exactly this situation.  The industrialists said: &ldquo;We have been exhorted to establish industries to furnish the home market, and we undertook to do that under high protection; but we admit that, paying the wages we do and with the equipment we have, with the limited market which the Irish home market represents, we have no competitors if you compare us with Northampton or New England and, therefore, it is impossible even to go out and secure permanent foreign markets; one of the heaviest charges we have to carry is corporation profits' tax and income tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having heard all that, we made them this proposition: &ldquo;We will take your industrial output as of a certain date and we are prepared to say to you, in respect of your entire export after that day, you will be free of all <Col N="1401" /> corporation profits' tax and you will be free of all income tax.&rdquo;  When that scheme came to be administered it was manifest that one could not examine every pair of boots that was manufactured and apportion to one pair of boots the costs of the factory production. As I understand it, the rough and ready device was employed that the Revenue Commissioners said that, if, at the end of a year, a factory had made £10,000 profit and one-fifth of the output had gone abroad in exports and four-fifths had been sold at home, the industrialists would pay income tax on £8,000 of profits and, in respect of £2,000, they were tax free.  What the result of that stimulus has been we have seen in the very steep increase in industrial exports.  I know of one boot factory that was working one shift&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

Since he is a neighbour, I do not want to smack Smart answers across the floor to the Deputy, but I appeal to the Deputy not to try me too far.  All I am saying is that I do not deny that the concessions we made <Col N="1402" /> in the Finance Act of 1956 were of a generous scale.  But they had this result: a boot factory which, to my knowledge, was working one eight-hour shift three years ago is now working three shifts and exporting nearly half of its entire output.  It is doing that because its release from tax on all these exports has made it economic to break into foreign markets.  What astonishes me is that, when we are dealing with the manufacture of boots, or textiles, or tin cans, or any industrial product, we all approve of the 1956 Finance Act approach.  When this Government came into office they not alone adopted the scheme we had introduced but they even extended it.</P>
      <P>What has gone wrong with the minds of our people that when we approach farmers we do not say to them: &ldquo;If you double, or treble, your output substantial benefits will be conferred upon you as a result of your contribution to the balance of our international trade.&rdquo;  Not at all.  We say we want higher production in order to expand our exports but, remember, with regard to every increase you make there is automatic machinery here to ensure you will get less for your output. What is more, you will get less, and there will be silence; no voice must be raised about it in Dáil Éireann, ever, any more.  I often wonder am I standing in an Irish Parliament at all. Or are we all going daft?</P>

      <P>I have heard that charge made here a few times.  I would not <Col N="1406" /> be immediately concerned with undertakings given on these matters by other Ministers.  However, having heard these charges flung across the floor of the House, I endeavoured in my intervention to make it clear that when you set up a board of this nature, set out clearly the powers and functions of that board, it is absurd for any of us to think we can be acquainted with all the day to day details and decisions made by them and based upon their judgment and responsibility.</P>

After having transferred certain powers to this board, the Minister has also retained certain powers.  He has the authority to fix the prices in relation to the home market.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing the making of an Order.  I am <Col N="1407" /> discussing the powers still retained by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, with the concurrence of the Government, fixes from time to time the prices at which butter will be purchased by the Butter Marketing Committee and by this board.  Having fixed that price, he determines generally the price at which milk will be purchased by creameries.  The board has nothing to do with those functions. They are Ministerial functions. The board's task is to endeavour to market as profitably as possible any surplus of milk products that may exist.</P>
      <P>Now the Government say to this Board that if its export losses this year amount to £900, £9,000 or £1,000,000 that we will give them two-thirds of any sum that may be necessary to dispose of these surplus milk products.  As Deputy Donegan has said, the Board is composed of people who have a deep interest in the industry and I am, in this measure, giving effect to the report of the advisory committee which was composed of people who were interested in the industry and who knew that, if we are going to go out and encourage the production of milk and then dispose of our milk products, it would not be reasonable to think that the industry would not make some contribution towards the effort to improve its productivity and its profits.</P>
      <P>What Committee would recommend that a board should be set up to improve an industry and that the State should bear all the cost of that improvement?  Do you think we would be taken seriously in that or that it would be taken seriously by the consumers of milk products who are, in the main, the people who are supporting the milk producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could talk about all the matters mentioned here, about the utility of boards and about the injustice of handing over of delegating functions to these boards.  The only thing I said in this House, and I would say it to myself, is that I would regard myself as being very foolish if I took <Col N="1408" /> part in a deliberative assembly as to whether a board should or should not be set up and then, immediately that proposal had passed into law, that I should start to trick with them, interfere with them and ask for information which I should know in advance would not be available to me once I had taken the original course.</P>
    <P>I do not like people who try to have it both ways.  There are a lot of people in this country who want to have the hide and the price of it. What I do say to-day and what I have said outside is that any man is entitled to his view as to whether it is a good thing to delegate these responsibilities and to hand them over to a board. Any Deputy can have his own view as to the wisdom of such a course but I also say that when Parliament makes a decision by a majority vote of this House we cannot expect to have it the other way the following day.  If Parliament, having given powers of this nature to a particular board, think that they are too extensive, Parliament can easily rectify that.  That is the reasonable way to approach this matter.</P>
    <P>It is childish to come in here and ask a Minister for Agriculture when he is going to give effect to the report of such an advisory committee and then, when he is giving effect to it, to say that we do not want the board to have that much power.  If any member of this House, no matter who he is or how experienced he is, thinks he is going to put that sort of stuff over on the public or that he is going to affect the public mind in a political sense by saying these things he is making the mistake of his life.</P>
    <P>I do not mind if we talk over the Bill for the next seven days but there is no justification for all the repetition that we have had here to-night.  I have made my point on this matter. It was recommended to me by the advisory committee but if it was never recommended it would still be in this Bill because I think if is fair.  I shall go out to the country as a politician and, with my colleagues, meet the people who are affected by these provisions. When my point of view and the other point of view have been <Col N="1409" /> stated we should not have this futile and endless repetition which gets us nowhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one good answer to that and that is that it took a lot of repetition to get the Minister to his feet&mdash;not that we are any wiser than we were before he got up.  The Minister defends the principle he has introduced and, in addition, introduces a third point, that of the impact on the public mind.  Let me ask the Minister in what other Department of State in connection with the marketing of goods outside this country are the producers required to pay anything by way of a levy?</P>
      <P>There is in existence in relation to industrial exports a body known as Coras Tráchtála.  Is there any industrialist in this country who has objected to the fact that Coras Tráchtála operates under State funds and that industrialists do not contribute directly to the expenses of Coras Tráchtála? How could anybody in the agricultural community feel that this board would have less authority if the State carried the entire cost as it carries it for Coras Tráchtála?</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to tell me if there is in existence in the State a single example of such a contribution, being exacted from other producers in the case of such a board.  If there is, the Minister will have succeeded in the arguments he has advanced.  He appears to be the solitary member of the Government who is prepared to put a levy on the people for whose welfare he is responsible, to put on them the burden of bearing a substantial contribution of the expenses of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon pointed out we have very effectively given financial assistance to industrial exporters.  They are secured, no matter what they-produce, against any reduction in their profits.  Here, we find the same thing happening as happened in the case of An Bord Gráin; the producer has been told that the matter will not arise unless he works harder and produces more goods.  You are removing the guarantee to the people that they have had up to the present and the result of the appeal made to them to produce <Col N="1410" /> more will be that they will receive a reduction on their investment.  That is a serious things to revive in the minds of these people.  After the assistance they have been given, after the markets that have developed for them and having got production up to this point, if we remove any of the guarantees that were responsible for bringing about increased production we may be inviting more trouble.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that we object. If the Minister stands on the principle of a contribution being fair, on the principle that he attempted to explain to us a few moments ago that the producers would appreciate being given this responsibility, why is it that industrialists who are being assisted so well and who are availing of the facilities provided for them in marketing their surplus, do not resent the fact that they are not called upon to pay any direct levy?</P>

He was able to express them in a much nicer way than I, as a farmer, can do.  Nevertheless, he had the courage of his convictions and disagreed with giving power to boards.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave me the impression early today that Deputies could not ask a question with regard to this board once it is set up.  I am glad that he has clarified that position now and that we will at least be in a position to question the expenditure of the money which we are providing.</P>

      <P>As long as the board is functioning properly, I do not think anybody would be looking for publicity.  Deputy Donegan seemed to think that the board as set up was weighted in favour of the producer. There are only four producers out of nine members, three from the cooperative societies and one from the Dairy Disposal Company.  The remaining five are representative of manufacturing concerns many of whom would like to buy the farmer's produce as cheaply as they possibly could&mdash;the chocolate crumb manufacturers, the cheese manufacturers, the dried milk powder manufacturers and I will not say anything about the Minister's nominee.</P>

The Minister was not present but very wide ground has been covered. His colleague seemed to say at one time that these decisions were not reviewable by the House; then he tried to reassure us that they were reviewable by the House.

      <P>The plain truth of it is that the Minister for Agriculture has not the faintest notion of what is in his own brief and is trying to pick it up as he goes along.  His hearing is <Col N="1414" /> not too good and the width of the passage is more than the advice that frequently flows across.  It is quite true that Section 62 provides that every order and regulation made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oirechtas but the process of arriving at the levy is a process of determining the price to be paid by the board for butter and then determining the price the board may charge for butter on the domestic market.  When you come to the relevant section in which that is done you find this interesting formula employed in Section 42 which provides: &ldquo;(1) the Minister may from time to time give the Board a direction in writing...&rdquo; Then you look at Section 62.  Is there any provision in Section 62 about a direction in writing being laid on the Table of this House?</P>

      <P>That is not covered by Section 62.  I do not know what is the exact machinery envisaged in section 43 (2) which provides: &ldquo;The Government may from time to time fix the price of butter...&rdquo;  They may fix the price of butter but it does not say by Order, and the subsection continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section or may fix two or more prices varying in accordance <Col N="1415" /> with either or both of the following, that is to say, the quantity of butter sold and the method of packing the butter, and may specify a date or dates as on and from which purchases shall be made at the price or prices so fixed and the Minister shall notify the Board in writing of the price or prices so fixed and the date or dates so specified.</P>
    <P>Is there any instrument envisaged in that subsection which is caught by Section 62?</P>

      <P>We were reassured by the Minister turning up Section 62 and saying every Order made under the Bill, whether by the Board or the Minister, must be laid before the House thus giving any Deputy the right of calling it in question.  He sought to demolish Deputy Wycherley's argument, Deputy Murphy's argument and my argument in regard to the levy on milk by saying it has to be laid on the Table of the House.  However, when you probe further you find out how the levy is arrived at.  You discover it is arrived at as a result of a series of directions to be given by the Minister to the Board under Sections 42, 43 and 44 and that in none of these sections is there any reference made to an Order at all.  Then you go to the point of the Government fixing a price but it is not fixed by Order. The way the Government communicates the price is not by including a statutory instrument of which everyone must take notice; it is by the Minister notifying the Board in writing of the price or prices so fixed. That fixation is done, I take it, by Government decision and, as all of us well know&mdash;certainly the Minister knows&mdash;Government decisions are not placed upon the Table of Oireachtas Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes it is.  The whole object of this discussion, into which the Minister has leapt to enable the Minister for Agriculture to have a cup of tea, is to find out whether this House retains effective control over the rate of levy which the board may from time to time make on creamery milk.  The case was made at first by Deputy Donegan that we need not worry our heads, that this board was representative of producers and therefore it could be trusted to do whatever was right. That argument having been discussed at length, Deputy Donegan mended his hand and said he was quite mistaken in that belief because his Minister now told him that every Order made would be placed on the Table of the House and would be subject to review by this House.  We then reminded him that might be a bit late in the day.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture was trying to reassure us that everything affecting the price of milk or butter would be available to the House under Section 62.  He had angrily asserted earlier in the evening that it would be wholly irrational to give a board such powers and then claim the right to review its powers in Dáil Éireann, but he then excepted from that generalisation such matters as were caught under Section 62 and said that that related to all Orders made by the board. However, when I look at Sections 42, 43 and 44 I find that a different procedure is provided for under these sections and that none, of the mandatory directions given by the Minister under these sections are subject to review or, according to the Minister, discussable in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that everything the Government and the individual Ministers do is discussed in Dáil Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There are heaps of decisions taken by the Government <Col N="1417" /> that are never laid on the Table of the House at all.  It is perfectly simple to make all these matters subject to review by providing that a Minister should make an Order consequent on a Government decision, but he is not required to do that.  All he is required to do is give a direction in writing to the board and on that the board must act.  The net result will be of course that the board will have to make an Order in respect of a levy.  At that stage it is open to any Deputy to call that Order in question but if the Act provides that the board has a statutory obligation to liquidate its losses through a levy after it has received an Exchequer grant of two-thirds of these losses, there does not seem to be much use in moving a Resolution in this House.  Its losses will be created by the directive given in writing to the board by the Minister for Agriculture. Of course when it comes down to tin tacks, this is all an elaborate device to exonerate the Minister for Agriculture from blame in respect of the Fianna Fáil policy which is to levy an increasing sum on the milk producers in order to finance the export of any surplus they produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it to the Minister that in fact this device is that the expanding levy made on creamery milk is now to be the responsibility of the board and that they have got to raise the levy to whatever figure is requisite to meet any losses they incur. <Col N="1418" /> I wonder are we wise, are we going to get the increased output we are hoping for, and if we do not where are we going to go?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the levy proposed in this section by the board, under written direction of the Minister, a device to lower the price of milk to the creamery farmers?  The board is obliged to engage in the sale of butter abroad and within the State if the Minister so decides.  The Government can fix the price of butter under this Bill.  It is just a cunning device to lower the price of milk to the producers. In other words, the price being paid for milk is considered uneconomic for the purpose of the export of surplus butter.  Now we are going back and imposing a levy which is just another way of reducing the price of milk to the farmers.  There is no other way to view it.  It may be described as a device to take a load off the shoulders of the Minister for Finance in providing the necessary subsidy for the export of butter.  If you give farmers 1/6d. a gallon for milk and take 6d. back in levy you are in fact giving him only a shilling a gallon, no matter how you dress it up. Any Deputy who thinks otherwise is only hoodwinking himself.  The Minister has told us, in the light of experience of other boards&mdash;C.I.E. being one of them&mdash;that the position of this board can be reviewed here and that orders and regulations will be laid on the Table of the House.</P>

I have seen Orders laid on the Table and I have come to know the futility of questioning any of those Orders because by the time they appear the harm is done and there is no use crying over spilt milk. As far as I can see it, the whole question of dairying and milk production in this country has now become something evil if we are to believe the Government side of the House.  We are asked to increase production in many fields, milk being one of them.  Now it seems the more we produce, the <Col N="1419" /> greater damage we do to the State.  In this Bill the Minister calmly divests himself of responsibility and throws it on the board.</P>

At the present time cheese is subsidised in the same way as butter and if the export of cheese is to be expanded&mdash;it would be helpful to our economy if it were&mdash; will the board have power in regard to the exports of these various products to support them by subsidies and to recoup outlay on these subsidies by increasing the levy?</P>

      <P>In respect to exports gone out?  So it is true to say the Minister is at the moment supporting exports which hereafter will be borne by the milk levy.  That will not be retrospective.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press the Minister to go into details on what support has been vouchsafed but we shall assume that a certain dairy product received some measure of support since the 1st June last up to now.  That, I take it, has been provided if such has happened by Treasury grant.  It is not proposed to carry that charge forward and impose it in a levy when the levy under this Bill comes into operation.  That is a finished transaction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is right. As I explained to the House the levy imposed by me some time ago to meet the marketing problem of the butter surplus was confined to butter.  When that problem had been met, and when in the last year the situation developed in which we were not likely to have any large butter surplus, I announced the withdrawal of the levy.  In 1960 it became apparent that if we were to continue the policy of a levy on butter only we would not be free, in fairness, to support on a two-to-one basis those industries that were engaged in the conversion of milk into chocolate crumb, milk powder and cheese.  I felt that it would be better then to give these concerns an assurance that they too would be supported and I gave them that assurance and indicated the extent to which that support would be given.  This assurance that I have given will be fully completed before the board contemplated in this Bill is set up and they <Col N="1422" /> will start off, I hope, on a clean sheet.</P>

That support may not be for this year on the basis of the support that was given to butter for the simple reason that the question that the milk that was used for conversion into these products had not made its contribution in the sense that the milk converted into butter had.

Treasury grants and is it not the truth that after this Bill comes into operation dairy products other than butter will be supported out of the milk levy as to one-third and by Central Fund grant as to two-thirds?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>These other products are not being supported to the extent of 100 per cent.  State grant but by a State grant which is influenced by the fact that they have not, as the butter has, contributed any part towards a fund for the subsidisation of these exports on a two-to-one basis.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for the nervous system of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. The milk levy mentioned in Section 35 appears to be payable on all milk purchased by creameries.  What will happen in respect of these creameries which distribute a large volume of milk in the form of bottled milk for liquid consumption in the home market?  Is the Minister aware that for the past five or six years a great many creameries in different parts of the country have gone into the bottled milk business on a pretty large scale.  Will that liquid milk pay the levy the same as milk designed for conversion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>The fact remains that we have allowed the creameries under certain registration conditions to get into the milk distribution business on a pretty large scale.  The Minister is as well informed as I am.  They take in the milk at a different reception point and keep a register of the suppliers who have registered dairy premises, and so forth; but, as far as I read Section 35, it operates to collect the levy off that milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be equivalent to collecting a levy off milk intended for liquid consumption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You must under Section 35.  The section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) There shall be paid to the Board by every registered proprietor of a creamery or cream-separating station a levy on milk purchased or otherwise acquired by him, other than from another such proprietor, at a time in respect of which a rate for such levy stands fixed by virtue of an order under subsection (3) of this section, and the levy shall be of such amount as may be appropriate having regard to the rate fixed under the order.</P>
      <P>(2) The amount of milk levy due by a registered proprietor of a creamery or a cream-separating station in respect of milk purchased or acquired in any month shall be paid to the Board not later than seven days after the last day of the month.</P>
      <P>(3) (a) The Board may, whenever it thinks fit, make an order fixing the rate of milk levy and specifying the date on which the rate so fixed is to come into operation.</P>
      <P>(b) The Board may, whenever it thinks fit, by order revoke or amend an order under this subsection including an order under this paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) An order under this subsection may fix different rates of <Col N="1426" /> milk levy in respect of different periods specified in the order.</P>
    <P>(4) In this section &ldquo;milk&rdquo; means whole milk.</P>
    <P>There is no provision here for refunding the levy to a creamery in respect of milk purchased for liquid distribution. So far as I can see, while there is power to make an Order under the subsection fixing the different rates of milk levy in respect of different periods specified in the Order, there is no power to make different rates of levy, or to exempt from levy, milk purchased or subsequently sold for liquid consumption in the home market.  As far as I know, if this levy ran up to something like twopence per gallon, which would produce at present rates approximately £2,000,000, it would have a very grave effect on the creameries which were distributing milk for consumption and I do not think the Minister means to interfere with that trade.  I should be glad to know if the implication of levying milk for that purpose has been considered.</P>

      <P>I do not think there should be any difficulty about the point the Deputy makes.  I know a number of creameries at the moment which purchase milk for conversion into butter and other products and which are also registered for the purpose of selling liquid milk.  They have to keep records even now.  They are two distinct businesses and the records they keep now should suffice for the purpose of any levy that may be imposed by the board on liquid milk purchased for industrial purposes.</P>

      <P>When he comes to sell the milk, he may sell it to a chocolate crumb factory, to a condensed milk factory, a dried milk plant, or he may sell it for liquid consumption.  If he is buying milk to convert it into butter, <Col N="1428" /> to sell it to a cream factory, a cheese factory, or to another person who will engage in one of the activities entitled to support under the scheme, he must pay a levy on that milk.  I understand the Minister does not wish the levy to apply to, say, 250,000 gallons of milk which he buys, pasteurises, bottles and sells for retail distribution in his own area.  I know it is done in Monaghan on a pretty large scale.  I know it is done in Limerick.  I know it is done in Clonmel.  In Waterford, I think it is done by a proprietary company. There are several places in which cooperative creameries are doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The manager in one case is purchasing milk as a registered creamery proprietor.  In the other case he is purchasing milk as a registered dairy under the Dairy Produce Act.  There are two different persons involved here.  The milk purchased in one capacity is not leviable&mdash;that is the milk purchased in his capacity under the Milk and Dairies Act.  No milk purchased under that Act is leviable.  It is only on the milk he purchases as a creamery proprietor that the levy will be imposed by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister gives me his word that that is so, that must influence my mind, but certainly the section does not read that way to me. To me the section reads that if a registered proprietor buys milk the levy must be paid upon it without reference to how he subsequently disposes of it. Now the Minister says if he sends it to a chocolate crumb factory, to a dried milk factory, to a cheese factory or if he processes it himself into butter, the levy must be paid.  But if he pasteurises it, bottles it and sells it retail, he does not pay the levy.  Surely to goodness, the Minister is opening up the father and mother of a door to grave abuses in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warned the Minister when he was embarking on the £15 scheme in respect of T.B. cows in the south that he was going to wind up in trouble.  I think he has.  Now he has plenty of trouble on hands.  Think of what will happen here.  The Minister knows as <Col N="1429" /> well as I do the almost insoluble difficulties created for the Department in trying to control the intake of this milk and ensuring that no stuff went into bottles that was not produced in registered dairy premises.  The Minister and I both know, despite the utmost vigilance of our staff, that neither of us was ever satisfied that we effectively excluded unauthorised milk from being pasteurised and bottled.</P>
    <P>How in the name of Providence, if a creamery is taking in 10,000 gallons of milk per day and is bottling 1,000 gallons a day, is the Minister going to satisfy himself that the levy is being paid on all the milk on which it ought to be paid?  In the old days we used to have the rough measure of butter output.  We multiplied the butter by 2¼ gallons and found out approximately how much milk passed through the creameries.  Take the case of a creamery sending part of its milk to a cheese factory, on which levy must be paid, part to a chocolate crumb factory, on which levy must be paid, processing part of it into butter on its own premises, in respect of which levy must be paid, and possibly sending part of it to Dungarvan, Ballyclough or Tipperary for conversion into dried milk, on which levy must be paid, and, at the same time, pasteurising and bottling part of it and selling it in a neighbouring town, and in that case the levy need not be paid.  Would it not be reasonable to suggest that sums running into thousands every year could go astray if creameries made returns suggesting that their sales of retailed bottle milk were far in excess of what they actually were?  The money involved would run into a substantial sum.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think that is the most important aspect of it.  I do not think we should willingly legislate in a way well calculated to put temptation under a man's feet.  And a penny a gallon when you are handling vast quantities of liquid milk&mdash;and this levy might even be 2d. per gallon&mdash;can run into a very substantial sum.  I do not know what administrative machine the Minister can devise to exempt milk received by a creamery and subsequently sold for liquid consumption <Col N="1430" /> from the impact of this levy.  I should be glad to know has he considered the machinery that will operate to achieve that.  Will he just require the manager to make a daily return of the amount of milk sold?  Will there be some system of check or is he simply going to let it rip and make estimates?  There must be some machinery in his mind where such large sums of quasi public money are involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say any more than I have said.  This business has been carried on for years by some creameries.  They are registered under the Milk and Dairies Act for the public sale of milk for liquid consumption after pasteurisation and they are registered under the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, for the purpose of purchasing milk for conversion into industrial milk products.  I have, been puzzled for a long time as to how this business was supervised and how they could be assured they were only accepting milk from registered dairies.</P>
      <P>However, the question now arises as to the collection of any levy that may be imposed.  The people who drafted this Bill were directed to exclude those who handled milk for liquid consumption. I take it the assurance I have given on their advice is correct and accurate.  The question the Deputy referred to then arises.  Could there be any juggling between the milk in respect of which levy must be paid and that purchased by them for liquid consumption?  I do not think that that should present any insuperable problem.  There are only a few firms engaged in that business and I have no doubt a means will be found of ensuring that the levy will be paid in respect of the milk on which it is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I do not share the Minister's optimism at all. Deputies may say: &ldquo;If you do not, why were you so calm about the segregation of milk from registered dairy premises?  &ldquo;When it was merely a question of selling bottled milk, the answer was that although we felt all milk for liquid consumption should come from registered dairy premises, the fact was present to our mind that <Col N="1431" /> all the milk sold retail from such dairy premises was being pasteurised.  Therefore, if it was not entirely of the standard that might be expected from a registered dairy premises, pasteurisation would in large measure correct that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Pasteurisation is not a complete answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a complete answer, I think, against the danger of the communication of sickness and disease through the medium of the milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When you discuss that with the medical people they do not agree with you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you discussed everything with the medical people and the vets&mdash;even with the lawyers&mdash;you would not sleep at night at all.  By and large, I think that was substantially true.  The plain truth was that sometimes, if you did not segregate the milk, it was not as clean as you would wish it to be, and was not fit for general retail distribution for consumer consumption. There is no doubt whatever, as the Minister has admitted by implication, that the operation of segregation was a doubtful one.  But where you are satisfied there is no danger to public health, that is tolerable. We are all human beings and if you are putting within a man's reach the means of avoiding a statutory levy of 2d. a gallon on milk, and that might amount to 500 gallons a day, you are putting a terrible burden on any man responsible for the administration of such a system in his creamery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you are right. I think the Minister had the same feeling with regard to the scheme of the £15 for the cows.  You set up a scheme of this kind with the best intentions of the world and then you find some <Col N="1432" /> gigantic scandal building up.  The papers in that case are going to the Attorney General and I presume that something is going to happen.  If we never put that temptation in the way of people we would not now be facing the situation that some unfortunate men are going to be prosecuted, and, perhaps, convicted of crime.  If they are, the fault is largely ours because we put in their way the temptation to which they fell.  We are creating here another very great occasion of temptation.</P>

I think that the Minister stands greatly in need of that assistance but I must confess that it is becoming rather a burden upon me because he is paid for it and I am not. I imagine that the wiser course would be to have a levy on all milk and then require the manager to furnish satisfactory returns of the milk sold for human consumption in his area and refund the money to him.</P>

I do suggest that the Minister has not adverted to this problem at all and I think that it is one of the problems that will have to be solved.  The net result of it is that the Minister says he will not levy that part of the milk which the creamery manager buys for the retail trade.  I think that is a pretty dangerous proceeding and I suggest that every creamery ought to be required to pay the levy and that there would be provision in the Bill, which there is not, to refund the levy to any creamery which sells milk under the appropriate licence for human consumption.

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 36.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 36 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has explained to us that the system of the levy is being changed under this new device and that the levy is now to be on milk.  Section 36 authorises the board to make a levy on butter delivered on sale or manufactured for some other person by the proprietor. Perhaps the Minister will explain to us the purpose of the butter levy envisaged in Section 36?  I think I understand the purpose envisaged in Section 37.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the legislation in Section 36 is, of course, part of the whole price support scheme for butter.  In other words, provision has to be made for the cold storage of butter and at the present time a levy to meet that cost is being collected, to meet not only the cost of cold storage of butter but also administrative expenses that arise.  These sections propose to continue these levies and have nothing to do with the supporting of our exports.  It means carrying on something that has been the practice here for years.  In the fixation of the butter price by the Government regard has to be had to the cost of cold storage and to the administrative expenses of the Butter Marketing Committee. In the fixation of the price at which butter is being sold regard is had to these two factors.  This section and the sections that follow are merely a continuation of the practice that is already in existence though, naturally, it has now to be in a different form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember when I was dealing with this matter there used to be an annual fight to persuade the Minister for Finance to make funds available to meet the cost of the storage of butter and, quite apart from the money that used to be provided to pay a subsidy on exports of butter, there was every year a substantial sum in my vote for the Butter Marketing Committee to meet the cost of the storage of butter.</P>
      <P>I want to make this case to the Minister: Under this section we are placing an obligation on the Milk Board to collect a levy to pay the cost of storing butter.  I would ask the House to consider what this involves. No creamery in Ireland that I know of wants to store butter.  It would be much more convenient for creameries to sell their butter as they make it and up to 18 or 20 years ago that was the practice.  The creameries sold the butter as they made it and if there was not sufficient butter in the winter, I think New Zealand butter mainly used to come in to fill in the gap of demand which was not met by current manufacture of butter during the months of perhaps January and February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community have grown into the habit of requiring that butter of Irish manufacture should be kept in store to suit the popular demand.  I think it was the Minister for Finance, <Col N="1437" /> Deputy Dr. Ryan, who in his first Budget after the Fianna Fáil Party came back to office this time announced quite casually that in future that charge was going to be taken off the Exchequer and it was transferred to the retail price of butter.  Am I to understand now that this butter levy under Section 36 will be included in the retail price of butter by the Minister when he is fixing the domestic price of butter? It will not be levied on the producer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be, in effect, by the Minister's Order, levied on the consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure; about 9/8d. a cwt.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Nine and fourpence a cwt. is 1d. per 1b.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A penny a 1b. on the total consumption of butter in this country is the equivalent of four-ninths of a penny on the total amount of milk used.  Four-ninths of a penny on the total milk used in the production of butter runs into a pretty substantial sum per annum.  I often wonder are we following a wise practice in continuing that charge.  I know that during the period of scarcity immediately after the World War there existed a difficulty that had never existed before and that was that there was no butter market in Great Britain. That meant if you wanted to get New Zealand butter you had to enter into a contract in New Zealand and if you did enter into a contract as of to-day in New Zealand butter you got no butter delivered here on foot of that contract for about two to three months after the contract was completed, because the butter actually had to come here from New Zealand.  With the return to normal in the '50's, stocks of butter are now maintained in Great Britain <Col N="1438" /> to supply the British market and any other European market in which New Zealand deals, so that long delay is no longer an obstacle to purchasing supplies of New Zealand butter.</P>
      <P>Our people, peculiarly enough, do not like Danish butter because Danish butter is manufactured from ripe milk. Although that butter commands on the London market a premium of anything from 10/- to 20/- a cwt. more than the price paid for New Zealand or Irish butter, our people do not like it; they called it &ldquo;Dillon's yellow butter&rdquo;. The interesting thing about &ldquo;Dillon's yellow butter&rdquo; was that it cost a great deal more than the butter to which they were accustomed and they were getting it at a sacrifice price. However, popular taste is popular taste and we never got into the habit of eating Danish butter.  New Zealand butter, as far as I know, is made by the same process as our own butter and is virtually indistinguishable from it, so there is no similar difficulty about filling a gap of supply for consumers with New Zealand butter.</P>
      <P>Two matters fall to be considered. We are trying to expand our exports abroad arid for that purpose we ought to try to bring our processing costs as low as we can.  We ought to operate the creameries to the maximum capacity and try to keep our costs of production as low as we can, thus reducing so far as we can any losses in which we may be involved in export markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is an economy we can make and it would run into a very substantial sum.  The average consumption of milk for conversion into butter for the domestic market is 240 million gallons per annum, approximately.  A halfpenny a gallon on that would yield £500,000 per annum.  Is it worth considering the possibility of eliminating that heavy charge of £500,000 a year and bringing in New Zealand butter for two months while domestic production was not equal to domestic demand?  I think that is worth considering. It is not that we shall be short of butter; on the contrary we shall be exporting more.  Two courses will be open to us: we could either <Col N="1439" /> levy the incoming butter to equate the price, because we buy the New Zealand butter at world market prices, and use that money in relief of the levy on milk that will have to be made to pay the charge that falls on the producer when we are exporting our surplus productions.  We could use that £500,000 a year to reduce the cost of butter to the consumer in this country.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there is a great deal of storage in the country, most of which could be advantageously used in connection with the dead meat trade because you have got to bear in mind that the storage is there and you must not encourage people to bring in expensive cold storage in one year and embark next year on something else which would result to them in very expensive capital outlay for which there is no profitable return.</P>
    <P>If we were to save £500,000 a year by this advice, we could use the cold storage facilities for the storage of turkeys at Christmas or for a variety of other products for which could storage is required.  With the growth of deep freeze, which is operating now in every provision shop in the country even in small towns, I think many of these cold stores could be profitably used as depots for frozen vegetables, frozen fowl and frozen fish.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to hear from the Minister whether the insertion of this section suggests that he is taking an irrevocable decision about storing our own butter in order to provide a 100 per cent. supply for the domestic market or whether this substantial annual charge could not be avoided to the advantage of either the producer or the consumer, or perhaps to the advantage of both in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing irrevocable about it.  I can see the purpose behind the plan envisaged in this section.  If we did not have in the past some means by which we could store our summer surplus of butter I cannot see very well how we could have maintained an even price, and given an assurance to the producers that we would try to maintain that even price <Col N="1440" /> throughout the year.  I do not know what the merits are of Deputy Dillon's proposal but this levy is included in the price of butter to the consumer.  I do not think there is anything wrong in that.  What is proposed in this section and the sections that follow is really the continuation, under new auspices, of a scheme or practice that has been going on for years.  I do not think there is anything wrong with it. I do not know what the board may have to say in regard to such matters when they come to examine the whole field for which they will be responsible.</P>
      <P>As I have said, there is nothing irrevocable in this in the sense that if we saw more advantageous means of handling our milk production we would be inclined to accept them.  This scheme seems to be admirable designed to see to it that the creameries would not be all rushing out to the market to sell at a time when butter was in flush supply.  We are aiming at having butter all the year round at a uniform price.  That is all that is proposed here in the way of financing a scheme through levies which are there at present and have been in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I think of it the more daft it seems to me.  We can leave Denmark out because of the quality of the butter which is somewhat peculiar.  New Zealand is located in the antipodes.  Their season of maximum production is our season of minimum production, so we do not compete directly with them.  It does not seem to be in order that simply because the practice grew up&mdash;I believe it originated during the economic war&mdash;that we should simply jog along.  It must be clear to us that it is costing us £500,000 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not mind about the flush period in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Danes flush period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not compete with the Danes at all.  Deputy Moher knows more about this than he appears to. The vast bulk of our exports are to <Col N="1441" /> Northern Ireland where the people have the same prejudices against Danish butter as we have.  At present 80 per cent. of our butter exports abroad go to Northern Ireland and the remaining 20 per cent. to Great Britain and that only for a very short period of the year.  Our period of scarcity is New Zealand's flush period. It seems to me that we have a system operating like a pendulum and that if there is an attempt to stop the pendulum, even though stopping it may save £500,000, we exclaim: &ldquo;For God's sake leave it alone; it has been working that way for years.&rdquo;  Is there any sane man whose own personal income is involved, and who saw a prospect of saving £ 500,000 a year, who would say: &ldquo;Leave well enough alone.  I am able to stagger along&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be quite irrational. There is a certain risk involved but I suggest to the Minister that this is the kind of buck we should not pass to the board.  I think this is the type of responsibility that the Dáil must shoulder itself.  We started this business; we inaugurated it.  There is no doubt that it is very hard to jog people's minds out of fixed habits.  But £50,000 a year is a lot of money.</P>
      <P>I have not yet heard anyone try to demonstrate that there is a flaw in my reasoning.  If that is so, surely the prospect should provoke more interest in the Minister for Agriculture than he appears to show.  I do not think it is enough for him to say that he is passing this over to the board to let them do what they please. It is very hard to ask the board to make a radical change of this kind the moment they take over.  They are a new body.  They will naturally go to lengths to try and avoid colliding with any vested interests in the country.  Accordingly, if this is a thing we ought to do, I suggest the Minister should seriously consider doing it before transferring that responsibility to An Bórd Bainne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should dearly like to hear what some of the experienced Deputies who constitute the trinity behind the Minister are thinking on this matter.  They are probably saying: &ldquo;I suppose he is <Col N="1442" /> right as he usually is.&rdquo;  I am encouraged by the affirmative nods of some of them.  Unfortunately the Minister cannot see the nods or perhaps he would not feel very pleased if he did.  I heard him make some observations to some of his older colleagues this evening that made me suffer vicariously on their behalf.  Is there no Deputy interested in half a million pounds?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not.  I remember that I did it one year and <Col N="1444" /> it cost me substantially more to collect the levy than I got out of it.  A ridiculous situation developed in which I had to go around to every grocery shop in the country and count the rolls of butter on the shelves.  Then we found the rolls disappearing under the shelves and we had inspectors who wanted to see what was under the shelves.  We found it was not worth while.</P>

      <P>Well, that is some relief in the situation but even there you are faced with the position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not better, seeing there is a reasonable prospect of collecting the difference&mdash;a difference that is effective overnight&mdash;to make the effort to collect it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it.  My real belief is that if you could confine your activity to wholesale premises it is probably worth doing.  There are probably quantities of butter there which are significant and, if a levy were made on butter, it is fairly reasonable to collect it; to go to retailers' premises rarely paid and set a premium on fraud.  On balance, I doubt if it is worth doing at all but I should be prepared to agree with the Minister if he said that there is too much malaise created if you do not levy a substantial wholesaler and the public think he is getting away with murder.  Of course, the public never think that if the price of butter comes down the wholesaler who is carrying stocks is very rarely required for the loss he has to carry on his stocks if there is a reduction in the levy that has been imposed.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister has power in this long section&mdash;which it is not easy to follow in detail&mdash;to discriminate, or is he required to levy on every butter trader.  Subsection (5) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section and in section 39 of this Act &ldquo;butter trader&rdquo; means a person (other than a registered proprietor of premises), who carries on for trade or gain, whether alone <Col N="1445" /> or in conjunction with any other business, the business of selling, by wholesale or retail, butter.</P>
    <P>Suppose you place upon yourself the obligation of checking the butter stocks of every retail butter shop in Ireland, does that not oblige you to make a visitation to every butter shop in Ireland?  You may not collect a levy except on three cwt. or more but would you not be obliged to inspect every premises to know if they had three cwt. or more?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>It is certainly not the ordinary procedure for the recovery of contract debts because it begins by passing the obligation to the debtor of proving he does not own, whereas ordinarily the person goes into court <Col N="1446" /> to claim the money and the first obligation on him is to prove that the alleged debtor owes him the money. In this case we reverse the procedure. The board can issue a certificate under its seal against anybody, whereupon he must post off to the court and protest that he does not owe anything to anybody.  Mark you, if he fails to turn up, he will have a decree awarded against him because the certificate is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the debt is due.  I never could understand why these statutory bodies should be exempted from the obligation that devolves on ordinary citizens of the State to prove the validity of their debts.  This practice is carried in its most extreme form to the claims of the Revenue Commissioners, who can put you in jail for debt.  Is there any reason why a board set up by statute should be exempted from the ordinary obligation of demonstrating that someone owes them money before they are entitled to recover judgment against him?  Is there any reason why a board should have that power?</P>

      <P>Certainly I never heard we had any power to issue a certificate against a retail shopkeeper which was <i>prima facie</i> evidence of his debt due.  I was never conscious such a power existed.  I can well imagine <i>vis-á-vis</i> creameries it was possible for the Butter Marketing Board to recover levies in this way because the records were there and there was a constant interchange of correspondence with the the Butter Marketing Board.  We do these things step by step.  This is roughly the same procedure conferred upon the Land Commission by this House at the time of the troubles in connection with <Col N="1447" /> the land annuities.  This House was prevailed upon then to authorise the Land Commission to short-circuit the courts and to recover by handing to the Sheriff a certificate that the annuities were overdue.  I know the number of abuses that arose in that connection were relatively few, but I have known one man to have a decree issued against him for another man's annuity and to have the bailiffs sent out to his house on foot of a document issued by the Land Commission without any reference to the court at all.</P>
      <P>I admit this procedure is not so extreme. The board has to go to the court and it behoves the shopkeeper, the wholesaler, or the creamery to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the debt is not due.  Mark you, if you go into court and are confronted by what is accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that you had 27 lbs. of butter in the shop and your concern is that you had only 7 lbs., I find it very hard to understand why a board like this should have that preferential position. Is it just to save the board trouble?  Can anybody help me?</P>

      <P>In any legal proceedings by the Minister against any person for any money claimed to be due by such person to the Minister on foot of a levy under this Part of this Act, a certificate under the official seal of the Minister certifying that such person was liable under this Part of this Act to pay a levy of a specified amount on a specified substance in respect of a specified levy month and that a specified sum is due and unpaid by such person on foot of such levy shall be conclusive evidence as to the liability for and amount of such levy and <i>prima facie</i> evidence as to the amount which is due and unpaid by such person in respect of such levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  Here we are, labouring away, trying to tread our way through a Bill of 64 sections of a very complicated kind.  The Minister is sitting in front of a brief, certainly four inches thick.  We direct his attention to the fact that Section 38 concerning the recovery of levies authorises the board to issue a certificate which is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of <Col N="1449" /> the existence of the debt and the Minister bluntly replies: &ldquo;Oh! this only applies to butter.&rdquo;  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Now, either the Minister believed that when he brought the Bill into the House or else he did not know what was in the Bill.  It certainly makes the labour of discussing this legislation far heavier if the Minister will not read his brief. All I will ask him to do is to read out the page of his brief relative to each section.  If he does not understand it, we shall.  I do not think it right for him to say quite blandly to Deputy Jones &ldquo;This refers only to the levy on butter.&rdquo;  It does not.</P>

      <P>Correct me if I am wrong.  Maybe there is a misprint in my copy of the Bill.  If there is, the fault is not mine but that of the printer. Let us spell it out. &ldquo;Every sum payable by a person by virtue of this Act to the Board for or on account of milk levy.&rdquo;  Are those words in the Bill or are they not?  The Minister just told us they are not in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wanted to say was this.  As far as the milk levy is concerned, in this Bill we are making the Exchequer responsible only for up to two-thirds of the export loss.  The board will be obliged to find the remaining one-third by way of levy. There is no means by which they can get that one-third except by levy.  They are the people who will be responsible for determining the amount of the levy and for collecting it from the creameries.  If some creamery were to refuse to pay that levy to the board, I suppose they would have the right to take action in order to recover it.  The onus is on the board to provide one-third of their losses and they can only get that by way of levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all going daft in this House.  The question of the power of the board to recover the levy it is authorised to recover under this Bill is not in question on this discussion. It is the method of recovery. I may get it into my head in the morning that the present Minister for Agriculture owes me 72/6d. for a pair of boots, but no one is going to suggest if I issue a certificate that Patrick Smith of County Cavan owes me 72/6d. for a pair of boots, that that is <i>prima facie</i> evidence he owes me 72/6d. for a pair of boots.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a certificate.  I do not think it is <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  I think I would be required to go into court and prove I had delivered to the person in question a pair of boots and that he was the person to whom I delivered the pair of boots.  Is it not fantastic to say it is perfectly normal that somebody should have the right of going <Col N="1451" /> into court and establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case on the foot of his own certificate? If you confine that strictly to creameries, I could make a case for it.  The case I would make is this. If Deputies will understand the relationship that exists between the Department of Agriculture and the creameries, there is no problem here at all, because there is the most intimate contact between them.  They know one another so well that it is probably a short circuiting of procedure which the creamery would welcome. In drawing up the certificate there would probably be agreement. They would probably agree on the quantity mentioned in the certificate. It might be on some other issue altogether they would join in the appropriate court, if they went to court at all.  But when you go beyond that and give them the right to similar facilities <i>vis-á-vis</i> shopkeepers, wholesalers, and anyone engaged in the trade, why should a statutory board have the right to short-circuit the procedure in court any more than anybody else has?  What struck me about the Minister was his reaction.  His reaction was &ldquo;Why should they not?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It seems to me to be an odd provision if anyone is in the slightest way interested in the freedom of the individual.  Section 39 and Section 40 give the auditor of the board extensive powers to examine records.  The implication is that the information absorbed from those records is confidential and is not to be communicated to anybody except the board.  It used to be the Minister for Agriculture.  Section 41 says that &ldquo;subject to subsection (2) of the section, information obtained under Section 39 or 40 or in the performance of the functions of the board by the board or a member, officer or servant thereof shall not be disclosed, without the consent of the person to whom or to whose business the information relates, to a person who is not a member of the board or an officer or servant employed by the board.&rdquo;  Then it says:</P>
      <P>(2) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply in relation to the disclosure of information to the Minister or the Comptroller and Auditor General or for the purposes of any legal proceedings (whether civil or criminal) taken or proposed to be taken under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> Does the Minister not think that there is something queer about getting access to records on a confidential basis, under Sections 39 and 40, and then claiming that they may be communicated to somebody with a view to instituting civil or criminal proceedings?</P>

      <P>This provision is included to provide for the continuation of the scheme at present operated by the Minister.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussing this Bill is like constructing a crossword puzzle because I raised on an earlier section the question as to whether this whole system of storing butter was a wise system and whether we should not review it, to which the Minister replied; &ldquo;Ah well, we are transferring all responsibility over to the board and we ought to let the board settle it.&rdquo;  I made an eloquent argument that this was a matter we ought to determine before we hand it over to the board. If now transpires under section 42 that this is a matter that we are not going to transfer over to the board because the Minister settles the scheme.  Section 42 subsection (1) says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may from time to time give the Board a direction in writing requiring it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to make and carry out during such period or periods as may be specified in the direction a scheme for the payments to the registered proprietors of creameries of allowances towards the cost of the cold storage, by or on behalf of the proprietors, of butter, or</P>
      <P>(b) to suspend, or provide for the cesser of, as from a date specified in the direction, in whole or in part, of a scheme under this subsection and payments thereunder.</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) of the section says:</P>
      <P>The terms and provisions of a scheme under sub-section (1) of this section shall, on the direction of the Minister, be amended by the Board in such manner as the Minister specifies in writing to the Board.</P>
      <P>Subsection (7) says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may give a direction under subsection (6) of this section to the Board from time to time as he thinks fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I am stupid.  If I am, I am sorry, but I understood the Minister to say to me that he heard my argument with interest but that, <Col N="1458" /> in view of the fact that he proposed to divest himself of functions in relation to that matter he thought it better to leave this matter to the discretion of the new board who would be responsible for it.

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5, subsection (2) authorises the board to store butter. Section 42 gives the Minister power to direct the board to do it if he so wishes but the board has already authority to do it on their own.  Presumably, if the Minister feels the board have not done something which they ought to have done he can direct them to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Booth has come in late.  I raised this matter on an earlier section and the Minister told me that he did not propose to consider the merits of this question because he was passing it over to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier on I did explain at length, I thought, that the Minister is responsible entirely for all matters, I might say, as far as the home market is concerned.  This is an export marketing board that is being established. Ministers have fixed, will the consent of the Government, the price of butter. They have determined the price at which butter will be purchased by the Butter Marketing Committee.  They have determined the price at which butter would be retailed.  In the determination of these questions they have made provision for the cold storage of butter, the cost of cold storage and for other minor charges and all these were included in the price support system as far as the supply of milk was concerned.  That picture is not changed.  That picture does not change.  The Minister and the Government will still be responsible for the determination of that matter.  That is why there is this continuing provision made in these sections that we are discussing.  There is this continuing provision for payment of the levy which is referred to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1459" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no levy or anything referred to here.  Is not this section simply vesting power in the Minister to make a scheme which he may require the board to carry out for the cold storage of butter during the winter months, presumably to maintain a supply?  I argued on an earlier section that that practice is costing us £500,000 a year, approximately, and that I thought the Minister ought to tell the House whether it was his intention to carry on that scheme or whether he would consider it desirable to effect the economy that could be made by permitting creameries to sell their butter as they made it and, if there was any gap in supply to meet the domestic demand in the months of January and February, to import butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If you were to permit the creameries to sell butter in that way do you not see the competition that there would be amongst them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  Let them buy what was coming in at approximately what it cost them to produce butter at home.  The Minister would thus save £500,000 in storage costs and accumulate a further not inconsiderable sum to meet the cost of production or the cost of the levy or to reduce the price to the consumer, whichever he likes to do.  I think the Minister would save £500,000 and he would easily pick up, in respect of a levy primarily designed to maintain a table price throughout the year, another £100,000 for imports of butter.  I do not think it unreasonable in the course of a discussion of this character to ask the Minister his reaction to that proposal <Col N="1460" /> with which he must be intimately familiar.  He knows as much as I do about storage costs of butter, the procedure we operate and the alternatives that are available.</P>
      <P>I was told within the last hour when I raised this matter that the Minister had decided to transfer all responsibility in regard to decisions relating to all future policy to the board.  It now transpires under Section 42 that in fact this is a function the Minister will retain in his own hands.  Does the Minister feel free to say that we are getting fair value for the £500,000 by the present system or would he think that, if a change would yield between £500,000 and £600,000 which could be used for the consumer or the producer, we ought to make the change ? That is a reasonable request to make, that the Minister would give us his opinion upon that.  Surely the Minister is prepared to tell us whether he would consider the matter.</P>

      <P>I wanted information on more or less the same point.  Some Fianna Fáil Deputies said tonight that, after all, the Minister and the Government were responsible to the House. The section said: &ldquo;The board shall furnish to the Minister, at such times and in such form and manner as the Minister may specify, such information regarding its proceedings under this Act as the Minister may request.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have had an amount of trouble in this House in recent times especially in regard to information sought by members in respect of State or semi-State bodies.  I wonder would the Minister care to comment now on whether, if he is asked a question in the House as to the proceedings of this board, he will be in a position to give the information?  As it now stands the section says that the Minister may get all the information he wants; therefore it is not unreasonable to suggest that he should be in a position to make that information available to Deputies.</P>

      <P>It is not unreasonable that the Minister should expect to get the information he requires, seeing that the Exchequer may be involved in paying very substantial sums to meet the export losses but how a Minister would determine questions that would arise in that regard without having been furnished by the Board with the information is something I do not know.

      <P>I want to support Deputy Corish.  In relation to a measure such as this we have had quite a lot of experience in the past. In the past two years we had the spectacle of the Minister in charge of a Bill in this House giving an undertaking to the House that a certain statutory board about to be established would act in a certain way in relation to its statutory obligations. We found that undertaking was departed from when the Board was in fact established.  Here is a section in which the Minister is empowered as a member of the House, elected by the House, to get certain information from a board being established and Deputy Corish has asked the Minister in charge of the Bill to give his view as to whether he, as Minister for Agriculture, is prepared to answer due and proper Parliamentary Questions by Deputies in relation to the activities of this board.  I think that is a reasonable question to be raised by Deputy Corish and the Minister has not even attempted to reply to it.  Is it in fact the Minister's intention in establishing this board that, when Deputies here ask for information concerning its activities, they will be met by a Ministerial reply that this is no part of the functions of the Minister, and that no information is to be given to Deputies?</P>

      <P>On many occasions when Parliamentary Questions are addressed to Ministers, Deputies are met with the reply, in so far as State and semi-State bodies are concerned, that the annual report is available for inspection in the library.  I want to point out that the greatest weapon that Deputies have, and the greatest safeguard that the country has, is the Parliamentary Question and if the Parliamentary Question is to be ignored in the House by Ministers Parliament will cease to serve any useful function.  Ministers <Col N="1467" /> are making a complete farce of this House.</P>
      <P>In order to have this matter cleared up once and for all, I should like the Minister to give a much clearer reply to the points raised by Deputy Corish. Is he, or is he not, going to give the House all the information required concerning the activities of this board should Parliamentary Questions be addressed to him concerning the activities of the board?  Or will the Minister consider that the information that is being sought by a Deputy will warrant making enquiries direct to the board and agree that the information that the board places at his disposal will be given to this House when sought by means of Parliamentary Question?</P>
      <P>I feel the House would be satisfied, and we on this side of the House will express our satisfaction, if the Minister will give us a guarantee at this stage that, when a Parliamentary Question is addressed to him concerning any matter relating to the board, he will look upon it as part of his responsibility&mdash;he stated he would do so a few moments ago&mdash;to obtain the information from the board and pass it on, instead of giving the evasive answers which have been given in the past when questions concerning C.I.E., Bord na Móna and other State and semi-State bodies have been asked by Deputies in an effort to elicit information. As I said, the strongest weapon we have, whether in Government or Opposition, is the Parliamentary Question.  I can foresee Deputies being anxious to ask many Parliamentary Questions concerning the activities of this board because of the very important functions the board will be asked to discharge.  It is for that reason that I now ask that we should be informed as to where we stand and I shall be glad to hear from the Minister what his attitude will be in relation to giving Deputies information relevant to the activities of this board.</P>

Section 1 enables the provisions of the Bill to be brought into operation gradually, while this section makes corresponding provision in regard to suspension, by Order of the Minister, of the parts of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Acts which are being replaced in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think the comments of some of the junior Ministers of the Government should be allowed to pass unnoticed.  If we are to carry on the business of this House as it ought to be carried on, it involves a certain amount of give and take on both sides.  There is certain legislation brought before this House which requires exhaustive discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my submission it reflects credit on this House when it does exhaustively discuss legislation in detail.  It is offensive and impermissible interference on <Col N="1476" /> behalf of any single Deputy of the House, or on behalf of any junior Minister or Parliamentary Secretary to refer to this work of the House as the drawing out of the debates, or as wasting time or as filibustering.</P>

      <P>Surely this has no relevance to the matter before the House?  The contents of the Bill only may be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of clarification of the sections of this Bill.  That has been contributed to by the model debate which has taken place on the Bill.  There are provisions in it to which we seriously object but, on balance, we do not oppose the principle of the Bill and we feel that the experiment is entitled to an early opportunity to prove itself in practice. Therefore we are prepared to give the Government all Stages now.</P>
      <P>I think it only right to mention that, in the last analysis, discourtesy and refusal to furnish reasonable information by the Government Front Bench can be controlled by the Opposition only by repeated recourse to the Lobbies and a strict adherence to the Standing Orders of the House.  That is a device to which I, Deputy Corish and other responsible members of the House will not lightly have recourse. However, if the obligation is thrown on us it is our duty to have recourse to it and have recourse to it we shall when it becomes necessary.  It is our duty and obligation to do so.</P>
      <P>We want Parliament to work well and efficiently but that involves the Government in the tedium of supplying to the Opposition all the information to which they are entitled, and which it is our duty to seek.  When we are in their position we shall discharge that duty as we have done on previous occasions.  I hope that when we become the Government we shall generously provide the Opposition with what they need and when that day comes I would expect the Opposition to ask us to do that.  We shall insist on our rights and use every device available to us under the Standing Orders of the House to make sure that we get them.</P>

      <P>When this Bill is passed do I understand that the board will have power to levy one-third on milk and milk products but that it is only optional on the Government to contribute two-thirds?

      <P>I do not want to speak now, but we all realise the importance this measure may have for the country.  I wonder will the outcome of the Bill be such as we hope for, that its provisions will operate to secure markets in foreign countries for our milk and milk products?  Will this board adopt the attitude of concentrating on its own powers in the internal market here to the detriment of the foreign markets?  Will the Minister say that the Board's officers will co-operate with our Embassies in foreign countries in this matter?  They have been working towards securing markets in the countries in which they are stationed.  I believe that the officers of this board and the board themselves, if they can concentrate in the widest sense on co-operation with our Embassies, may do a little better in securing these foreign markets, if it is not too late already to secure them. If the Board concentrates on entering into markets that should be left for other people, I am afraid that the time given to this discussion will not give the results for which we all would hope.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendments:</P>
      <P>1.  In page 7, line 46, &ldquo;and, in determining as aforesaid the notional rent of any other dwelling, (being dwellings to which Chapter 2 of Part II of the Act of 1946 applied) shall be regarded as being so contained in that subsection&rdquo; added to the paragraph.</P>
      <P>2.  In page 8, line 15, &ldquo;and, in the case of any other dwelling, &lsquo;(being dwellings to which Chapter 2 of Part II of the Act of 1946 applied)&rsquo; shall be regarded as being so contained in that subsection&rdquo; added to the subparagraph.</P>
      <P>These two amendments are of a purely drafting nature and are consequential on the deletion from Section 9 of the words &ldquo;being dwellings to which Chapter 2 of Part II of the Act of 1946 applied.&rdquo;  These words were deleted by the House to ensure that when a court comes to fix a rent, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9, it would be entitled to take into account the rents of any comparable dwellings.  It transpired that, in order that Section 8 should operate fully, the reference which we had deleted should be deemed to be included in Section 9.  We thought the amendment we were making would achieve that but, in fact, it did not.</P>
