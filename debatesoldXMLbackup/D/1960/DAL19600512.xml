      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked that the Final Stage be left over until today in case he or his colleagues might have any observations to offer at this stage.  I do not know whether they have or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The only observation I want to make on it is this.  I should like to interest the Minister when he comes to make regulations under this legislation in two problems which, I think, are beginning to manifest themselves in Dublin and elsewhere and which, I feel, require attention.  The Minister's attention probably has been recently directed to a case in Cork where a woman was sued on foot of a hire-purchase contract.  It transpired in the course of the proceedings that what actually happened was that she had been approached in her home by an agent and had been persuaded to purchase some article on hire-purchase, and although she had not the deposit and was not in a position to put it down, the agent put down the deposit.  Subsequently, I think, it transpired the purchaser was unable to meet the instalments and some proceedings <Col N="1174" /> followed from that series of events.</P>
      <P>Hire-purchase may be a very desirable economic development, but like everything else, although good in itself, it is open to abuse.  I want to suggest to the Minister that where persons engage in the hire-purchase business and the prospective purchaser is not in a position to put down the deposit&mdash; and the agent puts down the deposit&mdash; presumably with the desire of collecting his commission on the sale&mdash;some steps should be taken either to render such a contract void under the regulations or to convert it into an ordinary credit sale transaction.</P>
      <P>It does seem to be a clear abuse, if the Minister by authority of the Oireachtas varies from time to time the percentage of deposits, with a view to exercising some control over the creation of credit and the purchase and sale of consumer goods, that a device can be employed calculated to frustrate the whole purpose of the regulations if and when an agent believes the commission to be sufficiently attractive to induce him to pay the deposit himself and to take his commission, hoping some day to recover the deposit but conscious in certain circumstances that, even if he does not recover the deposit, his commission on the sale is greater than the deposit and that he will still have some profit margin.  Quite apart from the credit creation aspect of this question, I think the propriety of this practice of pressing attractive merchandise on people who cannot afford the deposit is open to grave doubt.  I suggest it is a practice which the Minister might profitably study before making the regulations envisaged by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another practice to which I want to draw the Minister's attention. This practice is of so strange a character as to make it almost unbelievable, but I am reliably informed that it is in operation in the city of Dublin and is being operated at the expense of a very defenceless section of the community.  Ordinarily, I think, the Oireachtas must allow free people to make their own bargains and to abide by the consequences of <Col N="1175" /> the bargains they freely make, but to every general rule some exception, I think, must be made.</P>
    <P>I am told that in this city, particularly in certain new housing areas, a situation sometimes arises in which a family get into financial difficulties and possibly are threatened with eviction for that they are unable to find the rent and the arrears that have accumulated.  That naturally creates an atmosphere of great mental distress and apprehension.  Possibly, if they went the right way about it, means could be found to relieve that emergency without crippling the whole family finances, but, before appropriate means can be devised, an agent calls to the house and says: &ldquo;Here is a catalogue.  You can choose out of this catalogue goods to the value of £40.  I shall give you a docket which will entitle you to approach the merchant who has issued this catalogue to me as an agent and you can get goods to that value on the docket which I shall issue to you.  Sign this hire-purchase agreement now, undertaking to repay £40 in regular weekly instalments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That hire-purchase agreement is completed, whereupon the agent says: &ldquo;I understand you are a bit short of money here today.&rdquo;  The distressed householder says: &ldquo;I am very short of money.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says the agent, &ldquo;I will tell you what I am prepared to do.  I will give you £20 for your docket.&rdquo;  It seems incredible that such a transaction could be consummated but I am told those kinds of transactions are going on.  The person who is in financial straits surrenders the £40 docket and takes £20 in cash, discharges the urgent debts that threaten immediate consequences, and commits himself to pay off £40 over a protracted period.  The real truth is that in that case what is actually happening is that the hire-purchase machinery is being used for the purpose of conducting an illegitimate and an illegal money-lending activity.</P>
    <P>It does not seem conceivable that people would undertake such an improvident contract but, on the other hand, where poor people are in <Col N="1176" /> urgent apprehension of eviction, or something of that kind, it is astonishing what they will do.  I am not saying that eviction is the only apprehension they may have.  Sometimes they may already be deeply committed in other transactions of a hire-purchase character, and are gravely apprehensive that somebody is going to call at their house and, in the presence of the neighbours, re-possess some article of furniture on which they are no longer able to pay the instalments.  Thus, under one stress or another of that kind, they enter into these extravagantly improvident contracts.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister to inquire into these kinds of activities and, if necessary, by regulation, which of course must be laid before this House in due course, take steps to ensure that fraudulent hire-purchase contracts of that character will no longer be possible under our law, if the Minister has the same evidence as I have in respect of the first category of cases I have mentioned, that is, the proceedings to which I have referred which took place in the courts.</P>
    <P>In respect of the second category of cases&mdash;the docket for £40 re-purchased by the agent for half of that sum in cash&mdash;I assume the Minister will be in a position to inquire into that and confirm or correct the information which has reached me.  I am satisfied that there are taking place in the city transactions of that character, almost exclusively at the expense of poor people who are ill able to protect themselves from that type of activity, and I think it should not be beyond the skill of the Minister's advisers to devise machinery to prevent a continuance of these abuses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter to which I should like to refer, and I am speaking from personal experience of it, in regard to the execution of these hire-purchase agreements. Very often members of the legal profession find, when they are asked to defend civil bills where the claim is based on a hire-purchase agreement, that they are told by the hirers that they did not sign them. They say: &ldquo;We signed an order form but we did not sign a hire-purchase <Col N="1177" /> agreement.&rdquo;  Then, on demanding a copy of a hire-purchase agreement, a solicitor finds that a proper agreement has been entered into by the hirer, and that it is witnessed by the agent.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to look into the law on this matter and see if it is possible to have an independent person witness the signature of the hirer on all hire-purchase agreements, because, though you may cod the hirer, who is possibly anxious to procure the articles being hired to him, you generally do not cod two people at the same time.  The person who is asked to witness a signature will inquire further into the agreement, and possibly read it.  If such agreements are entered into, it would be a good thing that the witness should not be an agent of the owner.  He should be an independent witness, if necessary, a relation, and a relation of the hirer should not make an agreement void. A witness who is in the employment of the owner should not be a valid witness to such agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by both Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Donnell strengthen the position I took up on the Second and Report Stages of the Bill in relation to Section 6, which empowers the Minister to make regulations to control hire-purchase transactions in different ways. Deputy McGilligan sought to limit these powers to Orders by the Minister prescribing minimum deposits and maximum periods of repayment, but, in order to ensure that the Minister would have adequate powers to deal with evasory practices which could spring up in hire-purchase transactions, I insisted on maintaining in the section powers to control the form of the agreement and the information to be given.  The intention is to introduce regulations requiring minimum deposits only when national financial considerations require it, and not in ordinary circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to see the case outlined in Deputy Dillon's first example arising at the present time, at any rate. Minimum deposits, certainly, are not required by law at the present time and will only be required by law if an appropriate order is made under <Col N="1178" /> Section 6 and in the national financial difficulties that I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>If such regulations are made I believe it will be possible to ensure that the payment of deposits by agents rather than by the hirer of the goods could be held to render the agreement void.  That is a personal opinion, speaking without consultation, but I am sure it would be possible so to frame the regulations as to ensure that such a transaction would be void and would be unenforceable.  Therefore, such agent would pay a deposit on behalf of the hirer at his own risk.</P>
    <P>The second case to which the Deputy refers was mentioned in part by Deputy Larkin during the Second Stage and since then I have made inquiries.  I was told that there was in existence, not only in Dublin, but in Cork, at any rate, a system whereby a person had some form of agency from a firm who supplied household or other goods and if that person approached a housewife who needed, say, £20 worth of goods, the agent would give the housewife an order form.  The housewife would commit herself to repay to that agent maybe £25 or £30.  I have not heard, however, of cases where that transaction was brought the other stage further, when the agent offered to buy that order form from the housewife at a much reduced price in circumstances in which the housewife was badly in need of ready cash.</P>
    <P>Strictly speaking, I do not think that such a transaction is hire purchase but I can assure the Deputy that I shall watch the development of such transactions and, if they require the making of regulations and if I have power to control them, I shall not hesitate to take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>I am advised, however, that with the development of hire purchase, the issue of order forms to housewives for the supply of goods on credit has diminished considerably.  There may be, of course, as the Deputy has suggested, agents still acting and, perhaps by reason of their diminishing market, acting unscrupulously but I assure the Deputy that I shall keep an eye on the position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> As far as Deputy O'Donnell's point is concerned, I think, again, that that can be adequately covered by the regulations to be made under Section 6 which empowers the Minister to make an order requiring the agreement to be in a certain form and I take it that the practicability of having a witness to such an agreement could be ensured under the subsection dealing with the form of the agreement.  However, I am not so sure that in most cases in which unthinking people enter into transactions for hire purchase the presence of a witness to the agreement would be any safeguard because most people who sign documents as witnesses really set out to ensure that they sign only as witnesses and are not concerned with the contents of the document. Their main purpose is to ensure that their signing of the document will not impose any legal obligation on them other than, perhaps, at some later stage to prove that they did witness the document.</P>
    <P>However, as I said, the section which empowers the Minister to make regulations is wide enough, I think, to ensure that the form of the agreement will make provision for a witness signing the agreement if that proves to be necessary having regard to experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring specially to the notice of the Minister a case in my constituency of a Connaught Ranger who, unfortunately, got into a small bit of trouble some years ago.  The offence was trivial; it was not anything criminal.  His pension, of course, was taken from him. I know that the Minister has not the power himself, but the House has the power to restore that pension.</P>
      <P>It is not an easy matter to see in trouble a man who 40 years ago laid down arms in India.  It took great men to do it.  To lay down arms in India took as good men as it took to take up arms in this country.  After the burning suns of India and the rigours of imprisonment it was only natural that mental illness should affect the unfortunate person concerned. In the first years of the war he found himself in a concentration camp in France.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry. When I moved to report progress last evening, I was dealing with the pensions of the Defence Forces as such and have not anything to add on that matter.</P>
      <P>It is true that those retiring on pension from the rank and file of the Defence Forces are finding the going very hard.  As I said yesterday evening, there is no member of this House who has not been approached in one way or another to try to assist them in finding some other employment to enable them to augment their small pensions.  Therefore, the Minister and the Government should seriously consider increasing their pensions and should make some further provision for them.</P>
      <P>To go back to the other pensions of those whom I might describe as my old comrades and colleagues of days gone by, amongst those people, as I said, Father Time is reaping a heavy harvest and their numbers are decreasing every year.  In the Estimate for this year, one can see that the numbers have been considerably reduced.  In other words, the Minister and the Department are basing upon the number of deaths which occurred in the past their estimate of the number that will occur this year.  Every year, the Department, the Minister and the Government have underestimated the number who pass on.  Therefore, I feel that two things are required: some provision to increase their pensions in a substantial way and, on reaching the age of 70, a sympathetic examination of the means test on the special allowances.</P>
      <P>We get the extraordinary situation where a person with a medal, or a certificate of service, gets the old age pension fairly easily but when the same pensions officer comes to examine the means of an applicant for a special allowance&mdash;where he gets this income from or how he calculates it, I do not know&mdash;it appears that something is radically wrong with the whole system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Medical Pensions Board are sympathetic but they are tied up by regulations.  Total disability or <Col N="1182" /> total incapacity is very difficult to define.  I am aware of persons who have been refused a special allowance on these grounds who, I know well, are totally incapable of earning their livelihood and who, on examination, appeared to be capable of self-support.</P>
    <P>In the estimation of the means of an applicant who is resident with somebody else and the accommodation is given gratuitously by the other person&mdash;perhaps a brother-in-law, a father-in-law or some such relative&mdash; the calculation includes the value of so much a week income, whereas, on the other hand, there is a hardship on the other person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Not if there is a hardship on the person.  There is a provision that, if it is a hardship on the person providing accommodation, it is not taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that, and I am sure many Deputies are glad to know that these cases can be re-examined.  If these few remarks of mine did no other good than to get that fact established, they will have been of some help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to ask the Minister how the position relating to the widows of people who were on disability pension is proceeding.  Is the Act in operation, and have the people who think the Act applies to them made application to the Minister?  I understood there would be an examination of the files and that it would not be necessary for the widow to apply but cases have been brought to my notice recently in which it would appear that the people concerned have not so far received any word from the Department. I advised them to apply <Col N="1183" /> directly to the Minister, supplying the name of the deceased and, if they had any of his papers, to cite the reference number, or return them to the Department. In that way, the name of the person could be ascertained and the situation fully established.</P>
    <P>As I say, the reduction this year is, in one sense, smaller than it was in other years.  Under the heading &ldquo;Wounds and Disability Pensions and Gratuities&rdquo;, there is a reduction of £6,600.  Under the heading &ldquo;Special Allowances&rdquo;, there is an increase of £2,200, and under the heading &ldquo;Military Service Pensions&rdquo; there is a decrease of £11,000.  I am aware, of course, that when a person who has a medal or a military service certificate, reaches the age of 70, the disability examination does not apply and he is automatically entitled to the special allowance if his means allow it.  That is a very wise provision and it will, of course, for a short time, increase the charge under that heading.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Department to be as generous as they possibly can be in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is one final matter I wish to raise in connection with the question that has arisen about the service in the Army of the person who has a military service certificate or a medal with bar.  The Minister has taken some steps to deal with that in another way, but it has now arisen in relation to the Garda Síochána and the Minister for Justice has decided to extend the service of officers, N.C.O.s and men of the Garda Síochána who have a medal with bar.  Everyone knows that the definition was that a person had a military service certificate.  During my term of office for all purposes, a person with a medal was regarded as having a medal, and whether with or without bar made no difference.</P>
    <P>A number of officers and men of the Garda Síochána did not apply for a service certificate on the ground that they were in good employment and were amply compensated by the State. They are now looking for it but because the Minister has wound up the Military Service Pensions Board, it is not possible for them to get the military <Col N="1184" /> service certificate that would entitle them to the medal with bar. That creates a very grave hardship.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should declare that there is no difference in the medal &mdash;that a medal with or without a bar shows service and membership of the Forces.  He should appeal to his colleague, the Minister for Justice, not to enforce that regulation in that way but to accept from the Minister for Defence a certificate that the medal has been duly awarded.  If the medal has been duly awarded, it should meet the requirements of the Minister for Justice.  I appeal to him to do that in the interests of fair play to all concerned.</P>
    <P>It would appear that in 1957 or the beginning of 1958 the Minister informed the Old I.R.A.  Association that if the local officers were satisfied there was a case of hardship or a case where a person was entitled to a certificate of service and did not get it the matter would be looked into.  The Minister said that if they investigated the case and sent their report to the Mansion House Committee, as it is known, and then, if the Mansion House Committee investigated the case and found that the person was entitled to a certificate of service, he would see that it was granted.</P>
    <P>I have been approached in regard to a particular matter and the persons concerned want to know what has happened.  I think with the best intentions in the world, it was not possible for the Minister, because of the abolition of the Board, to have the matter reinvestigated.  I presume that when he gave that undertaking, if he gave it&mdash; I assume that what they say is right and that he did give it&mdash;it was while the Pensions Board was in operation and that when it ceased and they had not dealt with the cases that should have been dealt with, he was no longer able to fulfil his promise.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the matter because there is a good deal of discontent about it.  I have even been charged that I could have helped to see to it that the Minister's promise was fulfilled.  For the life of me, I cannot see what I or anybody else could do about it.  I should be glad if the <Col N="1185" /> Minister would tell us the circumstances in which he gave that undertaking and why it is no longer possible for him to give effect to it.  I want to thank my colleague on the other side of the House for permitting me to say these few words and also the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to take part in the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>To resume at the point at which I broke off, this man, a former member of the Connaught Rangers, found himself in a concerntration camp in France.  He was allowed to write to me to certify that he had been engaged in the struggle for independence.  His sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life. It was the second time he had been under sentence of death.</P>
      <P>I mention these matters so that the Minister and the House will appreciate what condition this man was in mentally when at last he was discovered some place in Russia and was subsequently extradited.  He committed some trivial offence and as a result his pension was taken from him.  I am sure that if the district justice had known the full circumstances of this unfortunate man, he would, in his wisdom, have imposed a shorter sentence.</P>
      <P>If this man had been represented by a solicitor or had had legal aid, it would have been pointed out on his behalf that he was in receipt of a military service pension and that a sentence longer than three months would mean the withdrawal of that pension.  Unfortunately, he was not legally represented.  Nobody knew anything about his case until he had served the sentence and then apparently it was too late to make representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is a humane man.  I appeal to him to bring the matter of this unfortunate man before the Government with a view to the restoration of his pension.  He is now in the winter of his life.  His poor health can be imagined.  I beg that the case of this man who gave such loyal service to the country and whose actions were deserving of every possible good that we could give him will <Col N="1186" /> receive sympathetic consideration.  I trust the Minister will see his way to have inquiries made.</P>
    <P>I am certain, as I say, that if the district justice had known the position he would not have given him the extra few weeks that involve such hardship for him now.  He has been without a pension for many years.  His financial and physical conditions are now much worse.  He has been punished very severely for his offence.  I feel confident the Minister will restore his pension and help him to tide over the most difficult period of his life.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to the means test in respect of special allowances. It is the one means test I never liked.  I ask the Minister to have it re-examined in relation to the claim of a pensioner's wife for the old age pension.  It is hardly fair.  The State gives a pension at 70 years of age to the old woman to help her to exist.  I fail to see why that pension should be assessed as means when her husband claims a special allowance.  It would be well if the Minister would act soon as there are bound to be changes in the near future&mdash;on 1st January next.  It would be well if the Minister would forgo that part of the means test in the interim.</P>
    <P>I have long experience and I find that, while many of the social welfare officers are reasonably fair, some are carried away.  There appears to be some mystery as to how they decide on an estimate of means.  I am told that some of them estimate means of £104 against people and others estimate means of £130.  Married and single applicants are treated thus.  Such social welfare officers should have their heads examined.</P>
    <P>If I give particulars of specific cases to the Minister, I trust he will ascertain if it is true that the social welfare officer assessed means to the extent we are told he did because, as a result, the applicant is debarred from a special allowance.  In one or two cases I know of, the social welfare officer should have his head examined. There is a sum of £2 12s. for free lodging.  I do not think free lodging should be associated with <i>bona fide</i><Col N="1187" /> Old I.R.A.  I appeal to the Minister not to refuse a military service pension to a genuine member of the Old I.R.A. I have no sympathy whatsoever for men who pretend they were in the Irish Forces.  I am jolly sure some of them were not.  Some of them hung their stockings up for Daddy Christmas.  We know that others were refused.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to be very careful before he refuses a military service medal in respect of a genuine old I.R.A. man.  I know very well that spite and jealousy have played no small part in the recommendations, whether in respect of a military service pension or a military service medal. Spite played a great part&mdash;personal spite more perhaps than even political spite.  Few elements of political spite are to be found but we know that such is not the case in regard to personal spite.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that if an old I.R.A. man loses his medal or was refused a medal, he will have the right to appeal to some body set up by the Minister before whom evidence can be heard.  Let the green-eyed monsters who are responsible for preventing a man getting a medal to which he is fully entitled come out into the open on oath and stand over what they did secretly.</P>
    <P>We hear again that a person did not qualify because of the fact that he was not active in the three months before the Truce.  The period of three months before the Truce is a very difficult period to assess.  I can assure the House that the activities in this period were not as great as people think nor was it easy to be active.  Even if the person in question had to transfer his place of residence or work to some other area for safety purposes, as long as he remained a member of the I.R.A. he is fully entitled to a military service pension.</P>
    <P>We have a number of certifying officers, some of whom I know personally. They could not think of what happened last week, not to speak of what happened 40 or more years ago. I have personal experience of that.  A minute inquiry should be made, and, <Col N="1188" /> if necessary, the Minister should appoint a few members of his staff to hear orally the evidence for or against in cases where certain people are refused. It is bad enough&mdash;indeed it is very bad&mdash;that a man cannot wear a medal to which he is entitled but it is much worse that a man who was a <i>bona fide</i> member of the I.R.A. is refused a medal.  In other words, you are telling him that he was not in the I.R.A. at all.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the matter of special allowances, especially in the case of a man who was turned down on the grounds of means.  The Minister should give that man the right to appeal.  I do not refer to medical grounds because if the medical board turns him down, that is good enough for me.  I do not doubt the board in any way; I am sure they are impartial. If they find that a person is incapacitated, they will have no hesitation in saying so, but in regard to means, some of the estimates are purely imaginary and I think the person should have the right of appeal.</P>
    <P>There are members of the Garda and the Army, too, who were in the pre-Truce I.R.A. who unfortunately did not make their case sufficiently well to get a military service pension. I know that military service certificates were awarded under the Military Service Pensions Acts of 1924 and 1934.  Those people were entitled to pensions.  It is fair that persons not in possession of certificates under the Military Service Pensions Act who satisfy the Minister that their service was such as to merit the award of a pension, had they made application under the Acts, should be awarded pensions.  The trouble is that an application now is too late.  That is a hardship on many of these.  I take it that the Minister will arrange that in such cases he will entertain applications from them, in view of the statement of the Minister for Justice some weeks ago.  Up to now, only a member of the Garda or Army had a bar to their military service medal but it looks as if that factor is much more important now.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should give special consideration to men who are <Col N="1189" /> 100 per cent. disabled.  Nobody is more deserving of sympathy than those unfortunate men.  There are not many of them left now.  Unfortunately their number is getting smaller.  They had their glorious hour.  The days of many of those old soldiers who helped to obtain freedom for this country are practically gone.  I would ask the Minister to consider favourably the question of giving a higher pension to those men who are 100 per cent. disabled.  They are not able to do anything now as they are too old.</P>
    <P>Freedom costs very little.  There are other countries in which freedom costs countless millions but it cost us very little in this country and if we hand over to posterity a little liability, we make no apology for it because we hand over to them something which is priceless, something which money could not buy and something which future generations, when they come to realise fully what it means, will appreciate.</P>
    <P>I do not see any good reason why the widows of men in receipt of pensions under the 1937 Act are not granted further facilities.  Every year the Minister or his predecessors made some improvement and I think that little improvement is well deserved. It is long overdue.  The widow of a 1937 pensioner ought to be as near and dear to the State as a pensioner under the Acts of 1923, 1927, 1932 or any other Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and I thank him for the courtesy with which he has always received deputations or members of this House when making a case for a <i>bona fide</i> old I.R.A. man.</P>
    <P>With regard to dependants' allowances, the case is very difficult to prove.  It is very difficult for people whose brothers were killed 40 years ago or perhaps more to prove dependence. They are old themselves and probably some of them are not too enlightened on legal matters.  There are not many left now.  I think very few have been turned down and I would ask the Minister to reconsider favourably the question of making it easier for some of these dependants to get the pension.  That will give them the <Col N="1190" /> same comfort at least as they would have had if their brothers had not given their lives for this country.  I know that as far as the Minister is concerned we are knocking on an open door in our desire to promote the welfare of those soldiers of the Republic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate interests me because I am well acquainted with people affected by it, as an old Fianna member who has associated with old I.R.A. members.  First of all, I should like to deal with this question of the medal.  In my opinion the Minister should issue some kind of certificate, something that would show that the person had service.  There could be a distinction as between the person with active service and others but there should be some kind of a certificate. It is not enough to have a medal because as time goes on it will be like the old soldiers in the American Civil War.  We shall become fewer and more privileged, hail-fellow-well-met with everybody and going around on sticks.  There will, however, be a few bogus cases and it will be so long since the time the medal was granted and since the evidence was there to show that a person was entitled to a medal, that there will be bogus people who will have medals.  Nobody will be able to say that these people are &ldquo;phonies.&rdquo;  The only thing to prove a person is genuine would be a certificate.</P>
      <P>I understand that Deputy MacEoin had in mind some kind of commission to investigate those in possession of medals because it is alleged that some people have medals to which they are not entitled.  That is true.  There may not be many cases but even so the position should be rectified.  People's memories fail them and it is quite a simple thing for a man to say: &ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember this fellow; he was in my Company&rdquo;.  But he could have been in the Company six months before the Truce or six months after the Truce and he might not be able to place that person so well.  It is always possible for someone to be backed up by a friend and the Company officer may accept that assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember well that in 1918&mdash;I mentioned this before&mdash;there was no <Col N="1191" /> end to the people in the Fianna.  I was only a youngster at the time and there were 80 to 90 people on parade but gradually the parade became smaller as times became more dangerous.  I remember our meeting in a loft in Upper Henrietta Street; there were never more than a dozen there for the six months or so before the Truce. Then gradually the crowd came back during the Truce and there were about 100 there again.  I suppose most Companies were something like that in both the I.R.A. and the Fianna.  The question is how can a man remember whether another man was a member earlier or not or whether he was there when times were becoming dangerous.</P>
    <P>One person said that it was enough that a man was a member even if he had not been seen on parade for some time, but the question arises: why was he not on parade?  It was not a question of being on the books; you were there to serve.  I had a little experience in the Civil War when I was handed a certain small command by a certain gentleman.  He handed me the baby but he could well say that he fought.  So he did, but he disappeared and was arrested nice and peacefully six months later, having taken no part in the proceedings in the interim.  It is important that men should prove they were there to serve if called upon. If they had all disappeared there would have been no Army if it was required.</P>
    <P>For example, at the time of the attack on the Custom House there were many men lost to us and if there had not been other men standing by to take their place it would have been unfortunate. It was important that the men were on parade.  I should like to emphasise that.  At that time, certainly in activities like the attack on the Custom House it was dangerous, in Dublin anyway, for a large number of men to take part in an engagement.  It was safer to have only three or four, or a half a dozen of them, and usually the same half dozen were brought out to do a job.  If one of them was arrested another man was taken in out of the crowd.  It did not mean that the others were &ldquo;funking&rdquo; because, as <Col N="1192" /> long as they were there on parade, they were there to serve.</P>
    <P>Those people should get certificates. It is not too late to show that they were serving members of the I.R.A. during that period.  There should be something to distinguish them from those who actually have service medals for action.  As time goes on there will be fewer of these people and you will have a number of &ldquo;phonies &rdquo;.  We want to avoid that.  In my opinion those who served are getting a raw deal.  If you took part in none of the activities you did not get a pension.  I never advocated pensions but I did say that people should get a gratuity just like those in the F.C.A.  Those who turn up in the F.C.A. on parade in peace time get a gratuity.  In the &ldquo;Tan&rdquo; war you could have turned up for two or three years, two or three times a week, instead of looking after yourself learning the Irish language in order to get a good job later.  You were giving your time and putting yourself in danger of being arrested and shot as a prisoner, as did happen in some cases.</P>
    <P>Many of those people did minor jobs if they were asked to do them.  They served just as much as the other fellows.  In the countryside large numbers of men could operate but in Dublin, as I say, a crowd immediately attracted attention.  I remember a group of nine who had gathered to do a certain job and some woman in the local post office saw them and rang up the police and they were all arrested. These people were good soldiers and should get some sort of recompense or some sort of gratuity but, to start with, there should be some sort of certificate to back up the medal.  The medal means nothing.  As I said, as we get fewer in numbers there will be more &ldquo;phonies&rdquo; and it is important that any privileges which are going should be given to the right people.</P>
    <P>I had almost forgotten one point which I intended to mention on the Estimate for Defence.  In my opinion those Old I.R.A. men should be entitled to some free hospital treatment in Army hospitals.  They ought to have some privilege of that type for the service they gave.  Some of them got nothing but a medal worth 5/-.  In <Col N="1193" /> their old age those men should get free hospital service because many of them may not be entitled to the blue card; they may be border-line cases like many in the community, and indeed, there is much dissatisfaction about this blue card.</P>
    <P>I notice in the accounts that hospital treatment has decreased from £2,000 to £1,000.  In fact, there is a general decrease of over £23,000 in the accounts this year and last year, and every year from this on there will be a further decrease.  These men are passing on and it is obvious that their numbers will decrease.  In fact, the Minister can afford to be a little generous in future.  I think the important thing is a certificate to justify having the medal.  That would do away with any inquiries as to whether a man had a right to a medal or not because further information would be given to the Minister and his Department so that they could be satisfied on the merits of the case even though the man already had a medal. In that way, the inquiry which Deputy MacEoin had in mind would come about.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the Connaught Rangers.  I attended a commemoration of the Connaught Rangers in Glasnevin last year and I was touched by the speech of the Chairman of the Committee who spoke of those who had been executed and who had died abroad.  I think it is not too much to ask the Minister to do something about having the remains of those people brought back to this country.  That was the proposal made by the Chairman at the commemoration and I think the Minister should keep it in mind.</P>
    <P>My most important point is the certificate to support the possession of a medal so that there will be no &ldquo;phonies&rdquo; in future and I would also ask that the matter of having the bodies of Connaught Rangers restored to this country be considered.</P>

      <P>It was rather refreshing to hear Deputy Davern talking about freedom and the price we paid for it.  It would have been great if they had thought in that way many years <Col N="1194" /> ago&mdash;that freedom was worth while having.</P>
      <P>Once again I refer to the Connaught Rangers.  I have done so on several occasions already and I was glad to hear two other Deputies raise the matter to-day.  Deputy Sherwin referred to some who were executed.  Others died in jail at the hands of the British but we cannot lift our heads any higher than the British because we allowed several of these men to die in the workhouses.  I would urge the Minister once more to issue some form of recognition to the survivors or to the families of survivors of those who played their part in foreign fields.  I know that the official attitude will be against issuing a medal on the grounds that it might be the prelude to a demand for a pension.  That would be a rather poor attitude to adopt and I appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to give some recognition to those survivors or their relatives.  I would like him to say, when replying, if he is inclined to do this.  Then we might continue to press the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know and understand that the Minister is very favourably disposed towards the survivors of the fight for independence.  His heart is with them and he will do everything possible within the law and the regulations to make their lot easier in the years when their health is failing and when, perhaps, some of them still <Col N="1195" /> have family obligations and when the world is pressing pretty severely on them.</P>
    <P>I support the appeals made here to-day for those who have got special allowances under the award of service medals because in many cases these were border-line cases and there was only very little&mdash;perhaps the death of an officer intimately connected with their activities or the fact that they were not able to make the best possible case before the Board&mdash;to prevent them from getting pensions over the years.  Consequently, I think everything possible should be done for them and they should be dealt with as favourably as possible.</P>
    <P>Submissions were made to the Minister lately by the Old I.R.A. organisation in Cork setting out in detail three or four specific points they wanted him to consider.  I do not want to occupy the time of the Dáil now because the Minister will be able to get these points examined departmentally and see if he can go any distance towards meeting the reasonable requests set out.  The numbers now left are very small and are diminishing year after year.  In these circumstances the regulations should not be too rigidly applied.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin mentioned the case of some of these people who are being maintained not by relatives but by old friends or comrades who have no family obligations to them.  To my mind, it is unfair to consider hardship at all in some of these cases.  I know a few instances of that kind where, out of kindness of heart and appreciation of what they had done in the past, friends took these survivors in when they could no longer give a full week's work, although they may be able to do some odd jobs&mdash; not very much.  We should treat with every consideration those who are left. I feel there is no Minister who could hold the high office the present Minister holds who would treat more sympathetically any reasonable cases submitted to him and I ask him to give special consideration to cases submitted for reconsideration.</P>

    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to Defence Force pensions and to the fact that these pensions in many cases are not adequate to maintain the recipients in a reasonable standard of living.  N.C.O.s and private soldiers find it necessary, therefore, to seek employment in order to achieve a reasonably decent standard of living when they retire on pension.  I am well aware that that is so.  I realise that quite a number of retired soldiers, particularly those who have families depending on them, find it necessary to obtain employment outside.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister, I have arranged that these men will be given a period of pre-discharge leave, during which they are paid at the same rate as if they were still serving in the Army, in order to enable them to find employment without suffering in the interim a considerable reduction <Col N="1198" /> in their standard of living.  The majority of these men are well fit to work when they leave the Army, particularly those who retire after 21 years' service.  Such a man is still an active man.  He has the advantage of a very valuable training in the Army and he still has many more years during which he can do useful work.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need for me to recommend such people for employment.  Employers generally appreciate that the ex-soldier is likely to prove a good investment from an employment point of view.  It would, no doubt, be very desirable if pensions generally could be brought up to a sufficiently high level to eliminate the necessity of these people having to look for work.  It is, however, a general principle that pensions must be related to pay.  I do not wish it to be understood that I am quite satisfied with the level of the pensions awarded to N.C.O.s and private soldiers.  I should like to improve these, but, as I explained on previous occasions, the question of raising the level of pensions is bound up with financial considerations which are not entirely under my control.</P>
    <P>Of course the pensions of officers have always been related to their pay and that is the position still.  In regard to N.C.O.s and men, in 1947, the system of pensions was changed and married pensions and additional pensions for service in excess of 21 years were introduced for the first time then.  The trouble was that at that time the basic pension was not increased as much as I feel, and Deputy MacEoin feels, it might have been, and that has carried on ever since.  Deputy MacEoin and I have found it impossible to do anything about it so far but I have not given up hope of being able to improve that position eventually.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about special allowances and, in particular, about the means test.  Any means test is always unsatisfactory to the people to whom it is applied but the whole idea of special allowances is bound up with a means test.  There have been some fairly worthwhile relaxations of the means test in the past year or two <Col N="1199" /> and, as Deputies know, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement this year, did say that he was setting aside a sum of £30,000 to be allocated, in a manner to be decided between himself and myself, to special allowance holders.  One way of allocating that would be by some further relaxations of the means test.</P>
    <P>A number of suggestions as to what should be done in that respect were made by different Deputies here and it is somewhat along those lines that my own mind is running.  Free maintenance and other such reliefs are what I have in mind.  However, I did interject while Deputy MacEoin was speaking in regard to this question of maintenance being provided by other people for the special allowance holder that where it can be shown that the provision of such maintenance is a hardship on the person providing it, there is provision for its being ignored.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make clear to Deputies is that these decisions in relation to special allowances can always be reviewed, the assessment of the means and the decision of the Pensions Board as to whether a person is or is not incapacitated to the extent of being unable to provide himself with a living.  These things can always be reinvestigated and even when the due award of a medal has been refused, if the person concerned or any Deputy with whom he is in touch believes he can produce fresh evidence, that can also be reopened.  However, as Deputies have pointed out, as time goes on, it becomes more and more difficult to establish these things and I can only advise anybody who has not applied for a medal and feels he is entitled to it that he should do so now while it is still possible to establish the fact that he was a member.</P>
    <P>I can think of no other way in which membership could be established than the present way.  There have been various exhortations made to me to-day to give every applicant fair play and to be as generous as possible, but the onus is on me to be satisfied that the person has been a member for the critical period and there is only one <Col N="1200" /> way of getting that proof, that is, by going to the appropriate verifying officer.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, in doubtful cases, we do sometimes go to volunteer pensioners in the area. There have been cases in which that has been the deciding factor.  I make every possible effort to ensure that a wrong decision is not given.  I cannot guarantee that wrong decisions are not given sometimes but if they are, it is due to the fact that the evidence just cannot be obtained.  With regard to the recent introduction of extended service for members of the Garda in possession of a medal with bar, a medal with bar was awarded only to people who were considered to be entitled to military service pensions.</P>

      <P>A service certificate which entitled them to the award of a pension and, as Deputies know, there is now no provision for the award of pensions.  Everybody got a reasonable opportunity, in fact, a number of opportunities, to apply for military service certificates and a number of opportunities to appeal against adverse decisions.  Apparently there are some people still who did not apply, particularly in the Gardaí and I have set up a Departmental committee to investigate cases such as that.  This Departmental committee will decide whether, in their opinion, such a person, if he had applied for a military service certificate, would have been awarded one.  If it is established to their satisfaction that he probably would have been awarded a military service certificate, then he may be awarded the medal with bar, but he cannot be given the certificate which would entitle him to a pension.</P>

      <P>Yes, but anybody who did apply for a certificate and <Col N="1201" /> was turned down by the referee cannot have his case reconsidered; it is only people who did not apply, and people who write in to my Department in that connection are informed to that effect.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Connaught Rangers, Deputy Davern raised the question of a man whose pension was withdrawn because of conviction for a civil offence.  There is provision in respect of military service pensioners for the restoration of a pension in such a case with the concurrence of the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Finance.  There is no such provision with regard to the Connaught Rangers and I suppose that is because there was no case at the time the legislation was introduced but now that there is a case, I shall undertake to look into that matter.  I shall be bringing in legislation to provide for the increase in pensions awarded in the Budget and it should be possible to bring in an amending section to cover that case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan raised another point about the Connaught Rangers, suggesting the issue of medals or some form of recognition for members of the Connaught Rangers who did not qualify for pension.  I do not see how we can establish who those people are.  After all, the people who were deemed to have taken part in the Connaught Rangers mutiny were tried by a British drumhead courtmartial. If the British at such a courtmartial were not able to secure a conviction, how can I now establish whether such people did take part in the mutiny or not?  I cannot see any way in which people such as that could be brought in.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin raised the question of people who got medals and who <Col N="1202" /> were not entitled to them.  I am afraid that did happen.  In any case where an application is made for a special allowance, medals awarded under the old system of verification are reinvestigated.  We do find cases where people apparently have got these medals without any proper entitlement to them.  I do not see that there is any way of taking the medals from them.  However, I am sure such persons are in a very small minority.  I do not think it is so widespread as to call for the issuing of certificates with the medals without bar also.  I do not think there was any other point that called for a reply by me.</P>

      <P>I propose to follow the practice of previous years by taking Votes 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>Vote 8 bears the salaries and expenses of the administrative, executive and technical staffs of the Office of Public Works which is the office responsible for the administration of Vote 9.</P>
      <P>Vote 9 provides the necessary funds for the purchase of sites and buildings for State purposes; for the erection, maintenance and furnishing of Government offices and other State-owned premises; for the erection and improvement of national schools and Garda stations; for the erection of major military buildings; for arterial drainage and other engineering works; for the maintenance of State-owned parks and State harbours and for a number of other activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a net increase of £30,800 in the Estimate for the Office of Public Works compared with the total of the sums voted for 1959/60.  Subhead A, which bears the cost of Salaries, Wages and Allowances, shows a net increase of £31,850.  This is due to the recent general increases in remuneration.  The office establishment is slightly reduced and there had been some reorganisation of the higher posts.  The increase under this Subhead and a minor increase of £300 under Subhead D&mdash;Telegrams, Telephones and Postage&mdash;arising from extensions of the telephone service of the office are offset to a small extent <Col N="1204" /> by a decrease of £1,350 under Subhead C&mdash;Incidental Expenses&mdash;resulting from a reduction in engineering technical equipment requirements and some economies in advertising. There is no change in the estimate of Appropriations in Aid.</P>
    <P>The Estimate of £4,224,000 for Public Works and Buildings&mdash;Vote 9 &mdash;shows a net increase of £135,130 on the Estimate for 1959/60.  This is accounted for by an increase in estimated expenditure of £156,270 partly offset by an increase of £21,140 in the amount expected to be realised from Appropriations in Aid.</P>
    <P>The principal increases in expenditure are £60,000 under Subhead B&mdash; New Works, Alterations and Additions; £30,870 under Subhead C&mdash; Maintenance and Supplies; £115,000 under Subhead J.2&mdash;Arterial Drainage&mdash;Construction Works; and £15,000 under Subhead J.5&mdash;Arterial Drainage and Maintenance.</P>
    <P>Subhead A&mdash;Purchase of Sites and Buildings&mdash;shows an increase of £4,000 in respect of purchases of miscellaneous sites and premises.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have already received a statement showing the various amounts making up the bulk provision for Subhead B and it is unnecessary for me to go into detail.  A few items, however, merit special mention.</P>
    <P>Last year, £1,600,000 was provided for national schools and this year we are asking for the same amount&mdash; Item 44.  As stated by my predecessors, the replacement and improvement of defective school buildings is a most important feature in our work.  Over 700 schools require to be replaced and major schemes of improvement or extension are required for about 300 others.  Serious efforts to increase building output have been made and are being continued.  As the Minister for the Gaeltacht said here last year, 92 new schools and 62 major improvement schemes were completed in the year 1958-59.  The figures for the year 1959-60 were 85 and 51 respectively. This does not mean any falling off in the work.  The figures do not represent the full amount of work in hands during the year but only the number of works which happen to have <Col N="1205" /> reached completion within the year. Some of these may have been in hands the previous year or the year before that.  For example, last year 85 new schools are recorded as completed: at the beginning of the year work was in hands on 111 new schools and on 102 at the end of the year.  The best indication of the amount of work done is the expenditure, which last year was approximately £1,543,000, the highest yet recorded.  We hope to do as well this year.</P>
    <P>There is a provision of £100,000 for work on Major Fishery Harbours&mdash; Item 55.  As the House is aware, the Government brought in an eminent Swedish consulting engineer to advise on these matters and his report has been received by the Minister for Lands.  It is not for me to intrude on that because no doubt it will be mentioned on his Estimate.  It has already been decided to proceed with some of the recommendations and this provision is in the nature of a first instalment to cover the work which is expected to be carried out this year at Killybegs and Greencastle.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that a provision of £20,000 has been included for expenditure on the projected Garden of Remembrance at Parnell Square &mdash;Item 21&mdash;for which tenders have been received and on which it is hoped to commence work shortly. The cost of the project will be substantially higher than had been originally anticipated but I feel sure that nobody will quibble at the expense of providing this long overdue Memorial in the centre of our capital city, to all those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish Freedom.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are already aware it has been decided, subject to certain conditions, to hand over Kilmainham Gaol&mdash;Item No. 22&mdash;to a Board of Trustees who intend to carry out a scheme for the restoration of the premises and the establishment there of an historical museum.  It is proposed to have the work done by voluntary workers and I trust that those responsible will receive the fullest possible support from the public in the execution of the project.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> There is one other matter to which I might perhaps refer at this stage although no provision in respect of it is included in the Subhead this year. It has for long been recognised by all Parties in the House that the accommodation and general facilities for Ministers and the members and staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas are altogether inadequate and it is imperative that something should be done about the matter. During the past year the problem has been examined by an InterDepartmental Committee and their recommendation, which has been accepted by the Government, is that the only practical way in which the situation can be eased is by the erection of a new building here alongside the Natural History Musuem as an extension of Leinster House.  A certain amount of preliminary planning has already been done by the architects in the Office of Public Works but it will be about a year before actual building operations can commence.</P>
    <P>The provision of £6,000 under Subhead BB&mdash;Coast Protection&mdash;is for the continuance of the survey and experimental works in connection with the coast erosion problem at Rosslare Strand.</P>
    <P>The increase of £30,870 under Subhead C&mdash;Maintenance and Supplies&mdash; is mainly due to wage increases granted to workers in the building trade.</P>
    <P>The provision for Furniture, Fittings and Utensils, Subhead D.1., is little changed, and that for the Central Furniture Stores, Subhead D.2, is the same as before.  A reduction of £8,000 under Subhead E&mdash;Rents, Rates, etc., is attributable to the inclusion in last year's estimate of some exceptional provisions and non-recurrent charges in respect of premises abroad.  The small decrease under Subhead F and the provisions for the minor Subheads G, H.1 and I, scarcely call for comment.</P>
    <P>The provision of £15,000 under Subhead H.2&mdash;River Shannon Navigation (Grant-in-Aid), is required to make good an anticipated deficit in the Shannon Navigation Fund Account which, despite staff economies and <Col N="1207" /> reduced incidence of maintenance, shows an increase of £4,500.  This increase in the estimated deficit is due to the reduction in C.I.E. traffic on the Grand Canal system and the Navigation.</P>
    <P>There is a reduction of £2,000 in the provision for Subhead J.1&mdash;Arterial Drainage Surveys.  This does not mean that there is any diminution in the arterial drainage survey programme but is due to the fact that the outdoor work on the special preliminary investigations in connection with the River Shannon flood problem is almost completed. We hope to have the engineering report available for consideration about the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice a substantial increase&mdash;£115,000&mdash;for arterial drainage construction works under Subhead J.2.  It was decided in 1958 that the programme should be accelerated as far as practicable having regard to the availability of technical staff, labour and machinery, and the provision for 1960-61 continues that trend.  In the programme drawn up some 15 years ago for the purposes of the 1945 Act there are 28 major catchments and 30 minor catchments. Progress in the beginning was necessarily slow as an organisation had to be built up: engineers had to be recruited, plant acquired and a central workshop and stores established.  This has now been done and we can look forward to an increased volume of work in future years.  Of the 28 major catchments, schemes for three have been completed, works are in progress in three others, and seven more are at various stages of survey and design. Two minor schemes have been finished, one is in hands and four are at the survey or design stage.  This is a big bite out of the listed programme and I think Deputies will agree that we are now well launched on the project.</P>
    <P>It was decided recently to extend activities still further by bringing within the scope of the 1945 Act what, for want of a better term, have been called &ldquo;intermediate rivers&rdquo;.  By these are meant the smaller independent <Col N="1208" /> catchments with clear outfalls which were not included in the original lists.  When arrangements get under way we hope to have works on four of these catchments in hands each year.  Surveys of the first group are in progress and work will be begun as soon as we can.  It is perhaps no harm to impress on Deputies that this new arrangement does not indicate that any piece-meal work will be undertaken. The areas dealt with which will be treated as a whole must be independent catchment areas and must not form part of any larger catchment already listed in the main programme.</P>
    <P>In Subhead J.2 provision is made for all the schemes featured in last year's Estimate except the Feale which has been completed.  The Corrib-Clare scheme is past its peak and the provision is reduced by £45,000.  Work is expanding on the Maine and the Ballyteige and Kilmore schemes as well as on the Fergus Embankments scheme, which last year was covered by the provision for Additional Minor Schemes.  The sums provided for the Moy and Inny schemes show increases of £50,000 and £55,000 respectively as this year they are intended to cover almost a full year's work.  We hope that the £15,000 under the heading &ldquo;Additional Minor Schemes&rdquo; will be needed for work on the Killimor, Co. Galway and Broadmeadow, Counties Dublin and Meath, which we expect to reach the works stage later in the year. In respect of the Nenagh, Clareen and Bunratty-Rineanna schemes, provisions of only £2,000 in all, are required, as certificates of completion are expected to issue shortly.</P>
    <P>Subhead J. 5&mdash;Arterial Drainage: Maintenance, covers the estimated expenditure on maintenance of the schemes already completed as well as the Nenagh, Clareen and Bunratty-Rineanna Schemes which are expected to come under maintenance in 1960/61. The expenditure under this Subhead is recoverable from the County Councils concerned.</P>
    <P>Plant released from the Corrib-Clare drainage scheme will be available for use on other schemes and, accordingly, it is possible to make a reduction of £62,000 under Subhead <Col N="1209" /> K&mdash;Purchase and Maintenance of Plant and Machinery, and Stores.</P>
    <P>An increase of £21,140 in Appropriations-in-Aid is due principally to an increase in recoupments in respect of the outlay on drainage maintenance as two additional drainage works, the Feale drainage scheme and the Owenogarney river embankments, were completed in 1959, and to estimated receipts, previously surrendered to the Exchequer, from sales of property.  The principal decrease is in receipts from hire of plant for drainage works financed from the National Development Fund.</P>
    <P>That is a factual statement and without being unduly wordy, I have tried to cover the activities of my office as adequately as possible.  If Deputies in the course of the debate wish me to elaborate, to elucidate or to refer to some activities of my office which may not have been mentioned in the statement, I shall be only too glad to do my best to give them whatever information they may require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the outset, I am handicapped in that I cannot take this Estimate with what I call my usual style, as I should find it very hard to be tough on the Parliamentary Secretary.  I think this is his first Vote and I am very grateful to him for supplying me with a copy of his statement.  I wish him the very best of luck in his office.</P>
      <P>To a Deputy, the Office of Public Works is a mystery.  To the people down the country, it is a Never-Never Land.  People seldom know how things happen or are initiated in the Office of Public Works.  There is always what I could describe as a <i>fait accompli</i> in connection with schemes.  I should like to know how these schemes are initiated.  Is it possible for Deputies, the people or local authorities to bring pressure on the Parliamentary Secretary and the Office of Public Works or to direct them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, when I moved to refer the Estimate back, I mentioned arterial <Col N="1210" /> drainage and I was nearly trampled to death by the speakers who followed me. They completely misunderstood me.  I mentioned then, and I make no apology for mentioning now, arterial drainage.  Under Subhead J.2. the total estimate is from £10,000,000 to £11,000,000.  The Deputies who did not agree with me last year were concerned with their constituencies and should be sufficiently tolerant to realise that I should be concerned with mine.  It is a great thing to have big schemes in progress, not in various parts of the country, but in just one part.  It is extraordinary that I can never see great schemes, or even small schemes, in my part of the country.  I can justify that statement.</P>
    <P>If a local authority or a statutory board in the constituency of Waterford puts up a proposition involving thousands of pounds to the Office of Public Works or any Government Department, they are met with shudders and the matter is usually brought to the local Deputies.  The Deputies for Waterford and the people of Waterford then see that even though they were turned down in respect of a scheme that would cost some thousands of pounds, millions of pounds can be spent in other places.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate on the Adjournment on 6th April, 1960, the Parliamentary Secretary said&mdash; Volume 180, No. 13, column 1963 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>It would not be fair to withdraw the survey staff from the other catchments on the priority list and send them back to do further work in Galway.  They must wait until such time as the other schemes on the priority list have been completed.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary were to make the priority list available.</P>
    <P>As far as arterial drainage is concerned, it was said that there would be a survey of the River Suir in 1960. This is 1960 and I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if the survey of the Suir has commenced and, if so, if he can give me some idea as to how far it has gone and when the report will be available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> Last year, I referred to the fact that some flooding had taken place at our own door, in the courtyard of Leinster House.  I want to thank the Parliamentary Secretary or his predecessor, and the Office of Public Works, for the prompt manner in which the matter was dealt with.</P>
    <P>A list of new works, alternations and additions under Subhead B. has been circulated.  Item No. 2 on that list is Leinster House&mdash;extension of indicator board system.  Does that mean we are to have the new closed circuit TV installed this year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It says &ldquo;Extension of indicator board system&rdquo; and I thought it might include TV., that it would be a new type of indicator board.</P>
      <P>Item No. 4 is &ldquo;State Apartments&mdash; restoration of burnt-out drawing rooms.&rdquo;  The total estimated cost is £104,000; the provision is £500.  It would appear that we are not going on with that at present.</P>
      <P>Item No. 5 is &ldquo;Busts and portraits of national leaders.&rdquo;  I should be grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary if he would state the national leaders of whom we have acquired portraits and busts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item No. 9 is &ldquo;Office of Public Works: New central furniture stores and workshops&mdash;adaptations.&rdquo;  The total estimated cost is £25,000.  As a result of the way in which the Office of Public Works operate, it could be regarded as Never-Never Land; nobody knows anything about it or where it is; but I have to compliment the officials for their work and their furnishing of Government offices. There is a tradition of buying real furniture.  That tradition has been carried on.  The Office of Public <Col N="1212" /> Works furnish Government offices magnificently and with great taste and I should like to compliment the officials, through the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>Item No. 15 is &ldquo;Revenue Commissioners, Dublin Castle&mdash;rebuilding of cross block&rdquo;  The total estimated cost is £85,000 and the provision this year is £6,000.  Apparently, they are not taking that seriously, either.</P>
    <P>Item No. 20 is &ldquo;Kilmainham Gaol &mdash;Treatment of 1916 Plot.&rdquo;  The total estimated cost is £3,500; the provision is £3,000.  I welcome that provision, and I am sure that its restoration or its preservation will be well done, because the people who look after our ancient monuments in the Office of Public Works know their business.</P>
    <P>There is a provision of £126,500 in item 23&mdash;&ldquo;Dún Laoghaire Harbour: Mail Boat Pier&mdash;Improvements.&rdquo;  This is one of the jealousies I have, that there are only certain piers and certain places on which the Office of Public Works will spend big money. Big money has been spent in the west on arterial drainage and the only places that get an estimate of £126,000 are in the east.  I am not antagonistic to the west.  Western Deputies are very loyal to their constituencies but surely they will afford me the toleration I give to them, that I have the right to speak here for my own constituency.</P>
    <P>The total Estimate for Johnstown Castle has been dealt with.  Great work has been done there.  I notice that my own constituency is mentioned in this document and that £3,000 has been provided for the bovine tuberculosis offices in Waterford.  Thank God for small mercies.</P>
    <P>The provision for national schools grants, No. 44 in this document, is £1,600,000&mdash;the same as last year.  I do not know whether this is a matter for the Office of Public Works or the Department of Education, but I suppose they could get together on it: I hope when they are building schools in the future they will build them where the pupils are, or at least give priority to the areas where there is overcrowding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> Nos. 48 and 49 deal with the National Library and the National Museum, and I shall take them together.  We have all at times attended functions where people got very starry-eyed, sucked their breaths through their teeth and told us all about our culture and our national heritage.  I have travelled around Ireland seeking this culture all my lifetime and I have been disappointed. So far as our national heritage is concerned, the most tangible things I came across are in the National Museum, the National Library and the National Gallery.  I have said that many times and I hope I shall not have to repeat it again.  I commend to the Parliamentary Secretary this great work.  No opportunity should be lost at any time to ensure that if buildings become available in the vicinity of any of these three great institutions, they are made available to them.</P>
    <P>Let us take the National Library first.  The storage position there has become practically impossible.  It is only because of the dedicated men and the fine staff they have there that they are able to carry on at all.  The same could be said of the National Museum with its crammed cellars.  So far as the National Gallery is concerned, I do not think there is any proper up-to-date inventory of its contents.  It is not possible to see a great treasure, or a collection of great treasures without giving notice because what you wanted to see might be in a corner of a room which was crammed with other pictures and other treasures.</P>

    <P>In regard to major fishery harbours, the total estimated cost has not yet been <Col N="1214" /> decided.  The Parliamentary Secretary said this morning:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It has already been decided to proceed with some of the recommendations and this provision is in the nature of a first instalment to cover the work which is expected to be carried out this year at Killybegs and Greencastle.</P>
    <P>I have consistently reminded this House that there is such a place as Dunmore East.  There is there a pier for which the Office of Public Works have responsibility.  If I may be allowed to say so, I have seen more fish landed there in one day than have been landed on piers in this State in a whole season. I have read newspaper clippings which said that so many cran of herring were landed at such and such a place during the season and that it was not as good as it could possibly have been, but nearly £100,000 was spent on it.  Surely a place like Dunmore East, where we can land up to 4,000 cran of herring in a day during the season, is entitled to consideration.  There are many stores there which should be rehabilitated and the pier could easily be widened by the removal of many of them.</P>

      <P>A scheme was put up to another Department which will I suppose come up soon to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I refer to the drainage of Kilbarry Bog and the river running out of it, St. John's River.  That would come under the arterial drainage scheme.  I hope the <Col N="1215" /> Parliamentary Secretary will give it his blessing.</P>
      <P>Another place that seems to be unlucky in the matter of Government grants or any Government interest at all is the resort of Tramore.  The foreshore there was very badly damaged by the winter gales.  I put down a Question to the Parliamentary Secretary asking if the Office of Public Works would be prepared to take any steps to have this matter remedied and to have a survey made.  He told me that no proposition had been put to him by the local authority.  I am quite sure that a proposition will be put to him by the local authority.  He has the precedent already.  I hope he will treat Tramore as lie treated Rosslare Strand, which was being ruined.  I am glad a grant of £6,000 was given towards the cost of a survey and experimental works at Rosslare Strand.  That seems a fabulous amount of money to us down in the south-east of Ireland to get from a Government Department.  It is only chickenfeed to other counties.</P>
      <P>It is unnecessary for Deputies from other constituencies who speak after me to give me the scarifying I got last year just because I mentioned arterial drainage in the west.  I hope that when the Parliamentary Secretary reads his priority list, he will be able to tell us that the survey is being made on the River Suir, that we shall see arterial drainage on that river and in the fine lands of county Waterford, county Kilkenny, county Tipperary and up into the Golden Vale and that it will be started within the next few years.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the copy of the statement.  I wish the Parliamentary Secretary a very successful term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I also should like to wish the new Parliamentary Secretary well in his capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  When a new Minister or a new Parliamentary Secretary takes office, we all hope that there will be improvements and, <Col N="1216" /> in the case of the Office of Public Works, that more work will be carried out.  The Parliamentary Secretary is hamstrung from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; because he has a limited amount of money to spend this year to do a certain amount of work.</P>
      <P>Frankly, I am disappointed that the money provided by the Government for Public Works and Buildings has not increased beyond £135,130.  In view of increased costs, in view of increased wages, how better can the Parliamentary Secretary do this year than, say, was done last year?  Nobody wants work merely for the sake of providing work as such.  The emphasis in recent years has been on productive employment.  The Government from time to time, especially the Taoiseach, stated that money will be freely available for work which is productive or which will advance or improve the general economy and wellbeing of the country.</P>
      <P>I propose to make a few remarks on the amount provided for national schools.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that last year £1,600,000 was provided for national schools and this year we are providing the same amount.  Why does the Parliamentary Secretary not ask the Dáil for a larger amount?  I think he would be justified in asking for it.  I think the Government would be justified in giving him a larger amount, especially when we have regard to the need for more schools, which is admitted by the Parliamentary Secretary, and to the fact that there are so many skilled and unskilled building operatives in the country who need employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years some Governments have been reasonably generous in the provision of money for houses.  It has been stated that we do not need the same activity in the building of houses now as we did, say, a certain number of years ago.  If there is not now the same need for houses in certain parts of the country as there was at one time, there is a need for more national schools and, in the words of the Parliamentary Secretary, over 700 schools require to be replaced. <Col N="1217" /> We are not providing the same amount of money for house building as we did some years ago.  Therefore, money that is not now required for house building could surely be devoted to the building of much-needed schools. I do not think anybody could argue that that would not be of direct or indirect benefit to the general economy and the general well being of the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the Parliamentary Secretary can say that the same amount of work in the building and repair of national schools will be engaged in this year as last year and the year before.  The Parliamentary Secretary must have regard to the fact that the price of materials has increased and that there has been another increase in wages.  If in the last financial year, 1959-60, 85 new schools were completed and 51 were approved how can he hope to do the same this year? Last year was not as good a year for the building of schools as was the previous year, according to what the Parliamentary Secretary told us in his statements.  How then with the same amount of money can he do the same amount of work this year?  As I said, employment is needed for building workers who have been laid off from building houses and they could well be put on to the building of schools.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I want to refer, and which has been referred to many times, is the abnormal delay in the commencement of the building of schools.  The acquisition of the land, the planning of the school, the innumerable changes made in plans, the discussions which take place between the Department of Education, the Board of Works and the manager, sometimes take up to ten years before the commencement of the building of the school.  The Parliamentary Secretary with the limited amount at his disposal could do something in that respect which would short-circuit all these preliminaries which take place before the actual building of the school gets under way.</P>
    <P>To their credit let it be said that those who propose to build factories <Col N="1218" /> do not seem to have the same difficulties about the acquisition of the site, the transfer of title and the finalising of plans and all that sort of thing. If a school is to be built, all these preliminaries could be gone through in a much shorter time in order to have the actual building commenced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to the development of major fishery harbours and to the fact that a Swedish consultant engineer advised and reported to the Government on the general question of the development of major fishery harbours.  I do not know whether or not it is a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary but, if it is, perhaps he would tell us if the Government have now decided which of the harbours around our coast are regarded as major fishery harbours.  Could he at this stage give us an idea of what harbours are to be developed?  I remember six or seven years ago when a survey was carried out and it was the intention of the Government at the time&mdash;I think it was the inter-Party Government&mdash;to designate certain harbours as major fishery harbours and to develop them to such an extent that they would be capable of catering for the fleets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Minister for Lands.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us a little more detail about the handing over and restoration of Kilmainham Jail.  I raise this matter because the Parliamentary Secretary has not given us details.  He said that Kilmainham Jail is to be handed over to a Board of Trustees who intend to carry out a scheme for its restoration and to make it into an historical museum.  He said: &ldquo;It is proposed to have the work done by voluntary workers.&rdquo; Let us hear more from the Parliamentary Secretary about the voluntary workers.  There were some schemes initiated around the country which were to be carried out by voluntary <Col N="1219" /> workers.  I am always suspicious of work done by voluntary workers.</P>
      <P>We have a suggestion that in the matter of forestry many people should band themselves together as voluntary workers.  That could be dangerous for the ordinary worker who is now unemployed and I would hate to see a Local Government official, a civil servant, a member of the armed Forces or the Garda Síochána engaging in that sort of voluntary work to the detriment of people who are unemployed.  I do not know whether or not it is the case in this instance, but, perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary could enlighten us on it.  If that sort of position were to prevail we might have a situation in which voluntary workers could be people doing work for nothing on which the Civil Service are now engaged.  The Civil Service would not like that, so let us hear more about these voluntary workers who propose to restore Kilmainham Jail.  I make my remarks without prejudice until we hear a little more from the Parliamentary Secretary as to the type of voluntary work this will be.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was also kind enough to refer to the work which his Department is carrying out in connection with the coast erosion problem at Rosslare Strand.  In case anybody thinks that Rosslare has been selected specially, or because it is in the constituency of the Minister for Finance, there is a problem in Rosslare Strand and, as has been explained today and on other occasions, the work is experimental.  None of us expects that every single penny spent on a problem such as coast erosion can be justified because, in dealing with the sea and the vagaries of the tides, one does not know what to expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coast erosion is a problem and a particular problem on the east and south-eastern coasts.  I wonder, however, if the money provided for this experiment is sufficient.  I do not know and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary if, when replying, he would kindly tell us what, if anything, <Col N="1220" /> they have learned from this experiment which has been going on at Rosslare Strand for about three years. It does not seem to me that the experiment has been wholly successful. It has been successful, I am informed, in parts of the area now subjected to coast erosion in Rosslare but I honestly suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he believes this experiment is not likely to be successful he should continue the work certainly but change his method or employ some consultant from Holland, say, who would be in a better position, with all due respect to our engineers, in dealing with this problem of which the Dutch engineers have particular experience.  I say that without any disrespect to any of the engineers now employed by the Board of Works on tackling this problem of coast erosion at Rosslare Strand in an effort to provide a solution for coast erosion in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Parliamentary Secretary to induce the Government to make available more money for the building of schools&mdash;No. 1, to provide the schools, and No. 2, to keep in the country many building workers who will be forced to emigrate when our housing needs are satisfied in the areas which now require houses.  It would be a tragedy if we were to lose these workers.  I am hopeful that many factories will be built in the very near future.  If the Government are hopeful or satisfied that these factories will be built would it not be a terrible tragedy if we had no workers to build them?</P>
    <P>If, for example, when the housing scheme at present in progress in Wexford is completed, the building workers go to employment in Britain it will be very difficult to get them back. Similarly if workers are laid off in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or any other centre they will not be content to remain here for six months until they can get work again.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary could help to keep people at home so that they will be available to build the factories which all of us ardently desire to see built in the country in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow me to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary first, on his appointment and, secondly, on the way he has introduced this Estimate.  I think every Deputy in the House will agree that it was a clear and factual presentation with no room for misunderstanding.  The building of new schools, at least in my constituency, is a very slow process. I believe that the architects and engineers when planning these schools should confine the buildings, especially where the reverend managers get the sites, to one end of the sites.  At present a new school is almost completed in my constituency with the exception of the boundary wall.  That site could have provided a splendid football pitch for the children and perhaps a tennis court in addition if the building had been properly sited for the benefit of the children and had the school been placed nearer the main road and to one side of the site.</P>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, we have a drainage scheme in our catchment area which is on the verge of completion.  I understood that, as it went through and as the rivers and streams leading into the Corrib were cleaned and the machinery moved on, after a certain length of time the machinery would be brought back over some of those rivers to clear away clay and mud that had again collected there.  I am afraid that is not being done although I know that some of the streams and rivers are practically choked and a little more work on them would make all the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in regard to work on piers and harbours is appalling, but I cannot say that the Board of Works is at fault all the time.  It is between the Board, the Department of Lands and the Department of the Gaeltacht. It seems to be like ducks and drakes, going from one to another without getting a decision made in the shortest possible time.  Surveys have been carried out of certain piers and harbours in my constituency without result.  Examinations have been made on several occasions, and I am sorry to say that fishermen find <Col N="1222" /> it almost impossible to moor their boats, especially in high tides and stormy weather.  Some of their fishing boats, on which they depend for a living, have been broken on the rocks for want of shelter.  I trust that the present energetic Parliamentary Secretary will do his best to speed up action in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment.  When the position became vacant many of us hoped he would succeed Deputy Bartley.  It was about time we had a Parliamentary Secretary outside of Galway, although I cannot say we have any reason to find fault with the Galwegians who occupied the position previously.  I had intended to deal with arterial drainage but, seeing so many children in the Gallery, it might be no harm to discuss schools, especially when the children are led by a Deputy from Clare, Deputy William Murphy.  If he has to entertain all of them here, he can certainly claim a good reduction in income tax.</P>
      <P>Having heard from the Parliamentary Secretary that there are 700 new schools required and something like 300 needing reconstruction, I must say that is a proposal that will require immense sums of money.  As Deputy Corish said it would be well to have that extra money allocated for the purpose.  The new schools that have been erected especially since the end of the war are a credit to the architects of the Board of Works and also to the contractors, both the national and vocational schools.  But perhaps their construction is too costly; perhaps they are a little too elaborate. In thirty, forty or fifty years they will be entirely out of date and by having them less elaborate and less costly, we could build more for the money allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When schools are erected in rural, urban or city areas, now that rural electrification is widespread and extended to all areas&mdash;or will be in the very near future&mdash;it would be well, if it is not the practice, to have schools wired for electricity and provision made for heating the schools by electricity if necessary.  After all, in many <Col N="1223" /> areas it is not so very easy to get turf supplies.  Hand-won turf is a thing of the past except in the case of the farmer who cuts sufficient for his own needs.  The heating of schools by electricity should prove a great boon to managers, teachers and pupils alike. I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will give us some information as to what the position is in that regard when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>When school sites are being acquired, sites sufficient to cater for recreational activities for the children attending the schools should be acquired.  There should be ample space to provide football and hurling pitches for the boys and hockey fields and tennis courts for the girls.  Lack of such facilities at the moment is a great drawback.  Sites are not large enough to provide facilities for games. It should be remembered that games are an important feature in the physical development of children.</P>
    <P>With regard to arterial drainage, we have benefited to a considerable extent already in Kerry, and we hope to benefit still further in the future. A certificate of completion has been issued for the Feale in North Kerry. The drainage of the Maine is in full operation.  I do not like having to refer to complaints, but complaints have been made&mdash;I have received several&mdash; by labourers and workers generally that, though they are registered in the labour exchange, they have been refused work.  It is their contention that they are being victimised.  It is said that applicants for work have to be recommended by certain Deputies, otherwise their applications are hopeless. I have not made any representations to the Office of Public Works in this matter, but, perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary would inquire into the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch is to be congratulated on the fact that there is apparently no need for arterial drainage in Waterford, though he seemed to have a grievance because such a scheme was not necessary.  His argument seemed to be that such a scheme would bring in more money and provide employment.  Recently, <Col N="1224" /> we have had occasion in Kerry to consider the estimates.  We found ourselves confronted with a claim for £17,000 for the maintenance of the Feale.  That will entail a very big increase in the rates.  It does seem unfair that people far removed from the actual drainage, and who will not benefit in any way as a result of the work done, should be asked to pay increased rates for maintenance. Possibly, the matter is covered in the 1945 Act, but £17,000 for maintenance this year seems a rather exorbitant figure.  If £17,000 is required this year, the first year after the completion of the scheme, double that sum will be necessary, I imagine, in three, four, or five years.</P>
    <P>We anticipate a similar demand when the Maine catchment is done.  I do not know what the people will do about their rates, especially those far distant from the schemes who will reap no benefit at all.  I think that assessment should be in proportion to the benefit derived.  In that way, hardship on those who will derive no benefit at all will be relieved.  The people in my own area will derive no benefit at all from the drainage of either the Maine or the Feale.</P>
    <P>Somewhere in his files the Parliamentary Secretary has information relating to a deputation received by his predecessor in relation to the exclusion of the Brown Flesk from the scheme as originally prepared for the Maine drainage.  A case was made. It was to be considered.  We have heard nothing about it since.  We understand that, as the Flesk is a tributary near the source, it would be the last tributary to be drained. The scheme will take a couple of years and we hope that, before it is completed, provision will be made for the drainage of the Brown Flesk.</P>
    <P>This is a peculiar river, a winding river, and the drawing up of plans provided some difficulty for the engineers.  The local people are of opinion that the only way to do it successfully would be by a process of &ldquo;give-and-take&rdquo;&mdash;some land, in the cutting out of bends, might go to a neighbour on the opposite bank, and <Col N="1225" /> some land might be given in compensation for that.  The people in the area own the best land in Kerry.  It forms part of the Golden Vale.  Surely, it is only right their lands should be drained.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consult his files and take some steps to deal with the position before it is too late.</P>
    <P>I had a question down recently with regard to the flooding of the Flesk, which flows into Killarney Lakes.  It is in the Laune catchment area.  I understand the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the position there.  He has received a deputation from the area in connection with the very serious flooding which occurred last year.  The Parliamentary Secretary and his officials are aware that, if the people in Dunflesk have to wait until the arterial drainage scheme comes into operation, not very many of them will be left in the area awaiting rescue. Their lives, their homes, their livestock are in constant danger from flooding which occurs very frequently and very quickly.  I do not suppose the Parliamentary Secretary would like to detail the priority list, but I am rather wondering in what position on that list is the River Flesk.  In his statement he referred to intermediate rivers.  Perhaps the Flesk would come under that heading.  If it does, the possibility is that relief may come more quickly than is anticipated if we have to wait for arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about coastal erosion.  A couple of months ago the Kerry County Council asked the Parliamentary Secretary to receive a deputation in connection with very serious erosion in two areas in Kerry, Ballyheigue in North Kerry and Waterville in South Kerry.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question which I put down, the Parliamentary Secretary said that surveys were being made and until such surveys were completed, he could not receive a deputation.  So long as the surveys are being made, we are quite satisfied, but I hope he will receive a deputation soon and will acquaint the Kerry County Council and the people concerned of surveys that have been carried out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> I am especially interested in Waterville, a very important village in Kerry; but perhaps the people living there prefer to call it a town.  If something is not done to prevent coast erosion in that area, Waterville will be submerged in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch claimed credit for getting the steamrolling done in the courtyard in front of Leinster House because he made a complaint last year that Deputies had to wade through water to get into the House. Some improvements have been made to the wings of the House and it would be no harm if the front of Leinster House got a new look.  I do not know what could be done but I am sure the Board of Works could make improvements so that our Houses of Parliament will be a credit to the country and also present a pleasant appearance to visitors.  The school children in the public gallery must be rather amazed to see this building facing them and wonder if it can be our Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment and wish him every success.  As far as I know, he is a very courteous and efficient man who will make his mark in our Parliament. He has a very important role to play in regard to the work to be carried out through the length and breadth of Ireland.  However, while in his speech he traversed the country from Donegal to Kerry and from Clare to Dublin Bay, he seemed to ignore altogether the existence of the territory we call Cork.  While he referred to the hundreds of thousands of pounds we spent all over Ireland, he forgot that there was such a place as Cork and such a place as West Cork and that in the whole county of Cork not one river has so far been cleaned under the Arterial Drainage Act.  I appreciate that a survey has been started in two small catchment areas but I sincerely hope there will not be any undue delay on the part of the Board of Works in starting work on those rivers, once the survey has been completed.  Time and again, I have stressed the importance of cleaning <Col N="1227" /> these rivers in order to bring valuable land into cultivation in that forgotten part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>County Cork is one-eighth of our territory, producing over half the agricultural produce of the country. We pay more than our share in revenue to the Government and it is high time the Board of Works and the Parliamentary Secretary turned their eyes southwards for at least a couple of years until this essential work is done.</P>
      <P>We had a very important deputation here some time ago in connection with Castletownbere, and I should like to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary the urgency of erecting a new pier there.  The first year I was a Member of this House I put down a Question about the landings of fish, and I was informed that Castletownbere had the second largest in Ireland.  The pier is in a very bad condition and has been condemned by the engineers as being dangerous. While I do not know what is in the reports of the Swedish engineer, I am sure he realises the absolute necessity for the erection of a new pier there. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to press the case with all his might and see that the work is put in hands as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The fishing industry is very important to the people of that area. It is practically their sole means of livelihood and unless those people are helped in this respect, they cannot be expected to stay there and make a living.  I sincerely hope I shall not have to refer to the Castletownbere pier again.</P>
      <P>The erection of schools is a very important matter and when the Board of Works erect a new school, they should ensure that proper water and sewerage facilities are available.  It may not be possible in all areas, but, where possible, water should be installed in every new school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must dissociate myself from the decision to extend Leinster House because of cramming.  Cramming in our schools is a far more serious problem to parents and children than it is in Leinster House.  I see no <Col N="1228" /> cramming in Leinster House to interfere with anybody's health, but I see plenty of it in some of the schools in my own constituency, and it is a serious impediment to educating the children attending them.  I disapprove of a decision to spend large sums of money on an extension of the accommodation here which is adequate for many years to come.  The building of schools, fishery harbours and piers and the cleaning of rivers are far more important than an extension to Leinster House and some of the other projects mooted here for the city of Dublin.  I want the money spread more evenly over the country for the benefit of all the people.  The all-important thing is to spend wisely the money we have at our disposal, and it is often said that we are not doing that.  First things should come first, and such projects as the Garden of Remembrance and the extension to Leinster House should, in my opinion, come last.</P>
    <P>I would impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary the importance of first carrying out the work on harbours, piers and schools in the country, and, in particular, the cleaning of rivers.  These rivers have been doing much damage, holding up other work and washing from the soil the manures and lime which have cost us so much money.  If first things are put first, the Parliamentary Secretary will hear no grouse from me or from any other man who has to pay his way, but when money is squandered in an unnecessary fashion, there is bound to be grumbling and grousing. I do not believe in spending money for the mere sake of giving employment. I always like to get value for money spent.  We should, therefore, spend wisely on capital development, which will be of lasting benefit to the country and the people.</P>

      <P>As this is the first Estimate the Parliamentary Secretary has brought into the House since he took up duty, I join with other Deputies in congratulating him and wishing him well in his job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has informed the House that the school building programme will continue this year the same as last year. <Col N="1229" /> As a teacher, I am very pleased to hear that.  Last year, I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, saw the spending of the largest figure ever on the building of new schools, extensions and repairs.  However, there are many schools still requiring to be replaced or repaired. Last year, we had the pleasure of having the Parliamentary Secretary open an extension to the school in which I myself teach.  That school was built only three years ago; yet we had to build an extra room on to it. That is a most encouraging thing at this time when we hear so many references to the flight from the land. I mention it to impress upon the architects and those taking the figures for school buildings that, where they see an upward trend in the population, they should take that into account.</P>
    <P>As principal of the school, I impressed upon the people concerned at the time that it would not be big enough.  When it was originally opened, I forecast that before many years a new room would have to be built on to it.  However, I did not think the necessity would arise quite so soon.  It was originally built for 80, but on the first day, 99 were present.  That shows that even at the time it was opened there were more pupils than the number for which it was built.  However, we have got the additional room now and I am glad to say the population is still showing an upward trend.  In fact, before the Parliamentary Secretary leaves office, we may have to have him down to open another addition to the school.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the architects and the engineers of the Board of Works on the modern design of the recently built schools compared with the drab buildings where I went-to school myself and where, 25 years ago, I started to teach.  These modern schools are certainly a credit to the architects.  It is grand to see electric light, heating, water and sewerage in all the new schools built in rural Ireland. I hope that will continue.</P>
    <P>This Vote also deals with drainage. I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary state that the preliminary investigation of the River Shannon <Col N="1230" /> flood problem was almost complete, and that he hoped the engineering report would be available before the end of the year.  My constituency does not exactly border the Shannon, but it borders the Suck, which, of course, is a tributary of the Shannon but is a separate catchment area.  I hope that the Suck will not be swamped out by all the other rivers that have been mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>According to Mr. Rydell, the gentleman who was brought over here to survey the Shannon, the Suck was to be left over until the Shannon flooding had been fully relieved.  However, we have experience heretofore of the Brosna catchment area being drained under the arterial drainage scheme without causing any extra flooding in the Shannon, so far as anybody could see. One must remember that when a river is widened and deepened, it will naturally hold more water than it did previously, and I believe we have plenty of engineers and experts of our own who could tackle the drainage of the Suck, in spite of what Mr. Rydell has said.  They could treat it as a simple catchment area, independent of the Shannon, and as I have said, we have had experience of the Brosna being tackled, even though it flows into the Shannon, without adding to the problem there.</P>
      <P>There are hundreds of acres of land along both sides of the Suck and the people who have holdings there are all small farmers with large families. They depend on every acre of their land, but hundreds of acres of their lands are flooded year after year.  If the catchment area were treated now, it would solve their problems by making good land available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Corrib-Clare catchment area is at the other end of my constituency and I do not intend to go into the merits or demerits of the case raised here at one time when it was originally the Corrib-Clare-Mask catchment area, and part of it was taken out and treated separately.  From question and <Col N="1231" /> answer in this House, it has transpired that it was originally one area and that part of it was cut out.  Anything that is partitioned, as we know in regard to the partition of our country, is unnatural and unjust, and if that is so in regard to our country, it is equally the case in this instance. I hope that the partitioned part will be restored to the original area and that the whole scheme will be carried out as originally planned for the benefit of farmers around Belclare and Caherlistrane whose lands are being flooded every year.</P>
    <P>I come now to the position in regard to the Corrib-Clare scheme.  A lot of very useful work was done on that and hundreds of acres of land were reclaimed and put into use, but I have a few comments to make with regard to improvements which I think should have been made there.  For instance, there are some rivers and drains in the Corrib-Clare catchment area which were originally pegged for the carrying out of drainage work.  The machinery to do the work was brought there and, when the people saw the pegs and the survey being carried out, they understood that the work was to be done, but to their amazement an engineer or a ganger came along and the machinery was taken away.  Long portions of rivers and major drains were left undone and the pegs are still to be seen there.  Neither I nor the people concerned can understand this.</P>
    <P>People who have signed with the Department of Agriculture to have their lands drained into these rivers and drains are still waiting for the catchment schemes to be completed, and I would like to see some cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, and also with the local authorities, on this drainage matter.  Each will do a certain amount but when a major scheme is involved, I imagine it is the Parliamentary Secretary's Office that should coordinate the whole lot.  Drainage work is required by 14 farmers and it is no good doing a scheme to serve three or four of them, leaving the rest of it uncompleted, so that when an engineer comes along <Col N="1232" /> from the Department, he says to the others: &ldquo;We cannot do anything further until the main drain is done.&rdquo; I am saying that for the benefit of some other Deputies also.  I do not know if these farmers did something wrong but it has so happened that they were left in the dark.  The land was pegged, the pegs are still there; but the work was not done.</P>
    <P>To pinpoint this, there is a farmer named Thomas Kelly of Windfield Road, Menlough, Ballinasloe, Co. Galway, who has 14 acres of land flooded and who wishes to have them drained under the Land Project.  The officials eventually tried to drain the land for him and pipes were put down, but, instead of the water flowing through the pipes, it flowed over them or under them.  There is a river there, the Abbert river, and a junction of the road which is flooded for three or four months of the year.  The river is closed up with weeds but after a scheme was started to clear it, it came to a standstill and the machinery was taken away.</P>
    <P>I was asked to raise this matter in the House and I consider it my duty to do so.  That is an isolated case but I have nine or ten others which I do not want to give in full in this speech because I shall give the details privately to the Parliamentary Secretary, of work left undone under the Corrib drainage scheme which would give immense benefit if the whole scheme were completed. By halting the work, it is just like ruining the ship for a ha'penny worth of tar.</P>
    <P>I shall come now to another matter which I have taken up in writing with the Board of Works in an attempt to have it rectified.  This is a case where a river was drained and a little bridge was put across it.  It affects the lands of Peter Divilly, Polnabrone, Menlough, Ballinasloe, Co. Galway, and other farmers in the area, and I can vouch for this myself because I was taken up to see the bridge.  In any case, I had to get my turf there last year and I passed it so many times each day.  This scheme was done before the major catchment scheme came along and, because there was not a lot of money left over, a tar barrel <Col N="1233" /> was placed under the bridge for the water to flow through.</P>
    <P>Then the Board of Works came along with their machinery to drain the river and took up the bridge and the tar barrel through which the water flowed under it.  They put down a new bridge, and in the gullet under the bridge they put in a thing made out of concrete casting, instead of the tar barrel.  If put at the same level as the former one, it would have been all right.  I do not want to blame the ganger or the men who worked on it. I imagine that they were working from levels and carried out the work they were told to do.  They put this concrete cast at the level prescribed and, instead of the water flowing out through it, it flowed out under it and at each side of of it.  In order to get the water to flow out&mdash;you will imagine this is silly&mdash;they put stones in front and cement on top, to force the water to flow out through this thing, thereby creating a sluice and keeping the water back, which resulted in flooding of land and the bog behind it.  That is an absolute fact. I saw this thing.</P>
    <P>The farmers affected are tempted to use pickaxes to rip it out.  They asked me to write about it, which I did, but, so far, have got no satisfaction except a letter to state that the Commissioners are satisfied.  The Commissioners have not seen this.  The people who made a botch of the job probably wrote and told them that it was all right and their word was accepted.  I got a letter from the Commissioners stating that they are satisfied that this was a good job.</P>
    <P>If I bring the Parliamentary Secretary to the district to open a school or an extension to a school, I should like him to see this for himself.  One does not have to be an engineer to see the sluice holding back the water, which is not allowed to flow as it should flow, if it could find its own level.</P>
    <P>I mention that case in particular, because I promised the people concerned that I would raise it by question or otherwise in this House. <Col N="1234" /> I have tried to raise the matter by other methods but, so far, have failed. Therefore, I bring it up in public now, in the hope that something will come of it.</P>
    <P>I want again to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment and to wish him very many happy years in the post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Deputies in complimenting the Parliamentary Secretary.  I was delighted at his appointment.  I believe he will justify my feelings and those of other Deputies.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of £6,000 odd for the National Monuments Trust, I must refer to a decision of theirs.  I do not know if anything can be done about it at this stage.  I refer to the Lion's Tower, part of the ancient walls of Galway. There is no greater authority in this country on this matter than Professor Hayes McCoy.  His opinion should not be questioned, that the preservation order should be renewed so that the walls will not be allowed to crumble or be demolished.  I wonder what would happen in Northern Ireland if the opposite number of the Parliamentary Secretary were to allow the walls of Derry to crumble.  There would be uproar.</P>
      <P>Feeling is beginning to run high in regard to the question of the last remaining section of the old walls of Galway city.  Public bodies have expressed their views.  The situation has been reached in which it is intended to demolish the wall.  As it is, it is an eyesore.  Something will have to be done.  It is anything but a presentable structure as it stands, but the last thing we would agree on is demolition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to let me know if there has been a decision with regard to the wages of workers on the Corrib scheme at Galway.  I refer to city workers employed at the mouth of the Friars Cut.  The increase which has been granted to the country group should be extended to the city men.  That increase is overdue. <Col N="1235" /> Also with regard to the Corrib, there is the question of damage to houses along the river bank, caused inevitably, by vibration from blasting in the river bed.  Much of this damage is only beginning to show itself.  Houses are crumbling.  It is rather strange that all this has happened along the river bank. The Office of Public Works should not fight shy of their responsibility.  If such is the case, as I know it is, they should face up to it and see that any damage they have done will be repaired.</P>
    <P>In Galway city, there are a number of millrace embankments that are beginning to crumble.  Who would come to the rescue if, tomorrow morning, there was a burst in some of these embankments?  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to send down an engineer.  The Corrib Navigation accept no responsibility; the corporation cannot accept responsibility; the county council does not accept responsibility. At one time, there was a millrace committee, which is now defunct.  The Office of Public Works should step in because the situation will arise in which they will have to.  There will be a burst in some of the embankments in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I should also like to raise once more the question of the ventilation of this House, especially this Chamber.  The air at times is a bit hot but that is not the air to which I refer.  At times Deputies cannot stay in the Chamber. They have to go out for a breath of air.  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should have this matter examined.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of coast erosion.  I have here a letter from five men from Carrowmore, Oranmore, Galway.  That district is not in my constituency but is on the border.  The letter appeals to me to do something about lands that are flooded every fortnight.  It states that the tide knocked down walls and that it is no use in their paying rent and rates for the land.  The writers of the letter informed the Land Commission, who do not intend to do anything about it. The Land Commission said:</P>
    <P>With reference to your letter of <Col N="1236" /> 3rd March, 1960, and subsequent correspondence, regarding the flooding of your above holding, and the lands of five other persons, I am desired by the Land Commission to state that they are not prepared to take any action in the matter.</P>
    <P>You cannot expect farmers to produce if perhaps overnight their lands are flooded and their crops ruined.  That is very wrong.</P>
    <P>A sum of over £6,000 is being allocated to coast protection.  I mention this to the Parliamentary Secretary with a view to having the whole matter looked into and the possibility of its being brought to a fruitful conclusion examined.</P>
    <P>I notice a provision here for major fishery harbours, and less important harbours.  That is work, the importance of which cannot be over-stressed in view of the fact that along our coasts a number of trawlers are based and, at times, they have to go in for protection to harbours which cannot altogether protect them.  Some time ago, I asked for a survey of the pier at Kilronan, Aran.  I suppose we shall have to wait until the day when a number of these trawlers which are based along the coast, are smashed to bits, because that is what will happen unless something is done.  I am suggesting that an elbow should be put on the end of the pier at Kilronan and I am also referring to the need for certain slipways and other protection in the islands of Inishmaan and Inishere.</P>
    <P>I note also that there is a provision with regard to fire precautions at Athenry College.  In view of the fact that we hope this college will play its part in our agricultural drive, and in the hope of getting the Faculty of Agriculture there, it is important that that should be gone ahead with.  I am glad to note that at last the Garda Síochána station at Leenane is to be improved by the expenditure of a sum of £1,500.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with other Deputies in congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary.  We hope he will be a Minister some day because he is a most approachable type of man and <Col N="1237" /> has proved most acceptable to this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention a few points in connection with Vote 9, which are dealt with in the list submitted to Deputies by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I should like to comment, first of all, on No. 1 in this list : the President's Establishment. I see that a sum of £7,500 was allocated for the improvement of planthouse accommodation there.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would elaborate somewhat further on that.  Every year, during the past ten years, we have had capital expenditure on that very luxurious establishment.  In the course of a number of Parliamentary Questions and Answers, I extracted the amount of money which has been spent during the past ten years on that establishment.</P>
      <P>The second point with which I want to deal is in relation to No. 14 on this list.  It is a small sum, perhaps, to the Parliamentary Secretary, but it is the principle involved I am concerned with and I should like to have it clarified. It is described as &ldquo;Improvement of Heating&rdquo; in the Department of Finance. I want to know what type of heating is being used.  Is it oil, is it coal, or is it native fuel?  It may perhaps be native fuel and, if it is, that covers the matter, but if not, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to let us know the reason.</P>
      <P>Nos. 40 and 41 refer to alterations in connection with Garda Síochána barracks.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will let me know what is the position with regard to the construction of a Garda barracks in Roscommon.  There are very few amenities in that county.  There is no industry and very little employment there and a Garda barracks would be appreciated in that town.  I can vouch for the fact that that project has been on the list for quite a number of years and I am sure if an investigation were made, we would find that some other locality had its claim moved up and probably headed off the Roscommon scheme by some devious means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point with which I want to deal is No. 44 on this list which <Col N="1238" /> deals with expenditure on national schools.  I want to make the comment that, in spite of the fact that the Government admit that over 700 schools require to be replaced, new schools are needed and there are quite a number to be reconstructed, we find that there is not one extra penny voted this year for the erection of new schools.  The shocking condition of some of the schools in the rural areas has been brought to the notice of the Government on a number of occasions. I know of a school where, up to recently, when heavy rain was falling, the children had to leave the school itself and try to take shelter in the porch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter for the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to develop it at all, but might I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should consult with the Minister for Education and with other members of the Government, as to the feasibility of setting up a special construction branch in the Department of Education? Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would like to be relieved of his responsibility in that matter.  If he would, perhaps we shall help him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No. 79 on the list is another matter on which I should like to comment and other Deputies have mentioned it, too.  A sum of £32,000 is provided for the hangar gates at Baldonnel Aerodrome.  Is it a fact that the hangar gates and their erection in Baldonnel Aerodrome cost £32,000?  Is that correct?  If it is, then we must remember that the total cost of the pet scheme of the Minister for Defence has not been disclosed to the House. In another Estimate, there was a sum of £144,000 for the purchase of three jet planes.  I presume the new gates for the hangar have a connection with the jet planes so that is another £32,000 that should be added to the £144,000 for the jets.  Figures were given in this House and outside it to the effect that a helicopter which would be of immense benefit on the coast could be purchased for £34,000.  We were told we could not afford that, but we have <Col N="1239" /> no trouble in finding £32,000 for gates for the hangar in Baldonnel for the pilots to play about.</P>
    <P>In connection with drainage allocation, the Parliamentary Secretary, by now, has the case for the River Suck nearly off by heart.  Although I feel that it is like knocking one's head against a stone wall, I must, at the same time, make a further case to him to ensure that a scheme for the drainage of the Suck will be put into operation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Previous holders of this office assured the Suck Drainage Committee that when the Corrib scheme was concluded, the plant and machinery would be moved to the River Suck for the carrying out of drainage in that catchment area.  When I mention previous Parliamentary Secretaries, I refer to the late Deputy Beegan and also to Deputy Donnellan and Deputy Bartley. Those three men, on various occasions, were Parliamentary Secretaries.  They visited Roscommon.  Some of them met the county council officially and others attended a meeting of the River Suck Drainage Board.  The members of that board and the members of the county council were left under the impression that the River Suck was very high in the priority list.</P>
    <P>I know that every area will press its claims, but I should like to know the basis on which the priority list is established.  Is it because of political pressure in various localities that one scheme manages to move ahead on the list over others?  It has been admitted by the experts in the Office of Public Works that, on the basis of population and of the numbers trying to eke out an existence in the catchment areas, far more families are involved in the River Suck catchment area, for its size, and so on, than in any other catchment area.</P>
    <P>Small farmers there are trying to eke out an existence.  Do we give preference to the small farmers and the number of these involved, or to catchment areas where the land may be of much greater value but is owned by fewer people?  There are <Col N="1240" /> areas in the country where prime land is flooded but where the prime land is owned by a very limited number of people.  On the other hand, we have areas where the land may not be of the highest quality but where a large number of families are trying to eke out an existence.  Do we give priority to the claim of the families or to the claim of the ranchers?  That is important.</P>
    <P>The River Suck is one of those rivers that come into the category of having along its banks large numbers of small holdings.  Over the years, many of the people on these small holdings have given up hope. Now, they will be able to join the general stream of emigrants from the west, locking up their houses and disappearing.</P>
    <P>While I do not object to the idea of intermediate river drainage, I suggest that the danger exists that schemes already on the priority list under the Arterial Drainage Act are likely to be postponed, due to the fact that the endeavours of the survey teams are being directed to these intermediate drainage areas.  As far as County Roscommon is concerned, we are precluded from having any work done under an intermediate drainage scheme, if we are to accept what the Parliamentary Secretary has said as being correct that there must be separate catchment areas with a direct outflow.  I gather that only rivers which flow directly to the sea can be included in this intermediate drainage scheme.  Of course, that will preclude a county such as Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I hope I do not sound unreasonable when I say that all groups in Roscommon, including the Minister's Party, have, over the years, pressed as hard as they possibly could to have something done to remedy the position in that county, to ease the burden on the farmers whose lands are constantly flooded.  I know that other Deputies must be bored at times when they hear so much talk about flooding but no area in the country suffers as much from flooding as that part because of its geographical position&mdash;the Suck <Col N="1241" /> running along one border for a considerable length of the county and the Shannon along the other side.</P>
    <P>When both of these rivers are flooded, they cover practically half the county.  Everybody here must be aware that the newspapers, over the years, have given plenty of publicity to the havoc wrought by the Shannon, in particular.  Very recently, we were told there is a danger involved in carrying out drainage work on the River Suck.  This is a new piece of information which has only just been made available to us.</P>
    <P>There was no question, in years past, as far as the engineers of the Office of Public Works were concerned, about the drainage of the River Suck into the Shannon causing harm to the people living lower down the banks of the Shannon.  However, since the inspection of the Shannon area by Mr. Rydell, fears have been expressed that it would be dangerous to carry out work on the Suck for fear of flooding land along the Shannon.  That argument did not arise when the Brosna was being done.  What is still more important, that argument has not been used as far as the River Inny is concerned. People are beginning to lose patience about this question of drainage.  It might be no harm to have the Minister aware of this situation.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, the River Inny flows into the Shannon at Athlone.  Practically right beside that, there is another river from the Roscommon side flowing into the Shannon.  The Office of Public Works are precluded from carrying out drainage works on the Roscommon side.  The basis of the refusal is the danger of doing piecemeal drainage under the 1945 Act. Nevertheless, on the far side, the River Inny is to be drained.  The work is to commence in the next few months and it is to be drained into the River Shannon.  That is to be drained into the Shannon.  The volume of water in the Inny is far greater than the volume of water in most of the other tributaries. It is, I think, the second biggest tributary of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> There is something extraordinary about that situation.  It is something people are not going to accept any longer with the same patience they have shown up to the present.  Many of us in Roscommon had on occasion to urge, particularly on the people in the Crannagh-Cross area, to have patience, that the Government, whatever Government might be in power, would surely recognise their just request for aid.</P>
    <P>So far, the Government have refused to give any grant for the drainage of this river but they have not so far made any bones about the county council raising the money from the rates.  As far as the Government are concerned, we are told that the Board of Works are precluded from doing arterial drainage on the grounds that it is piecemeal and, therefore, it would be dangerous to do it unless the catchment area were being drained.  At the same time, the Government say to the county council: &ldquo;You can go ahead and do it yourselves out of the rates.&rdquo; Is that not another conflicting story?  How can the people be expected to have patience much longer?</P>
    <P>In regard to subhead J.1, there is a reduction of £2,000 in the provision for the arterial drainage survey.  The statement says that this does not mean there is any diminution in the arterial drainage survey programme, but is due to the fact that the outdoor work on the special preliminary investigation in connection with the River Shannon flood proper is almost completed. Perhaps, we could find out what the £2,000 will be spent on.  If the rate of progress is to be kept up and maintained in the drainage works, surely there should be no reduction in the expenditure on the survey team.  If the Shannon flood problem investigation is completed by the end of the year, why should there be a reduction as a result of that in the Estimate?  Should not the team engaged on that work be switched on to some other work?</P>
    <P>On the question of the survey itself upon the Shannon, does this mean that the report, which is expected at the end of the year, is of a nature <Col N="1243" /> that will either give the Government an opportunity to embark on a proper survey or does the report mean that a survey has been included up to the present and that the work is likely to commence within a reasonable time after this report is received?  Could we have any indication as to whether, when this report is received, a drainage scheme of some description to ameliorate conditions, will be undertaken within, say, 12 months or two years of the issue of that report?  At least that would be some news to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough to have this flooding every year but it is much worse when you find that you have no definite knowledge that in five or seven years' time steps will be taken to remedy it.  Even if the people had accurate imformation as to when some practical steps would be taken, I think it would relieve the situation.</P>
    <P>I cannot be any milder than I have been on this matter of drainage because I feel we must explore all the peaceful lines open to us in regard to drainage before the people themselves decide to take action outside those lines.  As it stands at the moment, the small farmers in Roscommon County are almost at boiling point.  I say that now, having given the matter very careful thought.  I am talking now about the Minister's supporters as well as the supporters of all political Parties.  I am not issuing any threats as to the kind of organisation that will evolve along the Shannon but I can tell the Minister that the situation that has developed up to now will become very serious for the Government unless some light is cast on the Government's plans for work on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I have been in touch within the past few weeks with farming groups on the Shannon and I was disturbed at the reactions generally of all the groups concerned.  It is no longer a question of Party politics.  It is a question, as far as these people are concerned, of wanting work done or there will be no more rent and rates paid.  If that attitude develops, it can turn into a prairie fire and the Government will <Col N="1244" /> have nobody to blame but themselves. The Government should let the people along the Shannon know definitely whether, when this report is issued, they can hope to have practical steps taken of some description to remedy the problems which have lasted so many years.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should take the opportunity, if he has nothing good to tell us in this debate, of attending a meeting at a suitable venue near the Shannon so that he can explain the position to a representative gathering of the farmers.  Not so long ago a deputation attended on the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with the drainage problem.  That deputation should have been received by the Taoiseach. The application for the deputation was sent to the Taoiseach.</P>

I raised a question in this House with the Taoiseach as to why he sidetracked it and sent it to the Parliamentary Secretary.  At this stage, I shall say no more about it except that the Parliamentary Secretary should now put to the Government how serious the situation is.  If the Taoiseach is not prepared to receive the deputation and know the facts for himself, the Parliamentary Secretary has no excuse. He knows the facts and the temper of the people now.  I hope he will take the necessary steps to indicate to them when some measures of a practical nature will be taken to ease the position.</P>

      <P>I first wish to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the very efficient and courteous way in which he is carrying out his work.  He has proved a very good Parliamentary Secretary since he was appointed and is carrying out his duties very efficiently. We wish him well and hope he will be long spared to continue the good work.  There are a few items in this Estimate in which I am interested. While the major arterial drainage scheme has been accomplishing very <Col N="1245" /> good results since it was started, there is nevertheless a problem in county Dublin which is somewhat acute at certain periods of the year in relation to minor rivers, some of which originate in Meath and cause a considerable flooding in various parts of county Dublin.  I was delighted to hear that the Government have now put minor rivers under the Department's care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

      <P>Have they?  I thought it was intermediate rivers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>These minor rivers cause a lot of damage.  If we had to wait until all arterial drainage work was completed none of the minor rivers which I have in mind would be cleaned.  I welcome the advance made and also the idea of maintaining and cleaning rivers yearly. One thing about schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act was that the work was rushed; the job was completed, but no arrangements were made for maintenance afterwards.  I want to urge the Parliamentary Secretary to try to get the work done on these minor rivers emptying into the sea.  One of the rivers to which I am referring is the Broadmeadow River, which is responsible for flooding hundreds of acres and on which the Department and the engineers have been working for some time.  I hope actual drainage work on it will commence in the near future.</P>
      <P>Most of the rivers to which I refer run into the sea and work can be started on them from the seashore and proceed inland.  There is no excuse for delay.  It cannot be said they are flooding other areas, whereas some of the rivers which were cleaned in County Meath were responsible for flooding in county Dublin, where the rivers had not been cleaned the whole way down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we have had some good water and some bad water from County Meath. Another problem hitting us in County Dublin is that of coast erosion.  We have a considerable amount of coast erosion along the coast: and it was particularly bad last year in the Rush and Donabate districts.  While I know it is a major problem, people representing the various areas in which coast erosion takes place are expected by their constituents to see if anything can be done about it.</P>
      <P>As I say Donabate is one area I have in mind.  As far as I can see, in a few years' time at least 70 to 80 houses at the point known as The Burrows will be washed away.  The inroads made last year by the sea caused the high banks to collapse and in a few more winters the houses will be washed away.  That is the position in that respect.  The same applies to Rush.  These two districts are adjacent to each other and due to the sandy nature of the soil, rough tides take away big quantities of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer also to harbours. There has been a report on certain harbours around county Dublin and I intend to deal with those harbours again on the Estimate for the Department of Lands.  The Board of Works are partly responsible for these harbours inasmuch as their engineers made a report on them to the Department of Lands.  A number of fishing boats have been damaged in Skerries due to overcrowding in the small harbour.  Howth harbour has been dredged periodically but Howth is a great tourist centre.  A large number of visiting yachts come there from other countries and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary if possible to arrange to have dredging done between now and 1st June, because sometimes dredging starts during the tourist season and it has not been a great success.  I know that in a bad winter the Board of Works cannot very well send their dredger there but nevertheless it is work which will benefit the tourist trade and also <Col N="1247" /> benefit the Exchequer and the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am very satisfied with the progress made in county Dublin in regard to the building of schools, both national and secondary schools, by the Department of Education in conjunction with the Department of Public Works.  A number of the schools in the county still need to be replaced but, in the years during which I have been in public life, I have found that if the people and the manager make an honest effort the Board of Works are most helpful.  I hope I shall see all the old schools in the county replaced. Last year quite a number of new schools were opened in county Dublin and the Parliamentary Secretary, since he took office, and the Board of Works have been most helpful in these matters.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy on the opposite side who referred to cleaning up the outside of Leinster House.  We should put our own house in order first and set an example.  I feel that the outside of Leinster House, which is very dark and dull looking, should be cleaned up.  I heard someone say that an extension of accommodation in Leinster House was not necessary. In Dublin city and county we want to provide some work for tradesmen and labourers.  We have heard from the Opposition on numerous occasions a good deal of hypocritical talk about what they would do for Dublin and for Leinster House.  We have one-fifth of the population of all Ireland, and perhaps more, in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In other countries, the Department of Public Works create employment and go out of their way to do it.  It would be a bad situation if we could not look after our public buildings and create employment which will keep our people at home rather than have to listen to the hypocrisy about unemployment expressed from time to time during elections down the country.  I believe that work should be carried on and that where possible public buildings should be improved, thereby providing employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These Votes deal with various Departments and affect much of the country and, thus, we find various constituencies mentioned.  In a general way, listening to the debate since it opened, a plea was made for increased work under various headings. That is very desirable, but, to my mind, the real delay in carrying out works is not attributable entirely to the Board of Works.  I think it is due to inadequate staffing.  There is a backlog of work which is continuing to pile up, and I think that is because the technical, and architectural staff in particular, are not available. Too much is required of that staff both in regard to new work and work urgently arising in the course of the year.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas buildings have benefited from the attention of the Board of Works.  Further plans which are in train in that regard to provide more accommodation will, I am sure, be welcomed and appreciated by the public who come to Leinster House.  It is high time that the structure at the gate, in which officials of the House have to remain and where the public wait at times, was replaced.  It is unworthy of a national Parliament.  So far as I am concerned&mdash;and I am sure a great many other Deputies&mdash;we shall not find anything to criticise in that proposal.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Department of Finance, there is one item to which I should like to refer in connection with receipts under Appropriations-in-Aid. It may be a small matter but it is something that struck me in regard to Dún Laoghaire Pier.  On a few occasions I had to go to Westland Row to see off people on the mail boat.  I was refused a ticket and told that unless one is travelling, one cannot get a ticket to Dún Laoghaire at such times.  That is very hard to understand.  I presume it is a question of possible overcrowding but people do not readily understand why they should be refused a ticket to travel on the train to Dun Laoghaire with relatives going away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that provision is being made for a bovine T.B. eradication scheme office in Waterford.  That has been commented on already and certainly in <Col N="1249" /> Limerick, which is a dairying county and where we are struggling with the bovine T.B. scheme, we need an office instead of having to deal with an office in Tipperary at present which is quite a distance from many areas in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The progress in regard to schools, as indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, shows the number of new buildings and buildings to be enlarged or reconstructed but at the present rate of progress, even though it be a goodly one, it means that it will take from six to eight years to overtake the backlog, even if no further buildings required replacement in the meantime. The buildings which are being erected are pleasant to look at and to work in and the architectural staff are to be complimented, but the point mentioned by Deputy Kitt in regard to ensuring that the accommodation provided will be adequate for the future needs of the area is something that should be closely considered when the building is about to be undertaken.</P>

      <P>I notice that in regard to preparatory colleges minor expenditure is provided for by comparison with the large sums previously spent. Naturally, work that has been undertaken must be brought to completion but I understand that the whole question of preparatory colleges is rather in the melting pot at the moment.</P>
      <P>I do not notice any provision for Garda barracks in county Limerick. In one area in the county the Garda barracks was destroyed by fire during last year and at present there is no station there.  Whether it is proposed to build one and provide some type of station in the area is something we would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drainage has been mentioned by practically every Deputy and it is a matter that arises in my constituency also.  We are equally concerned about arterial and minor drainage schemes. Previously there was reference to the <Col N="1250" /> Deale and to the inspection and examination of that river that have taken place.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary when we may expect work on that scheme to commence. For the past three years, we had widespread flooding which caused considerable damage in the area. There is also the river Maigue and its tributary, the Camogue.</P>

      <P>I must apologise to the Deputy and to the House.  The answer is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Education (Provision of Meals) Acts are merely enabling Acts which permit urban local authorities to provide <Col N="1253" /> meals for children in national schools, either on payment or, in the case of needy children, at the expense of the rates where the Minister so authorises.  The Acts do not empower the local authorities to insist on supplying meals to any school and, consequently, school managers are free to decide whether or not they should seek to have meals supplied to children in their schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>School managers can decide.  One man can decide.  As the Minister is aware, ratepayers have at all times opposed the allocation of money by the local authority for the provision of school meals.  If a school manager happened to be a ratepayer and a member of a local authority, he would, in that capacity, oppose the allocation of moneys for school meals.  That is the point.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand that it is the Minister's intention sympathetically to consider the specific consequences of a large number of Schedule E assessments being withdrawn from collectors of income tax, with a consequent substantial reduction in the annual remuneration offered to them, which is in some measure related to the prospective numbers of assessments for which they are responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are difficulties which are being considered.  Of course, as the Deputy has pointed out, the collector's remuneration depended to a great extent on the number of people he dealt with and the amount of tax he collected.  A great number of these people will be removed from his direct attention.  There will, however, be questions arising under P.A.Y.E. and the services of collectors will be useful in that connection.  There will have to be a reappraisal of the whole position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable to assume there are no serious grounds for apprehending that their customary income will be materially reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say that definitely. As the Deputy has indicated, <Col N="1255" /> he knows that the income of the collector depended on the amount of collection he did.  There will have to be a rearrangement of the assessment of income in future.  That is being dealt with at the moment.</P>

      <P>When the Minister speaks of the work that will arise under P.A.Y.E., is he referring to inspecting the cards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is not so much that as dealing with individual cases. Some question may arise with regard to the individual paying income tax and the collector will be asked to deal with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>Income tax statistics are not compiled in such a manner as would provide the information requested at (a) and (b) of the Deputy's question.  In connection with the preparation of national income figures, however, particulars of total taxes on incomes and estimates of taxes on personal incomes are published in the Irish Statistical Survey.  Tables A.5 and A.12 of the 1958 Survey give figures for the years 1953 and 1958. Figures for later years are not yet available.  Estimates of taxes paid by companies can be derived by subtracting taxes on personal incomes from total taxes on incomes.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that for national income purposes taxes on incomes and taxes on personal incomes include contributions to social insurance.</P>
      <P>As regards (c) of the question, details of the net receipts of Death Duties in the years 1955/56 to 1957/58 are given in Table 46 of the Thirty-fifth Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners for the year ended on 31st March, 1958.  The net receipt for the years 1958/59 and 1959/60 was £2,883,556 and £3,012,012, respectively.  The estimated receipt for the year 1960/61 is £2,750,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the question of arterial drainage and saying we should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what progress was being made in Limerick.  In regard to the Maigue, this river has been under examination by the authorities for some time and has been causing a great deal of trouble.  Deputations were received recently from both Limerick and Tipperary on this matter pointing out the urgency of attending to this problem.  In regard to the lower Maigue where it reaches the Shannon, there has been a drainage problem there which is causing great hardship to certain farmers just before the river reaches the Shannon.  The drainage is effected by the embankments of the Shannon itself in which there were sluices previously but which now are not working satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year in this debate questions were asked in regard to these embankments and it was mentioned that the Office of Public Works would be accepting responsibility in future for them.  These embankments are still in the possession of the Land Commission. Whether the responsibility for drainage is still that of the Land Commission or whether it has been passed to the Office of Public Works I am not in a position to state.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and the other Deputies for the area know and have drawn to the attention of the responsible authority this problem, which affects quite a large area of land there.  We hope that something can be done by some <Col N="1269" /> Department&mdash;I presume by the Office of Public Works&mdash;to alleviate this grave hardship on the people there.</P>
    <P>There is one other small matter to which I want to refer.  It is in regard to the appropriations-in-aid&mdash;two small items there.  I notice in No. 5 that there is an anticipated drop in receipts from the sales of farm and garden produce this year over last year. It is to be sincerely hoped that that is not the trend in store for people engaging in the production of farm and garden produce.  Perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to give us an explanation as to why this drop will occur in the receipts.  The other matter is No. 9, which deals with sales of property.  There is no reference to the previous year, but there is an item there of £8,000 from the sales of property.  The Parliamentary Secretary might tell us how this arises or where the property is that is to be disposed of to realise this sum.</P>
    <P>Ancient monuments come within the orbit of this Vote.  Generally, the attention paid to them is very praiseworthy. In recent years, there has been a very notable contribution to the pleasure and benefit people get from visiting these places because of the fact that a concise synopsis of the history of the building or ruin has been given. I hope that this will even be enlarged upon.  In regard to the Abbey of Askeaton in my constituency, which dates from the 15th century, there seems to be evidence on the building itself of rain coming through.  Since very good work has been done in regard to it, perhaps, at some stage the Parliamentary Secretary would draw the attention of the local office to the matter to see whether this might be remedied at very small expense at this stage, whereas later it might require a larger amount.</P>
    <P>Deputies from all constituencies are interested in these two Votes.  A great amount of valuable work is being done, although, perhaps, the rate of progress is not as great as people would like to see.  The provision of work is very desirable.  The provision of the amenities which this Department deals with, both in the matter of schools and other public buildings, is something <Col N="1270" /> that could provide a great measure of needed employment, particularly in regard to the building trade.  It would seem, however, that even the provisions made here for the expenditure of certain sums of money are not always fully availed of.  This, I think, is not the fault of the Office itself, but rather is due to the shortage of technical staff in the Department to deal with the problems facing them.  I sincerely hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to do something in that respect and provide on his establishment the larger technical staff needed for the increased volume of work he has been asked to provide here today.  In that respect, I wish him every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wycherley complained this morning that the Board of Works were apparently unaware of the existence of a place called Cork.  But for the fact that Leinster House is situated in Dublin, I think I could make the same complaint and say that the Board of Works are not very aware of the existence of Dublin.  Admittedly, other Departments, such as the Department of Justice and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, have some building activity in the city carried out by the Board of Works or by contractors employed by the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wycherley's complaint was that no drainage whatever had taken place in Cork.  Last March 12 months, I raised the question here of the Dodder River.  I was informed by the then Parliamentary Secretary that he could not deal with the matter because the Dodder did not drain agricultural land, and that in accordance with the terms of the Drainage Act of 1945, he could drain only agricultural land.  I was having a look at the index to the Statutes and I turned over to the description of the various Drainage Acts.  We have the following Acts: 1926 (Owenmore), 1927 (Barrow), 1928 (Minor Schemes), 1933 (Barrow), 1943 (Fergus) and 1945 (General). The 1945 Act is listed as a general Drainage Act and not a Drainage Act to cover only agricultural land.  I followed that up and had a look at the particular Act.  While I know it is not the Minister's duty to interpret <Col N="1271" /> the Acts, in the entire Act of 1945 &ldquo;agricultural land&rdquo; is not mentioned even once.  It refers to &ldquo;the drainage of lands.&rdquo;  I maintain the Parliamentary Secretary has the power under these Acts to deal with the problems caused by the peak flooding of the Dodder.</P>
    <P>I accepted the explanation that there was greater hardship and that it was better in the national interest that these agricultural lands be attended to first.  However, when the flooding took place in the midlands about a year ago, I went down to have a look at it.  It looked almost as bad as it appeared in the newspapers.  Several families were staying in Army barracks and so on.  I immediately felt that perhaps I had been right in not pushing the question of the Dodder, but talking to the people in the area, I found there did not seem to be as much sympathy for these poor farmers as I anticipated, because, apparently, each year the river floods, they get much greater yields from their lands. Apparently, they are treated quite well during the time their homes are flooded.  I do not know whether that is true or not but that is the reaction I got from people in the midlands. Whereas I went down full of sympathy, the local people had very little sympathy at all.</P>
    <P>The River Dodder flooding affects principally 160 houses in Orwell Gardens, and other flooding takes place between there and the sea.  These houses are occupied almost entirely by middle-class people, tradesmen, labouring men and clerical workers in the main.  They have bought these houses on their own and Dublin Corporation are spending the equivalent of one penny in the £ on the rates each year in an effort to relieve somewhat the flooding caused by this river. Dublin Corporation, however, have not got the machinery, and in fact I doubt if they have even the engineering staff available, to take on a major scheme such as the River Dodder involves.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to have another look at this <Col N="1272" /> question because it is not very encouraging to people to invest their savings in the purchase of their own houses. In fact, some of these people regret very much that they did not take what facilities were available to them under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and ask Dublin Corporation to house them.  If they had, and there was any flooding, then it would have to be taken care of by the Corporation. There are also new houses off the Lower Dodder Road.  I have seen the flood marks three or four feet up on the walls, and the floods destroyed new carpets, furniture and pianos, with no effort made by the Government except by way of emergency relief grants to assist in tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>I understand that some years ago there was a priority list of rivers drawn up and I had that list a short while ago.  I got information from the City Engineer's office that it was announced some considerable number of years ago that the first river which flows through Dublin due to be dealt with is the Tolka.  I asked how long would that take and I was told it would probably be 20 to 25 years, and the Dodder is away down below that again.  I expect everybody in this House will be dead and buried by the time it comes to be tackled, if that rate of progress is maintained, unless the new Parliamentary Secretary, whom I congratulate on his appointment&mdash;he is an energetic man&mdash;deals with this problem out of consideration for the hardship caused to residents along the banks of the Dodder.</P>
    <P>Just as a matter of interest, if it is Government policy not to deal with any river which is considered to be purely an urban river, I can suggest that the Dodder could possibly be dealt with as a catchment of the River Liffey which, in fact, it is, and in that way we would not interfere with Government policy.</P>
    <P>There is not very much I want to say on this Estimate because, as I have said, with the exception of a few buildings, the Board of Works is not very much aware of the presence of Dublin.  However, I noticed here today that we had a few large coachfuls of school children in the Visitors' <Col N="1273" /> Gallery.  They come in on what I understand are C.I.E. educational tours and if the Parliamentary Secretary has any money available, though I do not know where he would get the space, I would suggest to him seriously that he must in some way endeavour to provide facilities for the six or eight buses that park outside in the middle of Kildare Street.  Perhaps it could be arranged that they would come in through Government Buildings because the whole of Kildare Street is obstructed when buses park there. That is a type of tour that we must encourage, but at the same time perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would try to get these buses off the street.</P>
    <P>Deputy P.J. Burke referred to Skerries harbour.  That is in county Dublin but I am very familiar with the problem that exists there.  It appears that some years ago the Board of Works carried out improvements to the neighbouring harbour at Loughshinny and whatever went wrong, Loughshinny silted up.  The boats moored there were forced to come to Skerries and now we have boats, four and five abreast tied to each other at Skerries and taking bottom twice every twenty-four hours which, I understand, will considerably shorten their life.  The fishermen tell me that as a result of constantly taking bottom, they reckon that the boats will be lucky to last while they are making their full repayments on them, and that they will probably be forced to buy new boats as soon as they have paid for their existing ones.</P>
    <P>One major piece of land owned by the Board of Works is Phoenix Park. Some months ago, I brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretrary, by way of Parliamentary Question, the fact that since the Gough monument had been blown up, its base now constitutes a traffic hazard. While the top was on the pedestal, people driving from the country into the city through Phoenix Park could see a silhouette of the monument, but now it is gone and apparently it is not to be replaced.  It was replaced on a couple of occasions, but apparently it will not be again.  The Parliamentary <Col N="1274" /> Secretary said he would look into the possibility of having reflectors placed around the base of the monument and I should like to hear if that matter has yet been considered.  I sincerely believe that the least that should be done is that reflectors should be placed around the base, or an alternative would be to re-site it on the side of the road, or some yards in off the road.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the French authorities have taken practically every monument off the centre of their roads and moved them to the sides.  Some of these monuments bear no inscriptions. Nobody knows who put them up, why they were put up or what they commemorate; they are retained purely as works of art.  I suggest that as far as Phoenix Park is concerned, the best way to deal with the monument is to re-site it in more protected ground, such as the Zoological Gardens.  It might then be worth considering the re-erection of the monument because, though we may not have any particular love for the man on the horse, it was a very beautiful statue.  I think most people agree it was a work of art, and from that point of view, it would be no harm to have it re-erected on protected ground.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned the Zoological Gardens, I should say that I think they are very fine gardens, and we were all very distressed by the vandalism that took place when some of the birds there were killed a short while ago.</P>

      <P>According to regulations, commercial vehicles are not allowed to drive through Phoenix Park and if children and elderly people want to go to the Zoo, they must be left off their buses on the North Circular Road or Parkgate Street and walk up to it.  I suggest that an exception could be made in this case, particularly on bank holidays and weekends, to allow C.I.E. buses to <Col N="1275" /> run as far as the Zoological Gardens. I think it would be a commercial proposition for the Board of C.I.E. and furthermore would open up the attractions of the Park and make the Zoological Gardens more attractive and more readily available to the citizens and to visitors to the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity when mothers of small children must make a considerable journey to catch a bus, particularly coming back after spending a whole day on their feet in the Zoological Gardens.  I know, because I have had the experience.  This matter could be dealt with quite easily because commercial vehicles must come in there when animals and goods are being delivered to the Zoo.  Therefore, I assume that exception is made in certain cases.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the lighting facilities in the Phoenix Park are completely inadequate. Most of the lighting there is gas lighting.  It is certainly very dim and inadequate and I should very much like to see the Parliamentary Secretary doing something to improve it.  It is quite common to see cars parked there without lights.  Unlike corporation parks, the Phoenix Park can be police patrolled.  There have been prosecutions for parking without lights but I suppose that sort of thing will go on for all time.  In order to protect people against accidents, the Parliamentary Secretary should endeavour to see that the principal roads at any rate in Phoenix Park are properly lighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other matter to which I should like to refer.  The civilian Olympic equestrian team is now training in the south-east of Ireland.  I believe that very adequate facilities have been put at their disposal but the difficulty has arisen that a great number of our leading show jumping riders and dressage riders cannot travel to these facilities without giving up their employment in the city.  I raised this question briefly with <Col N="1276" /> the Minister for Defence on his Estimate with a view to seeing if facilities might be made available in McKee Barracks and he informed the House that, unfortunately, the facilities there are fully utilised at the moment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would investigate the possibility of making facilities available to a civilian Olympic equestrian team&mdash;it is too late for the 1960 Olympic Games to do anything like that&mdash;for the 1964 Games because it is generally agreed that our bloodstock, show jumpers and racehorses, are a very important industry. We should do everything in our power, and the Government should co-operate to the maximum possible extent, to ensure that when we send horses and riders abroad, we send only the very best we have and let them be a constant advertisement for the very fine bloodstock produced in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Lemass was speaking, I had before me the list of the proposed new works, alterations and additions for 1960/61. With regard to his complaint that Dublin did not appear to be well served by the Office of Public Works, may I say that I notice some items that are strictly of value to this capital city?  There is a proposal in the present year to spend £7,500 on the improvement of the plant house at Aras an Uachtarain and, in the entire list to be financed out of £116,520, £107,520 is scheduled for expenditure in the city of Dublin.  That is not a bad contribution towards the city from the Parliamentary Secretary's Vote.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that any Deputy would desire to secure from the Vote the maximum amount for his constituency or environs, but I consider that is a fairly formidable contribution towards works in Dublin by one Department and, no doubt, there are items in other Estimates which will be of value to the city.</P>
      <P>I should like to join the other Deputies who have spoken in extending felicitations to the Parliamentary Secretary.  He has not been long enough in office as yet to prove what he is capable of but I am sure we wish him the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> This is a Vote in which we are glad to see an increase in expenditure. Whatever criticism we may offer about increases in expenditure generally, this is a Vote, particularly in respect of arterial drainage where it is very desirable to spend, not alone as much as we have been spending in the past but, if possible, more.  It is unfortunate, however, that under some subheads quite a substantial proportion of the increased money allocated is being swallowed up by increased salaries and wages.</P>
    <P>It is a couple of years since we pointed out that the Government were taking a foolish action in withdrawing food subsidies and in thinking that they could cut off from the expenditure of the State the moneys then being spent in that direction.  We were told by the Minister for Finance at the time that he would ensure that that money was really saved but we have this recurring, this echoing expenditure, increasing all the time in the effort that the Government have been compelled to make to compensate all the State personnel, everybody engaged in public works and elsewhere, for the impact on the value of their wages and salaries of that Government action.</P>
    <P>This is another echo of what has resounded from the Government's action at that time.  If there was to be an increase, we would have wished that increase to be devoted in its entirety to a more rapid extension of the operations under this Vote.</P>
    <P>In the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, there was no reference whatever to proposed works which would cater for the operations formerly carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It was understood here from a statement made by the Minister for Local Government in a discussion in the House before we adjourned for Christmas last that there would be alternative schemes whereby work formerly carried out under that very important scheme would in future be carried out in conjunction with the Office of Public Works.  We have no indication that the Government have prepared a substitute scheme for the carrying on of this work.  That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> I do not advocate that the money for such works should be found under this Vote now or at any time in future because that would mean taking up the time of engineers, overseers and others in the employment of the Office of Public Works which should be devoted to their present occupations. Personnel are available in local authorities, particularly engineers who, because of the modernisation of road maintenance and improvement, would have more time to devote to the supervision of Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes.  I earnestly recommend, through the Parliamentary Secretary, to the Minister and the Government, the resumption of operations under that scheme because if it is thrown over on this Office, it would mean taking up the time of engineers and other personnel that should be concentrated on what has been traditionally the work of that Office.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any reference whatever to what was regarded as impending, we may accept that that has now been shelved and that the argument on which the Minister for Local Government escaped at the time of the Private Members' Motion did not have much validity.</P>
    <P>I note that there has been some reduction in the number of new schools built and the number of schools improved last year over the previous year.  I may remark that the work that was carried out the previous year was work that was prepared in advance of the advent of this Government.  I trust that the hopeful statement of the Parliamentary Secretary will be fruitful and that there will be an examination of this work, because I know of no more important work in which the Office of Public Works is engaged than the provision of new schools and the improvement of existing schools. It is a matter of grave concern that we have suffered the children of this country to attend schools that would be a disgrace to any civilised community. That is work in which considerable progress has been made and which should be expedited as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I note also that there is, again, a provision of £20,000 for the projected <Col N="1279" /> Garden of Remembrance at Parnell Square.  I am glad to see that work has now progressed beyond the point at which there was considerable political acrimony in respect of it and criticism of the fact that more progress had not been made in earlier years in the provision of this projected Garden of Remembrance.  No doubt the reasons and factors which operated in previous years during the approach to this problem have also had their impact on the present Government.</P>
    <P>In relation to Kilmainham Jail, I should like to welcome the fact that it is proposed that the work in this regard will be done by voluntary workers.  That is a novel idea, and I hope it will meet with the success it merits and be an example in the carrying out of similar operations in other parts of the country.  Infinite compensation by way of a sense of achievement will be given to those who participate in that work.</P>
    <P>I note that favourable comment is made on the advances in arterial drainage and, quite rightly, tribute is being paid to the fact that the establishment of the Central Workshop Stores had a considerable part to play in that progress.  One can recall, certainly with some misgivings, the unfortunate campaign that was instituted when the previous Government decided to establish the Central Workshop Stores.  It is now recognised that their action at that time was, certainly, a major contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>At any rate, is it not well that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government should put on record their appreciation of the wisdom of the establishment of that workshop and the fact that, had it not been done then, arterial drainage would be many many years awaiting completion?</P>

      <P>At that time, an Act was in existence under which there had been no operations and certainly that was a wise thing to have done at that time.  It was of infinite value to the many needs of the country and it is fine to see that now put on record. Reference is also made here to the fact that in relation to appropriations-in-aid, some moneys have been acquired from sales of property.  In that respect, I emphasise to the Parliamentary Secretary the desirability of adequate advertisements on occasions on which such property is for sale.  I know that on a recent occasion somebody made a profit to the extent of 200 per cent on his investment in property bought from the Office of Public Works at such a sale.</P>

I shall say again it was not a small item, but an item which ran into hundreds of pounds, and into thousands of pounds, for the person who was cute enough to avail of the opportunity.  I agree it is something which could happen to anybody and I just mention it as something to be watched in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy give particulars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give particulars. In relation to arterial drainage, I want to say that the reluctance of the Board of Works down through the years to embark on the drainage of tributaries is understandable, because it might aggravate flooding in the lower reaches of the catchment areas.  With the advancement of the scheme, I appeal to him to re-examine that position because, as the more necessary schemes are dealt with, he will find there are parts of the country where the main catchment area would not <Col N="1281" /> suffer, except to a very small extent possibly, from the carrying out of the very necessary drainage operations on the tributaries in such areas.</P>
      <P>I have in mind one tributary in my own constituency, the Awbeg tributary of the Blackwater.  Anyone who knows the area, will appreciate that the affected area is excellent land and it would be of great value locally if it could be properly utilised.  The losses of crops, and the damage by flooding to the grasslands, have been considerable, year in and year out, down through the years.  That is one tributary that could well be examined with a view to carrying out some drainage operations before the main catchment area is affected, because we have never had any serious evidence of the aggravation of flooding on the lower reaches of the parent river, the Blackwater.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that matter and not to defer any action, whatever, in relation to such areas until such time as the entire catchment area comes for survey and later development.</P>
      <P>The fact is that there would appear to be a limited area, in relation to the entire catchment area, which is very seriously affected, but it is of extreme importance to the farmers who have to pay high rates on very highly valued lands which are subject to perennial flooding.  The best argument I can advance in support of attention being paid to such an area is the fact that the members of Cork County Council, from regions as far distant as the Beara Peninsula, when they realised the importance of drainage in this area, co-operated by increasing the grant from the rates in order to maintain some freedom in the river.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, therefore, sympathetically to examine the possibility of extending some attention to this area, and others, if there are similar instances, prior to making any inroads on the larger catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Palmer was speaking here in relation to the siting of new schools, he made a very pertinent point in relation to the provision of <Col N="1282" /> playing grounds.  We all know, as we drive throughout the country, the necessity of being on the look-out for children coming to or leaving the national schools.  The siting of playing grounds quite often would not only provide the necessary arena for them to engage in worthwhile sports, but would also ease and minimise the danger of accidents to them when they are forced on to the public roadways.</P>
    <P>I shall give an example.  In my native town of Millstreet, when a site was being sought for a new school, it was decided to go to the local town park.  That meant that these children, during their play hour, had the facility of the public park without being compelled to traverse the public streets and roadways. If sites such as that could be found in other areas, I think it would be a solution.  Where there are not public town parks, then I think careful consideration should be given to the acquisition of sufficient land with a school to give those children the freedom which is essential to them, if they are not to suffer accident or worse during play hour or during other hours when they are not in class.</P>
    <P>Before the Parliamentary Secretary concludes, we should like him to clear the air in relation to his intentions and in relation to the Minister for Local Government and the Government in respect of the resumption of operations under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>

      <P>With reference to the question of national schools, it has been mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan to my surprise that there was a decrease this year in the number of national schools completed and renovated&mdash;a reduction in the number of new national schools completed and old national schools renovated.  I understood from the Parliamentary Secretary last year that it was proposed to provide an increased number of national schools this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>He has an alibi so.  I also agree with him that as far as possible, when the Office of Public Works provides a new school, a playing pitch should be attached to it. In many areas it is extremely difficult to get the minimum amount of land for siting a national school but where the land is readily available, playing fields should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Education should have something to say on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I am a little irrelevant but I think those who went before me were equally irrelevant.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was not in the Chair at that time.  There is a difficulty, of course.  If the playing pitch is too far away from a national school, questions of supervision and insurance of the pupils arise.  They have a break usually of half an hour in rural schools in the middle of the day during which period one or other of the teachers normally has to supervise games and play while the other teachers are having their mid-day meal.  If the playing pitch is not in close proximity to the school, a great difficulty arises because the time factor is all important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity of having adequate play shelters attached to the national schools.  No manager should be allowed to proceed <Col N="1284" /> with plans that do not provide for playing shelters for the children.  That is important in bleak areas where the children have no shelter, where the aspect of the school does not lend itself to adequate shelter and they are exposed to the wind and weather during the inclement parts of the year. Many children get colds and have to stay away from school because of the hardships they have to endure during playtime.  It would be in the interests at least of the health of the children to make sure that no school is allowed to be provided without these shelters.</P>
    <P>I have recently seen a number of new national schools which were erected by the Office of Public Works and where there was no provision for running water or water closets.  We are living in the second half of the 20th century.  No school manager should be allowed to build a national school that does not provide these amenities.  I should use a stronger word than &ldquo;amenities&rdquo;&mdash;they are necessities.  We hear references in this house to piped water schemes, to sewerage schemes and so on.  The national schools are supposed to be examples of everything that is desirable.  If they have not these services, it is very hard to convince the children of today who are the citizens of tomorrow that these are necessaries and that they should have them in their own homes.</P>
    <P>Recently the county council of which I am a member discussed the question of non-public roads.  The Office of Public Works, through rural improvements schemes, provides grants for the reconstruction and repair of these roads.  Oftentimes a number of small farmers band together and raise a contribution which they forward to the Office of Public Works.  In due course, a good job of work is done on the road. Have I left the road?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall return to that subject later.  If I must leave the road, I must certainly go on to the question of drainage.  During the past year, I <Col N="1285" /> was on a number of deputations received by the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with drainage in my constituency, with particular reference to the River Shannon and its tributaries. I should like to know at this stage what progress, if any, has been made with the preliminary surveys that were to be carried out on the Shannon catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The surveys will conclude this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am interested in the Shannon is that until some decision is taken in relation to its drainage, which is a very big problem, the tributaries of the Shannon and, in particular, the Suck cannot be catered for.  The hold-up is not due to any action taken by the Parliamentary Secretary or his predecessor.  It arises out of a recommendation by Colonel Rydell who carried out a survey there some years ago and who advised the Government of the day that no drainage should be carried out on the tributaries of the Shannon unless and until the Shannon itself had been dealt with.</P>
      <P>I believe that was a just recommendation. The Government at the time accepted the recommendation and the Government who succeeded them honoured it, but it is, of course, very hard to convince the people in my own area that it was a just recommendation because they cannot understand why the drainage of the River Suck cannot be proceeded with and they cannot understand why the flooding of their own lands which adjoin the River Suck must continue until such time as the River Shannon is drained.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the preliminary survey of the River Shannon is nearing completion.  Of course, I expect it will be a long time yet before any concrete proposal for the drainage of the Shannon comes before the House. Until that time comes, the people affected by the flooding of the River Suck must, it appears, bide their time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told in the course of the year that the Board of Works might be prepared to carry out a certain number of intermediate drainage schemes.  As far as my constituency is <Col N="1286" /> concerned, I have not yet heard of any survey having been made in connection with any of these intermediate drainage catchment areas.  I drew the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to two rivers in my area that might possibly lend themselves to treatment under a scheme of this type.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in particular the Gort River.  This river rises on the borders of Galway and Clare and flows through the town of Gort.  Eventually, it enters the sea at Kinvara.  In the course of its journey from the Clare-Galway border to Kinvara, it disappears in some places.  Unfortunately, it does not disappear in Gort.  Every time we have a heavy flood, the Automobile Association and the Galway County Council have to plaster diversion notices within four and five miles of Gort on either side.  As Gort is on the main road from Shannon Airport to Galway, this causes serious inconvenience to all kinds of traffic.  The flooding on this occasion lasted for over two months. It was very serious as compared with the previous years and great damage was done to property and land in the town of Gort and the surrounding district. There was a grave dislocation of business in one of the principal streets of the town.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to give urgent and sympathetic consideration to the provision of an intermediate drainage scheme to relieve flooding in that area.  I have been in correspondence with him, and indeed, he was most helpful, but, owing to the nature of the difficulties&mdash;the swallow-holes and the disappearance of the river in places&mdash;he did not hold out much hope of an early scheme.</P>
    <P>There is also another river in my area that could readily lend itself to treatment under one of those schemes, the Oranmore River, which, I think, could be quite easily done as an intermediate drainage scheme.  If drained, it would give great relief to the farmers in the Oranmore area and would relieve hundreds of acres of first-class arable land of serious flooding.</P>
    <P>There are just two more points I wish to deal with.  A survey has been completed on the Killimor catchment area in Galway.  We were told that <Col N="1287" /> the scheme held a high place on the priority list.  The survey was carried out over three and a half years ago and the engineers with their equipment left the district over two years ago.  We were confident that the plans would be exhibited and that the scheme would start early this year.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary on 4th November, 1959, in Volume 177, column 618 of the Official Report, when approximately the drainage of the Killimor river catchment, county Galway, under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, would be commenced.  He informed me that the design of a scheme for the drainage of the Killimor catchment was in hands, but, pending completion of the design and compliance with the requirements of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, as regards exhibition and confirmation, it was not possible to say when works might be commenced.</P>
    <P>That was last November.  I hope, when he is replying, he may be able to give me more definite information in regard to the commencement than he was in a position to give me last November.</P>
    <P>The late Deputy Beegan, when he was Parliamentary Secretary, drew up a priority list and he informed this House and the Galway Deputies that another drainage scheme, the Dunkellin drainage scheme, occupied a high place on the priority list.  He was succeeded by Deputy Bartley, now Minister for the Gaeltacht, who also gave us the same information.  Luckily, they were both Galwaymen.  We have a Donegalman in charge of the Board of Works at present and I hope that the importance of the Dunkellin drainage area has not escaped him and that he will be in a position to give us some information about that scheme as well.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in these two drainage schemes because both were drained under the 1924 Drainage Act.  At least, I should say they were supposed to have been drained.  For a number of years, the people who were supposed to have benefited from these two schemes had to pay a special rate to the Galway County Council for the maintenance of the drainage works. <Col N="1288" /> The council have been under an obligation for a number of years to keep those two drainage areas in the same condition as they were in when handed over to them in 1926 but the council, I regret to say, are neither legally obliged nor in a position to do anything more than give the two rivers a slight run-over every year.  The slight run-over, I am afraid, is not of much use, but they vote a certain amount of money.  That is expended on different stretches of both rivers each year.</P>
    <P>Under the 1945 Act, the farmers, the supposed beneficiaries, were relieved of making the contribution. The council were not relieved of the obligation to maintain the rivers in the condition in which they were handed over to them by the Board of Works in 1926.  Having regard to these considerations they occupy such a position now they should I believe receive special attention from the Board of Works.  Preliminary work&mdash; the surveys and so on&mdash;have been carried out on the Killimor catchment area and I hope it will be possible to exhibit the plans and start work on it soon and also that it will be possible to start a survey of the Dunkellin catchment area and that the strict priority laid down by the late Deputy Beegan when he was Parliamentary Secretary will be rigidly adhered to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are all aware, the Board of Works spend a vast amount of money in many areas.  We know that most of that money is spent wisely and that before they embark on any scheme they give it very careful consideration.  Their activities cover a wide field, drainage schemes, Garda barracks, schools and so on.  In regard to schools in my county, reasonable progress is being made and a splendid type of school is being built.  Everyone seems to be satisfied&mdash;the managers, the pupils and the teachers&mdash;that the work is well done.  More consideration, however, will have to be given to the building of those schools.  In my county quite a number of migrants have arrived from the west of Ireland and by the time a new school is built seven or eight new families may have come into that area.  In some areas in the last five or six years, five or six <Col N="1289" /> large migrant families have arrived and are overcrowding the schools with the result that now an extra school is required.  I hope that when schools are being built in future each Department involved will be consulted so that the mistake will not be made of building too small a school.  It is my belief that every new school should have an extra school room.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall turn then, to drainage which is a problem which concerns practically every county.  My own county is one which needs urgent attention.  We have very flat, low-lying areas and most of the bogs in central Ireland are drained into the county. We are very concerned to make sure that the River Boyne is kept on the priority list, as it is at present.  I hope that the drainage of the Boyne will be carried out with all possible speed.  A survey has been carried out for over two years and I think it is now completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About five years ago I asked when the drainage of the Boyne would take place and I was told that it would take place in five years' time.  A year ago I asked the same question and again I was told that it would take place in about five years.  I do not like that. There is no reason why it should be put on the long finger.  There is a vast amount of virgin soil destroyed or overrun by water between Edenderry and Drogheda and we cannot afford to have that type of soil neglected.  That land is too valuable to be lost.  The farmers have been suffering over a number of years because of this flooding. Near where I live a small drainage scheme was carried out on the Rye river at Kilcock under the inter-Party Government.  It did an immense amount of good because prior to that the village of Kilcock was completely surrounded by water for two or three days every two or three years.  The roads were flooded and tractors had to be used to pull cars through the water. We are now in the happy position that Kilcock is not flooded and several hundred acres have been reclaimed and <Col N="1290" /> are being worked by the farmers.  The land reclamation programme is going ahead there at full speed.  That was only a small scheme but it shows what a large scheme like the Boyne drainage scheme could achieve.</P>
    <P>In another area near Dunboyne there is a problem which has existed for many years but which county Meath cannot tackle if Dublin County Council does not tackle it also.  I heard Deputy Burke speak about the same river.  We maintain that the backwater from Dublin is keeping the water in County Meath, so there is a problem between Meath and Dublin which must be solved jointly.  I hope that this will be put on the priority list for the minor drainage schemes.  I do not know whether it is the Tolka or the Liffey which is involved but work should be started at the Dublin end and continued back through Clonee.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, who is an energetic man and who put up many proposals to the Board of Works before he became Parliamentary Secretary, to tackle this problem now that he is in control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past 10 or 15 years a huge area of bogland in the centre of the country has been drained into our county and all the sediment and dirt comes rushing into the tributaries of the Boyne, the Blackwater and the Dee and a few others. These rivers and the Boyne are flooded very quickly.  In the past when the bogs were not drained the area was like a sponge and could hold the water but now many acres of land between Kildare and Meath are flooded, land which if the rivers were drained would be perfectly good land.  It is therefore important that we get ahead with the drainage as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear that Kilmainham Jail is being taken over and that private individuals of the right type are proposing to make it into a national monument of which we can be proud.  That is what we want, public spirited men to do the right thing in the right way.  I am confident <Col N="1291" /> that they will convert the jail into something of which we can be proud. For many years I have been listening to proposals in regard to this jail but nothing has been done.  The same applies to the Garden of Remembrance. I am glad that we shall have a Garden of Remembrance worthy of the people who died for this country and which will be our national memorial to those who made the great sacrifice, a memorial in which we can pay tribute to the living and the dead.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I pay tribute to the Board of Works for the good work they do.  I do not think I ever saw work that was badly done by them. They may go slowly but that is only right as they handle a vast amount of money for many types of schemes and they should not rush headlong into a scheme without looking at the pros and cons.  I believe they do, and that when carrying out a scheme, they do it in a way that is a credit to themselves and the country.  We have splendid schools and Garda barracks, well planned and laid out, representing money well spent.  Under the Board of Works, we get fair value for our money, even though we may have to wait a few years longer than we expect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to refer to the progress made with arterial drainage and to say that I am sure Deputies on all sides are satisfied that the progress for the past nine or ten years was very satisfactory.  We have broken the back of that problem now, even though there are still many important rivers to be drained.  If the present rate of progress continues, and possibly improves to some extent each year, we can be optimistic and hope that the main problem of arterial drainage will be solved in the next 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem of minor drainage which seemed to be nobody's responsibility up to now.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should endeavour to give this problem his attention as soon as possible.  The damage done through lack of minor drainage facilities is enormous.  Much discussion has taken place on the <Col N="1292" /> problem here in connection with the suspension of the Local Authorities (Works) Act and opinions were expressed largely in general agreement as to the necessity for minor drainage.  I have always felt that minor drainage is a problem that could not be tackled in a piecemeal fashion.  My view is that the schemes heretofore in operation were largely ineffective.  They may have cured some local requirement but in many cases the cure was worse than the disease because other problems were created and much damage done in other areas arising from remedial measures taken at the sources of small streams.</P>
    <P>The time has arrived when all drainage operations should be carried out by one office, preferably the Office of Public Works.  It seems to be equipped, not alone with the personnel but also with the experience, which is very important in drainage matters, to deal with the problem in a comprehensive way.  These minor drainage schemes have a rather important bearing on major schemes which are being taken care of at the moment.  Quite a lot of local drainage operations could be attended to during the period of operation on the general drainage now being carried out in several areas. Minor drainage problems have been discussed here many times in the past 12 months&mdash;on the Adjournment, arising out of replies to Dáil Questions and on other occasions.  Therefore, it is not necessary to elaborate unduly on them at this stage and I shall be content to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to try to give immediate attention to the problem so that some work may be put in hands in connection with minor drainage during the coming year.</P>
    <P>My second point&mdash;I think it has already been dealt with by several speakers&mdash;concerns coast erosion.  For some reason, not explained by people who should be competent to do so, the damage done by coast erosion in the past couple of years was very considerable. In parts of my constituency whole villages and adjoining areas have been seriously threatened due to an abnormal amount of damage particularly during the winter as a result <Col N="1293" /> of coast erosion.  In the Ballyheigue area in particular that has been the case.  The local committee set up to focus attention on the problem made representations to the Parliamentary Secretary some months ago and sought some assistance in the form of a grant and advice with a view to tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>The local authority seems to come into this up to now and a good deal of time and effort has been wasted because no single authority can be pinned down to accept responsibility for this work.  To what extent the local authority is involved I find it hard to understand.  It appears that unless the roads or the property of a local authority are in danger of being damaged the local authority should not be expected to come into it at all. I know there is legislation in that connection but unfortunately no provision is made under that legislation or otherwise to deal with problems of that kind.</P>
    <P>In other parts of the country I know there are problems of a similar nature and perhaps they are as urgent, or even more urgent, than the one I have mentioned but it is right that the Office of Public Works should endeavour to take responsibility to some extent in this matter.  The problem is rather extensive and cannot be remedied overnight but if the damage that has taken place in many areas is to continue at the same rate for any length of time I am afraid it will be too late to take corrective measures in the next six or eight months.  I seriously suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should give the matter his immediate attention. He might find it possible now to obtain funds from the Central Authority to enable either his own organisation or the local authorities to take action on this problem.</P>
    <P>There is still much complaint throughout the country about what is described as the undue delay that is taking place, it is alleged, in the architects' section of the Office of Public Works in regard to plans and specifications for new schools.  Evidently, the Minister for Education decides as to the necessity for schools on the representations of the managers or local <Col N="1294" /> interests concerned.  When that stage is reached and agreement secured in regard to the local contribution and so on the application is passed to the architects section of the Office of Public Works.  It is appreciated that the section is dealing at the moment with a large number of problems and it is only reasonable to expect that there should be a fair amount of delay. The delay which takes place, whether or not it is due to pressure because of the large volume of work in the section, is something we shall have to try to eliminate.  A way out of the difficulty for the Office of Public Works might be to farm out work of that kind to architects in private practice.  They are well equipped to undertake work of that kind and I can see no objection to availing of their services.  If the Parliamentary Secretary could see his way to adopting that suggestion, even as a temporary measure, it might help in clearing some of the arrears in his office.  There are a number of schools on the stocks at the moment and it is important that we should move a little more quickly in their construction than in the past.  The greatest delay occurs between the time of sanction and the time the contract is placed.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take note of the point and deal with the matter in the manner I suggest.</P>

      <P>A review of the various items of expenditure in this Vote shows a fair distribution as between town and country in regard to the money made available not alone for buildings of general and particular utility but also for the purpose of providing employment.  That is particularly true of the city areas as compared with rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think too high a tribute can be paid to the Board of Works for the manner in which they design and execute their buildings.  Their work is excellent.  If anything can be said against the Office of Public Works, it is perhaps in regard to the delay that occurs in some instances.  It should be remembered, however, that <Col N="1295" /> very often delay is desirable in order to achieve the best possible results.</P>
    <P>On every Estimate for the Board of Works and the Department of Education, since I came into this House, I have made it quite clear that, in the acquisition of sites for schools, particular attention should be paid to the acquiring of sufficient ground to enable provision to be made for recreational facilities for the children attending these schools.</P>
    <P>With regard to piers and harbours, I am somewhat perplexed, I must confess, as to where actual responsibility lies.  Under this Vote we have major harbour schemes for which £100,000 is required in the current financial year.  I notice that part of that money will be spent in Killybegs, in the Parliamentary Secretary's own constituency. Lest he might be accused of favouritism, let me say that the remainder will be spent in the neighbouring constituency of East Donegal at Greencastle.  Having regard to all we heard in the past, when Galwaymen, in succession, occupied the Parliamentary Secretary's post, I suppose it is a very natural evolution in the allocation of these moneys.</P>

      <P>I want now to deal with a specific instance.  As far back as February, 1957, through the combined efforts of Fisheries and the Department of Finance sanction was given, through the Board of Works, for the erection of a slip at Blacksod in County Mayo in the constituency of North Mayo. That slip has not yet been built.</P>

      <P>From time to time, over the past two years, I have asked questions about this.  While I addressed my questions to the Minister for Finance, they appeared on the Order Paper for answer by the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  From my own experience, and from what I have heard the Minister say himself in that particular area in relation to piers and harbours and kindred subjects, I am somewhat puzzled at the metamorphosis that takes place.  I have heard the Minister state that he has no function whatsoever either in the allocation of money or in the sanctioning of anything; all he can do is urge and recommend, and consider things for recommendation, and such like pious aspirations.  Why then, when a question is put down in relation to these matters to the Minister for Finance, does it appear on the Order Paper for answer by the Minister for the Gaeltacht, who, when talking to the people in the Gaeltacht, carefully avoids any responsibility for these matters?</P>
      <P>So far as public works and buildings are concerned, we shall have in my constituency one very clear-cut programme, namely, the erection of an employment exchange at Achill Sound. That is in the heart of an area&mdash;I referred to this last week in the Budget debate&mdash;in which 143 families have closed their homes and gone to England, Scotland, or America within the past three years.  What then is the purpose of this employment exchange? Is it an acceptance that those remaining families will in the future be still dependent upon unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is getting away from the Estimate. The Parliamentary Secretary has no responsibility for a decision to erect an employment exchange in any <Col N="1297" /> part of the country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall have it on another Estimate then, and on any other relevant Estimate.  Mention has been made of arterial drainage.  I notice Government speakers have abandoned the term used in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech&mdash;intermediate rivers&mdash;and are resolutely referring to such rivers as &ldquo;minor rivers&rdquo;.  I do not know whether there is anything deliberate in that or whether it is designed to enable it to be said hereafter that this intermediate river project envisaged in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech is something that can be substituted on platforms for the Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes.  I do not think that is what the Parliamentary Secretary meant and I should not like it to be understood otherwise than in the manner in which he meant it and what it actually means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had Deputy P.J. Burke talking about the provision of work by the Office of Public Works.  The Office of Public Works does its best having regard to the money provided for it to allocate to the various places.  Mention has been made of the sales of property by the Board of Works.  I know of recent sales and I hasten to exonerate the Commissioners or any officials there from negligence in this regard or any partisanship.  It is a matter, on the other hand, for which the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister must be fully responsible.  I know of an instance where a certain piece of machinery was purchased for £500 and, within two days, sold by the fortunate purchasers for £1,750, a profit of 250 per cent.  All that was due to two things: one, that the advertising was inadequate, and the other, <Col N="1298" /> that the preliminary work of salesmanship prior to the actual sale itself was far from the realm of competence. However, it is the people's money and if that is the way it is to be used, I suppose the people themselves will have to answer for it at some time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch referred to item 5 on this list of works, under the heading of Department of Finance, which is entitled &ldquo;Busts and Portraits of National Leaders.&rdquo;  From this, it appears that £1,500 has been expended in the financial year ended 31st March, 1960, and a further £1,000 is necessary for the financial year 1960/61, certainly provisionally.  I want to know, and I am sure the House and the country would like to know, of what leaders these busts are, who are the subjects of the portraits, who are the people who executed either the busts or the portraits and what was the amount paid for each of these items.</P>
    <P>At a time when everybody is feeling the pinch, in whatever walk of life he may be&mdash;I think everybody knows how difficult the times are in spite of the wonderful descriptions given of them by Government speakers&mdash;it is certainly not opportune to be laying out money for such items even though, proportionately speaking, from the point of view of the Exchequer, the sum involved is very small.  Nevertheless, the people would like to know the details.  Certainly, I should like to know them and I am sure the House would like to know them, too.  Beyond that, there is very little scope for further discussion on this matter.  In conclusion, I might say I am particularly pleased by the vast amount of work which is contemplated on buildings devoted to Agriculture, Land and Fisheries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat disheartened by what the last Fianna Fáil speaker had to say about the completion of our drainage programmes. He said that although the Office of Public Works are moving rather slowly, he felt they would complete the drainage programmes in 25 years&mdash;a quarter of a century.  A good many of us who are here to-day will be flapping our wings in the great <Col N="1299" /> hereafter within the space of the next 25 years.</P>
      <P>I am particularly interested in the drainage of the River Erne.  On quite a number of occasions, I asked the Parliamentary Secretary questions about the matter.  Each time, I was told it was under consideration.  I quite appreciate the difficulty in relation to two Governments being concerned.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to use his good offices to bring the two Governments together on this matter of vital importance.</P>
      <P>We have been told that the Northern Government have done their part up to a certain point and that, on our part, we have taken levels.  Therefore, the work should be practically ready to commence.  No major drainage scheme or indeed any drainage scheme has taken place in county Cavan.  All minor drainage and other works have been hampered by the fact that the River Erne has not been drained.  County Cavan has suffered very seriously from emigration.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to tackle the problem of the relief of flooding there as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>There are other rivers not of the same magnitude as the Erne which have been spoken of by other Deputies as, for instance, the River Boyne which was mentioned by Deputy Giles.  While the River Boyne does not flow through my constituency, its tributaries do. Time and time again engineers have visited the area.  If they had a shovel for all the times they have visited the area, not to talk of the amount of money that has been spent on engineers, there would not be much water lying around the borders of my constituency now.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary informed me some time ago that the work would be put in hands as expeditiously as possible.  I should be glad if he could give a clear indication as to when all the preliminaries necessary to advertising the scheme will be put in hands.</P>

We have made some little progress in regard to the survey of the Deale.  The engineers have done their job.  The survey has been completed. There is no point in shelving the matter.  I do not know what is happening the principal scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will give particulars of the sale of agricultural social insurance stamps during each of the latest three years for which details are available, showing the amounts for each quarter year and the total for each year.</P>

      <P>As from the 5th January, 1953, when social insurance contributions became payable under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the rate of contribution applicable to males employed in agriculture was 2/6d.  The corresponding rate for females was 2/- but this rate also applied to females employed in private domestic service and to persons of either sex employed in sharefishing or as outworkers.  These rates were increased to 3/2d. and 2/6d., respectively, as from 3rd September, 1956.</P>
      <P>Owing to these complications, as already explained in replies given on 5th May, 1960, and 20th May, 1958, to previous questions on the same subject, the number of stamps sold at any time since the 5th January, 1953, in respect of the employment of females in agriculture cannot be stated.  As regards stamps sold in respect of males employed in agriculture, the particulars for the latest three years for which details are available are those given on 5th May, 1960, in reply to Deputy Desmond's previous question.</P>
