      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any decision has yet been reached by the Government as to Ireland's membership of the European Common Market or the European Free Trade Association, or its associateship with either group; and, if not, if he will indicate approximately when a decision on the matter will be taken.</P>

      <P>There is nothing which I could usefully add to my reply to a question addressed to me in this House on 21st June.  I stated then that the Dáil would be kept informed of all major developments in the field of trade.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible, at this stage, to attempt to forecast when circumstances may make it advisable for us to take decisions in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say, in pursuance of his promise to keep the Dáil informed, what steps he would take in that connection if events necessitated or rendered desirable some association with or membership of either of those two groups while the Dáil is in recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance I think that is highly unlikely but if circumstances should arise which required taking a decision&mdash;which as I pointed out could not be implemented without the consent of the <Col N="992" /> Dáil&mdash;then a special meeting of the Dáil would certainly be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach does not anticipate the event will necessitate that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 31 of the Minerals Development Act, 1940, confers on persons entitled to work State-owned minerals the right to enter on the lands under which the minerals lie and use such lands in such manner <Col N="993" /> as may be reasonably necessary for the working of the minerals subject to the payment of compensation for damage caused to the surface of the land.</P>
      <P>Under the Minerals Development Acts, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, compulsorily acquire, either permanently or temporarily, land or ancillary rights where he is of the opinion that such is necessary for the efficient and convenient exploitation of any State minerals and he may grant to the holder of a State mining lease a permit to use any land or ancillary right so acquired.  It is provided that the Minister shall be liable to pay compensation where he exercises his power of acquisition.</P>
      <P>Any person entitled to work privately owned minerals may apply to the Minister for an ancillary rights licence in respect of the working of the said minerals.  Such applications may be referred by the Minister to the Mining Board and any person having an interest is entitled to be heard by the Mining Board.  A licence may not be granted by the Minister, however, unless it is not reasonably practicable for the applicant to obtain by private arrangement the ancillary right in question.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to provide as a condition of the grant of an ancillary rights licence in relation to opencast mining that the surface of the land be restored to its former condition except in cases where such a course would not be practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <P>It did and I furnished particulars to the Minister's Department and it was afterwards adjusted. Would the Minister consider investigating circumstances of that kind?

    <P>Electors in urban areas and towns can vote at both the county council and the urban or town election.  Each such vote is counted in these figures.</P>
    <P>* Figures for towns are not available for 1934 or 1942.  The figures given for those years are therefore based on returns from local authorities other than town commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether in view of the widespread misunderstanding by local government electors as to whether they are entitled to vote when they do not receive cards indicating their place of voting and number on the election register, such as they receive in Dáil <Col N="996" /> elections, he will arrange that in future such electors will receive notification from the returning officers of their place of voting and number on the register.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>Such returns as have so far been received in my Department from local authorities indicate that, while the poll at the recent local elections was lower in some areas than the poll at previous elections, it could not be described as &ldquo;extremely low&rdquo; generally.  When all the figures sought by the Deputy have been received I will have them sent to him.</P>
      <P>Legislation would be necessary to enable polling cards to be issued to voters at local elections.  Proposals for the amendment of the law relating to such elections will be considered in the light of the recommendations which the Joint Committee on Electoral Law make for the amendment of the law relating to Dáil elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, and with particular reference to No. 8, would the Minister bear in mind that the practice of religion and the discharge of one's public duties as a citizen are closely related virtues and would he not think that elections should be held on Sundays so that those discharging their religious duties could afterwards turn into the local school, which is usually adjacent to the church, and discharge their obligation as citizens as well? That procedure would result in a much greater return of votes than having elections haphazard as they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate has already been discussed fairly fully by the House and there are just a few matters with which I want to deal. Certain speakers have already dealt with three principal aspects of the Estimate&mdash;the question of housing, <Col N="1000" /> the question of the Minister's responsibility and the proposals which he has circulated in relation to road traffic, and the matter, raised by Deputy Norton in his question to the Minister today, of the deplorably low poll, as I would regard it, in the recent local elections.</P>
      <P>So far as housing is concerned, I want to say, and any Deputy on this side of the House is entitled to say, that we are justified in accusing the present Government of having failed dismally.  We are entitled to measure up the Government's performance in house building, and particularly in local authority house building, against the campaign carried on by the present Government when they occupied these benches prior to the 1957 general election. I want to refer to this matter simply for the purpose of pointing out to the Minister, and in particular to Deputy Noel Lemass, that it is not good enough, after the Government have been three years in office, to endeavour to escape responsibility for the situation regarding housing over the last few years by the type of excuse put up by Deputy Lemass yesterday evening when he said that the previous Government had been responsible for slowing things down and that it took time to get things going again.  That kind of excuse might be all right and might sell itself to the public for six months or 12 months but it is not good enough over a three or four year span.</P>
      <P>The housing figures issued by the Minister in reply to Parliamentary Questions over the last few months do show that since the present Government came into office there has been a disastrous fall in the erection of houses both by local authorities and by private concerns.  As I say, we are entitled to view that within the framework of the sustained campaign carried on by Fianna Fáil spokesmen, Fianna Fáil Deputies and others, prior to the last General Election and carried on in a particularly active way by members of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House prior to the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to substantiate what I am saying by referring to some quotations <Col N="1001" /> from Fianna Fáil sources.  I have here a few quotations.  I shall not weary the House unduly with them.  Fianna Fáil used to publish a pamphlet called <i>Gléas</i> which is in the nature of organisational directions to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not know whether they still do so or not.  For a period of a number of months they used to send me a complimentary copy of <i>Gléas.</i>  Since I commenced quoting <i>Gléas</i> in the House they have discontinued sending me the complimentary copy so that I am not in a position to say whether it is still published and in circulation amongst the Deputies opposite or not.</P>
    <P>However, I have a copy of <i>Gléas</i> for May, 1955 when the Fianna Fáil Party occupied these Benches.  On page 2 of that issue there is a heading: &ldquo;Plan for Housing&rdquo;.  I shall quote the first two paragraphs.  They are not too long.  Under the heading, &ldquo;Plan for Housing&rdquo; we are told:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil intends to pursue to completion the housing programme initiated by it in 1932 with the same vigour as in the past so that the national housing needs will be met in the shortest possible time.  Fianna Fáil believes that private individuals should be given every encouragement to build their own homes or to have them built for them and to enable them to do this they should be given all the help and facilities they may reasonably need.</P>
    <P>Where houses are built by public authorities Fianna Fáil will encourage tenant purchase schemes.</P>
    <P>There, in May, 1955, before the campaign to which I have referred had gained impetus, Fianna Fáil were at least declaring their own policy in relation to housing and their belief that private individuals should be given every encouragement to build their own homes.</P>
    <P>Little over a year later, in June, 1956, <i>Gléas</i> was circulated again and this time, on page 2, they also dealt with the question of housing and they came out with banner headlines: &ldquo;Building Trade Faces Disaster&rdquo;.  The article had this to say:</P>
    <P>Of all the imcompetent bungling which has been perpetrated by the <Col N="1002" /> Coalition Government during the past two years perhaps the most glaring example is the housing position, particularly in Dublin city.  In spite of all the building which has taken place in Dublin since Fianna Fáil initiated the housing drive, many thousands still live in appalling conditions.  Whole families often have to exist in one small room. To do away with these slum conditions 15,000 new buildings are still required.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bear that figure in mind.  In June, 1956, when Fianna Fáil were occupying these Benches, they were prepared to state that 15,000 new dwellings were required in the city of Dublin.  There was then none of the talk that we heard subsequently of the need for local authority housing tapering off.  That was their figure in June, 1956.</P>
    <P>A General Election took place in the year 1957 and Fianna Fáil published their usual propaganda sheet in connection with it.  This one dealt with such questions as unemployment, cost of living and also the question of housing.  Under the heading of &ldquo;Homes for Irishmen&rdquo;, they told us:&mdash;</P>
    <P>One of the most serious problems facing the new Fianna Fáil Government will be the question of the building industry which has been thrown into a state of chaos.</P>
    <P>Later in this article they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It will be a first task of Fianna Fáil to see that life and vigour are restored to the building trade and that small dwellings loans once again become available for house purchase.</P>
    <P>As a result of that and other propaganda efforts by Fianna Fáil before and during the course of the general election they find themselves in a position where they occupy the Government Benches today and they have the present Minister in charge of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Approximately nine months after they took over they were faced with a by-election in the north side of Dublin city.  Speaking from recollection, it was the by-election which returned <Col N="1003" /> Deputy Sherwin to the House. Fianna Fáil issued their usual propaganda in connection with that by-election. They were still in a position where they thought themselves able to blame their predecessors for anything that might be wanting in regard to housing.  They published their pamphlet in support of the Fianna Fáil candidate in that by-election, dealing again in part with the question of housing.  We were told in that pamphlet, under the heading: &ldquo;We Are Going Ahead with Housing&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In Dublin city the number of dwellings in tender on April 1st last was only 222 compared with 815 a year earlier.  Private house building was in no better position due to the collapse of the small dwellings loans scheme during 1956. The number of grant houses under consideration fell by almost 2,000. Action has now been taken to deal with this position.</P>
    <P>This was in November, 1957.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>During the year the Fianna Fáil Government is providing sufficient money to initiate at successive stages the whole of the housing schemes which were held up.  As well as some schemes at present maturing, a small dwellings loans scheme has been started again.  As a result of this Government action there have in recent months been signs of improvement in the housing situation.</P>
    <P>It takes time to bring new housing schemes to the point where work actually begins.  Plans must be prepared, sites acquired and tenders sought.  New schemes are now being prepared which will come to fruition in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>We are still talking in terms of November 1957, and Fianna Fáil, facing the electorate on the north side of this city, told them that new schemes were being prepared which would come to fruition in the months ahead.  They finished this article by saying:</P>
    <P>As construction work gets under way on these new schemes the building trade may expect some relief <Col N="1004" /> from the very heavy unemployment problem which arose last year.</P>
    <P>I have referred to these quotations for the purpose of substantiating my statement that prior to and during the last general election there was a very active and vigorous campaign fought against the last Government on the question of housing.  The leadership of that campaign so far as the city of Dublin is concerned can undoubtedly be claimed by Deputy Briscoe.  That campaign had its effects in Dublin and elsewhere.  When Fianna Fáil got back to office in 1957 they claimed that, whatever about the past, whatever about what they chose to describe as the bungling of the inter-Party Government that preceded them, now that they were back in office they had plans, that they were implementing those plans and in the months that lay ahead there was going to be a significant change in regard to housing in the city of Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>What is the result after three years of Fianna Fáil effort?  Are Deputy Briscoe and any other Deputies in that Party, particularly those who campaigned so actively against the last Government and the predecessor of the present Minister for Local Government, happy about the results which have been achieved by them and their Government?  Are any of them happy in the knowledge that they got into this House with a majority over every other Party, that they got themselves put into the position by the electorate where no Party or groupings of Parties in this House could even halt any of the plans or schemes they wanted to operate?  What plans or schemes have they operated in regard to housing?</P>
    <P>On the 22nd March last Deputy Norton asked the Minister for Local Government to state the average number of houses under construction by the Dublin Corporation and by all other local authorities for each of the half years July to December, 1956 to 1959 and the average number of persons employed on such housing schemes.  In view of the campaign by the Deputies opposite and in view of the propaganda in the North Dublin by-election to which I have referred, <Col N="1005" /> if any of them expected that there would be anything to cheer about in the Minister's reply they were certainly in for a very great disappointment.</P>
    <P>The reply given by the Minister for Local Government on the 22nd March last showed that the average number of houses under construction by the Dublin Corporation during the half year, July to December, 1956, was 2,159&mdash;1956, the black year according to Fianna Fáil, the year they felt themselves entitled to thump the table on this side of the House and to scoff and jeer at the previous Government because of their record in connection with housing.  In the next half year, July to December, 1957, there were 828 houses under construction by the Dublin Corporation; in July to December, 1958, after Fianna Fáil had been there sufficiently long to implement the plans and the schemes of which they spoke in their propaganda during the North Dublin by-election campaign in 1957, there had been a drop down to 518 houses under construction by the Dublin Corporation.  In July to December, 1959, when Fianna Fáil had been there for a further twelve months, when they had been in an unchallengeable position in this House with the voting strength to implement any plans they liked, what was the result?  A further drop to the miserable total of 392 houses under construction by the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The numbers in employment on corporation houses in this city fell accordingly and, for the four half years in question, the figures dropped from 1,883 in 1956 to 970 in 1957, to 569 in 1958 and to 482 in 1959.  Was the picture any better for areas other than that under the jurisdiction of the Dublin Corporation?  The picture is exactly the same: a drop from 3,584 houses under construction in the period July to December, 1956, to 1,843 in 1957 and a further reduction to 1,678 in 1958 and a still further reduction to 1,381 in 1959.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to weary the House any longer in relation to this question of housing, but it is time, and it is due to the House, that the Minister, Deputy Briscoe and any others who took part in that campaign some years <Col N="1006" /> ago should apologise to the House and to the people for their own miserable failure in relation to housing.  I could give figures&mdash;but I do not think it is necessary&mdash;showing the drop in the amount of money put forward by the Government to support housing schemes by local authorities and others over the last few years which is in contradiction to the hopes for encouraging private individuals to build their own houses which were expressed in the quotations to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I hope, and I think I can speak for other Deputies on this side of the House, that sooner or later the question of house building either by private individuals or local authorities will be taken out and will stay out of the realm of controversial politics That can be done&mdash;and I think I can safely give this undertaking on behalf of Deputies on this side of the House &mdash;as soon as we get a full and frank apology from the Minister and those behind him for the campaign they indulged in some years ago and an acknowledgment of their failure in relation to housing.</P>
    <P>References have been made to the low poll in the recent municipal elections. I was surprised to hear the Minister in reply to a Parliamentary Question today saying that the vote could not be described as extremely low generally.  I beg to disagree with him there.  It may be that in relation to voting at other local elections the drop was not as much in some areas as in others.  The fact that voting in previous local elections was low does not hold out any encouragement because there was an equally low poll in the most recent elections.</P>
    <P>I regard the poll in the recent local elections as extremely low and deplorably so.  I want to express the hope that the low poll is not to be taken as an indication by some 60 per cent. or 70 per cent. of the electorate that they believe that local councils are not serving any useful purpose and that, as far as they are concerned, they regard local authorities and local council representation as being redundant and consequently open to possible abolition.  Every Deputy <Col N="1007" /> should, I think, take stock of the position.</P>
    <P>Various reasons have been given to account for the low poll.  One of the reasons&mdash;I believe there is a good deal of weight in it&mdash;is that in local elections, unlike Parliamentary elections, the electorate have not the advantage of receiving voting cards from the returning officer notifying them of their number and where they should vote.  I believe that plays its part in the low polls in local elections, but I do not believe that it is the whole story.</P>
    <P>Another explanation, or part explanation, which, again, I believe is true and does have an effect, is the fact that in local elections as distinct from general elections there is not the same degree of all-over publicity.  There is not the same national publicity with a consequent stirring up of interest.  I believe that has a fairly significant effect on the lowness of the poll in local elections.</P>
    <P>I have heard&mdash;I believe every Deputy has heard&mdash;the lowness of the poll blamed on the fact that political Parties and Party politicians take part in local elections.  I hold a view on that.  It is one I have expressed in this House before.  I think I expressed it for the first time when I spoke on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government some twelve years back. It is a purely personal view.  I should prefer to see local councils constituted in such a way that no member of the Dáil could be a member of them. However, I am sufficient of a realist to recognise the fact that one cannot turn back the hands of the clock.  We are not very likely to see that situation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Taoiseach has expressed the view that it is proper for political Parties to take part in local affairs and to have their representation on local councils.  I believe there are a great number of people who accept that view and believe it is the right view.  Personally, I think it is unsound basically.  As I recollect, the Taoiseach when he was giving expression to that view justified it on <Col N="1008" /> the basis that Government policy is implemented through local authorities and it is, therefore, right that a national Party with a national policy should seek to put itself in a position in which its policies will be implemented through local bodies.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I believe that view is basically unsound even though it is endorsed by practice not only here but in Great Britain and on the Continent of Europe.  It seems to me to be tantamount to saying that because the Government have a policy in relation to health services, for example, because, indeed, the Minister for Health is waging a political war with the Irish Medical Association, it would be proper for the Fianna Fáil Party to endeavour to infiltrate into the Irish Medical Association, to fill key positions there for the purpose of furthering the Minister's policy.</P>
    <P>I think one argument is pretty much the same as the other.  I do not believe it would be proper for Fianna Fáil to do that.  I do not believe they would regard it as proper for them to do that. That, I think, is the fallacy in the Taoiseach's argument.  However, as I have said, one cannot put the hands of the clock back.  Political Parties in this country, and in others, play their part in local elections.  To those who blame that fact for lack of interest on the part of the electorate in local authorities it is true to say that, but for the fact that political Parties and independent politicians have played their part on local bodies and presented themselves as candidates in local elections, the vote would be a very miserable one indeed.  If it is as low as 25 per cent., 30 per cent., or 35 per cent. with the efforts of the political Parties thrown in, what would it be if the political Parties were to hold aloof and play no part at all in these elections?</P>
    <P>I believe one of the reasons&mdash;I think possibly the main reason&mdash;for the low poll and the lack of interest in local elections is that, by and large, the ratepayers feel that everyone overlooks the fact that it is they who foot the bill.  With the extension of full suffrage some twenty or twenty-five <Col N="1009" /> years ago to local elections I believe the heavier ratepayers feel their voice in civic administration has practically gone, and they have lost confidence in the ability of local authorities to do anything effective in relation to rates.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Sweetman yesterday, and I should like to support his plea, urge the necessity for bringing home to the people the power and the authority that local councils have.  It is essential that the people should know that they are not wasting their time when they send people on to local authorities; that there is a definite job of work to be done by the representatives they send there; and that it is no credit to them, and certainly no compliment to the members of local authorities, if they just do not bother voting at local elections.</P>
    <P>It is my experience in Dublin&mdash;I do not pretend to know the position in the rural areas&mdash;that the people who are most likely to remain away from the polls in local elections are those who are the heaviest ratepayers.  My impression is that it is those who pay least rates, or none at all, who vote and discharge their duties properly in local elections and it is their votes which, in fact, elect the various local authorities.</P>
    <P>Whatever the reasons may be, Deputies must take stock of the fact that people are less interested now in local authorities.  The explanation may very well lie, as was suggested by Deputy Dillon yesterday, in the fact that people have come to believe that local authorities have no power, no adequate power, and that consequently there is not much to be gained in taking part in local elections.  In this connection I would ask the Minister to examine closely the figures for voting in local elections over the years and to do whatever he can, either on the lines suggested by Questions to him today, or otherwise, to stir up more interest in these elections and endeavour to get people to realise that the local authorities form a very definite part of our democratic machinery.</P>
    <P>As a person who is not a member of a local authority but who has been a member, I can say without any personal <Col N="1010" /> embarrassment that it is right people should know that members of local authorities do a very great deal of work and get very little thanks for it.  Those who work on the Dublin Corporation get nothing by way of expenses or anything else, and they voluntarily give a very great deal of their time in carrying out the administration of the city.  I believe there is a great deal of uninformed criticism of members of local authorities and that if there were better recognition of the work done by them people might take a greater interest in local elections.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I wish to refer, and I shall be brief, is the question of road traffic.  This Party thought it proper to respond to the general invitation issued by the Minister to submit views on the White Paper for road traffic legislation which he circulated.  By doing that we marked our desire, first to see that this question and the necessity for steps being taken adequately to deal with it, would be removed from any association with Party politics.  Had we so wished we could have sought an opportunity to discuss the Minister's White Paper in detail in this House but we thought it better to record, as we have done, our desire that this question should be considered as one of urgency and about which there should be little or no controversy, if controversy can be avoided.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to do anything more today than urge the Minister, as have other speakers, to introduce his proposals as quickly as possible so that the new code may come into operation fairly quickly.  It is urgently needed and there is no one on this side of the House who will stand in the Minister's way if he will only get moving.  I am disappointed that it has taken so long for him and his colleagues to get moving on this question.</P>

I would ask him <Col N="1011" /> to go ahead with that work without delay.  Various suggestions have been made to the Minister in the course of this debate regarding road traffic, the use of the roads, and road signs.  I do not want to repeat those suggestions but I would ask him to give very careful consideration to them, particularly to the question of distracting road signs which are to be seen along a number of main roads and which, to my mind, very often constitute a danger.</P>

The Finance Committee is concerned with the financing of the housing programme and the Housing Committee is concerned with the actual building of the houses and all that goes with it.  We have Fine Gael Deputies coming in here and talking about the operations of Dublin Corporation in these respects as if they had any knowledge whatever about it when their own members do not attend the committee meetings to deal with it.  It is all very fine to come in here, criticise and get reports in the papers; but the solid hard work is another thing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin is chairman of the Housing Committee and has been for a great number of years.  When we were in opposition and were finding fault with the then Coalition Government, although Deputy Larkin was a member of the group that kept the Coalition in office, he was man enough to get up in this House and agree with what I had stated was happening in the city of Dublin.  He did not repudiate me.  Yet, you have Deputy Dillon, Deputy Sweetman, Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy O'Higgins coming in here and doing the naive gentlemen.  They want us to apologise. For what?  In 1932 there were in the city of Dublin, living in single rooms, 18,000 families with as many as 14 to a family; and the previous Cumann na nGaedheal Government, having been in office for ten years, had not begun to deal with that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not expecting the Opposition to give us an explanation of their reasons for failure or otherwise.  I am just trying to recite facts.  Whatever the cause, this nation was faced with that situation as far as the city of Dublin was concerned. The new Housing Act resulted immediately from the change of Government, and the problem was tackled in an aggressive way.  We heard a lot of talk about 1956 and 1957.  I was chairman of the Finance Committee of Dublin Corporation and Deputy Larkin was chairman of the Housing Committee.  We found ourselves in that period without any possibility, from the point of view of <Col N="1016" /> financial means, of proceeding with the programme that had been developed since 1932 and had been continued consistently since that period.</P>
      <P>Remember, Sir, there was a change of Government in 1948.  In 1948 the then Minister for Local Government, the late Deputy Murphy, was not satisfied with the speed with which housing was tackled, particularly with regard to the small dwelling loans where a person could apply and purchase his own house under a tenant purchase scheme.  He introduced an amendment to the housing legislation to make it possible that this scheme could be availed of with greater ease by those seeking to purchase their own houses.  We have no fault to find with the approach of the 1948-51 Coalition Government in that regard. They themselves were so optimistic about the results that they issued advertisements to all the emigrants to come home from England and to be ready to participate in the expected tremendous building programme.</P>
      <P>The housing problem reached a very sad situation in 1956.  I do not know whether people know the practical side applying to what is called building, as a local authority engages in it. First, you have to know that money is available, and to what extent it is available.  On the basis of that, you then acquire land on which you are going to build.  Having acquired land, for which you have to pay, you then begin site development.  When the site development is finished, you then seek contractors to come along and tender for the building of schemes of houses in any number from 100 up to, maybe, 400 or 500.  That all takes time.</P>
      <P>When I heard Deputy O'Higgins speak I immediately concluded he was of the opinion houses could be produced somewhat on the style and scale that Deputy Dillon, when he was Minister for Agriculture, believed he could produce eggs and bacon&mdash;that he could drown the British with eggs and smother them with bacon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just saying that Deputy O'Higgins believes that houses could be produced in the same way Deputy Dillon believed eggs and bacon could be produced.  But it takes time.  Deputy Lynch ought to know from his own personal knowledge of that side of life that you cannot acquire a piece of land, develop the site and build on it all in 24 hours.</P>

      <P>When we came into office in 1957 we found what we had stated was, in fact, the situation.  We in the Dublin Corporation in 1956 were not able to proceed with any further acquisition of sites because we could not make the commitment without being assured that if we made the contract to purchase and build, the money would be available.  At the same time, we had been advocating the extensive use of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts and we had agreed to loans for a certain number of houses, the purchase price of which to the contractors at that time had reached £800,000.</P>
      <P>We had no money and we could not get money from the Government.  We therefore had to say frankly to the public: &ldquo;We cannot accept any more applications for these loans because we have not got the money.&rdquo;  A hurried conference was called by the members of the then Cabinet and representatives of the Dublin Corporation.  I was one of those present on the Corporation's side.  Deputy O'Donnell, then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Sweetman, the Minister for Finance, and the then Taoiseach represented the Government.  Deputy Larkin, Chairman of the Housing Committee, the City Manager and one or two others represented the Corporation.  We discussed the whole matter and we came away with one million pounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We had sufficient to pay the £800,000 that we owed and £200,000 for further building.  That was <Col N="1018" /> the extent of our building programme under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  Then there was consternation in the building trade.  The builders, who had themselves acquired land on which to build, realised they could not go ahead because if they built houses and got customers the customers could not get loans because there was not any money there.  At the time, money was very scarce for some reason or another. It could not be got and the Minister for Local Government gave a promise in this House&mdash;some Deputies will remember it&mdash;that he would get the building societies to finance all the building necessary for rehousing under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.</P>
      <P>Not one penny was forthcoming for this purpose from the building societies except at exorbitant rates of interest, far beyond the capacity of the proposed borrowers to pay.  So, by the time the change of Government came about, there had been a complete standstill in building operations as far as this type of house was concerned.  I do not know whether the Coalition Government members remember that at the change of Government in 1957, within at least one or two weeks of the takeover by this Government, Deputy Smith, the Minister for Local Government, had to pay £800,000 to the local authorities for money which was overdue to them.  These are facts and yet Deputy Michael O'Higgins wants us to believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the building position, since the change of Government there has been a change of approach.  There is now money available up to any amount that we in the Dublin Corporation may require under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  There is no doubt about that.  In fact, if one looks at the trend <Col N="1020" /> one will see there is a steady rise in the receipt of applications every month in the area of jurisdiction of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>In regard to this matter of house building, one has got to understand a certain amount of history and geography. In order to provide housing accommodation for those who lived in slums, we had to remove them from the slums, and the places of their resettlement had to be newly built houses within the perimeter of Dublin.  All that had to be done within a period of years until we had the slums cleared.</P>
      <P>Now we have sixty odd sites on which to build flats and we have, within the last few years, begun the building of flats in the central parts of the city.  Anyone who knows anything about building will understand that the erection of flats is quite a different operation from the building of small houses such as have been developed in recent years.  There seems to be a lack of willingness on the part of our political opponents to go around the city of Dublin and see Crumlin, Drimnagh, Finglas, Ballyfermot or the other areas of what one might call new towns built up as a result of Fianna Fáil's housing policy on the basis of courage and realisation of the needs of the people.</P>
      <P>There is nowadays much talk about the housing development situation.  We in Dublin Corporation believe that we shall have met our requirements in full, other than natural growth, within the next five years.  We are now concentrating more on flats than on houses in the outside areas and we are quite satisfied that there is no undue holdup now on the part of the Government.  The Minister quite correctly adjudicates on our schemes: he sees whether they are within what he calls the rights and confines of Government policy and sees, with regard to flat-building, that we are not unduly squandering&mdash;if you like&mdash;by building too-lavish types of dwellings.  On the whole, we are moving satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if any member of the Opposition has ever taken the trouble to examine what has been done in terms of £. s. d.  The total debt of Dublin <Col N="1021" /> Corporation is nearly £44,000,000 and 90 per cent. of that is due to housing. Do they appreciate what that means, what the interest charges on such loans mean?  Do they further appreciate what it means to have those loans subsidised as they are by the State by two-thirds of the interest charges where it concerns development by the removal of slums and one-third of the interest charges for ordinary development, apart from Government grants towards each dwelling?</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party, who are taking the full responsibility of objecting to what has been said about them in 1956 and 1957, must surely recognise that they were at fault.  They were not able to provide the finance necessary for a continuance of the housing policy at the rate at which it had been developed over the previous years prior to their advent in 1954.  When this business was collapsing, or was about to collapse finally in 1956 and 1957, did they believe that with the return of Fianna Fáil to office everything could be put back on the rails with the same speed as was customary before disaster overtook the city?  Naturally, we had stopped acquiring land but since 1957 we are again acquiring land; we are back at work on site development and we are building a certain number of houses.  We are making rapid progress now to make use finally of the 62 sites that we have, some of which are now vacant and some of which will have to be demolished.</P>
    <P>As far as housing is concerned nobody can find fault.  There is new hope in the private builder.  There are some 6,000 sites available in Dublin on which small dwellings can be built.  The grants are available.  We actually raised the income level of the people who qualify for the purpose of those borrowings.  We did not alter the percentage that had been given by the local authorities by way of loan and that had been increased by the late Deputy Murphy when he was Minister for Local Government.  As far as that is concerned, we have no complaints but I should like to ask the Minister about one matter.  We are seeking certain legislation to enable us to undertake certain other operations immediately. <Col N="1022" /> I know the Minister has hopes of introducing this legislation shortly and I would ask him to try to ensure that it be introduced this session.  It is not contentious and it will enable Dublin Corporation to add to its housing operations this other work which we have in mind.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that I would not have intervened in this debate if it were not for the fact that out of courtesy it is necessary for an individual to stand up and express his appreciation of a high commendation when he gets one such as I got from the Opposition in the accusations they made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with Deputy Briscoe on one matter&mdash;the short statement he made when he said that there was a new approach to housing when the present Government came into office.  I appreciate that and agree with him.  That approach was a big change from that of the previous Government as will be appreciated when we find that after the present Government has been three years in office the number of men employed on local authority housing has been reduced from 5,200 in 1956 to 1,700 last year.  That is a new approach to housing, a definite close-down in housing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe, for the last quarter of an hour or so, spoke of 1931.  He did not go back any farther but mentioned the various years up to 1956 and 1957.  When a Deputy has nothing to say in support of his own Minister it is as well for him to go back and rehash what happened in 1931 and 1932.  If he had anything else to say, why did he not come to 1960, 1961 or 1962?  When a Deputy knows that he has no case to make and his Minister has fallen down on housing, he comes along to rehash the various phases of history but the proof of the matter is that the number employed in local authority housing in 1956 was 5,200 and has fallen to 1,700.  It proves that they closed down on housing as far as it was possible to do so; they could not close down completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must smile when I hear Deputy Briscoe speak about Dublin.  He went <Col N="1023" /> into great detail and almost brought us to a meeting of the Housing Committee and afterwards to a meeting of the Finance Committee.  He described how they first must get the site, then get the money, then the plans and all the other various moves.  I should like to tell Deputy Briscoe that in 1957 when the present Government came into office, we had plans, we had a site and we had it developed and the present Government said: &ldquo;No, you will not build houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not like to repeat this because I have said it on every platform during the by-election in Kilkenny.  I have said what I have thought about the present Government and their housing programme.  The people of Kilkenny have told the present Government what they think of its housing programme by giving it the greatest setback ever received by any Government in office in this country.  We had our housing site developed with water, sewerage, roads and everything laid on.  We had sanction from the previous Minister for 68 houses and when the present Minister came in he was told to shut down on housing.  He came to Kilkenny and said: &ldquo;No, you cannot have 68 houses; you will have 30.&rdquo;  Just as Deputy Briscoe is a member of Dublin Corporation, I am a member of Kilkenny Corporation and we had deputations or meetings at which we put our point of view.  We told the Minister that is was most important even from an unemployment point of view that we should continue our housing programme. The Minister said: &ldquo;Do not put up a case about unemployment to me.  That has no bearing on housing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is difficult to imagine any Minister in an Irish Government saying that unemployment has no bearing on his Department or on the Government.  It is no wonder that the Government has lost the confidence of the people when the Minister for Local Government says that he has no thought for the unemployed man, no desire to tide a man over the winter months until he can get work in the following spring. Then we have Deputy Briscoe coming along to talk about a new approach. We can imagine it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> To cap it all, what has happened since?  Due to the unfortunate death of another Deputy, a colleague of mine, we had a by-election in Kilkenny. But when the by-election was proceeding and they wanted to get the votes they gave the remainder of the 38 houses.  Was that a trick to buy votes in Carlow-Kilkenny?  They knew they could not get them otherwise, and in the last fortnight of that by-election we have them offering the houses in order to get the votes.  The people of Carlow-Kilkenny replied to the Minister on that occasion in no uncertain manner.  I shall finish with that matter now but I thought it right to put it on the records of the House.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the question of county roads in a different mood and I would ask the Minister, the Government and the officials of the Department to look into the matter of the grants for county roads.  In Kilkenny, after the emergency, some people thought that we had got behind with the work on our county roads and we struck a special rate of 2/- in the £ to assist in the improvement of these roads.  That rate has been struck every year since with the result that we have got our county roads into a very good condition.  They are second to none in the country but that means that much more has to be spent in tar spraying.</P>
    <P>At the present time we are spending £47,000 on far spraying and £61,000 on ordinary repairs to the county roads.  That makes a total of £108,000. We get grants from the Government of £82,000 for the improvement of our county roads but those grants are for improvement only.  I would appeal to the Minister and to the Government to look into this matter.  We have gone further ahead than most other counties and that fact makes for a much greater expenditure on tar spraying.  We have to do it every three years.  I would ask the Minister to allow us to transfer some of that grant for road improvements to the tar spraying work.  We have good roads now and it is purely a matter of maintaining them in their present condition.</P>
    <P>We find it a great burden to provide the money for tar spraying the roads <Col N="1025" /> and we find it hard to decide how we are going to spend the £82,000 granted to us for improving the county roads. Many counties which have not got as far ahead as we have got with our county roads require the grant for improvement but they do not require such a large amount of money as we do for the maintenance of the roads. I would appeal to the Minister to consider sympathetically the switching of some of this money from the improvement of county roads to tar spraying. I think that is most essential, more especially in counties which are far advanced with their county roads.  It it not because some counties are backward that we should be held up until they get to our standard.  That is principally the matter that brought me to my feet here to-night.</P>
    <P>There is another item I should like to bring to the Minister's attention&mdash; his failure to reply to letters sent to him recently by Kilkenny Corporation. There was an increase of 2/- in the rent of each local authority house in Kilkenny recently.  It was imposed by the county manager, no doubt at the direction of the Minister and his officials.  The county manager does not do these things of his own accord and I am sure that he was instructed by the Department to review the rents of local authority houses.  It has happened not alone in Kilkenny but in every other county.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny Corporation has invoked Section 4 of the County Management Act and has asked the Minister to give a decision as to whether he is prepared to take the line of the Corporation, which is to have no increase, or the line of the county manager which is to have an increase of 2/- per week.  The Minister has not replied to that letter and it is quite a considerable time since it was sent to him.  I myself have been present at meetings of the corporation when it was decided to send a telegram to him asking for his decision.  He gave his decision as regards the 38 houses quickly enough when he was concerned with the votes of the people.  I am not going to forecast his decision, but I am drawing attention to the fact that he has been slow in giving it.  Kilkenny Corporation <Col N="1026" /> is a fine body and the members have done their work well.  It is not because I am a member of it that I am saying that, but I think that, in all courtesy to the members, the Minister should give them his decision.</P>
    <P>I should like to make another appeal to the Minister in connection with housing.  In Kilkenny we are nearing the end of our housing programme, but we have a big problem in cases where a son or daughter marries and goes to live with parents in a corporation house.  According to the present rules and regulations, that cuts them out from getting a corporation house for themselves with the full two-thirds subsidy.  Could a father or mother turn out a son or daughter when they are getting married?  In five or six years' time the accommodation in these small houses becomes very limited owing to the natural increase in family so that, at the present time, we have cases of 12 and 14 people living in one small house.  I think the Minister could deal with this matter under Section 6 of the Act which deals with overcrowding.  He should allow these people to invoke that section of the Act.  They are sons of good fathers and mothers, decent people who have always been good pays and they are entitled to get a house in their native city when they had confidence enough in the country to get married and settle down in it.</P>
    <P>There may be other areas in which there is still a scarcity of houses but in Kilkenny we have gone a long way towards completing our programme. I appeal to the Minister that these people should be allowed to use that section of the Act so that they can get houses.  Unless a son or daughter was married before 1952 and living with the parents, they are not entitled to the full two-thirds subsidy.  The Minister could facilitate these people by allowing the corporation to rehouse them on the ground of overcrowding.  I know the terrible job that these people have in trying to get houses apart altogether from the inconvenience of living with their in-laws.  They would be much happier rearing their families in their own houses.</P>
    <Col N="1027" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. S. Brady Mr. S. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few observations I should like to make before the Minister concludes.  I am very pleased that the Minister is allocating £395,000 to private persons for housing.  That is very good policy. The more people are encouraged to build and own their own houses the better.  While excellent work has been done by local authorities, we have reached the stage that some local authorities would appear to be overburdened and unable to deal with the problem as it should be dealt with.  For instance, in some areas there are people still in very urgent need of houses and there is no sign of their being granted houses.</P>
      <P>There is considerable delay in the matter of ordinary repair of these houses.  Proper maintenance is not carried out.  There are cases of leaking gutters or loose slates being neglected over a long period and causing considerable damage to the property.  I do not want to suggest that the local officials are incompetent but it would seem to me that the time has come when they are unable to deal with these matters as efficiently as is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the work being done by local authorities, I would suggest that the rates have reached such a very high figure that the greatest care must be taken to keep expenditure at as reasonable a figure as possible. Everybody realises that there is a considerable amount of waste in the manner in which local authorities carry out a number of works.  In laying new roads or footpaths the usual pattern seems to be that before the work is properly seasoned teams of men arrive to rip up the concrete to put down essential services.  I know of one case where the people of a locality were waiting for years for a proper footpath.  Eventually the footpath was laid.  Within a few weeks the local authority decided to instal a new public lighting system on the road. The spacing of the lights was completely different from the existing pattern with the result that not only were the existing standards replaced by more modern standards but cuttings had to be made for each standard <Col N="1028" /> from the edge of the road right into the railings with the result that what had been originally a very well-finished job is now a disgrace to any public authority.</P>
    <P>Very serious notice should be taken of the standard of building in housing schemes.  It is suggested that the responsibility lies with the purchaser who, if he wants to protect himself, should employ an architect to advise him.  That is asking private people to involve themselves in unnecessary expense.  The Department of Local Government and the local authority contribute by way of grants or loans to these schemes and, as they have constant inspection, considerable responsibility rests with them to see that the contractor carries out the work efficiently.  I have seen appalling cases of bad workmanship in big housing schemes.  For instance, in one case the down pipe was leading to faked drains or gullies.  After a considerable time, when the people were in occupation, it was discovered that there was in fact no drain to take the water from the rooftop.  In many instances the footpaths laid down are of such a poor standard that in a very short time they rise to the extent of an inch or two, creating considerable danger for the people of the locality.</P>
    <P>The local authority plead that it is difficult for them to take over the maintenance of the roadways in connection with these schemes because the work has not been properly carried out.  The responsibility rests with them to see that the work is carried out properly in the first instance.</P>
    <P>There may be a clash between two local authorities whose territories adjoin or where a local authority extends its territory and takes over from another.  There was an example of that a few years ago in Milltown. There was an exchange of ownership of the territory.  During the period of transition a number of public services were discontinued.  The removal of domestic refuse was suspended.  When the local people wrote to one authority they were referred to the other authority.  When they wrote to the other authority they were referred back <Col N="1029" /> to the authority to whom they had first written.  There should be some definite regulation that the services will be properly maintained even if the responsibility cannot be fixed.</P>
    <P>Another example is the serious flooding that took place up to quite recently in Stradbrook, on the borderline between two local authorities' territory.  When the stream caused very serious flooding of the public road the question was whose responsibility it was.  Instead of having the stream cleared and the flooding remedied and then settling the dispute between the local authorities, the whole area was flooded, the main sewer was affected, the manhole covers lifted by the force of the water and the people very seriously embarrassed, to such an extent that they had to sandbag the entrances to their houses and in many cases could not enter their houses for several days.  The problem was temporarily solved by some officials coming along from some local authority&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;and clearing the gully.  That solved it for the time being but my point is that public property should not be destroyed or damaged as a result of a dispute between local authorities as to responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is another case going on for almost two years in the Rathfarnham district.  One local authority built cottages and when the other local authority took over the tenants purchased these cottages.  It was discovered when some of the tenants had completed their purchase that the water supply did not comply with the regulations of the local authority taking over the property.  Several bursts occurred and it was found that one pipe was supplying eight or nine cottages.</P>
    <P>The local authority refused to accept responsibility.  It said the tenants had purchased and it was their responsibility. After a while the first local authority had the pipe repaired by putting a length of copper piping into the old lead pipe.  Another burst occurred and by this time the second local authority had possession of the property.  It refused to accept responsibility. In the meantime at least one <Col N="1030" /> of the tenants refused to conclude the purchase of the cottage until this dispute was settled and the local authority laid on a separate supply from the main to that one house.  That dispute is going on for almost two years during which time the water is freely running from several bursts in this pipe.</P>
    <P>Surely there should be some regulation by which property will be preserved to the best of our ability and by which the local authority will either accept responsibility for rectifying the mistake made by another local authority or prosecute the tenants and, while having the case brought to court, find out who ultimately is responsible for saving the water and putting the pipe in proper condition.</P>
    <P>In the Dundrum area we had examples of houses being built on land which was a swamp.  When that swamp was covered by numerous houses, other houses much lower down were subject to constant flooding to such a serious extent that many people lost the complete contents of their houses.  One woman was almost drowned because there were about 5 feet of water in the basement where she was living.  Another person who had paid a considerable sum of money for her property vacated it because of the constant flooding that occurred to a house which was never subject to flooding before this development took place.</P>
    <P>There again the local authority refused to accept any responsibility. It was discovered then that in this housing development the local authority diverted what was originally a very small stream capable of taking the small amount of water that went into it because the fields were able to take a considerable amount of the water.  The local authority allowed water pipes and drainage pipes to be laid on the surface of the stream right under the various bridgeheads with the result that when anything washed down the streams there was immediate choking and flooding and people's property was destroyed or seriously damaged.</P>
    <P>A very big scheme was undertaken <Col N="1031" /> eventually and at considerable public expense that was rectified.  However, if the local authority did its duty in the beginning it would have seen to it that the land was properly drained before it authorised houses to be built on it, and the State and the people would have been saved a considerable amount of money.  I do not wish to convey the impression that our Local Government officials or the officials in the locality are incompetent.  They are not.  I know most of them personally. They are highly competent persons but it is obvious that there is something wrong.  Perhaps the machine has become too big for proper management but certainly supervision is seriously lacking.  If much stricter supervision were insisted upon considerable economies could be made at a time when rates are increasing steadily.</P>
    <P>The one other point to which I wish to refer is the question of sub-committees set up by the various councils. I would ask the Minister to examine seriously this question because apropos of a Question I asked yesterday there is the possibility of a very serious situation arising when it can happen that members would be properly elected on to a sub-committee and never be summoned to attend a meeting of that committee.  I would ask the Minister to take serious note of that and bring it to the attention of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the delay in the payment of compensation for an extension of the borough boundaries in Cork which took place in 1955.  Property was taken over and the county council received no compensation. The Cork Corporation are drawing the profits from that property in rates and the people of Cork city have not felt the effect of that in the rates.  I suggest that if they had felt the effect of the compensation payments in the rates we would not have the fresh demand we have for a further extension of the borough boundaries to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the reason for a five year delay in a matter of this kind by the Department of Local <Col N="1032" /> Government.  A fresh demand has been handed to the Minister now for a further extension of the borough boundary, covering an area in which the Cork County Council have paid out in the last seven years some £780,000 in grants for new houses and the reconstruction of old houses.  As the House is aware, the rates on those houses for the first five or six years are very low.  We are now reaching the time when full rates will be paid on these and the Cork City Fathers have decided to put out their arms and grab.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,760,000 has been lent by the Cork County Council to people who built new houses in that area. If the area is taken over by the Cork Corporation there will be no security because the rates in the area will be increased by something between 25/- and 30/- in the £.  There will be no security where the Cork County Council is concerned because the people will be unable to pay the rates and pay the loan charges at the same time. I suggest that all this difficulty could have been avoided were it not for the delay on the part of the Department of Local Government in dealing with the previous application.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Department, in my view, is a huge joke.  Today, they will say, &ldquo;Black&rdquo;; tomorrow &ldquo;White&rdquo;.  A few years ago I had occasion to raise with Deputy O'Donnell, when he was Minister for Local Government, his refusal to allow the South Cork Housing Authority to build houses in the village of Ballinacurra. The usual manoeuvring went on and after a couple of years he told me it had been solemnly decided that the site was not suitable because there was no water supply, despite the fact that the Midleton water main runs outside the fence.</P>
    <P>Some twelve months after the departure of Deputy O'Donnell I decided to try again.  Lo and behold, there was no difficulty whatever.  Some Moses struck a rock and found water and the building of the houses was duly sanctioned.  Is there any valid explanation for that kind of conduct? Where else would one find such <Col N="1033" /> lunacy?  In plain language, it depended on the colour of one's coat or on whose corns one happened to tread.</P>
    <P>There is also then the position with regard to Youghal bridge.  I heard a shout from Deputy Dillon a few days ago about Youghal bridge.  For five long years we tried to drive some sense into the Department of Local Government in connection with that bridge. An inquiry was held and the engineer decided that a new bridge should be erected.  A consultant was employed. We who were advocating the reconstruction of the old bridge invited and got tenders for its reconstruction.  We brought them in before the council and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> announced the following day: &ldquo;County Council Bombshell.  Consultant reduces his estimate by £168,000.&rdquo;  In one day he reduced his estimate from £368,000 to £200,000.  It was decided to build the bridge at Ardsallagh; the cut price won.  Tenders were invited, and one was duly accepted, on the consultant's opinion.  The unfortunate man who went to build the bridge, and who had been told firmly by both the consultant and the Department of Local Government engineers that there was a rock foundation, found seventeen feet of sand and fifty feet of mud under that. I guarantee that when that bridge is built the taxpayers and the ratepayers will be lucky if they get out at anything less than £450,000 to £500,000. I know what I am talking about.  It is a crazy engineering system, and the trouble is one cannot track it down.</P>
    <P>I was inundated a few months ago with complaints from the people of Midleton and resolutions from the Midleton Urban Council about the bypassing of the town.  Some idiot from the Department of Local Government went down there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When I asked questions here, I was told there was no truth in them.  Later I was brought down and shown the pegs put down by the engineers of the Department of Local Government marking out the road.  I found that people holding land at the entrance to an outlet from that road had been told that they could not build because the land would be required for a bypass.</P>
      <P>Another genius, if genius is a more appropriate word, from the Department came down and planned a new road bypassing Glanmire village and the village of Riverstown.

      <P>What I am saying is that the Minister should not send those people down there.  Let us have some gumption some time.  For the main road between Cork and Carrigtwohill there is marked down a width of 180 feet.  I would ask the Minister to come down there some day and measure it for himself.  It is to be for a new road but I believe the money that will be spent from the Road Fund for its construction could be better used to relieve the ratepayers of some of the cost of road repairs necessitated by motor vehicle owners who are paying road tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very many years ago I drew attention to the anomaly that exists between tenants of county council non-municipal <Col N="1035" /> houses and tenants who have the misfortune to have houses built for them in an urban area.  There is a striking example of that in the town of Cobh where there are 130 houses in the immediate neighbourhood of the town which were built by Cork County Council.  Across the road from them, and no nearer to the town, there are 52 houses built by the urban authority. To illustrate the point I shall take as an example 24 houses built on one side of the road by the county council and the 52 built on the other side of it by Cobh Urban Council.</P>
    <P>These houses were built around the same time and were officially opened by the present Minister for Agriculture. They are exactly the same in regard to amenities and their rents were fixed at 11/- a week plus rates.  A few years ago we in the Cork County Council put forward a scheme for tenant purchase of the houses.  I am a firm believer that every tenant should own his house and that once a new scheme of houses is finished a local authority should introduce a purchase scheme.  The scheme we put forward was duly sanctioned by the Department and under it the 11/- a week rent was reduced to 9/- a week with the tenants becoming responsible for all repairs.</P>
    <P>I then said that we should do the same thing for the tenants of urban council houses on the other side of the road and we put forward a scheme towards that end.  How did it work out?  It worked out that a tenant on one side of the road had his rent reduced from 11/- to 9/- a week on purchase, but a tenant on the other side of the road, in an urban council house, had his rent increased from 11/- to 32/- on purchase.  It is something that should be portrayed in the theatre or opera house.</P>
    <P>I asked a question about this matter on the 30th October, 1958, and the Minister replied as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The special facilities available to tenants of labourers cottages&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>though I am not talking about labourers' cottages</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" />&mdash;&mdash;were provided by the Labourers Act, 1936, which gave effect to the recommendations of a commission of inquiry in support of the vesting of ownership of cottages in agricultural labourers as a class....</P>
    <P>The statutory definition of the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; has been so extended by successive Housing Acts that it now includes various classes of persons whose employment is not directly related to the land.  One result of this development is that the terms of purchase available to such persons are frequently more advantageous than those available to tenants of urban houses who may be engaged in similar types of employment... any legislation designed to place all such tenants on the same level would, if it followed the tendency of housing legislation in recent years, have the effect of equating the conditions of tenancy of persons housed under the Labourers Acts to those applicable under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Column 288 of the Official Report for 30th October, 1958.  I asked a few more questions on this subject but I could get no further ahead.  I then found the reason was that while the subsidy continues for a county council house whilst it is being purchased by the tenant, once an urban council tenant enters into a purchase scheme the State puts out its hand and grabs the subsidy back.  It is immediately withdrawn and in the town of Cobh alone the subsidy on each lot of houses is as follows: for one, £1,170 a year, on the second £708 a year, on the third £50 a year, on the fourth £195 a year and on the fifth £40 a year, so that if the tenants were lunatics enough to avail of the generous offer, made by the Minister and the Department, the State would immediately gain £1,727 17s. 3d. a year in subsidy alone. It would be better if one of those gentlemen who were down driving the <Col N="1037" /> pegs below Midleton were turned to that job to see if he could devolve some scheme whereby these people could purchase their houses at a reasonable figure.</P>
      <P>As everybody knows, the older houses become the higher their repair bill goes, and this means that the money which local authorities should be providing to build new houses has to go on repairs for old ones.  If there was any intelligence at all, the legislation covering the houses on one side of that road should also be applied to those on the other side of it.  I do not mind the veiled threat in the Minister's statement that the subsidy would be withdrawn.  I do not believe there is any Government in the world lunatic enough to try it.</P>
      <P>Those are the circumstances under which the Department is working and under which it sent circulars to local authorities, dated 11th July, 1953, outlining standard minimum terms and conditions for the sale by urban authorities of houses to occupier tenants.  The minimum conditions are the increasing of a man's rent on purchase from 11/- to 32/- per week. Those are the conditions the Department of Local Government had the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; to send down to a local authority.</P>
      <P>I hope I am a reasonable man but I cannot understand this.  Fifty-two houses were completed there and 52 tenants were picked and put into them. The next day 50 more were finished and 50 others picked and put into them.  All of the 100 tenants are working in the one job in Irish Steel in Cobh.  One can get a reduction of 2/- in the rent while in the case of another it is sought to push his rent up to 32/-. Public money should not be expended by any Department in the preparation of schemes like that.  The Minister should find out who is responsible for that scheme and take steps accordingly. It is only now we are paying for the effects of the Youghal Bridge.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter and give those 180 tenants in the town of Cobh an opportunity of purchasing their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not weary the House by dealing <Col N="1038" /> with the proposal by Cork Corporation for the extension of the borough boundary because we shall have, I think, another opportunity of dealing with that.  If we do not, I shall take good care to make one.  I would ask the Minister to say when we are to have a decision on the compensation payable.  When will it be paid?  In future, whenever there is any proposal for the extension of a borough boundary anywhere, I would ask that the whole financial settlement be arrived at and the money paid to the local authority before there is any change over.  I think that in the majority of cases when these gentlemen see the bill they will not be in half the hurry to look for extensions as they are at present.</P>
    <P>They talk about amenities.  The Cork Corporation, as such, could not lend 5/-, and that is a small amount, to any man wanting to build a house in the morning.  They have no facilities for lending money.  They have no department or no bank out of which they could lend money.  Each year we have had an average of about 300 to 500 young married people in the area wanting their own houses.  They came up here to the Department and got a grant.  Then they came down to a benevolent county council and got an equal grant.  They then applied for a loan to the county council and got a loan of from £1,500 to £1,800 to build their house.  Where are the amenities of that description that can be provided by a corporation at present bankrupt?</P>
    <P>The unfortunate people in that area have been carrying those city people on their backs for the last 30 years.  I had to allude to it frequently in this House.  Under the Board of Assistance we found that for every bob paid, the rural area paid 8d. and the city paid 4d.; but in the distribution of that bob the city got 9d. and we got back 3d. for our 8d.  That has being going on through legislation by this House for the last 20 years.  Those are the people who come along now seeking to bring those unfortunate people into the city.</P>
    <P>About a month ago I asked the Minister if he would have a revaluation <Col N="1039" /> of Cork city.  The County Manager made a statement, which was not contradicted, that Cork city, per head of the population, is the lowest valued town or city in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Now they propose to bring in the unfortunate people who borrowed money to build their own houses and who were helped by grants from the State and the county council. They propose to bring them in now on the new valuation recently fixed on those houses by the Commissioner of Valuation and ask them to pay on that new valuation in order to relieve the city rates.  I think any proposal of that type is scandalous, and the sooner we get down to bedrock in this matter the better.  I do not want the Minister to come along at a later stage sponsoring any proposal of that sort.  It is better to nip it in the bud now.</P>
    <P>As I stated, in so far as the security the county council have in respect of the £1,750,000 they have lent to the people in that area is concerned, that security is now gone because those people are generally on a fixed income; and if the rates go up, as they will have to go up by from 25/- to 30/- in the £, how will those people be able to pay back the loans they got from the county council?  It is time this matter was fully investigated.  The sooner we get a decision from the Local Government Department on the compensation payable for land and property taken over by those people five years ago the sooner the people in the area will know where they stand.  I am sorry for the delay but I wanted to put those facts as clearly as I could before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention, first, the problem relating to house building, particularly in South Cork.  It seems to be a habit now in Ministerial statements to say that our housing problems are practically solved.  I should like to say, in so far as south Cork is concerned, that that very definitely is not true.  It is most deplorable that when people have been accepted as genuine applicants for houses by responsible members and officials of local authorities&mdash;applicants who are living in unfit, overcrowded <Col N="1040" /> and condemned houses&mdash;the applications must be referred for Ministerial decision.  This happens although their applications for new houses have been thoroughly investigated already by the county housing superintendent and the county medical officer of health.  It is a known fact that some years ago once local authorities decided people were genuine applicants the houses were built.</P>
      <P>Why is it that applications must now be investigated and inquiries carried out by Departmental inspectors who are sent down the country to see whether or not these unfortunate people should get houses? Many of these people have despaired of getting houses built for themselves and their families, all because of red tape.</P>
      <P>It is about time, too, that we saw the end of these Ministerial statements that the target for house building has been reached.  As a member of a local authority, as one who knows the position, particularly in South Cork, I want to make it quite clear to the Minister that this is not so and I want to pin on the Minister the responsibility for holding up the building of houses in that area.  He may say that schemes are not begun because the plans have not been sent to the Department and have not, accordingly, been sanctioned.  I can tell him that in the days of the late Deputy Tim Murphy when he was Minister for Local Government, there were no such excuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few years the number of cottage tenants who have been applying for the vesting of their cottages has been very high.  I fail to understand why it is that all necessary repairs are not carried out by the responsible local authority before the vesting of cottages is completed.  I know that several tenants have had to complain that they are not getting fair play in this matter.  There is one case of which I have personal knowledge where a tenant seeking vesting of his cottage found that, in his opinion and in mine, its state of repair was far from satisfactory.  A qualified engineer listed the repairs that had not been attended to and sent the list to <Col N="1041" /> the Department who sent an inspector down.  It was found that half the repairs had not been carried out.</P>
    <P>The result is that that tenant, as well as several others, are forced into the awkward situation of having to take responsibility, through a vesting order, for cottages which have not been handed over to their ownership in a proper state of repair.  I am not blaming the inspectors of the Department of Local Government for this; I believe this situation arises because of the method and the system adopted by the Department at the behest of the Minister.  I would ask him to carry out a thorough investigation of this matter to see that prospective owners of cottages to be vested are not placed in the terrible situation of having to provide money for repairs that should have been carried out by the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to put before the Minister is the long delay in giving to county library committees grants to which they became entitled by legislation fourteen years ago.  We all know the problem of the increased imposition of rates.  Increases in rates are not liked by anyone, and when we realise that through the delays in the payment of these grants the local library services are becoming an even heavier burden on ratepayers, we have cause for serious complaint.  Could not the Minister come to the aid of these committees by speeding up the payment of these grants which, after all, have been authorised by legislation?</P>
    <P>Finally, I naturally support the complaint of Deputy Corry against this unwarranted intrusion into Cork county by the people from the city. Deputy Corry has explained the situation and his statement requires very little addition from me.  We in the county consider it a blatant robbery of the people in the county by the city authority.  I say to the Minister that he should take the line of letting things stand as they are in Cork.  We in Cork County Council, month after month, see people who have built their homes in the suburbs having to sell out.  We see them having to transfer <Col N="1042" /> their interest in their homes to other people because, even with the present rate in the suburbs, they find it impossible to keep going.</P>
    <P>Should the Cork Corporation be allowed, by grabbing part of the county area, to get relief from their financial burdens?  I would ask the Minister to see that Cork Corporation are forced to tackle their own problems without coming out into the county.  It is time the Minister realised that as well as the people in the suburbs, those in the rest of the county will be equally penalised because if Cork County Council is to lose £400,000 revenue it will mean a greater imposition on the people in the county as a whole if there is not to be a reduction in the facilities and amenities in the county area.  I would impress on the Minister that this protest is not of a political nature, it comes from all sides of the House.  It is a protest by the members of the Cork County Council.  There are other ways in which the Corporation can maintain their finances without robbing those in the county area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking briefly on this Estimate, I should like initially to make a plea to the Minister in regard to the difficulties faced by local authorities, particularly in Dublin, in respect of the provision of houses, the development and widening of streets, provision of car parking facilities and kindred matters.  I am asking the Minister to use his authority and his influence with the Government, so far as he can, to endeavour to repeal the somewhat archaic legislation governing the acquisition of land for street-widening and other purposes.  For a long time in Dublin we have been up against the difficulties that arise in this connection.  It was relatively simple to acquire ground for building houses or flats, but in many cases development was held up because of the involved and tortuous proceedings necessary to provide ground for street widening, even though some of the streets concerned were particularly in need of widening and without widening the development of housing sites and facilities was very severely prejudiced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> I should also like to advert to the general position, speaking as a Dublin Deputy, in regard to housing in the city over a number of years.  I think that it is only reasonable and proper for me to say that since the Minister was appointed to his present post we have not had any occasion to complain regarding delays in the approval of plans submitted by the corporation to his Department.  Unfortunately that was not so in the case of his predecessor and in this matter I am not referring to his predecessor who was Minister for the inter-Party Government as a member of the Fine Gael Party.  I want to go beyond that.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor who is now Minister for Agriculture was one of those primarily responsible, in my view, for starting the hold-up in Dublin city.  There was no specific public suggestion that there was any financial difficulty, but I think that in every-body's experience there are a number of ways of attaining an objective, and it was found necessary during the period when the present Minister for Agriculture was Minister for Local Government to make constant and repeated representations in order to get plans approved by his Department. There were many delays and very many occasions on which there appeared to be obstruction from the Department.</P>
    <P>As regards housing, the picture in the Dublin area is pretty clear.  It shows that the greatest number of dwellings, houses and flats, were built in 1950-51.  From that year on, with, I think, one exception, there was a fairly regular decline.  In my opinion the first cause of that decline was the action of the then Minister for Local Government.  We subsequenty had the situation when certain difficulties arose. I made no apology in placing the blame for some of those difficulties at the door of another Minister for Local Government of a different Party.  I have done it publicly before and I do not propose to withdraw it now but, as I understand in the course of this debate reference was made to myself and to the fact that I happened to have <Col N="1044" /> a certain position in the local authority in Dublin for a number of years, I think it is necessary to clear the record and to remove at least, to some extent, the allegation that Dublin Corporation was responsible for delays.</P>
    <P>There were certain difficulties in 1955-56.  These difficulties would never have arisen, in my estimation, to the extent that they did arise as far as Dublin was concerned had it not been for the public actions of members of the Minister's Party.  When I, as chairman of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation was getting the support of my colleagues to go ahead with full speed with construction works members of the Fianna Fáil Party, I regret to say, both outside and inside the corporation were endeavouring to take advantage of the difficulties purely for the sake of their own Party's future position.  The situation reached the point at which the Finance Committee, which I think has been mentioned by Deputy Noel Lemass, decided on a particular line of action&mdash;that they would recommend that no applications would be considered for loans under the S.D.A. Acts unless and until the hard cash to meet in full each application made was lodged in the corporation's bank.  Up to that date this was an unheard of position and it does not exist to-day.</P>

      <P>Previously applications for loans were considered on the basis that when the money would be required it would be forthcoming.  The situation was not made any easier by very prominent representatives of Fianna Fáil&mdash;not just in the corporation but in this House&mdash;attending meeting after meeting of groups of builders and pointing out to them that the building trade was coming to a halt.</P>
      <P>In or about that time I had the honour to be Lord Mayor of the city and I recollect receiving, with the City Manager, a deputation from at least one group of builders who indicated that the requirements of their clients were being held up.  The very day on which that deputation were making this submission to the City Manager there were thousands of pounds lying in the corporation offices waiting to be issued, but they were not submitting their arguments in order to ensure that they would get this money. I should like to place on record that whatever the incompetence of the Minister for Local Government at that time&mdash;and I am suggesting that a lot of the difficulty arose from that Minister's mishandling of the situation&mdash; the position of those desiring to purchase houses was not helped by the political activities of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of ordinary corporation housing, I have to say categorically that the Housing Committee at all times insisted on going ahead with its proposals to build houses once the approval of the Department was received.  Even in that respect there were attempts made to hold up the work.  Contributors to this debate have mentioned the fact that in Dublin the construction of houses and flats has been steadily declining.  We hope it will increase somewhat again but, to a great extent, the steady decline in the construction of houses and flats has been due to the very significant increase in the number of vacancies in local authority dwellings each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the late 1940's and <Col N="1046" /> early 1950's we had a vacancy rate of approximately 400 dwellings a year. In the period 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958 and 1959 the vacancy rate has increased fairly steadily and it is now running at about 1,400 dwellings a year.  I do not know what the reason for those vacancies is but it has been estimated that a considerable contributory cause in the Dublin area has been the failure to provide sufficient employment in Dublin and that because of the economic situation and because the people of Dublin cannot obtain sufficient employment in their own city they have been emigrating from Corporation dwellings.</P>
    <P>I hope this tendency has now ceased. It would be very difficult for me to visualise that situation continuing. There has been some small increase in the demand for Corporation dwellings. There is a still a very substantial demand but the problem, as the Minister must know, is made more difficult in Dublin because of the fact that the corporation's activities in providing dwellings has meant building houses on the perimeter of the city. Those corporation tenants not only have to meet the rent of the dwellings but in thousands of cases they have to meet very heavy bus fares in travelling to and from their work, in their children travelling to and from school and in their wives having to travel to and from the more central parts of the city where they would be enabled to purchase some of their necessities at a competitive price.</P>
    <P>No corporation, county council or urban housing scheme can go ahead without the sanction and approval of the Minister's Department.  Every such scheme requires not only the approval of the Minister in respect of the cost of the dwellings but, before one stone is put upon another, the Minister must approve of the layout. Consequently when a local authority seeks the Department's approval for the layout of a scheme that scheme has usually been drawn up under the guidance of their own local planning officer and it is examined by the planning section of the Minister's Department. Yet, time after time, we have <Col N="1047" /> seen developments in Dublin which were accepted by the Department and then they have changed the whole nature of the development.</P>
    <P>I shall give one or two instances to support that case.  Quite a few years ago now the question of building houses in the Ballyfermot area was under consideration.  The layout was submitted to the Department.  The Department at that time decided that if some thousands of dwellings were to be erected in Ballyfermot, in order to comply with modern planning requirements and to give the people living in those houses modern shops and services, the local authority would have to provide for a central shopping area.  As an individual, as Chairman of the Housing Committee at the time and as a Deputy, I agree that that seems to be a very reasonable provision.</P>
    <P>If you propose to build a few thousand houses it would not be common sense to acquire a thousand acres and build the houses without having any regard to the subsequent requirements of the people who are to live in them, in the way of churches, schools and shops.  In that case the Department said the plans would be approved only if provision were made for a major shopping centre.  That was done.  Within a year or so, the same Department calmly gave permission to individuals to erect shops at a little distance from the site reserved for the shopping centre.  In Ballyfermot today in an area which was reserved in the original plan for the provision of shops there are vacant sites because the shops are situated somewhere else.  I have often wondered whether the decision, which cut across the Department's own plans, to determine applications in favour of individuals did not arise as a result of political pressure without regard to the best interests of the thousands of people who are living in the area.</P>
    <P>I have another instance in mind.  On the north side of the city, the corporation, again with the approval of the Department of Local Government, reserved a site in the centre of an estate known as St. Anne's, holding nearly <Col N="1048" /> 600 houses.  Today, that site has grass and weeds growing on it.  Why? Because the Department that approved of the plans to construct the houses and that approved of the plan to reserve sites for shops and for schools subsequently determined an appeal by citizens to have shops built on the perimeter of the site.  The result is that the site cannot be utilised for the purpose for which it was intended. The women and children in that tenant-purchase area have to go out on to a main thoroughfare to do their shopping.</P>
    <P>If the Department were at any stage considering the provision of shopping facilities anywhere other than as provided for in the plans, why did they insist, in the first place, on provision for such amenities being made in the plans for the estate?  If it was a good thing, and I personally believe it was a good thing, to provide space for these facilities, ordinary commonsense would lead one to believe that the same Department would not subsequently take a decision which would prejudice their previous decision in the matter.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister while I am discussing the question of housing.  I believe that local authorities, particularly Dublin Corporation, should obtain a greater measure of financial assistance from the State for the provision of housing for the people.  The provision of assistance is applicable generally but I feel that there is a special case to be made in respect of the city of Dublin because down through the years the pattern has been migration into Dublin. If the population of Dublin had been reasonably static over a number of years the problem of dealing with slum dwellings, overcrowding, unsuitable and dangerous dwellings could have been handled much more rapidly. Until very recent years the population of Dublin was constantly increasing.</P>
    <P>Although efforts were made by the local authority, with generous help from successive Governments, those efforts were handicapped by the fact of the constant increase in the population. The situation has altered in recent years.  I understand that the <Col N="1049" /> population of Dublin is static at the moment.  In regard to corporation houses, there has been a larger number of vacancies which has enabled the corporation to house a large number of people without having to provide new dwellings.</P>
    <P>The cost of providing dwellings in the city of Dublin is out of proportion. At the present time the effort has to be directed to providing dwellings in the more central city areas.  The cost of acquiring ground in those areas is very much greater than the cost of acquiring ground on the perimeter.  The cost of constructing flat dwellings is very high for some reason unknown to me.  I have never been fully satisfied as to why it should cost £2,700 to provide a three-room flat when a five-room cottage can be built for £1,600 or £1,700.  The reason advanced from time to time is the greater weight and greater strength of the structure.  However, there is some reason unknown to me which inflates the price.  That does not apply only in the case of buildings of five to ten storeys.  I could understand it in such cases.  But, where you are building blocks of two-storey flats for old people, each flat consisting of a room with a little kitchenette off it, and the cost is as high, if not higher, than the cost of a three-room house, there would appear to be some factor in the financial operation that is beyond my comprehension.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the people housed in central city flats, in accordance with the terms of the Houses of the Working Classes Acts and in accordance with policy, come from clearance areas.  A large percentage of them are able to pay only a minimum rent.  Consequently the cost of providing the dwelling and of the subsequent commitments is liable to fall to a great extent, aside from the general Government subvention, on the citizens who pay rates.  Having regard to the fact that for the purposes of the Acts the maximum taken into consideration and on which Government assistance is given is £2,000 in the case of a flat and £1,400 in the case of a house&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Malley says £1,500 I shall not argue with him. Having regard to the fact that a five-roomed house can be built for around £1,700 but a three-roomed modern flat may cost £2,400, £2,500, or maybe £2,700, there is a good case for the Minister having a look at the financial aspect of the question.  In respect of flat building I would urge upon the Minister that the cost of site acquisition should be separated completely from the cost of construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the figure the Deputy mentioned of £2,700 for a flat include site value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We had a case not too long ago where the actual cost of the flat would have reached over £3,000 and in the particular case the reason for the inflated cost was that it was a small site and the value of the site was very high; consequently the final costs were altogether out of proportion.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of appealing to the Minister again to do something in relation to the question of acquisition for street widening and road widening.  We have read in the newspapers this morning of a substantial increase in the number of motor cars on the road.  As regards the city of Dublin I do not think the problem of traffic is as bad as some people make it out to be but we should try to visualise what the position will be in five or ten years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If they would stop people parking on both sides of the street we would get along very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If acquisition for street or road widening is not speeded up it will be difficult for local authorities to do anything.  On the question of parking on both sides of the street, there is a problem in Dublin.  If we could take out of the city, for instance, the cars of all those who arrive in the city at 8.30 or 9 in the morning and who do not remove them until 5 or 5.30 in the afternoon, the situation would be a very happy one.  So far that has not been found possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> On the other hand, if a regulation were imposed prohibiting parking in the city, though possibly it is not my duty to make a plea for them, a very substantial number of businesses in the city would have their trade affected adversely.  It would be a simple thing to prohibit parking but I can visualise that people engaged in business in the city would then have a very legitimate complaint because it might be made almost impossible for a considerable proportion of their customers to come and trade with them.  The same situation might occur in other towns throughout the country.  I have occasion now and again to go down the country and to get through Portlaoise is a bit of an exercise in manoeuvres.  However, in that case it might be possible to get the cars parked on one side of the street.  In Dublin there are many wide streets but the wide streets are not necessarily outside the shops.  In streets like Henry Street, Grafton Street, George's Street, where a considerable amount of shopping is done by people who go there in cars, to solve the problem by prohibiting parking in the area might be difficult.</P>
    <P>There is the question as to whether it could not be found possible to deal with the person, say, the civil servant or the local government official, who brings his car early in the morning and leaves it there until evening.  These cars cause obstruction for eight hours a day and make it impossible for people who have occasion to park for 20 minutes or half an hour to use the public streets.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister is circulating a Bill dealing with this problem. I would appeal to him to examine the possibility of providing multi-storey car park facilities.  The problem as regards local authorities in this respect is that they are not in a position to provide the moneys for such a project. They have indicated that sites will be made available at very reasonable cost to private persons who would be prepared to build such multi-storey car parks.  These car parks would be very useful but I cannot visualise private individuals&mdash;they do not do it in this country and I am sure they do not do <Col N="1052" /> it in any other country&mdash;embarking on ventures unless there are fairly substantial profits to be gained, and I do not think there are substantial profits to be gained from this undertaking.</P>
    <P>Up to the present we have not had any hold-up by the Minister's Department in regard to housing in Dublin. I think it is proper to give the Minister in charge of the Department or to give the Department officials credit where credit is due.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what are his intentions with regard to the Dublin town plan?  That plan has been with the Department since 1956 roughly.  I was responsible for many, many pages in the document and, as far as I can remember, towards the end of 1956 it was deposited with the Minister for Local Government.  All the statutory requirements were fulfilled. It would be interesting to know whether the Minister proposes bringing the plan into operation?  Does he intend to make any alterations in it? Does he intend to do nothing at all about it?  It is a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>Dublin was one of the few authorities which adopted town planning.  As far back as 1934 the Corporation decided on town planning and a plan was formally lodged with the Department in 1956.  This is 1960.  I think the Minister and his officials have had ample time to consider the plan lodged with him.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that some effort should be made to reduce the amount of detailed examination required in matters pertaining to local authorities.  If a competent engineer, in conjunction with his local authority, wants to lay a street or straighten a corner it seems somewhat archaic that the smallest change has to be notified to the Department, or some clerical officer from the Department, in order to show how efficient he is, insists on making a change and sends the whole thing back to the local authority with the statement: &ldquo;We want this change made before anything can be approved.&rdquo;  That situation has gone on for many years.  If the engineers are incapable of laying pipes or making roadways it is time they were <Col N="1053" /> scrapped.  If they cannot make a relatively small change without having it approved there is something wrong with the engineering staffs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I make this point because it seems to me that the local authorities, despite certain easements, are gradually becoming more closely tied to control by the Department of Local Government. With the implementation of the Management Act and the emergence in recent years of managerial associations, it seems to me that managers act on behalf of the Minister.  They certainly represent Ministerial policy. I am thinking now of a situation that existed in Dublin in 1957 when, contrary to the practice that had obtained for many years, the city manager refused to grant increases to workers employed by the local authority unless the application was dealt with by the Labour Court, a recommendation made, and Ministerial sanction obtained.  Prior to 1957 the practice was that the manager negotiated with the trade unions for the purpose of granting an increase, subject to the council's approval, in the wages paid to certain categories of workers, an increase commensurate with the increase given to similar categories of workers elsewhere.  That practice was departed from in 1957.  I am satisfied that the manager was acting on official direction or information.  I have not been able to trace any form of direction, but I am satisfied that the manager did not act solely on his own initiative.  The converse situation obtained last year.  Before the pattern had been set elsewhere the manager indicated that he was prepared to recommend to the council an increase in wage rates.  At that time, if my recollection is accurate, another Minister had indicated a certain policy in this House.</P>
    <P>Many members of local authorities are in favour of the managerial system. Without casting any reflection on any manager, my personal view is that the system has the effect of projecting the views and decisions of the Minister into every local authority and the manager, in fact, is but another voice of the Department of Local Government. <Col N="1054" /> Whether or not that is a good thing is a point that can be debated. I do not think it is.  If local authorities are considered desirable they are at least entitled to be given some responsibility.  The general effect of the managerial system has been to instil in people the feeling that it does not matter very much what the local authority wants to do; it does not matter very much who is elected to the local authority because, ultimately, important decisions will be made by the manager.</P>

      <P>I am just referring to a certain aspect.  I think I am entitled to advert to the recent local elections and the great apathy which existed amongst the electorate.  In my own area there was a 27 per cent. poll while in other areas in the city of Dublin it was lower and in other parts of the country the percentage was considerably higher.  My feeling on this subject is that the apathy is due to the fact that certain sections of the people think that members of local authorities, be they corporations, county councils, urban councils or town commissioners, have very little power.  This is to be regretted because I do not think local authorities should be regarded in that light.  Hundreds, possibly thousands, of men and women are serving on local authorities, giving their time, energy, enthusiasm and abilities to try to be of service to their fellow citizens, and it is no great benefit to them to feel that ordinary citizens are not concerned to cast their votes when an election takes place because those ordinary citizens feel they are just voting for a shadow.  If the electorate feel that the local authorities have no effective powers it might well lead them to that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking on local elections, I think I should say that I believe many thousands of electors were not clearly advised as to how they should vote, where they should vote and why they should vote.  I know the Minister may <Col N="1055" /> say that this is the responsibility of the local authorities themselves, but in local elections, we are dealing basically with the same group of citizens who vote in general elections.  Let us say that general elections take place in 1954 and 1957.  Cards are sent out to voters telling them where to vote and telling them what their numbers are on the register.  In 1955, however, when a local election takes place by and large it is the same people who vote, but they receive no official notification, and it is only to be expected that a large percentage of them may feel they are not entitled to vote.  It is a natural mistake for them to make.</P>
    <P>I have met dozens of people, by no means people without education or even in poor circumstances, who were confused because of the fact that they received an official card in 1957 advising them where to go to, as they did in the Presidential election and in the referendum on P.R., but in the recent local elections they did not get that notification and had to depend on a note received from Parties or candidates. When a general election takes place meetings are reported all over the country.  Ministers and leading members of the Opposition speak at various centres and the political Parties spend a lot of money on advertising. At least some of them do, but others have not much money to spend on advertising.</P>
    <P>Election addresses, of course, are sent out post free and if a couple of candidates in a Party can afford to print an election address and have the names of voters written on them the addresses will be delivered free.  They know, of course, that if elected to Dáil Éireann, there will be a certain allowance made to them, but in the case of county councils, urban councils and town commissioners, members get nothing though they may be covered for certain travelling expenses.  That does not apply in the case of Dublin, or possibly Cork and Limerick, where members of the local authorities live within a certain area and do not qualify for such expenses.  Generally speaking it appears to me that this can give the impression that not very <Col N="1056" /> much importance is attached to voting in local elections.</P>
    <P>In national elections I think the fact that voters are sent cards bearing their registered numbers is a matter that might lead to certain difficulties, but it could be overcome if the Minister would consider making it obligatory on any person going to vote to surrender that official card at the door of the polling booth.  I think the intention of the Act is that a person wishing to vote should go to the table in a polling booth, give his name and address and be handed a ballot paper.  It is proper that they should be advised of the date of polling and where to vote but the cards bearing their registered numbers should not be taken into the polling booths, because, as commonly happens, people produce these cards as evidence that they are the person entitled to vote. It has a psychological effect because when they present the card there is, apparently, a feeling on the part of some of the returning officers that that is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the person presenting the card is the person on the register.  I am afraid that is not necessarily the case.  However, if persons were required to deposit their cards at the door of the polling station, that difficulty could be overcome to the benefit of everybody.</P>
    <P>Those are the main subjects with which I wish to deal on this Estimate. I should like to refer also to a proposal submitted to the Department of Local Government, which has, I understand, received qualified approval but in regard to which there has been some delay.  I am referring to the proposal for the development of Bull Island.  I am aware that the Minister is not responsible for An Bord Fáilte or tourist development; he is responsible only for the work of local authorities. Nevertheless, I believe the development of Bull Island, the provision of proper approaches to it and so on, would be a benefit not only to tourism but would be of immediate benefit to the citizens of Dublin, particularly those with families who are not fortunate enough to be numbered among the ever-increasing group of people owning motor cars.</P>
    <P>At present if a Dublin family not <Col N="1057" /> owning a motor car want to get to Dollymount on a fine Saturday or Sunday they have to take the bus to the Bull Wall.  In order to get down to the sandy side of the island, where the children can play in relative safety and enjoy the fresh air they have to walk the best part of three-quarters of a mile; and to get away from the crowds that congregate there on fine Saturdays and Sundays, they may have to walk a further half mile along the strand. The approach to the island is by way of a single-carriageway, wooden bridge. I understand that proposals were submitted a long time ago urging the construction of a second bridge with a wider span and a dual carriageway.  In addition, there was a suggestion that there should be a new approach road across the island from a place known as Watermill Lane.</P>
    <P>While approval has been given to the proposal for the new bridge with the dual carriageway, I understand&mdash;I may be wrong, and if so the Minister can correct me&mdash;that the proposal to have a new approach road from Watermill Lane has been turned down.  In my view that could well be reconsidered. A roadway across the island at that spot would mean that traffic, including buses, could circulate around the island.  The buses could go across the bridge at the Bull Wall, along a new roadway by the strand and back out by the other route, thereby making it possible for families to get right out on to the beach.</P>
    <P>The Minister or some of his officials should go out to Dollymount on some fine Sunday afternoon and see the position for themselves.  They would see thousands of people making their way there to enjoy the fresh air and a dip in the sea.  But around 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the evening they would see the parents with tired and hungry children struggling back along that road&mdash; and at such times it can be a very long half mile indeed&mdash;and then, perhaps, finding they have to queue up for 20 minutes or half an hour to get a bus back into the city.  There is no problem for the people who have motor cars, but I am concerned with those who have to rely on public transport. <Col N="1058" /> I would ask the Minister to reconsider the decision taken in this regard.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that while Dublin Corporation, as a body, has always endeavoured to ensure that the maximum number of dwellings are built, there was unfortunately a period in which members of that body, some of them members of this House also, sought to gain political advantage and supported resolutions urging that no more S.D.A. loans be issued unless every penny of the amount committed was in the hands of the Corporation. These people even endeavoured to hold up the approval of contracts for the building of corporation tenancy houses.  They engaged in a public campaign with the object of creating a feeling of mistrust and doubt amongst builders, people anxious to build their own houses and the members of the public in general.  I understand some of these members, quite incorrectly, used my name in the course of their contributions to-day. That campaign could not have succeeded but for, as I said previously, the ineptitude of the then Minister for Local Government.  He did not, apparently, see the position in proper perspective.  He told the representatives of the building firms one thing, the representatives of the trade unions something else and the representatives of Dublin Corporation yet another thing.  Except for that Minister's ineptitude those people could not have succeeded.  They did succeed because of the Minister and they contributed to this feeling of doubt caused by the cancellation of plans for the reconstruction of houses.</P>
    <P>This phase has passed now, but there is still a problem in Dublin because there are still many thousands of people who require houses at rents they can afford to pay.  Most of those people are in very serious economic circumstances, and I am appealing to the Minister to reconsider his approach to the financing of local authority housing, particularly in the matter of local authority flats.  There is no possibility of many of the people now occupying condemned dwellings <Col N="1059" />&mdash;a considerable proportion of them are old age pensioners, widows and people living on relief&mdash;paying the high rents the local authorities must seek for houses.  Because Dublin has had to take a large proportion of the overspill of the population, the housing problem in the city has been aggravated, much more so by the fact that a considerable number of those people did not live in Dublin six or seven years ago and consequently are an added burden on the citizens who have had to pay rates in the city for such a long number of years.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider making a greater financial contribution to local authorities, aimed at relieving this problem so that the local authorities can continue rapidly to clear the sites that are available and to build flats on those sites.  I am not making a complaint at this stage about undue delays in approving of plans, but I would appeal to him to bring about a more streamlined method of approach in the manner in which local authority plans for houses are dealt with in the Department.  I would ask him to endeavour to give responsible officials of local authorities some credit for having ability.  If they have not that ability, the lack of it will soon demonstrate itself, but so long as they have and are prepared to do their work conscientiously, they should get some credit for this ability and should not be impeded as they so often have been in the past.</P>
    <P>I trust that in the future, if the Department of Local Government approve of a development lay-out, they will not subsequently come along and, because of what might be called political pressure or representation, make decisions completely contrary to those which guided them in the original decision.  There are many cases in Dublin where what the Department considered to be good planning practice was made a joke of by subsequent decisions in the same Department. Either planning practice is good and is to be supported or it should be condemned in the first instance.  In the case of housing, and other estates, <Col N="1060" /> planned for the benefit of the community, the Department should not lay down conditions which impose on local authorities the obligation of making decisions which involve declaring such sites as waste ground ultimately.  I do not think it is a credit to the Department that this should occur.  Not only does it impose difficulties on the people for whom houses should be provided, but it also appears foolish from the point of view of anybody visiting the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister whether his Department have seriously reviewed the housing position throughout the whole country and whether the Minister has thought it worth his while to consult local authorities throughout the country on their housing requirements.  Some local authorities have had vacant sites for upwards of 25 or 30 years while in many areas, particularly in the large provincial towns, we have many newly married people houseless because they do not qualify under the regulations.  Several married couples without families also suffer from the same restrictions.  I would ask the Minister to tell the House what steps are being taken or will be taken to provide for such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must realise that there are many growing towns in the midlands and elsewhere which have had very little relief from the housing point of view in the past few years.  The Minister must admit that since his Party assumed office three years ago the housing position has not improved. Very few additional houses have been provided in the midlands or elsewhere in that period.  During the term of office of the inter-Party Government we had, in fact, the waiting list for houses cut down to the very lowest. We now find that as a result of the stand-to policy of the Custom House with regard to housing the lists are growing rapidly and that the housing position in rural Ireland would be deplorable if it were not for emigration. The fact that so many families have gone, that fathers of families who have left have afterwards been able to make <Col N="1061" /> arrangements for their families' accommodation abroad, has eased the strain considerably on some local authorities, particularly in the West.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister&mdash;and I am sure the country would also&mdash;what excuses he has to make for the inactivity in regard to housing in the past and what his policy is for the future?  At what target does he propose to aim?  Has he consulted with the local authorities?  For example, has he discussed the whole question of housing with competent people like representatives of the General Council of County Councils or is he waiting to get an occasional letter from a local authority here and there?  Is he satisfied that his Department has made genuine efforts to ascertain our housing needs?  Is he satisfied with the present system of graded rents and the hardships imposed on certain people in having to pay high rents and does he agree with the policy of certain local authorities in having to subsidise rents by a form of home assistance?</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why some working-class people, in accordance with existing regulations, are put into houses at rents which they cannot pay. If they make application to the local authority to have the rents reduced to accord with their means, they are told it is not possible to do that but that the county manager and the local authority will agree to give them an allowance of home assistance for the purpose of paying increased rent.  The Minister cannot say he is not aware of these facts because that procedure is very familiar in my constituency. Many people in local authority houses at present, because of unemployment, sickness or domestic hardships of one kind or another, are unable to pay the present rents under a graded rent system.  Repeatedly applications have been made by such tenants for some relief.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not think it degrading for those people to have to stretch their hands out to a home assistance officer for 5/-, 6/-, 7/- or 10/- a week for the purpose of helping to pay the rent?  I think that matter is not alone worthy of the Minister's <Col N="1062" /> consideration but worthy of action by his Department.  It is wrong, and the practice should cease.  Steps should be taken to bring rents more into line with the means of the people.  I do not say or suggest that money received in the form of home assistance is not as good as other money but these are decent people who do not want to take home assistance to subsidise rents. That is why I say the question of rents should be carefully and sympathetically considered.</P>
    <P>I can remember the time when a suggestion came from somebody in the Custom House that as the housing problem was being tackled courageously, they intended to introduce some scheme whereby an old age pensioner or two old age pensioners would be provided with a house comprising a single room, kitchen and back kitchen and that the rents would be such that they could pay them from their old age pensions if they were entirely dependent on these pensions.  I should like to know from the Minister would it not be wise to do that now in the interests of the old people of whom we have many still living in hovels or as unwelcome guests on the floors of their in-laws or having to go to institutions or county homes simply because there is not any accommodation for them outside.  I cannot understand why each local authority could not provide in the townships at least 10 or 15 small houses for the old and for those people who, because of their circumstances, are left alone in the world having no member of their own family to care for or look after them. Such old people would be well able and prepared to look after themselves if they had some place to live; they do not want to be a burden on an institution or to live according to institutional discipline.  I should like to hear if the Minister would be prepared to give his approval if a local authority decided to allocate a number of houses for old age pensioners, widows or people living alone and without proper accommodation, people who do not want the usual big, two-storey house with bathroom and the other facilities associated with modern houses provided for large families.  I <Col N="1063" /> think the Minister should welcome a suggestion from any local authority prepared either to raise a loan or seek assistance from his Department to provide in each town a small experimental scheme&mdash;to so describe it&mdash;for such people.</P>
    <P>The housing situation is bad all over and no matter what picture the Minister is prepared to paint the practical test is in the country.  It rests on the number of applicants for vacant houses or cottages where they arise, on the number of people living in rooms or flats and the large number of people who for one reason or another cannot qualify for local authority houses and find themselves homeless with little hope of being able to provide houses for themselves because their financial resources will not permit them to do so.  The situation calls for a general review, for consultation with the county managers in general and for an expression of opinion from the elected representatives of the various councils throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The main responsibility of the Minister is in regard to housing, roads and town planning.  What is the position in regard to roads today?  There are some thousands fewer employed on road work than there were, for example, three years ago before the Minister took office.  Does the Minister not know&mdash;if he knows it is an extraordinary situation having regard to his statement that there is more road work being done&mdash;that the facts and figures reveal that there are fewer employed on road work today?</P>
    <P>I think one of the greatest tragedies for which the present Minister and his Party are responsible is the scrapping of the Local Authorities (Works) Act which provided grants for essential schemes.  It has already been stated here, I am sure, that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was one of the most beneficial measures ever introduced and general disapproval has been expressed by probably every authority in the country of the present situation.  It is no harm to remind the Minister, although I am sure it has already been said, that <Col N="1064" /> whenever the change of Government comes&mdash;and that will be at the next general election&mdash;the Local Authorities (Works) Act will be one of the first to be revived and the moneys to be provided under it for carrying out important works will provide employment that is well worth while in each local authority area.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to be honest with the House he must admit that that Act was scrapped out of pure, sheer spite.  It was an Act introduced by the inter-Party Government to give employment in rural Ireland.  Every member of this House who is a member of a local authority knows that works were carried out under that Act that could not be carried out by the local authorities as a charge at large on the county rates.  That is why the ratepayers were considerably relieved; that is why there was so much employment given in the carrying out of important local drainage schemes and on <i>culs-de-sac</i> and county roads.  None of these works could have been undertaken had it not been for the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>I assume that the scrapping of that Act was done deliberately by the Government and it must now be admitted that the scrapping of it was a foolish thing.  It was a step that has cost the ratepayers considerable sums, which have had to be expended to carry out works which otherwise could have been carried out under this Act. The scrapping of the Act has led to a considerable reduction in the numbers of men employed on road work.</P>
    <P>The general scheme of road grants as administered from the Road Fund requires to be reviewed and overhauled. It is ridiculous that certain sums of money are given to local authorities for maintenance and repair work and that the giving of them is tied up with certain restrictions and regulations.  It would be much better if the moneys provided for local authorities from the Road Fund were given to each local authority and if the manner in which they were to be spent were left to the discretion of the county engineer.  I want to say, and I want it to go on record, that whatever else we may have in this country we have as good <Col N="1065" /> engineers as there are in any other country in the world to-day.  I am sure that there is nobody in the Custom House who will disagree with that statement and that the Minister himself will not disagree with it.</P>
    <P>Here we have an extraordinary set-up in local government whereby a county engineer, who is a fully qualified authority in his own sphere, may submit a proposal to the county manager who is an ordinary layman and who is not qualified professionally in that particular sphere.  Yet the county manager may turn down that proposal. There is something wrong with a system of local government in which an ordinary layman can tell an engineer whether he is to spend a certain sum on a certain road or not.</P>
    <P>A county medical officer of health is in the same position.  He is a fully qualified man professionally and yet proposals by such qualified professional men can be overruled by men who do not possess the same knowledge or professional qualifications.  I think there is something extremely wrong in a system of local government that permits such things to happen.  Local government administration would be much better if the county engineer were the sole judge as to how money should be spent on roads and the same applies to the county medical officer of health in his sphere.  These professional men have experience and the professional training and they should be the best judges of what should be done in their own particular fields of activity.</P>
    <P>The county manager may have the best intentions in the world.  They are men of practical experience and, goodness knows, they have an extremely difficult job to do which is not made easier by the criticism of members of local authorities, even though such criticisms may be made with the best intentions of co-operating with them. However, we have seen where the expressed opinions of highly qualified professional men have been rejected and turned down because an ordinary lay person, in the person of the county manager, could not see the technical reasons which the professional people were putting forward.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to advocate <Col N="1066" /> legislation at this stage and I do not propose to do so, but without legislation we cannot give any greater authority to county engineers and county medical officers of health.  It has been the cause of certain criticism by members of local authorities that county managers have shown complete disregard for proposals from county engineers with regard to certain road requirements.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that there has been a considerable sum spent over the years on the main roads and the time has come now for more consideration to be given to the upkeep of by-roads and <i>culs-de-sac.</i>  I have often wondered why the road section of the Minister's Department has not provided money in the form of special grant to be given to local authorities for work on these by-roads and <i>culs-de-sac.</i>  In most rural areas we have numbers of families living in these lanes and <i>culs-de-sac</i> quite a considerable distance from the main roads. There is quite a considerable amount of money paid in rates by the people living in such areas, and I have often thought that it must be the cause of great anger to a large ratepayer living in those places whose children have to travel miles to school, through muck and mud in winter time, to see his neighbour who pays the same amount of rates but who has a dry foot the moment he sets out on the main road. That man has all the amenities of living on the main road and I have often wondered why, in the administration of local government, any serious consideration was never given to providing for the needs of the large ratepayers or cottage tenants who live in those lanes and <i>culs-de-sac.</i></P>
    <P>There was never a hope of having repairs carried out to the by-roads leading to these places although the road section of the Department, some years ago, asked local authorities to make a five year plan for county roads.  That was about eight or ten years ago.  I presume that there has been a good measure of work carried out in all counties on county roads. There are by-roads, lanes and <i>culs-de-sac</i> for which the Office of Public Works do not cater, for which relief schemes will not cater and on which <Col N="1067" /> expenditure is not warranted under any scheme administered by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The county council cannot expend money on them because they are not scheduled roads.  They have never been declared to be county roads.  The county council will be told by the county engineer that because they do not lead from one county to another they cannot be described as link roads and that the ratepayers' money cannot be spent on them.  Is there not a genuine case for the provision of money for the repair of these roads?  The people living on these non-scheduled roads have to pay taxes in the form of tractor and motor tax and other forms of road tax.  They have to pay the ordinary county rate, just as the person who lives on the edge of the main road.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Local Government wants to do something practical for these people it is within his power to introduce a scheme, which will have the blessing of members of the Opposition and of local authorities, whereby a sum of money would be provided by way of special grant to each county to enable local authorities to carry out general repairs to non-scheduled roads and <i>culs-de-sac.</i></P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to tie it up with conditions, it would be reasonable to suggest that for every £1 grant he put up, the local authority would put up £1.  I venture to say that members of local authorities who represent the ratepaying community would not expect 100 per cent. grants for such work, but would be prepared to consider sympathetically, in accordance with the financial situation of the local authority, putting up £ for £ under such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Ratepayers who live on by-roads and <i>culs-de-sac</i> are beginning to explode on the question of rates.  Rates have gone beyond the paying capacity of the people.  As a result of falling prices, unemployment, high living costs very great difficulty is being experienced this year in the collection of rates.  That applied last year and will probably apply to the payment <Col N="1068" /> of the next moiety.  The payment of rates is the cause of very great hardship. People who live under the conditions that I have described feel that they have a genuine grievance, that they get no benefits for the rates they pay.  They have not the benefit of water or sewerage schemes.  They have not a main road or a gravelled road.  They are called on to pay rates as high as those paid by the ratepayer who has all these facilities.  The Department of Local Government should interest itself in the welfare of these people.</P>

      <P>Certainly. Last night a Deputy referred to the powers of members of local authorities. I do not know if the Minister for Local Government was ever a member of a local authority.  I am sure he was.  I am not saying that the standard of intelligence on local authorities is low&mdash;it is the very opposite&mdash;but there are members of local authorities today who do not know what their functions are and there are wise county managers who do not go to the trouble of enlightening county councils as to what their functions are.  There are county managers, men of understanding, who are anxious to co-operate with their local authorities, who go to the trouble of explaining.  There are good county managers and reasonable county managers, but there are bad managers and unreasonable managers also.</P>
      <P>There is an association called the County Managers' Association.  What standing that has in the Custom House, I cannot say.  The Association usually makes a recommendation to the Minister if applications are made for sanction for various increases in pay.  The County Managers' Association seems to have the knob of the door of the Custom House more readily to its hand than any other section.  I should like to hear from the Minister for Local Government what he thinks of the County Managers' Association.</P>

      <P>We shall come to that also.  I should like to know whether he has met the County Managers' Association from time to time and for what purpose an organised group of county managers would have occasion to seek concessions from the Minister for Local Government.  I do not know, but I suppose the county managers have as good a right to organise as anybody else.  What their grievance would be is a mystery to me.  What problems they would have for the Minister to assist them on is a mystery.  In what way the Minister could assist them is another mystery.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of the County Managers' Association is surrounded by mystery.  The only time I saw that Association working actively was when road workers throughout the country were seeking increases in pay.  The county managers met in this city and all the county managers put their heads together.  I have known one county manager to address his colleagues and to say: &ldquo;Come together now and do not give the road workers an increase beyond such a penny.  We are influential enough in the Custom House to see that it will not be sanctioned.&rdquo; That county manager was not behind the door in making his statement. When there was an interview in the Custom House with officers of the Minister's Department and the county managers he was one of the spokesmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to find out.  That is just the very question I should like to hear answered by the Minister.  What responsibility has he in this regard?  Has he been influenced in relation to the sanction of wages of road-workers by the County Managers' Association?  Why should the County Managers' Association decide what was to be the standard rate of road workers' pay throughout the country?  Was it not an effort to take the power away from the Minister or was it, on the other hand, that the <Col N="1070" /> Minister was very glad to shirk the responsibility and to push it on to the county managers?  I would hope that the Minister for Local Government would not be inclined to yield to an organisation such as the County Managers' Association in relation to the pay of road workers.</P>
      <P>In the matter of the wages of road workers and other employees, there are local authorities who were anxious to provide the moneys.  There are local authorities who were anxious to provide money for schemes.  Yet, because of a decision reached by the County Managers' Association, one county had to fall in line with another.  The Minister should make some statement with regard to that matter.  I am sure the County Managers' Association cannot be of a confidential character.  There have been enough secret organisations springing up without a secret organisation describing itself as the County Managers' Association, designed, not to assist local authorities, but to bring about certain standards in local government over the heads of the elected representatives of the people on those authorities.</P>
      <P>Now that the local elections are over and all the local authorities will be starting anew, would it not be an opportune time for the Minister for Local Government to address a communication in plain language to each local authority explaining to the members what exactly are their functions and what are the functions of the county manager?  I am 17 or 18 years a member of a local authority.  I cannot describe myself as the dullest or the dumbest member any more than I can describe myself as the most intelligent; nevertheless I am still at sea in regard to reserved functions and in regard to the functions to be exercised by managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is laid down by law that the chairman of any local authority may obtain on request any information he requires from the county manager, but if members of the local authority ask the chairman to obtain such information he will be politely told that he gets the information as the law enables him to get it but it is for his own information and it cannot be passed <Col N="1071" /> on to the members of the local authority. On the other hand, there are county managers who are reasonable and who would say to the members of the county council: &ldquo;We can discuss the matter very fully.&rdquo;  Such a manager will place the whole file at their disposal and give them all the necessary information.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not county managers have come to stay but I should like to see local authorities with more power.  With the volume of work that has to be undertaken in the local authority I do not suppose it would be possible for members of the councils to deal with it.  They could not meet as frequently as necessary for the purpose of carrying out all the functions the county manager has to carry out.  However, the Minister should clarify the position because there must be many new members of local authorities who have not yet attended their first meeting.  This would be the right time to inform them of their powers and functions.</P>
    <P>We all know very clearly that the local authorities have two functions&mdash; to appoint a rate collector and to strike the rate.  After appointing the rate collector and striking the rate I do not know what functions they can have beyond making a recommendation to the county manager which he is not bound to accept, to consider or even to read.  If those are the only functions, the appointment of a rate collector, the striking of a rate and the appointment of other committees, that in itself is not sufficient to create great public interest in local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin was quite right when he said there is a great deal of apathy in regard to local authorities.  There may be a small number of people in every county who will interest themselves in becoming members of local authorities but very few of the ordinary businessmen, the substantial farmers or big ratepayers are interested in the administration of their own county. Most of those connected with local authorities are usually concerned with their own political Party and contest the local elections merely on a Party <Col N="1072" /> ticket, but there does not seem to be the genuine interest which should come from the ratepayers and the business people of each county.  If there is not that interest in the running of our counties, the present administration of local government is mainly responsible.</P>
    <P>New road traffic laws will be introduced shortly and this House will have plenty of time to debate them.  I merely want to take this opportunity of paying a special tribute to the Kildare branch of Muintir na Tíre for organising in Kildare during Whit week what was known as the Kildare Road-Safety Week.  During that week one would imagine that the road from Naas into Dublin was a battlefield judging by the number of skulls and crossbones, stones, wreaths and warning notices that were displayed.  It is no harm to bring home to the public the fact that too many people have lost their lives on that stretch of road due to accidents.  Muintir na Tíre in Kildare have shown a sense of public duty which is worthy of praise in this House. If it has done nothing else it has focussed public attention on the number of serious accidents on that stretch of road.</P>
    <P>If there is anything that will cause the motorist to pause, no matter what haste he is in, it is the sight of a cross on the road where a serious accident has occurred.  There is nothing very cheerful about such a sight, but it brings home to the mind of the careless person that there is a possibility that through his carelessness or lack of consideration he may be responsible for adding another cross to the side of the road.</P>
    <P>Money should be provided either from the Road Fund, from motor taxation or from some other source to assist counties anxious to undertake publicity in regard to road safety. The grants need not be very large and they could be used for the purpose of erecting suitable signs and warning notices.  However, the legislation which the Minister for Local Government will be introducing at an early date will enable this House to deal more fully with road traffic.</P>
    <P>When a local authority is instituting legal proceedings the county manager <Col N="1073" /> or the law agent institutes the proceedings in the name of the local authority. I suggest the position would be clarified for the benefit of all concerned if legal proceedings were taken in the name of the county manager.  Where proceedings are taken for the recovery of moneys owed to hospitals, for instance, the proceedings are taken in the name of the county council. That creates a false impression in the minds of the people, and particularly in the mind of the unfortunate debtor. Some form of circular should be sent to county managers instructing them to institute proceedings in the name of the county manager.  It is really the county manager who takes the proceedings and not the elected representatives on the local authority.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which may not cause any very grave concern in the Custom House, but it is a matter which causes considerable embarrassment to members of local authorities.  In court proceedings, the elected representatives on the local authority ought not to be branded as instituting the proceedings. These proceedings are generally very unpopular.  Unreasonable actions have been taken.  There have been actions when people fell over tar barrels at night time, or tripped on roads that had been ripped up.  There have been actions when motor cars struck unlighted barriers. All these proceedings should have nothing to do with the local authority; it is the manager who should defend these actions.  As it is, these actions cause embarrassment to the local authorities.  If the manager were joined in the proceedings, without the local authority, that would relieve the members of a good deal of embarrassment.</P>
    <P>I do not know if all local authorities have law agents.  I do not know if there is a standard practice in that regard.  I do not suggest that there should be.  Neither do I suggest that there should not be but, whatever is the practice for one, should be the practice for all.</P>
    <P>With regard to the vesting of county council cottages, we are told that that is a matter at the discretion of the local authority.  What about <Col N="1074" /> the case in which the local authority wants to vest and the manager, for one reason or another, will not agree?  As the law stands at the moment, no council house can be vested in a widow.  At least that is the situation in my county.  Evidently a different practice obtains in other counties.  We have another set of people living in council houses and paying the full rent.  Although they are the appointed tenants we are not allowed to vest the cottages in them.  The law and practice in this regard should be uniform in every county.</P>
    <P>At a very early date the Minister will have representations in connection with the general question of vesting county council houses in the tenants. I hope that he will be sympathetically disposed towards vesting.  If those tenants are not entitled to have their houses vested in them then in my view they should not be tenants of the houses at all.  This is a matter that the Department of Local Government should investigate.</P>
    <P>A peculiar situation arises with regard to the erection of petrol pumps on the kerbside.  An application will be made; the local authority will object; an appeal is taken to the Minister and, in nine cases out of ten, the appeal having being considered on its merits, the decision is against the applicant. Petrol pumps now have to be erected alongside the walls of premises and not at the kerbside where they would be regarded as an obstruction.  Surely a petrol pump is no greater obstruction than a line of telegraph poles or poles carrying E.S.B. current?  I think it wrong to prevent people putting the pumps wherever they want them. After all, the convenience of the motorist has to be considered.  The motorist will stop for petrol by the kerbside, but he will not drive in to a pump erected against the wall of a house.  There is a good deal of uneasiness about this matter because, in some areas, people have been permitted to put pumps at the kerbside and, in other areas, they have been forbidden to do so.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why there has not been some general line of policy laid down to deal with the erection of petrol pumps because this <Col N="1075" /> is something of a mystery.  Sometimes the Department of Local Government conveys a decision that a proposed petrol pump would be an obstruction to the public if it were placed on the kerbside, but electric light poles and telegraph poles are permitted to be there even though they are a greater source of obstruction.  I should like to hear from the Minister what general policy, if any, has been laid down by his Department in this connection.  The present system is unsatisfactory.  It has caused a great deal of inconvenience, annoyance and torment to decent people.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more annoying and aggravating than to see two neighbours making application to the Department of Local Government for permission to erect petrol pumps and one gets the permission while the other does not.  One can have a pump on the kerbside and the other cannot. That situation causes me to feel that there is a good deal of unreasonableness in such matters.  It is high time the engineering section of the Department of Local Government realised the conditions prevailing in rural Ireland and not stick closely to a city outlook and mentality on everything they are asked to decide.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention.  One of these is that in most midland counties there are good quarries, good sand pits and good gravel pits.  Would the Minister consider asking the road section of his Department to get in touch with local authorities who have good quarries in their areas in an effort to have them developed in order to provide employment for local people?  There are people like Roadstone who have, you might say, created a monopoly in this sphere and who supply road materials throughout the country, but I would venture to say that in Offaly there are as good stone quarries, sand and gravel pits as there are in any other county.</P>
    <P>It may be said by the engineers that stone must be of a very special type so that it may not be affected by weather, that it may make a better road and pay for itself in the long run <Col N="1076" /> over a great number of years, but if we want to provide work in our own localities our sand pits, gravel pits and quarries should be developed.</P>
    <P>In that connection I think the Minister ought to direct that a survey be made of the stone quarries that are to be found in most counties for the purpose, as I say, of providing local employment, and having stone material for roads available in each district.  It is frustrating for ratepayers and road workers to see substantial first class quarries lying undeveloped in their areas and yet watch lorries bringing stone into those areas from 50 and 60 miles away.  Offaly County Council has decided by a majority that no more imported sand and stone will be used on roads in its area, and suitable action will be taken to enforce the decision.</P>
    <P>I should like to see other county councils following the same pattern of action.  I know that in Laois a good deal of road stone and other material is brought in from outside.  I hope that some steps will be taken, with the assistance of the Department of Local Government, to develop any substantial worthwhile quarries in that and other counties instead of transporting such materials from outside districts.  It should be the duty of the Department to help in providing work and in extending and expanding schemes of employment in every way possible, and not to examine everything with an eye to reducing, pruning and cutting down employment.</P>
    <P>The greatest achievement that I feel any Minister could boast of is the large number of people his Department can employ and I feel that it would be a good service to the country to embark on schemes and plans which would give the greatest possible employment, particularly in rural areas.  One such scheme would be to develop sand pits, gravel pits and quarries.  As I say, such development would provide employment and the market is there for the materials produced. It consists of our roads and lanes.</P>
    <P>Most county councils are equipped with stone-breaking machines and <Col N="1077" /> crushers and there is nothing to prevent their entering quarries and building up their own reserves of road material.  In addition to that there is also the fact that Bord na Móna normally employs a large number of men in the midlands.  When these workers are laid off the county councils take them on for two or three months of the year, and I have often wondered whether it could be possible to have some form of dovetailing between the county councils and Bord na Móna whereby when the board lays them off they could be employed in quarries. Most areas now have rural electrification and all the necessary electrical apparatus could be constructed and installed in the quarries.  If that were done it would give employment to every single man that Bord na Móna could not employ.</P>
    <P>The last matter to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention has reference to pending legislation.</P>

      <P>I am not referring to any legislation in particular but I was about to ask the Minister, in the event of any legislation being introduced in relation to local authorities, would he be prepared to discuss it with the General Council of County Councils before introducing it here?  I feel that is very necessary.  The General Council of County Councils is a body comprising representatives of every county council in the country and, as a matter of courtesy to the elected representatives, I feel the Minister should at least meet them quarterly.  I do not know when he does meet them.  I am not a member of that body, though I might be a member of it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>A fair chance. I was suggesting that the Minister should consult with that body more frequently than he does.  By doing so he would set some value on the elected representatives of the people.  At any time he has local government legislation under consideration he and his <Col N="1078" /> officials should send for the representatives of the General Council of County Councils and discuss it with them.  He should ask their advice, assistance and guidance on it.  If the Minister went to the trouble of seeking their advice on matters of that kind I feel it would lead to a most satisfactory state of affairs.  Most members of local authorities are fully equipped with a knowledge of their areas.  The problems they have to face would be foremost in their minds and whatever legislation the Minister was about to introduce could be moulded according to their views.</P>
      <P>I make that suggestion to the Minister in the hope that, even at this late hour, he may see his way to bring about a greater measure of co-operation with local authorities in the matter of pending legislation particularly co-operation with the General Council of County Councils.  I believe they are a body of sensible men, representative of their various counties, and are in a position to give very valuable advice.  It must be admitted, of course, that the officials of the Department of Local Government are competent, skilled and trained men, probably as efficient as can be found in any branch of the Civil Service in the British Isles to-day.  Nevertheless, there is always a tendency on the part of trained civil servants to follow the line of the trained civil servant&mdash;as the old story goes, you cannot beat the old dog off his track.</P>
      <P>Along with the valuable technical advice he can get from his own officials, it would be well for the Minister to have the benefit also of the practical advice of the man in the field, so to speak.  Such advice could be very useful to him in moulding his legislation to suit the wishes of the people.  Therefore, I suggest that in respect of all forms of Local Government legislation the Minister should, in addition to the helpful advice of his own officials, seek the practical, common-sense advice of the representatives of the local authorities. Such advice would enable him to formulate local government legislation in the best interests of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister and his predecessors on <Col N="1079" /> the good work they have done over past years in the provision of cottages. However, I believe that in the past two years or so there has been a slowing down in cottage building so far as North Tipperary is concerned.  Our county council has sent up plans and specifications to the Department, but after a delay of five or six months they have been returned for further consideration or to be changed.  Last year we set ourselves a target of 146 cottages in our housing drive, but by the end of the year, because of red tape in the Local Government Department, we did not reach 48.  I feel that if we continue the way we are going we shall not even wipe out this year the arrears from last year.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is now Government policy to slow down house building?  County managers are suggesting that there is now a danger of over building.  That may apply in other counties, but speaking for North Tipperary, I can say it will take a long time to complete our housing programme there.  In the towns of Roscrea, Nenagh, Thurles and Templemore and the rural areas there is a demand for houses by newly married people which will take many years to meet.  The Department are not facing the housing problem in the way I would wish.  Perhaps the fault lies with the local authorities, but in rural Ireland local authorities have no power to build houses for people about to be married.  When a boy and girl are about to marry and find they can get no house, the only answer to that problem for them is emigration.  I believe local authorities should be empowered to build houses for such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities should also be allowed to build houses for small farmers; and I would say the Minister should give a direction to local authorities compelling them to build houses for small farmers.  While I admit the State has been fairly generous in the provision of grants for people wishing to build their own houses, I feel a certain class of small farmer has been overlooked.  Under the present system of grants these people cannot possibly afford to build their own houses.  At present the cost of building a house varies between <Col N="1080" /> £1,600 and £1,800.  If the farmer's valuation is under £12 he can get a grant of £250 from the Department and a further grant of £250 from the local authority.  That gives him a total of £500.  But no farmer under £12 valuation can possibly make up the difference between £500 and £1,600 or £1,700.  He will not get a loan from the county council because the council is empowered to give loans only to people in the higher income group.</P>
    <P>I believe the Department should give careful consideration to that section of the rural community.  You have local authorities who would not build a cottage for a man of £4, £5 or £6 valuation.  That man is nothing but a glorified labourer, but he is classified as a small farmer.  In fact, he is neither a farmer nor a labourer.  Under the present system of grants he cannot build for himself because he could not get security in the bank to raise £1,400. The Minister should set a headline by allowing local authorities to build houses for farmers under a certain valuation.  Even if they have to pay extra rent, I am sure the majority of them would welcome such a move.</P>
    <P>A matter to which I am very anxious to refer on this Estimate is the question of unemployment and the emigration caused by it.  Month after month we have our population slipping away and still our unemployment rises.  At the moment in North Tipperary we have no more than 250 people employed on roads where in the past we would have between 480 and 500.  A lot of this is caused by the fact that the council uses more machinery. We are told by the county manager and the engineers that the use of machinery will save money.</P>
    <P>While I do not at all doubt that the use of machinery will save money if used in the proper way, I believe local authorities can still employ a considerable number of workers.  In North Tipperary it is the practice that if the council start to tar-spray early in June they try to get the work done by the end of the month.  The result is that they bring in contractors from outside. I believe if the council used their own machinery exclusively and spread the work over the whole summer they <Col N="1081" /> could employ far more men and thus help to bring down the emigration figures and eradicate a lot of the evils that go with emigration.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan referred to the County Managers' Association.  I should like to ask the Minister for an assurance that the association will negotiate only on their own behalf.  It would be unfair if, having formed an association with a chairman and secretary, the county managers went on to decide what each local authority should have or should not have.  What might be good for, say, Sligo-Leitrim or Kerry might not be good for Laois-Offaly, Kildare or Tipperary.  How the County Managers' Association can fix round figures and hope to apply them to all the counties I do not know. I agree they are entitled to an association to look after their own interests but the council members who have been elected by the people to represent them should decide what is good for their respective areas.</P>
    <P>During the last local elections we heard a lot of criticism from electors who had not been notified of their eligibility to vote.  Many people were under the impression that they had no vote when they were not notified by post.  In future I hope that all people entitled to vote in local elections will receive notification by post as they do in Dáil elections.  We are arriving at a stage where people have become indifferent as to whether they should vote in local elections.  On of the things which can be blamed for that attitude is that many people are under the impression that those they might elect have no say whatever in the running of local affairs&mdash;that the managers have all the power.  People are losing interest in elections.  I would urge the Minister to make sure that people receive proper notification of the time and place they are to vote in local elections so that interest in them might be revived.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan pointed out, correctly I thought, that a number of local authorities do not know what functions they have.  The trouble is that even when we do know our functions we have no appeal when we think decisions are wrong.  We had a <Col N="1082" /> case quite recently in North Tipperary where the county manager came before the county council looking for £6,000 with which to build an office for the engineering staff.  After long consideration the council turned down the application on the ground that the ratepayers could not bear the extra burden.  After four or five months the manager came again before the council and spoke of the engineers' families and the ill-health that might follow if the staff were not properly housed in good offices.  The council passed the application, but when the offices were built the manager and his staff moved in.  I believe the Minister should investigate that case and any others like it to ensure that money voted by local authorities for a certain purpose is used for that purpose only.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's attitude to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  In North Tipperary we carried out a vast amount of work on river and road drainage.  We became so anxious to carry on the good work on a very large river, which is too large for the local authority to attack single-handed and too small to benefit under an arterial drainage scheme, that we decided to put by a certain amount of money every year for the purpose of improving it.  We employed an engineer to make a survey of the river.  He spent some time carrying out the survey and estimated the cost would be in the region of £56,000.  When we had our survey just finished and the recommendation made the Minister had closed down on the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister stated&mdash;I have not got the statement but I may yet get it&mdash;that where any council could prove that they had spent a certain amount of money on a portion of the work or on carrying out a survey of work prior to the suspension of the Act, he would sanction the council continuing the work.  I put down questions twice drawing the Minister's attention to the fact that we in North Tipperary had spent money on the Carrickahorig and Cloughjordan Rivers and I have not yet got an answer from him.  I believe the Minister, in other cases, has allowed local <Col N="1083" /> authorities to continue work started or about to start when the Act was suspended.</P>
    <P>I believe it was a big mistake to suspend that Act.  A vast amount of good work was being done under it. Money may have been badly spent&mdash; we were told it was&mdash;in certain cases but as far as North Tipperary is concerned our council spent the money wisely and with good results.  The Act gave good employment because it was a scheme which involved no big machinery; it covered cases where a road or possibly a bog was being flooded or where a river overflowed good land.  The work was done by local labour with very little machinery and I think it gave a very good return for the money.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister or to his successor, whoever will be in power in the future, to revive the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I would go so far as to say that its suspension was due to jealousy between Ministers on one side or the other.  When a Minister on one side brings in something, the Minister who succeeds him from the other side feels he must undo that, but whoever brought in the Local Authorities (Works) Act, good work was done under it in my constituency and I am sorry it has been thrown overboard.  I ask the Minister to consider carefully the question I have put to him because we have spent a vast amount of money on the Carrickahorig scheme and that he should give the local authority permission to finish that work.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long but I feel I should say that, to many of us, particularly those coming from city constituencies, the activities of the Department are related in the main to the local authority house building programme. Listening to debates here over several years I have always felt that very often, in speeches criticising the Minister irrespective of who he is, very often the Deputies fail to realise&mdash;and because of that the country fails to realise&mdash;the tremendous progress that has been made by successive Governments in rehousing the people.  All of <Col N="1084" /> us are at times inclined to be too partisan in that respect and we fail to pay tribute to the fellow on the other side who also made progress with this problem.</P>
      <P>The fact is that anybody with an eye in his head can go into any constituency, particularly in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Waterford and see for himself the tremendous progress made by Cumann na nGaedheal, Fianna Fáil, and by the inter-Party Government in rehousing our people.  Because of our Party affiliations I think we have failed up to now to stick out our chests a bit and to realise and publicise the progress we have made in that respect.  It is something of which all of us should be tremendously proud.  We should each in our small way take pride in the fact that somehow or other we made a contribution to that housing progress.  We can agree that the present Minister and his predecessor can hold their heads high in that regard and say that each of them has made a contribution and that those who stood behind them and supported them irrespective of Party also made a contribution.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I think there may be a tendency at this stage, because of the tremendous progress that has been made, to become complacent about the matter and the Minister or his advisers may be inclined to sit back on a soft chair and say: &ldquo;The back is broken in this problem and we can take things easy now.&rdquo;  I understand that some spokesmen of the Government&mdash;not the Minister, but some of his colleagues&mdash; have indicated that the problem is solved and that we need scarcely do anything more about it.  We know&mdash; and the Minister must realise&mdash;that the problem is far from solved, particularly in the cities of Cork and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take Cork City for a moment.  We need 2,000 more houses at present. There is no use in saying: &ldquo;We have the back of the problem broken.&rdquo;  That is true but nevertheless these 2,000 families are still awaiting houses.  I must say that, in an effort to carry a point in that regard, several excuses and arguments have been advanced by the Department against the unanimous contention of Cork Corporation that <Col N="1085" /> we still need 2,000 houses.  The Corporation has issued directions such as that anybody living outside the City borough should not be rehoused.  When I say they should not be rehoused I want to be quite clear about it.  The Corporation will not get the subsidy they would get if the man lived within the borough.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do the position regarding the very restricted and limited borough we have in Cork.  Several hundreds, if not thousands, of people are living immediately outside the boundary working in Fords, Dunlops, on the docks, on the railways and with the bus company, people who are citizens of Cork but because they are living just outside the boundary, the city manager has to say &mdash;and to a large extent the council has to agree with him&mdash;that they are outside the pale.  They cannot be regarded as legitimate applicants for council houses because the Minister and his Department can say to the city manager: &ldquo;If you house these people you will not get the two-thirds subsidy you would get for people inside the city boundary.&rdquo;  That is completely unrealistic and a&mdash;I hesitate to say it&mdash; dishonest method of restricting the activities of Cork Corporation.  It is a dishonest method of writing down the requirements of the Corporation so far as housing is concerned.</P>
    <P>That is one category but there is another.  We are also told: &ldquo;you will not get the full subsidy if you rehouse any family already living as subtenants in a corporation house.&rdquo;  On the face of it that might appear to be all right.  It might be said that it is to discourage any tenant of a corporation house from taking in a sub-tenant. I am quite sure that the Minister and his Department know that 99.9 per cent of the people whom we classify as sub-tenants are boys and girls who have got married out of their own homes and who have brought their husbands or wives back there.  We have been faced in the city of Cork with cases in which a boy of twenty or twenty-one got married and brought his wife to live with his parents.  It was simply a makeshift arrangement until such time as he could get accommodation for himself, but such people were <Col N="1086" /> immediately told by the corporation at the behest of the Department of Local Government that they were subtenants and they could not be rehoused.</P>
    <P>They were told that the corporation could re-house them if they wished but that if they did so they would not get the subsidy to which they would be entitled if these people had taken themselves into a garret or a tenement.  I would ask the Minister to take another look at that matter and to make himself conversant with it.  The vast majority of decent people who are looking for corporation houses are young people living with a father-in-law, a mother-in-law, or with their own people.  You also have the situation where many newly married people are living in private flats and, because they are not on the waiting list for very long and have not got the number of children that would qualify them for a house, they are disregarded as well.  I would ask the Minister to have a real look at this situation and see it as it really is rather than take the peculiar viewpoint taken of it by some of his advisers.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I think that the Minister at some stage previously indicated his desire to encourage people to own their own houses, to build or to buy their own houses.  As far as I know in my own local authority, there is unanimity of opinion in that regard.  Everybody feels that every encouragement should be given to people to build or purchase their own houses but I regret to say that any recent schemes&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;recent&rdquo; I mean schemes within the last two or three years&mdash;that have been sent up to the Minister for sanction by Cork Corporation where the corporation envisaged the building of houses and the allocation of purchase tenants to these houses, have been turned down flatly by the Department.</P>
    <P>I remember one scheme which was agreed by all the members of the corporation, irrespective of Party, to be an ideal scheme to appoint tenants under conditions by which they could purchase their own houses.  It was sent to the Minister and to his predecessor and the answer we got was: <Col N="1087" />&ldquo;I do not think you should embark on a scheme of that kind until you have all your slums cleared.&rdquo;  The clearance of slums is a different problem altogether and I would ask the Minister to check up on this particular question.  I think it was a disgraceful decision on the part of the Minister that, in spite of all the lip service that is being given to encouragement to people to buy their own houses, when a responsible body sent a scheme to the Minister they were told that it could not be done at the moment and that they should look after their slums first.</P>
    <P>The Cork Corporation or the Dublin Corporation can look after their slum problems in conjunction with the other problem of developing schemes enabling people to build or purchase their own houses.  Apart from houses that might be built by the corporation, I should like to make this remark with regard to people who seek to build their houses under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  I do not blame the Department entirely for this.  They have to take certain safeguards but I have had experience of people coming to me and I was deeply interested in their step by step progress.  I must say that it is a most frustrating experience for anyone to go along and start from scratch, to get his builder, to get his site, to endeavour to get his loan, to endeavour to get his grant and, last of all, to endeavour to get his supplementary grant.</P>
    <P>Anyone I know who ever undertook a task of that kind never recommended it to his neighbour.  He felt that instead of being encouraged by the local authority and by official sources he was viewed with suspicion from the very word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  He felt that he was regarded as a person who had to be tolerated but who was not to be encouraged.  I hope that that is not the situation generally but I have seen too many instances where decent, hard working men, newly married men, endeavoured to undertake this tremendous task, men who were putting a millstone around their necks and who got everything but encouragement. One would think that the Department of Local Government, as its <Col N="1088" /> name connotes, would be a helpful Department, not alone to the local authority but also to the local ratepayer, and that they would assist in every respect.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest regard for the officials of the Department of Local Government and I have seen instances of the very fine work they have carried out, not alone in the higher sphere but in every sphere of local government as well.  However, I very often feel that their lines of communication are not what they might be and that they find themselves a bit out of touch and do not see the problems as the local councillor and the local council see them.</P>
    <P>I often feel that the Department of Local Government might send its officials around the country to discuss with local corporations and county councils the problems that confront them.  Having said that, I wish to compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has been running his Department and the officials for the courtesies they have extended to all Deputies in the day-to-day problems that we bring before them.  I do feel that the Minister and his advisers might address themselves to the few little problems that I have outlined because they are real problems which I genuinely bring to the notice of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters raised in this discussion have been so varied and so numerous that it may prove to be impossible to cover all of them.  One matter to which a considerable number of speakers referred was the question of the recent local elections, the low poll, the reason for it, and what can be done about it.  Certain Deputies advocated legislation, which is not at all in order in this debate, so that these things may be done.  I should like to point out to the House, if it is necessary to do so, that there is in existence a committee which was set up to consider the various aspects of our electoral laws.  Any legislative changes which will follow from their deliberations will, I hope, go a long way to remove the shortcomings that <Col N="1089" /> Deputies seem to believe to exist and to have a very big effect on the carrying out of elections.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the low poll, it would seem that Deputies believe that the fact that there was no notification to individual voters of the election or as to the place where they were to vote was of paramount importance, that the sending of a card, as is done in the case of a general election, would bring out practically every voter to the polling booth.  I do not think that is true.  I do not even agree that it is necessary that cards should be issued.  A comparison of the percentage polls in the recent elections with the figures for past local elections, when cards were not issued either, would seem to suggest that our people have become less intelligent, that they do not know what is in the papers, that they do not listen to the radio and that it can be suggested that an election can take place without their knowing about it.  I do not agree that that is so.</P>
      <P>Whatever methods may be adopted in future to improve the poll in these elections, and from my point of view I would be very glad to see the percentage poll increasing rather than decreasing, let us give credit to those who came out in the recent elections and let us consider that a 60 per cent. poll has not been unusual, according to my information.  In fact, some of the few returns that have been submitted officially to my Department, as is the procedure after all elections, show that some areas polled over 80 per cent. That will give food for thought to those who say that there is something wrong with the system, that there is something wrong with the people or that there is something wrong with the candidates. An examination of all three aspects might prove worth while.  Credit must be given to those people who came out in big numbers to exercise the franchise and to elect the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One factor which may have affected the recent elections and other elections is the time of year in which the elections are held.  I have heard more adverse comment on the holding of the elections in the month of June, in what was, fortunately, excellent weather, than I have ever heard before.  Coming <Col N="1090" /> from rural Ireland, as I do, I am very much inclined to think that we might consider a change from the month of June.  The month that I might mention here and now could be worse.  I do not know.  I do feel, from the comments that I have heard, that the excellent weather experienced on the day the elections were held generally had a detrimental effect on the poll.</P>
    <P>Dublin seems to have been the worst offender in regard to this matter but not a much greater offender in this election than in some past local elections.  It would be almost true to say that there were more people watching the Canada Cup competition in Portmarnock than voted in the entire city area.  The holding of the election on the day of the Canada Cup competition was unfortunate.  It is hard to blame the people who went to Portmarnock.  We must be very grateful to those who did attend at Portmarnock and who voted.  Others went there and did not bother about voting.</P>
    <P>That may indicate complete lack of confidence in the local authority.  On the other hand, it may indicate quite the opposite.  Who is to say which of the two deductions is correct?  I certainly would not like to state categorically that a low poll means lack of confidence in a local authority. I could well make the case, if I had to, in certain instances that I am aware of where a low poll would reflect the opposite view, that from their knowledge of the local authorities and the members who acted on them in years gone by, the people regarded them as being so useful and of so high a standing that they thought the council would be all right this time even if they did not vote.  Of course, if everybody felt the same way about it we would have no results.</P>
    <P>The committee now dealing with this matter is representative of the entire House and I have no doubt that any Deputy who feels that he has something useful to suggest will find his way to some of the committee members, have the suggestion put before them and that the committee will give it every consideration.  In turn, in the report, which I hope will not be very long delayed, we may get the <Col N="1091" /> answer to a number of the problems discussed in this debate in regard to making the elections a better reflection of the opinions of the entire electorate.</P>
    <P>The managerial system was referred to by a number of Deputies.  Deputy Sweetman was one of the first speakers to refer to this matter.  All I want to say to Deputy Sweetman and to other members of his Party is that in 1955, after due and careful deliberation and consideration by the then Government, the Minister for Local Government brought in an amendment to the Management Acts and, apart from some few minor changes, there was nothing of any great importance in it. In turn, I would be inclined to say to Deputy Sweetman and to the Deputies who were in the Party at that time that that Management Act of 1955 was an act of faith by the then Government and the Fine Gael Party in particular in the managerial system in which now, after a few short years, they seem to find all the faults in the world.</P>
    <P>It has been said also by Deputy Sweetman that newly elected members of local authorities should be notified by my Department of their powers.  A booklet was published in 1955 which set out the law quite briefly in regard to the powers of the elected members of local authorities.  Local authorities as such are at liberty to issue these booklets to the new members who will not as yet have got them.  I take it the older members, and those of some years standing in their respective councils, will have copies and I am sure copies will be made available to new members who have not already got them.  If, as a result of their perusal of those booklets, there are still doubts which cannot be easily resolved by members of local authorities, I am sure the officers of my Department who know most about these matters will be only too glad to inform any council, or members of a council, on any aspect in regard to their rights under the law.</P>
    <P>It was suggested also that the county secretary should be obliged to advise the elected members, particularly in relation to any matter that would appear to have come into dispute between the manager as such and the <Col N="1092" /> elected body.  While that, on the surface, would appear to be a very reasonable and useful suggestion it would only arise in the case of a dispute between the manager and the elected body as to their respective rights.  We would then have the position in which the secretary, who is a subordinate of the manager, would take sides against his own boss. Both of them are, in fact, the servants of their elected local authority and owe their full allegiance at all times to their elected body who is their direct boss.  In no way are they controlled by the Department of Local Government. If there is an erroneous opinion abroad that the county managers are the instruments of the Department of Local Government to impose their will on the local authorities, the sooner that is removed from the minds of all elected members the sooner will the elected bodies take their rightful place and do their rightful job in our present system in co-operation with the manager.</P>

      <P>May I put it this way? The council can suspend the manager, but the manager cannot suspend the council or a councillor.  We shall leave it at that for the moment.  I shall probably come back to some of the more detailed points raised by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy P.J. Burke raised the question of the payment of rates by instalments. This is a hardy annual and it appears in different garbs in every discussion on Local Government to which I have listened over the years I have been in this House.  It is suggested that the payment of rates by instalments should be arranged for the people who find it difficult to make up their rates in two payments in the year. The existing legislation provides for the payment of rates in two moieties. Nevertheless collectors have authority to accept instalments.  I know a fair number of rate collectors who, if they <Col N="1093" /> are offered the rates in instalments, will not sue for the balance.  The majority of rate collectors are tactful and they know how best to collect the few pounds in the softest possible manner in order that everyone will pay his due and the collector himself will fulfil the collection of his warrant within the prescribed time.  In view of the fact that that authority does exist for the collector to make this mutual arrangement with any of his ratepayers, I do not think it would be advisable&mdash;dangers could arise and make it nearly impossible to get the rates in in a uniform manner&mdash;to introduce legislation for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke also mentioned his anxiety to have water and sewerage extended, and extended more quickly, to places in County Dublin still without these services.  So far as my Department and the Government are concerned, it is scarcely necessary to say that we have taken every opportunity during the past eight or ten months to try to bring home to everybody that it is our anxiety that the amenity of piped water should be extended to all parts within the next ten years.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, behind the scenes, as Deputies who are members of local authorities may be aware, we have been in touch with local authorities, including those in county Dublin, asking them to get down to a proper survey of their entire needs and to proceed with a planned campaign for their particular areas.  I can only say to Deputy Burke, as a member of Dublin County Council, that anything he and the other members of that council can do by way of suggesting improvements will be only too readily accepted by my Department and every effort in that direction will be facilitated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke also mentioned the North Dublin Regional Supply Scheme No. 2.  This is one of the largest schemes we have yet encountered and will probably cost in the region of £1,000,000.  A decision on this scheme is pending at the moment and, while it might appear that some little time has elapsed, because of its magnitude and the various technical difficulties that must arise in such a large scheme, the time we have had this scheme under <Col N="1094" /> review in my Department is not long at all.  However, we hope to have a decision on the preliminary plan in the very near future and, in fact, a conference recently begun between my Department and the officers of the county council has reached a fair degree of agreement on the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch from Waterford spoke in relation to road traffic, and pressed home his point very vigorously; he asked why a German traffic expert should be brought into this country?  I think he was referring to the Dublin Corporation's appointment of a German not so long ago who has, unfortunately, since died.  However, the issue was not the personality of the man but rather an argument to the effect that, because the accident rate in Germany would on figures appear to be appalling, anybody of that nationality could not be an appropriate expert to employ in this country.  May I say of the gentleman, who has since died, that he was regarded internationally, and certainly in Europe, as one of the leading experts on traffic problems?  It was because the Dublin Corporation were anxious to get the best, and only the best, that this man was brought in.  Deputy Lynch's argument that he was not the best because the figures of those fatally injured in Germany are higher than they are in this country, is completely illogical and has no semblance of common sense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan suggested that the wearing of crash helmets should be enforced. I am sorry Deputy Coogan is not here at the moment.  This matter is one for the Road Traffic Bill of which much mention has been made and of which I shall have something to say later. There are arguments against trying to enforce any such regulation or law and I might say it has been tried out in England where it is quite a problem and where it has been considered very fully.  This is a matter that can and will be considered in the Road Traffic Bill and the members of the House will have ample opportunity to discuss that and any other aspect of such matters they desire to discuss.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan also referred to the noise of motor cycles and I think quoted the case of some young chap who fitted a gadget on his motor bicycle <Col N="1095" /> to make it more noisy than his neighbours'.  That matter does not require new legislation.  There are regulations on this subject which are contained in Article 6 (3) of the Mechanically Propelled Vehicles (Construction, Equipment and Use) Order 1934. Those regulations are for the Garda Síochána to enforce and the question of somebody trying to make more noise than these machines can make already certainly requires investigation. Possibly the Deputy who raised the matter can furnish the information as to where this noise-maker hangs out and thus bring about some toning down in the noise he has been making up to the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman spoke quite caustically in regard to road accidents and with reference to the Road Traffic Bill which has been so long coming to this House.  I think he summed up by saying that most of the accidents were caused by stupidity and bad driving and not by speed.  He also said that, generally speaking, our roads are better than roads in the Six Counties but that the standard of driving here is much worse than in the Six Counties.  I suppose one person's opinion is as good as another in regard to road accidents but I think it goes much wider than just a question of stupidity and bad driving. There are not just one or two causes. There are many causes; I doubt if anyone could name all of them and there is no one cure unfortunately.</P>
    <P>All we can do is take the various steps in our power to reduce the accident rate which is appallingly high for a community of our size.  We can help by legislation and we can follow that up by the enforcement of that legislation. We can try by propaganda and every other means at our disposal to deal with the situation.  In the White Paper driving tests are proposed which can help in ensuring greater safety in the future by inculcating better driving habits.  The Department of Local Government has the task of bringing in laws and regulations governing the road and its use by vehicles, and all the rest.  However, enforcing those laws and regulations is <Col N="1096" /> for another Department, the Department of Justice, and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Despite opinions expressed to the contrary, we have had in various ways a fairly continuous campaign in regard to road safety over the years.  It was suggested that television could be used for this purpose as well as for other educational purposes.  Deputies can rest fully assured that that opportunity will not be missed if and when the time arrives to use that medium.</P>
    <P>On the engineering side, we realise that road construction has a great bearing and will have an increasing bearing on our road safety in the future.  I shall not weary the House at this stage with this question because undoubtedly we shall have a very full discussion on all these matters when we come to the Road Traffic Bill, but there are statistics over a number of years to show that the improvement of roads and the removal of hazards and dangerous bends which have caused accidents in the past have been worthwhile from the point of view of their safety value, apart altogether from their convenience to the motoring public who use them.  The records of tests and counts carried out are most convincing and to those who are critical in this matter of improving certain roads and taking away bends, may I say that this is only done in regard to first, places of danger by their proved accident rate and secondly, where a road because of its deterioration has to be improved and if we do not do a full job on it now we would have to do it again in a few years, which would be bad economics?  Only in those two instances is a fairly elaborate job done on our main roads. In every case since 1958 in relation to the removal of bends and the widening and improving of main roads, in advance of its coming to my Department for sanction that work has been approved by the elected representatives of the local authority for which the job is being done.</P>
    <P>That in itself, I think, does guard against what might be a dangerous procedure of possibly spending more money than we can afford on doing a job over-well and, at the same time, <Col N="1097" /> neglecting other necessary jobs in a particular district.  The local authorities, as you know, have the approving of these particular schemes before they come to me.  That was intimated to them in 1958 by a special circular letter and it cut out the grouse local authorities had for years that they usually knew little, if anything, about the main road proposals in their areas until after they had come back sanctioned by the Department of Local Government, having been submitted to it without their knowledge in detail by the county engineers.</P>
    <P>That, as I say, has been changed, and if in any county a job is being done today on the removal of a bend, or any other work that appears to be extravagant while other roads need care not so very far away from that particular point, it must be looked at very critically because you can rest assured the local authority members, conscious of all the demands of people in their areas, would have examined and approved that job prior to its being submitted for sanction to me at all.</P>
    <P>The question of road signs was also raised by Deputy Sweetman and other Deputies, and also the question of removing signs after a hazard has been eliminated on a roadway.  I agree with the Deputy that it is a rather silly situation to find a double bend sign still showing on a straight road, the double bend having been removed a few years ago.  All I would say in that case is that the local engineer should certainly be talked to in no uncertain terms, whenever members of the local authority concerned come to observe any such laxity.  There is no excuse for it.  As Deputy Sweetman said, such an occurrence may possibly lead to a fatal accident further along that roadway where there is another double bend sign and the assumption is that it means the same as the other one, that the road is straight whereas, in fact, it is not straight.</P>
    <P>With all the numerous signs that are made available to local authorities they will have to be looked at critically. I would say to the members of this House and to members of local authorities that in their respective <Col N="1098" /> areas they will have to look at these things and examine them with a critical eye, because it is a huge undertaking to signpost all the roads in this country.  It is a job that is going on pretty steadily and it would be a pity that money, time, energy and thought should be going to waste in any case through lack of criticism on the part of local representatives who see these things as they go around their areas every day.  May I also say in regard to signposting that the signs we have to use here, certainly those coming into use and which have come into use recently are, I think, of international standard and that it is the intention for the future that all our signs should conform to the standards agreed to internationally?</P>
    <P>This, as Deputies can well appreciate, is very necessary in this country where we are attracting more and more foreign visitors and, even though they may not have any knowledge of the two languages we may use on our signs, nevertheless the use of the particular type of sign they would have seen at home in their own language would adequately convey to them what it means.  That is the pattern that has been followed and the Deputies who raised this matter of lack of uniformity in signs need have little worry in that respect because, while some of the old signs may be out of step with the present trend in this matter, the overall picture is that the new signs, the recently erected signs and all signs erected in future, will conform to an international pattern and should be of even greater use because of that.</P>
    <P>The new Road Traffic Bill was referred to by quite a number of Deputies and let me say that I have been castigated here on several occasions because of the delay in presenting it to the House.  On many occasions, including this debate, it has been thrown up to me that all I had to do was bring it in, that it was already in existence and that I had nothing to do but to take it to the House.  Deputy O'Donnell, speaking in this debate on 22nd June, last, as reported at column 291, Volume 183 of the Official Report, made a statement to the effect that he <Col N="1099" /> had assured the present Taoiseach in June, 1956, that a sub-committee of the Cabinet was actively engaged in the drafting of a Road Traffic Bill and that such a Bill was then in draft.</P>
    <P>However, on the 8th May, 1956&mdash; this is going back to the time to which he adverted the other night&mdash;he said, as reported in Volume 157, Column 158 of the Official Report, that a Road Traffic Bill was &ldquo;in course of preparation&rdquo;. Those who have been members of any Government will fully appreciate there is a vast difference between a Road Traffic Bill, or any other Bill, being in course of preparation and a Bill being in draft, or drafted, which would seem to be the comparison that is now made.  The suggestion now made, possibly unwittingly, though I do not really know&mdash;I am not saying this to Deputy O'Donnell but it is really typical of the general attitude which has been adopted in this House &mdash;is that there was nothing for me to do but bring along a Bill already prepared in full detail by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>That is not so.  Far from being so, there are points in this Bill, and in the proposed draft of a Bill talked about in May, 1956, that were so difficult of solution that the then Government, at a somewhat later stage, while they reached agreement on many points, left unresolved some of the outstanding matters such as the question of driving tests.  As the Minister responsible for bringing the entire Bill to the House ultimately, I had to know what was in it and, mind you, there is quite a lot in it as those who have gone through it already must know.  It is not just a question of new fundamental ideas being put across.  It is not just a question of driving tests, speed limits and lighting regulations, but it is a question that the whole code of traffic law is being revised and that a new Act, superseding all the other Acts, will, in fact, come into operation and, to a layman, as I am myself, it took some digesting to appreciate really what it was all about.</P>
    <P>Then came the difficulty of these controversial matters such as driving tests, speed limits and other things which the previous Government as I <Col N="1100" /> say, having considered them, did not resolve because they were difficult and controversial matters.  It was because this whole question was so controversial that a White Paper was brought into being, rather than that we should come in as a Government and say: &ldquo;Here is the new traffic code; that is what we think,&rdquo; and give nobody an opportunity of going into the various pros and cons which undoubtedly exist in regard to this whole question.  Even getting to the stage of issuing the White Paper took a considerable time.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, a considerable amount of time was left for interested people to make suggestions, criticisms and so on.  In many cases their submissions in writing were followed by verbal discussions. Such discussions are taking place at the moment and we hope to complete them, possibly, within the next week or two.  At that stage my Department and myself will have an opportunity of considering the various views put before us.  Having sifted those views, we shall have to go back to the Government with the revised proposals resulting from the suggestions we have had from the public.  The Government will then have to go into the matter in detail.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest delays in bringing the legislation before the House will be the drafting of the legislation in its final, detailed form in the draftsman's office.  I understand that will take some months.  We certainly hope to cut that time as fine as possible, but four or five months are suggested.  I am suggesting however that we should have it in three months, but the draftsman's office is not my office and other matters must be dealt with there as well.  We hope to have the reactions of the public to the White Paper sorted out within the next week or so and to agree on the final form in which it will go to the draftsman's office.</P>
    <P>I am hoping to have the legislation introduced in the House certainly before the end of the next session, in other words, within the present calendar year.  That is my intention, and whether we reach that goal or not, any delay will not be entirely of my making because it will depend on how long the drafting of the Bill will <Col N="1101" /> take.  Even at this stage I am told that it will be difficult to put proper legal phraseology on some of the matters it is intended to cover in the Bill.  However, we can only hope for the best in that regard, and we in the Department shall endeavour to get the Bill to the House in the next session. At that stage we shall have ample opportunity of discussing the various items which we might have discussed on this Estimate, but which I think it would be more appropriate to leave over until then.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell mentioned the question of the cutting of hedges.  He suggested there was ample power to have these hedges cut if farmers were not inclined to co-operate or if for any reason they were not in a position to cut the hedges themselves.  He also said they could be dealt with under the heading of tourism when they interfered with scenic amenities.  While I know we have power to ensure that hedges are cut when they are a danger to the roadway, I do not think we are in the position to require the compulsory cutting of hedges for any other reason.  It is a matter that possibly will have to be dealt with.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy O'Donnell that, particularly in our tourist centres, it is a pity that so much of the beauty of the countryside&mdash;sometimes the best view&mdash;is very often missed by visitors because hedges are so high or are not trimmed.  I know that councils do insist on hedges being cut where they are damaging the roadway itself, but I do not think they have power to go further than that.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Donnell also raised a question in regard to the rating of half rents.  I am sure he will be glad to know that a certain agreement on this has been reached at Government level and that the matter will come before the House in the not-too-distant future.  The Deputy also made some suggestions in regard to sanitary services, water schemes, engineering staff and housing staff.  He suggested that the part-time, appointed officers we had in the housing service over the years, and whose posts have since been abolished, should be brought back into the service.  He said that would result in a reduction of architectural costs to the applicant.  The Deputy may have overlooked the fact, or indeed may not have been aware of it, that one of the prime considerations in my getting rid of appointed officers in some areas was the fact that architectural fees were rising, and the fact that they were acting in this alleged dual capacity made things difficult for applicants, and put them in a position that they had to pay much while getting very little in return.  The situation was, in fact, a direct contradiction of what the Deputy felt would happen if these appointed officers were brought back.  That was the main consideration in my mind when I came to the <Col N="1103" /> conclusion that it would benefit the applicants and that the work would be done more expeditiously, and at no greater cost, by our own inspectors.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested in a rather scathing sort of way that the setting up of a committee to deal with our water resources was just another committee and that this idea of the Minister was putting the matter on the long finger. But let me get it straight.  The question of this committee is not a question of putting the whole water supplies idea on the long finger.  This has to do with the utilisation of the water resources of the country, with the disposal of the water and particularly of waste water, and as there are all sorts of interests involved, particularly in the disposal of waste, it is obvious that the solution was to get these interests represented. This committee is the result.</P>
    <P>I may say now that it in no way will alter the intention of this Department to push ahead with its sanitary services scheme and its piped water supply scheme.  The committee may do very useful work in informing all concerned on the various aspects of the problem of disposal of waste water which has given rise to so many troubles in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The question of engineering staffs was mentioned also by Deputy O'Donnell. The question of taking on extra staff if they are required is not just the be-all and end-all of our idea of going ahead with the water scheme.  I merely indicated that if additional staff proves to be required as a result of the activities of any local authority which is proceeding with a water scheme, the recommendation of that authority's engineering staff will be given the Department's blessing so that the authority concerned can more quickly get on with the useful work.  If the additional staff are to be there the need for them will have to be shown and if the need is shown the cause is good and they will have no difficulty in getting this Department's sanction to the additional employment.</P>
    <P>The much vexed question of housing was mentioned so often by so many Deputies in so many different ways that it is rather difficult to know what a true <Col N="1104" /> summing up of the entire proceedings would be if one were asked to give an opinion and a conclusion on what was said here.  We have in this country over a number of years done a magnificent job of house building.  Undoubtedly there was a colossal job to be done as far back as 1932 but it was tackled in a most definite and courageous manner and carried on in face of all sorts of adversity.  There can be no gainsaying that.</P>
    <P>It is truly magnificent to be able to say that out of every every three people living in this country it is reckoned on the average one is living in a house that was either built by public funds or with the aid of public funds by way of grants or loans.  That is certainly a staggering figure and certainly it is a terrific compliment to the people, not of our day but of years that have gone, who visualised and had the courage to take on such a colossal task.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about the outstanding parts of the housing programme not yet completed.  But it is a lot easier to face up to those outstanding parts not yet done in the background of the huge job done by those who had to start from scratch.  It took some heart and courage and I cannot fail to point out that tackling the uncompleted part of the programme can now be approached in a more helpful background than in the early thirties or even later.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, the general trend of the debate has been an effort to indicate that everything in house building and Local Government Department financing of house building during the years up to 1957 and from 1954 in particular, was quite good and that there was no trouble whatsoever until we came back as the Fianna Fáil Government in 1957. The figures which have been supplied in this House by way of answer to Parliamentary Questions are being trotted out to show that the number of houses completed during 1957 and 1958 is fewer than in 1956, 1955 and 1954.  Immediately the conclusion is drawn that we have fallen down on house building and that we are, in fact. to blame for fewer houses being built.</P>
    <P>Just let me go back a bit&mdash;if necessary <Col N="1105" /> I can produce the document. In 1956, Deputy O'Donnell, then Minister for Local Government, in this House said that house building was tapering off and that that was a natural sequence to the building that had gone before&mdash;that the meeting of housing needs over the years would naturally bring that conclusion about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the statement and I am glad the Deputy recalls it. In 1957 and 1958 the figures for houses completed in this country fell considerably and we are told to-day that this Government is responsible for that fall.  In the background of the tapering off which was forecast in 1956 and maybe before that&mdash;and without for a moment going into any of the history which went before 1956&mdash;we are now blamed for bringing about a fall in the completion of houses.  The figures are quoted.  The trends have been obvious over a number of years, whether they be of houses completed or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I should now like to give the House a few figures which might give some uplift to those who are crying on their knees to-day about the building programme in this country.  The figures I intend to give are not just how many houses were completed yesterday or last week; I shall give the House the total allocation of grants arising from applications since 1955-56 under the heading of new houses, reconstructions, and water and sewerage installations in houses, all of which, I think it will be agreed, contribute to the better housing of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the bulk figures&mdash;and it is bulk figures I have&mdash;the number of allocations for 1955-56 was 15,762; in 1956-57, 14,657; in 1957-58 12,737; in 1958-59, 13,520; and in 1959-60, 19,801.  I am very glad to tell the House that that upward trend is continuing in the early months of 1960-61 at practically the same progressive rate as it did last year.  Those are the figures and if figures tell a story I think the trend there is obvious. One of the obvious points the figures make is that the upsurge came in 1958-59.  That was the year, as the <Col N="1106" /> House will recall, in which the present improved housing grants for repairs and improvements and their availability to a greater number of people came into being under the Act of 1958. Grants were also improved and increased in regard to water and sewerage facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but does that include reconstruction grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is the complete picture, new houses, reconstructions and sanitary grants all combined, over-all figures for all the years.</P>
      <P>Generally, I think it may be claimed that our activity in this sphere is definitely on the upswing and we can expect, under all these heads, increasing activity and improved living conditions throughout the country generally. This was the intention of the 1958 Act which was necessary not only because there might have been somewhat increased costs on previous levels of grants but also to revive the interest of the people in building and to revive their trust in the Government of the day to provide the moneys they promise under these Acts, something which they had come to regard as rather doubtful due to the operations, or lack of operations of the previous Government in regard to these matters.</P>
      <P>Figures that I have already given the House showing percentages of increase in completions convey the same picture of progress that I have just given in terms of thousands of allocations.  You will see from my introductory speech that new houses have increased in the year 1959-60 over the previous year by 21.5 per cent., reconstructions by 20.4 per cent. and water and sewerage installations by 23.4 per cent. I now find that this year, of which only a few months have gone, is showing that on top of the increased percentages I have quoted for last year and the previous year, there is a further 25 per cent. increase in the rate of allocations for new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all private development &mdash; not local authority housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1107" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is private development. The point I want to make is that the rise&mdash;I would say, the phenomenal rise &mdash; which appeared last year in new private housing allocations is, in fact, continuing.  I think that is a trend that no one expected in the private housing sector because the feeling was, as already indicated and believed by many people, that a tapering-off would occur and while we would expect&mdash;in fact, everybody anticipated &mdash; an upswing in repairs, reconstructions and improvement of houses, I think few expected there would be this continuous upswing in allocations for new houses which if it continues for this year will, I think, show almost a doubling of the figure of new house allocations over 1958-59.</P>
      <P>I am not really so concerned about giving figures to refute the allegations made as to how we are doing in housing. I think the people in the building trade themselves know how we are doing, that this activity has improved and increased and that it is increasing at present and will, we hope, continue to increase.  I want to relate the whole matter back to the general choir that has been singing on the Opposition benches, whether in the front bench or in the background, all through this debate.  All members of the Opposition who joined in the debate, no matter on what note they started off, eventually struck the same note, namely to try, I think deliberately, by repetition, to make themselves believe and to convince the people outside the House that there was no question of any financial difficulties in the Government during 1954-57.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why they want to dig that up now I do not know.  Why are their consciences pricking them into making themselves targets here on a matter on which they have not got a leg to stand?  I cannot understand that attitude but, whatever the reason, the same tune to a lesser or greater degree has been played by each of them whether in the front or back benches. That was that there was no lack of money whatever in 1954, 1955, in the late months of 1956 or in the early months of 1957.  The situation they <Col N="1108" /> implied was that the money was there whatever other difficulties there were, but it appears from all the indications we have that, if the money were there, the people who were entitled to it could not get it.  I suppose that comes to the same thing as not having the money.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Department let me state the position in that regard.  We may take three matters so far as moneys and the public are really concerned&mdash;roads, housing and sanitary services.  Let us look at the situation in 1956-57 in regard to these matters.  On the 20th March, 1957, we find that the Road Fund was committed to the tune of £4.1 million whereas three years previous to that its commitments were £1.8 million.  That was, immediately, an additional debt incurred during these three previous years of the Coalition of £2.3 million.  That was one aspect, but let us go right back to the year 1956.  We find that for some reason&mdash; and, of course, listening to the Opposition speakers tonight one would never suggest it was because of want of money&mdash;the Minister for Finance raided the Road Fund to the tune of £500,000 and brought it into the Exchequer at a time when the Road Fund was burdened beyond its capacity.  Why was the Road Fund raided if it was not a problem of money?  For what did they want the money?  Why was it taken and where did it go?</P>
    <P>Again, in regard to the Road Fund, in August 1956, while county and main road progress had got well under way throughout the country, there came, with loud proclamation, a decision of the Government announced by the Minister for Local Government that all main road work should stop on a day that was named and any that could not stop that day should just be tapered off and left there and the money was to go to the county roads. The intention was then that the greater part of the million pounds allocated to the main roads which was still unspent would be saved to the Government in its out-payments for that year because they wanted something to go along with the half million pounds already filched from <Col N="1109" /> the Fund.  It finally worked out that their efforts to save anything in this manner came to nothing.  The wheels of the councils were in motion, the workers were on the job and were not to be denied, and generally speaking no saving such as had been anticipated by the Government or the Department of Finance was made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that what happened was wrong, but what I am saying is that the intention was not to give any more money to the county roads or to give more work to the workers.  The distress signals of the then Government were flying and they wanted to have something salvaged from the Road Fund to relieve pressure at some other point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The date was the 10th September and they had six months in which to spend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made his point but I still say that they were trying to salvage something to meet some pressure that was bursting at another point.  They may deny it, but I still know what I know.  I am putting it to the House that these efforts were not for the purposes which they stated. Let us go on to February of 1957.  The fact remains that the distress signals were then flying for the Coalition Government and all sorts of measures were evolved to stave off the disaster which was overtaking them.  Councils all over the country were notified that they could start spending up to £500,000 of the following year's Road Fund grant on the roads.  That was done, I am sure, to provide more employment out of a Fund which was already practically bankrupt, if not completely bankrupt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> Those three things taken together may be added up by those who may want to add them and backgrounded by the fact that the Road Fund was sunk to the tune of £4.1 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there would be a very big percentage for bridge work.  If the Deputy wants a break-down of the figures, I shall give it to him.  I am giving the facts as against the arguments expressed here. What I am pointing out is that whatever may have been wrong, there was a want of money at that time.  I am talking only for my own Department and I am sure that those now in charge of other Departments have their own tale to tell.  The sum of £4.1 million was the debt then outstanding against that particular fund and also, subject to correction but relying on recollection, £2.6 million was due on foot of debts currently due to local authorities bringing about a situation which left £2 million only for Road Fund grants for 1957/58.</P>

      <P>There was also the National Development Fund out of which was available additional money for road work up to 1954.  The grants given for roads under that heading were compounded together and disappeared as such and became a charge on the Road Fund.  That would have accounted for some part of the increasing debt that was shouldered on to the Road Fund.  On the 20th March, 1957, on the coming into office of the present Government, the then Minister for Local Government, in order to try to keep up the grant, asked for a loan of £1.5 million so that 4,000 of the men who were working on the roads would not have to be paid off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of cheap talk.  On 28th March, 1957, immediate Departmental commitments due to councils throughout the country came with administrative expenses to £2.6 million, leaving a balance of approximately £2 million for the allocation of grants for the ensuing financial year, 1957/58.  The then Minister for Local Government sought a loan from the General Exchequer of £1½ million.  He got £900,000 because of the fact that under the terms of the law then existing no more than £900,000 could be advanced to the Road Fund by way of loan from the Central Fund.  It was only because of the fact that that money was made available from the general Exchequer to the Road Fund that it was possible to continue the grants that had been in existence in the previous year and it was only by virtue of those grants being continued that upwards of 4,000 workmen on the roads were not paid off.</P>
      <P>That is the Road Fund position, viewed against the background of what we have heard here tonight that the then Government were not really in the financial crisis which everybody knew that they were in but which, for some reason, they want to try to make us believe now they were not in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing is the second of the three matters which are of immediate concern to me and which have a bearing on this question of financial standing, solvency or insolvency, as the case may be.  In regard to that period, 1954/57, we find that with all the talk that there is here about tenders and houses going on apace, that they were being built as they were never built before, that there was room for everybody and something for everybody, here is the position: Housing tenders held up on 20th March, 1957, totalled for urban and rural areas combined, £865,685; sanitary services tenders held up amounted to £750,000; giving a grand total in tenders held up at that stage of £1,615,685. That was not all.  Loan instalments on foot of approved loans were then held up also.  In regard to <Col N="1113" /> housing there were then outstanding and held up loan instalments amounting to £1,156,000 and in regard to sanitary services loan instalments on foot of approved loans amounting to £350,000 were held up when we took office. Again, the total of these two figures being £1,506,000 we may add to those two totals the fill-in which it was necessary to get from the general Exchequer into the Road Fund, a contribution from the Government on foot of the debts incurred by their predecessors, amounting to £900,000 which added to the previous figures, gives a grand total of £4,021,685 that had to be found in order to pay the debts incurred by our predecessors in the year 1956 and previous years for the discharge of which they now would tell us that they had plenty of money.</P>

Possibly I am being over charitable in my own mind to Deputy O'Donnell who had the misfortune to be in the Department of Local Government under such trying circumstances in which he was being used more or less as a financial yo-yo by the then Minister for Finance who was juggling about here and there trying to find where he could get money and stopping one gap by opening another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is talking about.  As has been truthfully said, houses cannot be produced by pressing a button.  The number of houses being completed in 1957 and 1958 continued to show a fall.  Even though it was in keeping with the prophecy of the Minister for Local Government in 1956 that there would be a tapering off in building, the tapering off was undoubtedly greater than it should have been, due, as I have already said, to the lack of plans.  Commonsense must dictate that if the plans were not made, if the lands <Col N="1115" /> were not acquired, if the schemes were not put into operation and sent for approval it would be impossible to have the houses in course of construction, never mind completed, in 1957 and by the end of 1958.  It was because we in the Fianna Fáil Government knew that the fall was more than a natural tapering off that we looked around in 1958 to see what remedies we could find to encourage some revival of the building industry which should not have tapered off to such an alarming degree.</P>
      <P>The figures that I gave at the outset tonight are an indication, despite the bad history that was there before we took over, of the success of the measures taken to revive building and to encourage our people to improve their homes, to add sanitary services to them, to build new houses for themselves. The figures are there and cannot be contradicted.  I will leave it at that and leave it to the House to make the decision as to whether or not, on that background in Local Government, anybody would have the barefacedness to say in this House that whatever was wrong about housing, sanitary services, roads and all the rest, in 1956, the Coalition Government were not short of money.  That is the tallest yarn yet and that is really enough said about it.</P>
      <P>A few things were mentioned by Deputy Flanagan.  He talked at very great length and with much repetition about something that seemed to be very dear to his heart, the County Managers' Association or organisation or whatever its name is.  He seemed to think that such an organisation was almost of my manufacture.  He almost seemed to suggest that there were enough secret organisations without another semi-secret organisation being added to them.  He also attributed to that almost-secret organisation, the County Managers' Association, some all-powerful influence in so far as it is concerned with my Department and myself.  He wanted to know how often I met the members of that organisation, what we talked about, how we talked about it, and why local representatives down the country were not made aware of what we were talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> I have never met the organisation. On no occasion have I met the County Managers' Association, or whatever they call themselves.  What exactly their aims and objects are is their own business.  If, however, the House is interested in knowing the last time a Minister for Local Government met the County Managers' Association, I can tell them that it was in that ill-fated February, 1957.  I am sorry; the actual date was the 2nd January, 1957. And he was not alone; he had the Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, with him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan also had something to say about engineers. It was nothing derogatory&mdash;far from it. He suggested that it was lunacy to have a layman a manager with power to veto something a skilled engineer might bring up and which the manager did not like, and he seemed to suggest that the county engineer should have the last word as to how road grant moneys should be spent, without regard to the opinion of anybody else and, in particular, without regard to the opinion of a layman.  Am I to take it from Deputy Flanagan that he would have us set up in each county a system under which the county engineer would fill the roll of absolute dictator as to how Road Fund grants should be spent?  That is what he has suggested. I am amazed really, not because he objects to laymen having a veto but because he suggests that the engineers should be completely free.  That suggestion comes after all these years of fighting to try to retain the power in the council of the elected members. Now a front bench member of Fine Gael gets up and says that, so far as road grants are concerned, the last word, and the only word, should lie with the skilled engineer, and the layman, or anybody else, should have nothing to say in regard to it.</P>

Far be it from me to advocate in any way the forcing of local authorities to do anything, but I am glad that Deputy Tierney, who comes from a rural constituency, feels so strongly in this matter of the housing of small farmers. From my own observation and knowledge, I know that they represent the hard core of people who have yet to be rehoused.  What means we shall adopt, what facilities will be offered, or what inducements will be held out, I do not really know yet, but I can assure the House, and Deputy Tierney in particular, that this is one section which calls at the moment for a fairly high priority listing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I say that these small farmers can be facilitated very considerably by the operation of the &ldquo;Specific Instance&rdquo; house building.  I know that, like all other schemes, there are certain difficulties, but it is nevertheless a scheme designed to meet the needs of the small farmer.  It will give him a suitable house, at a reasonable rent, and one which will be his and cannot be taken from him because of someone else's needs being greater.  Over and above that the house will eventually be vested in him.  Houses to meet the needs of small farmers can be built by local authorities, with the assistance <Col N="1121" /> of a subsidy from the Department. Up to this, so far as housing needs are concerned, the small farmers have not come into their own.</P>
    <P>I would commend, for the time being at any rate, a more widespread operation of the S.I. scheme throughout the country districts.  If there should appear to be any difficulties, then I and the Government will have another look at the scheme in order to iron out such difficulties as may exist.  The scheme can be adapted to meet the needs of practically any case.  In this regard, the needs of the farm labourer must also be considered.</P>

      <P>Would the small farmer come under the heading of labourers for local authority purposes?</P>

      <P>The trouble seems to be that there is no real hard and fast rule about these S.I. houses in so far as their erection for particular people is concerned, but each council which adopts the scheme make their own rules more or less in regard to the scheme, and their own priority list.  In my own county, the priority is&mdash;I think it is too narrow and too confined &mdash; road workers, agricultural labourers and small farmers whose land valuation does not exceed £5. The local authority in Donegal have built a considerable number of such houses over the past six or seven years. They are still building.</P>

      <P>Where a small farmer got a grant five or six years ago, has since married and has now a growing family, is it open to him to apply for and get a reconstruction grant to meet the needs of that growing family?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the purpose of getting information.  If the man got a grant five or six years ago and now needs to extend his accommodation because of a growing family, does he now qualify for another grant for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position was, as Deputy O'Donnell has said, that after ten years a second grant for re-roofing could be obtained, and after 15 years, a grant for general purposes.  The position has now been altered to meet the type of case cited by Deputy Wycherley.  If a man has a growing family and needs extra accommodation now to safeguard against overcrowding, he will certainly be considered for another grant and, in all probability, will get another grant.</P>

      <P>When Deputies who were unavoidably absent when I introduced my Estimate read my speech, they will get fuller details in relation to the change with regard to the second grant.</P>
      <P>This debate has almost outworn its welcome in the House.  So many points were raised that it has been difficult to keep track of all of them.  Deputy Briscoe raised the matter of borrowing powers where there are a number of matters at issue.  Where different services have to be provided for, separate borrowing is made for each service.  Multiple borrowing to cover all services would improve the situation. We hope to introduce legislation to meet this difficulty before the House adjourns for the Summer Recess.</P>
      <P>Finally, if there are any matters which require an answer and which I may possibly have overlooked, if the Deputies who raised them will get in touch with my Department, they will receive the information they want.  I shall certainly try to accommodate any Deputy who requires information.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration&rdquo;&mdash; put.</P>
