      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This is a simple Bill to extend the time for the completion of works in respect of which grants are payable under the Housing Acts.  These works comprise the erection, reconstruction or repair and improvement of dwelling houses and the provision of private water supplies and sewerage facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effective provision of the Bill is contained in Section 2 which provides for an extension from the 1st April, <Col N="1968" /> 1960, to the 1st April, 1962, of the date for the completion of work so as to qualify for payment of any appropriate grant.  No changes in the amounts of the grants are proposed.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive housing measure, consolidating the provisions of the Labourers Acts and the Housing of the Working Classes Acts in a single code and including amendments of the existing codes is in course of preparation. The grant and other relevant provisions appropriate to private housing are also proposed to be consolidated in a single measure when a suitable opportunity presents itself.  I have therefore decided to limit my immediate proposals to a simple continuing measure which, from the very beginning of the new financial year, will enable private persons to plan for the carrying out of house-building and house-improvement works in the next two years, with the knowledge that grants will be available at the rates and on the conditions that have prevailed for the last two years.</P>
    <P>The Housing (Amendment) Act, 1958, provided for increased scales of grants for the reconstruction, repair and improvement of houses, the provision of sanitary services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Before section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  If, on the hearing of an application for the grant of a certificate entitling the applicant to receive a seven-day licence in respect of any premises, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the applicant is at the date of the said application the holder of a six-day licence in respect of the said premises, it shall not be open to the Court to refuse the said application.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of this section, the District Court shall be the appropriate Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Dillon).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing with this matter last night, I had not the advantage of knowing the full strength of these amendments.  Since then, I have studied them carefully and apparently the tide has turned and we are evidently prepared to go to extremes here.  It is the extreme tee-totallers who are the mad &ldquo;boozers.&rdquo; Deputy Blowick last night, I am afraid, gave the impression that he is some kind of a secret drinker, drinking on Sundays in six-day licensed premises. I cannot account for his knowledge of the facts in any other way.  He made a last appeal to the Minister last night on behalf of the &ldquo;poor man who was fond of a pint on Sunday.&rdquo;  Twelve <Col N="1971" /> years ago, Deputy Blowick marched into the Lobby with Deputy Dillon and the rest of the boys to vote against giving that poor man any opportunity of having his pint on Sunday with any kind of ease.  The Deputy will no doubt know what kind of a thirst a man develops over 12 years.</P>
      <P>I should like to examine this fairly. We are told there are 1,100 of these people in the country now.  I cannot imagine that a Commission sat for 12 months and not one of the 1,100 realised that it affected him in any way.  If it affected them, surely they would have come before us.  When I heard Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Boland last night, both of them from Roscommon, and when we are told there are many of those people, surely they had some knowledge of the recommendations the Commission were about to make, but apparently they did not.</P>
      <P>I believe we have entirely too many public houses, and if there is to be a decent livelihood in the business, about 50 per cent. of them should be done away with.  There would then be a livelihood for the others.  Other people thought as I did.  Under the 1927 Licensing Act passed by this House, we had compulsory closing down of public houses.  Certain public houses in each district were closed down under Part IV of that Act and compensation was paid to the man whose premises were closed down.  That compensation was levied on the other publicans in the district.</P>
      <P>At first it was estimated about 1,200 of them a year would be closed.  The Act was brought into operation and under that Act 299 public houses were closed.  Neighbouring publicans had to pay £50,000 compensation and the expenses were £10,000 more&mdash;£60,000 for, one might say, 300 public houses. We can work out the compensation&mdash; it amounts to roughly £170 per public house.  That was all they got for closing but it was too much and that part of the Act was dropped in a hurry because it was too expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1972" /> Now we have these amendments of Deputy Blowick and Deputy Dillon, and Deputy Blowick out-Herods Herod.  Deputy Dillon only requests that if they make application to the court, they should get a licence but Deputy Blowick went a step further. He would force the seven-day licence down their throats by saying that if they did not want the seven-day licence, they must apply within a month.  I understand we are discussing the two amendments together?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When I heard Deputy Blowick last night fighting so hard for the six-day licence holders, I was under the impression that every Sunday Deputy Blowick made for a six-day licensed public house where he knows there is no fear of being raided and where he can drink in peace.  That is the impression he gave me.  I understood he was dealing with his own amendment when he stood up a second time to tell us about the unfortunate country boy who could not get a drink on Sunday.</P>
      <P>We turn then to Deputy Dillon's amendment.  He says that it shall not be open to the court to review the application if a man applies for a seven-day licence.  That is all it will cost him.  Take the publican down in Ballaghaderreen, for instance, with a six-day licence.  First of all, he escapes paying one-seventh of the licence duty because his premises is licensed for only six days of the week.  He has, therefore, escaped a rate of 40/- in the pound on a £5 or £10 valuation over a number of years.  One would not be long making up the £170 that was paid in compensation for a licence in that way, and that has been done.  I am only anxious to save Deputy Dillon from himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is a very foolish man.  Just imagine what will happen.  First, it is not just one-seventh of the licence duty that you escape because it is on one-half of the poor law valuation of the premises that the licence duty is assessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If one's premises is a seven-day licensed premises, the Commissioner of Valuation will come down on top of one and increase the poor law valuation by 50 per cent. anyway.  On that basis, your licence is immediately increased.  Does Deputy Dillon realise now what I am saving him from in this?  If the poor law valuation was £10 on a six-day licensed premises in Ballaghaderreen, the poor law valuation will immediately jump up to £15 and, on that £15, he must pay a licence duty of four-fifths of the valuation, as Deputy Murphy says.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He must pay five-fourths of the increase as licence duty.  Hitherto he escaped one-seventh. On that basis alone, I think Deputy Dillon is very foolish to bring in this amendment.  I believe the Minister is acting fairly, and more than fairly in this.  I do not think any Deputy will admit that there are too few public houses.  Go into any country town to-day and every second house is a pub, all of them eking out a miserable existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That remains to be seen.  I understand that down in the Deputy's part of the country there are some queer pubs, if one can judge from what one hears here.  In <Col N="1974" /> 1927 a public house licence was valued at £170.  That was the value of 299 of them; at a cost of £50,000, plus £10,000 expenses, that represents £60,000 for 299 public houses.  To-day that valuation would be worth £500, taking the increase in the value of money into consideration.</P>
      <P>The owner of a six-day licensed premises comes in here and puts down an amendment in order to get a present of £500.  I see Nick, and that is carrying Nick too far.  The proposal by means of which these people can buy a seven-day licence and transfer it to their six-day premises is, I think, a very fair and reasonable one.  It will reduce the number of licences.  That appears to me to be a much more reasonable approach than giving a gift to 1,100 people of £500 or £600 per man. That is what this amendment asks us to do.  I can see no justification whatever for it, no matter how one looks at it.</P>
      <P>Let us consider another aspect.  Any Garda can report at the licensing session that a public house should be closed.  There may be an appeal to the Circuit Court but, if the Circuit Court upholds the decision, that is an end of the matter.  There is no appeal from the Circuit Court.  Another team may come along and assess the amount of compensation.  A third team can decide the particular publicans who will pay the compensation.  Remembering that the six-day licensee has been saving £10, £15 or £20 a year rates and, at the same time, one-seventh of the licence fee, I wonder would we confer any great benefit on these people by this change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blowick, of course, thinks they should all be converted into seven-day licensed premises overnight, whether they like it or not.  There may be people who do not want to serve drink on Sundays.  I do not know whether one would find many of them at the present time.  Here, however, is a bald proposal to hand out £500,000 to six-day licensed holders.  That is what this amendment amounts to.  If I were to consider who, under this Bill, should be entitled to compensation, I would consider the position of the publicans within three or four miles of Cork, four, five or six miles of Dublin, <Col N="1975" /> and within a certain radius of Limerick and Waterford.  These are the men who are definitely losing a certain amount of trade.  These are the people who would be entitled to some compensation. If I were to consider compensation under this Bill, I should certainly consider them instead of this lunatic proposal brought forward here in the misguided idea that there would be an actual cash down benefit. There will be a financial benefit of over £500,000, £500 per house on 1,100 houses.</P>
    <P>I should like to be reasonable in these matters, but I think this thing has gone too far.  I admire the innocence of a person like Deputy Boland there.  I know how innocent he has always been and how he would swallow any kind of a yarn.  But I do not know where he got the yarn that a man had to pay £800 for a seven-day licence.  If Deputy Beirne were to purchase a seven-day licence in Cork he need not pay £800 for it.  Deputy Boland and his brother-in-arms, Deputy McQuillan, sat side by side on the Liquor Commission for the whole long twelve months and never thought of the poor six-day licence holders in their constituency who would be robbed by this.  By jove, I looked after the Cork men.</P>
    <P>I honestly think Deputy Dillon should withdraw this amendment.  I think he was a very foolish man to introduce it.  He should realise the effect it will have.  Consider the amount that the Valuation Commissioners will place on a six-day licence holder in Ballaghaderreen the moment that licence becomes a seven-day licence and add to that the increased licence duty payable, not on the old valuation but on the new valuation.  In view of that position, I think the amendment should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>This problem of the six-day licensee is really a problem in the main for those licensees situated west of the Shannon or along the Monaghan-Leitrim border.  Having listened to the last speaker more or less ridiculing the suggestion of Deputy <Col N="1976" /> Boland that £800 was paid for a licence, I would recall that Deputy Seán Flanagan, speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, practically told us that some of his clients paid over £600 for licences recently.  I quite believe that.  I suggest that Deputy Corry really does not know what he is talking about when he stands up here and delivers an oration about the Licensing Bill.</P>

      <P>Whatever the Deputy likes to call it.  I was being very charitable.  Last night, Deputy Dillon described the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  This amendment has nothing to do with it, of course, but it was brought into the discussion by the Minister for Lands when he suggested that in the town of Castlebar hackney cars are lined up and people queue up to go out for the purpose of having a drink. It was suggested that these people were entitled to have a drink.  As I understand the licensing law governing the <i>bona fide</i> trade, you can drink to travel but you cannot travel to drink.  I suggest that 95 per cent. of the Deputies do not understand the <i>bona fide</i> law.</P>
      <P>I mention that for the simple reason that the six-day licensees and the seven-day licensees have been, in spite of what any Deputy says here, carrying on an illicit trade for the last 50 years.  All that was required of a man who wanted a drink in the rural areas on Sunday was the inclination and the money to buy the drink.  Whether it was a six-day or a seven-day house, facilities were available to him to get the drink he required.  In certain towns in the West where you have a number of six-day licenced houses they carried on trade on Sundays for the last 50 years.  So did the seven-day licensed houses.  Both of them were carrying on an illegal trade.  If this amendment is not accepted, this Bill will now permit the seven-day licensed house to carry on to the detriment of the six-day licensed house.  In other words, it legalises the trade for one type of house and not for the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> It has been mentioned here that the seven-day licensee is paying a higher licence than the six-day licensee.  That is admitted, I agree.  However, the Poor Law Valuation in respect of the licences paid in the bulk of these rural pubs is small.  In the majority of cases the difference between the two would be almost negligible.  If they were paying £7 or £8 as licence fee that would be the maximum, and the difference between that paid in respect of a six-day house and a seven-day house of similar size would be from 20/- to 25/- or 30/-.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us last night that he intended to bring in an amendment which would go a fair share of the way towards meeting the problems of the six-day licensees. But we did not hear any mention from either the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Justice that these provisions he intended to bring in would apply to the rural areas only. I might ask would they apply to a six-day licensed house situate in one of the four county boroughs?  That is a matter which I think should be looked upon in a completely different light.</P>
    <P>There is the situation that in certain parts of rural Ireland Sunday has become the shopping day.  In certain out-of-the way villages and rural districts you have a lot of six-day licensed houses as grocery shops, small drapery shops, hardware shops and so on.  Now they will have to close to customers who would normally come there for their shopping on Sundays.  As a city publican and a person who is interested in the trade, I suggest that the Minister should give favourable consideration to this proposal which favours the six-day licence holders.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to comment on Deputy Corry's statement that Deputy Blowick, Deputy Dillon and several other Deputies went into the lobby 12 years ago to vote against his amendment.  I was here at that time and I agree that they did, but Deputy Corry failed to mention that, through sour grapes, when his Private Member's motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This amendment will have very far reaching consequences for the licensed trade as a whole.  I do not know why it was brought in at this stage.  We have had many amendments discussed and why Fine Gael should choose to introduce this one now, I do not know.  It is only a few days since Deputy Dillon was acting in the role of theologian, quoting scripture and the Third Commandment, and holding up his hands in horror, like Deputy Blowick, that there should be an extension of what was termed the opening on Sundays. The saints have become sinners now and are advocating that all licensed traders in the country should open on Sundays and I should like to point out that that will have a very serious repercussion on seven-day licence holders.</P>
      <P>The total amount of trade at the disposal of all licence holders is small throughout the country areas.  Deputy Belton lives in a city with a big population and a very large volume of trade and I am afraid he will never realise the difficulties of licensed traders throughout the country.  This Bill does not confer any benefits whatsoever on the seven-day licence holders and it is only foolish people who never read it who suggest that it confers increased facilities for the sale of drink on licensed traders.  That, of course, is the reverse of the truth and it will be proved that it is so.  It curtails the hours of trading in rural Ireland and let there be no doubt about that.  I have argued that myself and it took me quite a long time to assure people that it is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not giving any increased facilities for drinking in rural Ireland but the Bill is, in fact, taking the <i>bona fide</i> trade from the traders, a trade which has been legitimately carried on by the vast majority of them, and I object strenuously to the gross, exaggerated slanders on the members of the licensed trade.  They <Col N="1979" /> have been held up as a pack of shebeeners, as people who deliberately for the sake of trading have broken the licensing laws every minute and every hour of the day, particularly on Sundays.  That is not true and I speak for the six-day licence holders in my own town, and I can assure the House and the country that not one of them sells drink on a Sunday and not one of them desires to have a seven-day licence.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Blowick's amendment is carried, what will be the position?  We shall have seven day licences forced on six-day licence holders who have no desire and no ambition to open and no proper facilities for opening, on Sundays.  Generally, six-day licence holders are people with very big, mixed trading, some of them in hardware, some in drapery some in groceries, selling anything from a needle to an anchor, but the seven-day trader is a person who must, of necessity, depend on the sale of intoxicating liquor.  Whether he can eke out a livelihood or not depends on whether a person is thirsty or not.</P>
    <P>As I said, this amendment reeks with suspicion.  It was not mentioned a month ago and I must ask why? It was because the temperance associations had been condemning this Bill with bell, book, and candle, and condemning those who stood for what they termed increased facilities for the sale of intoxicating drink.  The storm has now blown over and the Fine Gael Party think they are safe from criticism so they come along with this amendment, making out that they forgot about it until now.  On the one hand, they tell us that it is a most serious thing to give what they term increased facilities for drinking, but, on the other hand, they want to give increased facilities to six-day licence holders.  They tell us that up to now they did not even dream of going to the Commission which dealt with this matter to say that six-day licensed traders should be facilitated in this way.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Belton said, that the difference in the licence fee is not very much.  Perhaps, £5 to £10 <Col N="1980" /> is the average difference between the cost of a six and a seven-day licence, but the valuation of premises is quite a different matter, and the high rates in urban areas and local authority areas would certainly contract the profits made by six-day licence holders, were they to get these facilities.  In addition, some of them would be put into the unhappy position that they should accept a seven-day licence whether their premises were suitable or not, and also accept a revaluation of their premises.  That is a matter which, as every Deputy ought to know, is now of very serious dimensions, and if the Valuation Commissioners carry out wide-scale revaluations, I can assure the House that there will be far more dormant licences than there are at present.</P>
    <P>Somebody said that as high as £600 was paid for a seven-day licence by a six-day licence holder to enable him to open on Sundays.  I can assure that man that if he comes to Tipperary, he will get half a dozen of them for that money.  I tried to sell a seven-day licence for a friend of mine whose financial position had deteriorated and I could not get anybody to buy it.  I pressed one man who could afford to buy it very hard and even though there was a most suitable premises for Sunday opening, I could not sell the licence for £100 and it was afterwards sold for £75.</P>
    <P>Up and down the country, there are upwards of 2,000 licences which have been lying dormant for many years and this Bill will enable those licences to be revived within two years and I believe that, within two years of the passing of this Bill, there will be a wholesale revival of them.  According to some Deputies a seven-day licence will be something worth talking about.  Naturally, the people entitled to revive licences will have no difficulty in selling them.  No doubt the premises were suitable and there is no reason why they should have deteriorated to any appreciable extent.  Therefore, they can now be revived for the purpose of sale.  Now we are told that a seven-day licence is worth something.  I have yet to be convinced of that.  I find it difficult to believe that seven-day licences are of such great value.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1981" /> The Minister has gone a long way to meet the case.  He has gone much further than I anticipated he would go.  He has made it very easy for a six-day licence holder to obtain a seven-day licence, by purchasing a seven-day licence and allowing his own to lapse.  That is a very easy way of acquiring a seven-day licence and will appeal to any progressive six-day licence holder, except perhaps one who wants something for nothing.  It is always a popular thing in this House and at street corners to preach something for nothing at somebody else's expense.  Six-day licence holders will have no difficulty in getting seven-day licences.  I understand that there are 14,000 six-day licences, including existing licences and dormant licences.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton, who knows the licensed trade from A to Z, stated that the Minister for Lands was incorrect in stating that people could queue up for taxis in some town in Mayo and go out to the country and get drink there.  That is an everyday happening all over the country.  The Garda and vigilance societies are trying to enforce the licensing laws. People go out three miles in cars. Deputy Belton is correct in stating that one may not openly enter a public house during Sunday closing hours for the purpose of drinking. Nevertheless, in the history of the trade has there been one conviction? Not even my legal friends on this side or the other side of the House could tell me that in the long history of the licensing laws there has been even one conviction for obtaining drink or going for drink or consuming drink during Sunday closing hours. That has not happened.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the amendment has been pressed.  The Minister has gone a long way, much further than any holder of a six-day licence anticipated.  If a six-day licence holder is being put in the position of being able to compete with the people who have been paying more for their licences and paying more in wages for Sunday assistance, it is not too much to say that they should pay for it.  All this talk about £600 and £700 is &ldquo;boloney&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1982" /> This Bill is not conferring any benefit on seven-day licence holders. The <i>bona fide</i> trade, which has been a very substantial part of their livelihood, is being taken from them.  It is a difficult life.  In addition, their hours of trading are being curtailed and there is the possibility of endorsements being revived with substantial fines, and for the rest of their lives there will be for them the danger of their licences being taken from them.  That is a matter that should be earnestly considered.  Deputies can appreciate the mental strain involved in a suspended sentence of 12 months.  Publicans will be under similar mental strain if they fail to get out of their premises, in time, people who may be obstreperous. Therefore, do not put more people in the same street in competition with him, to take away the few shillings that he may get on Sunday.</P>
    <P>The amount of money available for drinking is definitely declining while the number of traders is on the increase.  Because of the great competition there must of necessity be more capital investment in bringing premises up to date, resulting in increases in valuations and licence duty.  That has been happening.  For goodness sake, leave them the little hard won livelihood that they have and do not increase the competition.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that the House should seriously consider.  With the advent of television in England thousands of public houses are almost on the verge of collapse and many licences have become dormant.  That is a natural development.  It shows, again, that people who drink do not do so for the love of drink.  The social aspect plays a great part in the consumption of liquor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to show that there will be more redundant licences in this country with the advent of television in, possibly, a year's time.  It will definitely mean more licences for sale on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton said there was not much difference in the licence fee, but <Col N="1983" /> there is a very substantial difference in the valuation and, above all, a very great difference in the capital investment. Put a six-day licensed house, and a seven-day, on the market, each with the same facilities for drink in the same kind of street, and you will find that the seven-day licenced house will command a substantially greater price.  The fact that this matter was not the subject of a recommendation by the Commission and that it has been dragged in here at the last minute is sufficient indication of its importance.  It is always a very popular thing to give something for nothing to somebody but when we are giving something for nothing to people we should not take it out of the pockets of people who are already harassed in their business. You have heard the Minister state&mdash;and I think I know him sufficiently well to know that when he makes a statement he means it&mdash;that the licensing laws will be enforced and the people who break the law will have to answer for it in a very serious way.  With that looming over the heads of the seven-day licensees, surely it is not the task of this House to add another worry to the thousand and one worries the seven-day licensees already have.  I sincerely hope the amendments will be withdrawn, especially Deputy Blowick's, because it will have very serious consequences for the licensing trade and for many people who have no desire to open on Sunday at all.</P>
    <P>I do not know what knowledge Deputy Blowick has of public houses. He pretends to be a very strong opponent of drink.  I think he said he would oppose this Bill strenuously if he thought it would mean increased facilities for drink.  I do not know whether he has been quietly having a drop but, if he has not, he is speaking with complete ignorance of the licensed trade.  I speak with the knowledge of five generations of it and I hope of the sixth.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry's speech a while ago would lead one to believe that putting the six-day licensees out of business was to him <Col N="1984" /> one huge joke.  I wonder what would Deputy Corry's attitude be if the Minister for Agriculture introduced a Bill interfering with the rights of the barley growers, he being Chairman of the Barley Growers' Association.  Surely the six-day licensees have as much right as the barley growers have to live in their holdings and carry on their small business.</P>
      <P>Fortunately in County Clare, by comparison with the rest of the country, we have very few of the people concerned in this Bill.  However, I feel it is my duty to speak for them, few though they may be.  I know the six-day licensees in my own town are carrying on a very fine business with a good clientele who come sometimes during the day for the six days of the week and every night without fail, say, from 8 o'clock until 10.30.  I wonder when this Bill becomes law and when those customers can go into a neighbouring house with the door wide open and have their drinks without hindrance, will they go to their usual place of drink, the six-day licensed house on the other six days of the week?  As a rule a man who drinks in the one public house for six days of the week does not like to go to another public house on a Sunday.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy knows that those six-day licences were granted under an alien régime almost 100 years ago in the supposed courts of justice.  Justice was meted out to the people then by none other than the members of the ascendancy and their henchmen, men who refused to give this seven-day licence and, if they possibly could, would not allow the people to live in this land of ours even for seven days. It is very strange that, 100 years after that, a native Government, a Government who are supposed to dispense justice between man and man, should introduce legislation here to do what could not be done at that time, that is, to put the padlocks on the doors of these unfortunate people, drive them on to the emigrant ship and force them and their families to seek a livelihood in another land, a livelihood of which a native Government would deprive them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1985" /> Every Deputy must agree with me that laws should be based on commonsense, justice and equality.  Is there any Deputy or any Minister here who can say to me that there is justice and equality in a Bill which grants certain privileges and facilities to a section of traders and deprives another section of our people of the self-same privileges and facilities?  If any member considers that that is justice and equality for our people, I must say it is certainly not the justice or the equality which this country fought over the years to obtain.  As a result of this legislation many of the six-day licensees will be driven away from their homes.  I can assure the Minister that no matter what rigorous provisions he puts in the law, and no matter how hard that law may be, one thing that it will never do is to deprive any man of his pint of stout or his glass of whiskey, wherever and whenever he wants it.</P>

We have gone to very great pains to explain that history.  I did so myself when concluding on the Second Stage of the Bill, but that error has been persisted in here by a number of Deputies whom I would regard as responsible Deputies.  Why they continue to repeat that distorted type of story about the six-day licensees, I find great difficulty in understanding. We are not doing anything to the six-day licensees that is injurious to them.  We are not affecting them.</P>

      <P>We are not affecting the rights and privileges which they have at the present time by one single iota, nor do we intend to.  What Deputy Murphy says may be true, that they have been doing something they were not entitled to do in serving drink on Sundays.  He made the suggestion that despite anything we may do in this House, these people will continue to do that.  I shall be very sorry for them, if they do.  It will mean that they will be putting themselves out of business. We are bringing in penalties, which, if inflicted &mdash; and they will be inflicted if people continue to commit these breaches of the law &mdash; will, in fact, automatically put them out of business.</P>
      <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, we are not, in any way, interfering with the rights of the six-day licensees to continue their legitimate business.  I do not like to hear the type of speech Deputy Murphy has just made suggesting that we are taking away some of the rights and privileges these people have at the present time.  We are not interfering in any sense with them.  I have said before, and it is worth repeating, that other Governments have endeavoured to prevent the spread of licensed premises.  In fact, the Act of 1902 definitely provided against the establishment of new licensed premises. Other Governments have sought to achieve that aim as well, and all we are doing in this Bill is ensuring so far as it is possible to do so that there will be no increase in licences but that, if possible, through the suggestions we are making in respect of the manner in which a six-day licence can become a seven-day licence, we should reduce still further the number of such licences.</P>
      <P>I think that is an aim which every member of this House will be prepared to support.  I merely want to repeat that so far as the Bill is concerned, it will not in any way affect the rights of the six-day licensees.  They will be in the same position as they have always been in, except that they will not be allowed to continue anything in the nature of illegitimate trading, if they have been indulging in such trading.</P>

      <P>I must say I was very depressed by the last intervention of the Minister.  I was under the impression that we had made some progress on Committee Stage in bringing home to the Minister, the Government and the Party opposite &mdash; and full marks to the Deputies behind the Minister who made their effort to bring it home to the Minister and the Government &mdash; the effect of the non-acceptance of this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has just said there would be no worsening of the conditions of the six-day licensees in consequence of the non-acceptance of this amendment.  Surely to goodness, after the views that have been advanced from both sides of the House with regard to the loss of trade which must undoubtedly accrue to the six-day licensees if the amendment is not accepted, he must have hearkened to the serious and well-informed reasons which were advanced for these views.</P>
      <P>Surely it must be accepted that the normal person who goes into a public house to enjoy his drink gets into the habit of meeting people there.  It is not the same as going into a hardware shop or a drapery shop where you are influenced by the prices which obtain and by the quality of the goods.  There are several factors which will influence a person going into a business house to purchase a particular article, but when you go to get a drink, you know there is a standard price and you know, in the main, there is little variation in quality and in service.  You go to a public house to meet your friends, and if you do that over a period, it becomes a habit, and you do not change from that public house unless you have some good reason for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1988" /> Can any Deputy stand up here and say it is a habit in their constituency to go to one public house on a Sunday, another on Monday and still another on Saturday night? Is it not a fact, as has been pretty well conceded by everyone who spoke on different Stages of the Bill, that the law was not respected in the past either in the six-day or the seven-day licensed premises.  That was the most cogent reason for bringing in this Bill &mdash; that the law was not respected.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister rising to speak immediately after Deputy Murphy and inferring from his remarks that he would condone the breaking of the law.  I do not think that is what Deputy Murphy intended.  I can see Deputy Murphy's point, and there is something in it. The Minister and the Government claim that the laws, when this Bill is passed, will be such that they will command respect.  If the Minister, in this Bill, inflicts upon a section of the trade such conditions that they will be driven, with their backs to the wall, to putting padlocks on their doors, is he not removing the very factor which the Government claim is so attractive in this measure?  I can see Deputy Murphy's point in that. It will be very much more difficult for the authorities to enforce a law that will place a small section in the position that they will not get their rights.  Deputy Davern and other Deputies referred to the fact that this concerns only a minority of the people engaged in the trade.  How, in the name of goodness, can we defend the rights of minorities in Northern Ireland or elsewhere if we accept the principle that because you are only one-eleventh of the trade, you are not worthy of consideration?</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Davern.  I felt he was well versed in the trade and would have some fresh view to offer.  I listened to a feast of contradictions.  So far, very few Deputies, when speaking in a certain frame of mind, have spoken in favour of the six-day licensee.  I think Deputy Davern said thousands of licences would be revived as this is <Col N="1989" /> making that possible.  They could be revived at the moment.  As the Minister pointed out last night, it would be easier to revive the licences and later to extinguish all of them after this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern said there will be an inflated market for licences if this amendment goes through.  That is the best argument for the six-day licensees. Who will be the purchasers?  If the price goes up, there must be a demand and who will create the demand?  Will it be the unfortunates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I speak as a seven-day licensee living in a seven-day premises.  Down the street from me, there is a six-day licensed premises. There are only two in my town.  We all agree that this problem seriously affects the West of Ireland.  There are few of us here who have not a neighbour who is not seriously affected by the Government's proposal.  I do not agree with Deputy Davern that, in the main, six-day licences are held by people with large mixed businesses and that it is more or less an amenity to the week-day customers, coming in to buy other articles.  They can relax and have a chat with their friends if they meet them in town and transact their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the six-day licensed premises which is down the street from me.  There is a grocery shop attached to the licensed premises, the very same as I have in my business premises.  It is the pattern generally throughout the country.  What will be the situation if this amendment is not accepted?  People who have been enjoying the facilities of a house of convenience in that six-day licensed premises &mdash; Deputy Dillon described the position fully last evening &mdash; will now find the door closed on a Sunday. <Col N="1990" /> However, across the street or adjoining the premises, there is a licensed premises the doors of which are open without breaking the law.  We are given to understand that there will be a rigid enforcement of the law in the future.  If we accept the Government's argument, a person who goes into a licensed premises at any hour other than the appointed hours will break the law and consequently will leave himself open to heavy prosecution.</P>
    <P>The moment this Bill becomes an Act, the six-day licensee will be compelled to keep his doors closed on Sunday.  He cannot possibly enjoy the facility he formerly enjoyed inasmuch as there was not a rigid enforcement of the law.  These people sold drink on Sunday just the same as the seven-day licensee.  Both were breaking the law.  The number of legitimate <i>bona fide</i> travellers in country towns on Sunday is infinitesimal in comparison with the number of other customers in licensed premises.  We all know that.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister has repeated the argument that there is nothing in this Bill which is depriving the six-day licensee of anything which he had formerly. There is.  If a regular customer of the six-day licensee must now go to a different house on Sunday for his drink, the result will be that in time that person will continue to go to the seven-day licensee and then God help the six-day licensee who is waiting for somebody to come in, even to pass the time of day with him, on the other six days when the law permits that type of premises to be open.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern and Deputy Corry and some others assert that because we on this side of the House are opposing the extension of drinking hours, we are illogical in seeking that the six-day licensee be afforded the facility sought by this amendment.  I do not see anything illogical in it. Deputy Davern said, in fact, that far from an extension of drinking hours, there would be a curtailment.  That was an admission that all unlawful drinking would end and that the hours now proposed would result in a curtailment rather than an extension. There are different points of view on <Col N="1991" /> that.  However, it supports our claim that the six-day licensees were not, in fact, six-day licensees and that the consequence will be that if their customers are driven into other premises on Sundays, they are extremely likely to develop the habit of going there during the legitimate hours on the other six days of the week.  Therein lies the injustice and therein lies our desire for the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Licensing Commission was not brought into this.  Deputy G. Boland quite rightly said that the Commission was not asked to consider the circumstances of the six-day licensees. The allegation has been made by Deputy Davern that we seek to confer on this limited number of licensees something for nothing.  We do not.  We seek to give them the opportunity which they had heretofore to eke out some existence for themselves.  We are trying to prevent the Government from depriving them of a living on the six days of the week which they had previously.  We are not seeking to confer some additional benefits on this unfortunate limited section of those engaged in the licensed trade.</P>

      <P>I think that what this amendment means is that any six-day licensee can, by going to the court, automatically receive the seven-day licence.  Do the movers of this amendment seriously contend that a six-day licensee can at present go into the court and, without any increase in licence fee or paying any compensation or any fine whatever, automatically become a seven-day licensee?  I could understand the amendment if there were a clause in it saying that on the payment of a certain amount of money, certain things would be done. I would not suggest any figure, although I have a figure in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>To the Government, in order that they should be in a position to buy out any licence that became redundant.  It has been admitted on all sides that there are too <Col N="1992" /> many public houses in the country and that there is not business for them all.  The days when everyone was looking for a licence have gone and it is a good job, but seriously to contend that we should open all these doors is something which I cannot understand.  If it were suggested that there should be a fine, say, of a couple of hundred pounds, to enable the Government to buy out redundant licences, I could understand the amendment.  I was about to make that suggestion but, on the whole, I think the Minister's idea is better &mdash; to let the six-day licensee himself bargain for premises that will be closed down.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine for Deputies in constituencies where there are a lot of six-day licences to play to the gallery and to the six-day licensees but we must remember that there are also seven-day licensees.  What the members of this House want to do in this Bill is to give justice to all sections of the licensed trade.  I ask these members, once they get this done, whether they consider they are doing justice to the men who want seven-day licences?</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell very ably pointed out that there are a number of people who opted for these six-day licenses for different reasons &mdash; oftentimes on religious grounds.  I know people who would not go into licensed trading on Sunday for any consideration.  Now we are asked to throw the doors open to all those people.  When it was a question of an extra hour in regard to Sunday opening, we were read a lecture on the Third Commandment &mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt keep holy the Sabbath day.&rdquo; Now we are asked to put 1,100 more in the position of breaking the Third Commandment.</P>

Deputy Murphy said Deputy Corry would complain bitterly if the barley growers were interfered with but let me put this case to Deputy Murphy. Suppose a farmer were given a guaranteed price for barley or wheat and someone in this House said that here was something for the Irish farmer which he did not have before and that we had to give the small man the same amount of land on which to grow the barley and wheat as the big man.  There would be just as much sense in that as there is in this amendment. I do not see any sense in it.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is going a long way to meet the six-day licensees when he allows them to get another six-day licence in any part of the district or a seven-day licence in any part of the country.  That is the fairest way to ensure that justice is done between the seven-day licensee and the six-day licensee.  I think the Minister is being very fair and that this amendment should be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Lands and, I believe, Deputy Corry seem to think there is something illogical in Deputy Blowick, myself and other Deputies supporting this amendment on behalf of the holders of six-day licences, in view of the fact that I think Deputy Blowick and I in any case oppose the idea of long drinking hours on Sunday.  The Minister for Lands did not go into detail in making that submission.  He merely stated that he believed it was illogical that a Deputy <Col N="1995" /> like myself should support this amendment. I do not see anything at all illogical in it.</P>
      <P>I am one of the many people in this House, I hope, who when a law is passed, accept the decision of Dáil Éireann.  I accept the fact that this House has voted to allow certain drinking hours on Sunday.  That is gone now.  It is accomplished in any case.  From what I have seen, by the decision of this House, it will be law in a very short time that people can drink for five and a half hours on a Sunday.</P>
      <P>If that is to be the law, I want to try to make sure, by my voice and my vote in this House, that thousands of people who have six-day licences now will not be done an injustice, as I believe they will be done if an amendment such as that tabled by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Lindsay and Deputy Blowick is not accepted.  I do not think Deputy Gilbride knows what he is talking about as a politician when he says&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he mean, as Deputy Dillon said last night, that we expect to get increased support in our constituencies for this sort of move?  He talks about an injustice being done to the seven-day licence holder, if this amendment and the other amendments are accepted by the House.  If we are to believe what Deputy Gilbride and Deputy Davern said, it means we shall get less support in our constituencies.  I do not believe that is the case.  I, like Deputy Dillon, have not met any seven-day licence holder who has objected, to me in any case, to the suggestion that the six-day licence holders now become in certain conditions seven-day licence holders.  Goodness knows, there are enough public houses in the country at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" /> I said last week &mdash; and I want to repeat it this week &mdash; that the drinking public of this country will, after a short while, determine what public houses are to survive, assuming that they are all seven-day licensed houses in the future.  If this is a method of cutting down the public houses would it not, therefore, be logical for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come to the House with proposals to cut down the number of petrol pumps? He does not do that.  We assume that he says to himself that competition will determine how many of these will survive.</P>
    <P>I believe that if on this occasion the Minister decided to accept the amendment, or introduced an appropriate amendment himself, the drinking public would determine how many public houses are needed.  I know that the position of the six-day licence holders may not be as acute in some parts of the country as in others.  It is particularly serious for those people in certain parts of Mayo and I believe these people are being done an injustice.</P>
    <P>Some of the arguments here are to the effect that these seven-day licence holders have been paying so much by way of income tax, rates and licence fees over the years.  The question is asked now: are the six-day licence holders to be given the same facilities as the seven-day licence holders who paid the money down through the years?  Of course, that is not the case.  This Bill will confer a benefit, and a substantial benefit, on the seven-day licence houses.  All the amendments seek to do is to try to ensure that the six-day men will not be done an injustice, because undoubtedly they will be done an injustice, if they are to remain six-day houses.  Nobody from the Opposition who supported the Minister in this has referred to the oft-repeated argument of the members from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is not a drinking man and I do not know if he ever drank in his life, but members of the Fianna Fáil Party who support the Minister will have had occasion to go into public houses. They will know that a man goes to <Col N="1997" /> one public house generally, especially in the provincial and rural areas.  He meets his friends there and he likes the publican and likes the atmosphere there.  Under the terms of this Bill, he is expected, if he is in the habit of going to a six-day house, to go for six days of the week to that house and change over on the seventh to another.  He will do that for a couple of weeks, or perhaps a couple of months, out of loyalty to the publican, but after a while because he drinks on Sunday in another public house, he will reckon that it is handier for him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not say that as a reflection on the Minister or the Guards.  That is the practice that has grown up.  Now there will be a vital difference.  The Minister told us last night how vigorously and rigorously the law was to be enforced. Now the six-day man has no chance, nor should he, I expect, on Sundays. For their own purposes, the Minister for Lands, Deputy Gilbride, and, I think, Deputy Davern, complimented Deputy O'Donnell on certain parts of his speech and hopped on the particular part where Deputy O'Donnell, on one occasion, said that <Col N="1998" /> in 1872, in certain circumstances, these people opted for six days.  One would imagine the owners of these public houses did it in the past three or four years.  How many years ago did they do it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They did it at least 50 years ago.  Are we to penalise the publicans on the plea that that was their choice?  There were different circumstances in those times.  It was much more advantageous for them to opt for a six-day licence so that they would not have to pay a couple of pounds, which in those days was a pretty substantial sum of money.  It meant you could serve only a lodger on the premises with drink.  For that, you paid the full seven-day licence. Now the seven-day licence men are to be allowed to sell drink for 5½ hours on Sunday &mdash; for all practical purposes more drinking hours than the ordinary drinking man can use on a week day. A tremendous advantage is being conferred on them.  Surely it is not unreasonable to ask that the six-day men should get some benefit from that trade?</P>
      <P>Deputies on the opposite side have taken exception to the terms of the amendment proposed by Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon and the Fine Gael Party, any more than the Labour Party, have not the advantages of the Parliamentary draftsmen who are available to the Minister for Justice.  They are not arguing on the strict merits of every word, every comma, and every line of the amendment.  They are arguing about the principle and I am certain they would be prepared to withdraw these amendments if the Minister said: &ldquo;All right; I shall bring in an amendment that will meet the point of view you have expressed or will go some way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

I believe you will have bad feeling in such a district which will last for many years.  I do not think that the Minister's solution is the best solution.  It seems to me that, apart from those few Deputies behind the Minister, the consensus of opinion in the Fianna Fáil Party seems to be in favour of an amendment of the type tabled here by the three Deputies from this side.</P>

I believe this is a decision made by the Front Bench with which a majority of the back benchers do not agree.

Boland has been making some pretty frank statements in this House in recent years, and he confessed that the Liquor Commission were not aware of the repercussions on the six-day men if the public houses were allowed to open for five-and-a-half hours on Sunday.  He made an appeal to the Minister.  He is an experienced Deputy and has had vast experience in Government as Minister for Justice for a long time.  Therefore, I think the Minister should reconsider his attitude to this matter and announce that, between now and the Report Stage, he will consider the position.  I do not believe that the solution as suggested in the section is a solution that will confer any benefit on the present six-day licence-holders.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands spoke in a very laboured fashion last night.  I do not know what sort of case he was making.  He has great experience of the law, but, right through his speech, while he may have been unconscious of it, he conveyed to me that there would be great hardship for the six-day men, especially in county Mayo. I do not know what he was trying to prove, but in any case I believe that the six-day men will virtually have to close up unless the Minister concedes the principle embodied in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was at pains to-day to inform the House that there is no infringement of either the rights or privileges of the six-day licensee.  He must be very naïve if he thinks that; I do not think he does. Heretofore, the position was that neither a six-day nor a seven-day man could open on Sunday, except for a very negligible <i>bona fide</i> trade.  The six-day and seven-day men were in exactly the same category, if they <Col N="2001" /> observed the law.  Even before the Commission sat, it was quite well known that some changes in the law were mooted, with the result that both six and seven-day licensees opened to a certain group of customers on Sunday, with the exception of a very occasional publican.</P>
      <P>In this case, the Minister is giving a very big concession to the seven-day licensee: he is giving none to the six-day men.  In a sense, the Minister is correct in saying that he is not infringing the rights and privileges of the seven-day licensee but, by virtue of the fact that he is improving the conditions of the seven-day men, he is putting the six-day men out of business.</P>
      <P>Great play has been made with the fact that the present six-day licences exist by their own option.  That is not so.  A certain number of licensees under the 1872 Act opted in favour of a six-day licence but the vast majority of the six-day licences to-day exist because the resident magistrate who heard the application for a licence determined whether it was a six- or a seven-day licence.  I think I am not far wrong in saying that three-fifths of the present six-day licences were so restricted by the resident magistrate of the day and not many of the seven-day licensees of those days sought to become six-day licensees under that Act.</P>
      <P>Anyway, that is completely irrelevant. It does not matter how the six-day licences came about.  We are doing something now to put them out of business.  I do not know how many six-day licensed premises or indeed seven-day licensed premises depend entirely for their livelihood on the sale of drink.  I would be puzzled if the Minister asked me to name one licensed premises that does not carry on another business and I know a good many of them.  We must take into account that in rural Ireland&mdash;I do not know what happens in the cities; I am not in a position to speak for them &mdash; a great deal of business is done on Sundays.  I am not referring to drink business.  A great deal of shopping is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained last night, it is quite <Col N="2002" /> customary in every town and village in the country that when they come to Mass on Sunday, most of the women do their shopping and that has to be done in public houses because the business is associated with drapery, groceries, hardware and so on.  Most of the customers who go in do not bother about drink: they are housewives and children who want to get the week's goods to bring home.  The Minister is forcing the six-day licensees to put a padlock on the door.  He is definitely putting them out of business. That is unjust.  It has been said that the Liquor Commission did not have a case put before it by the six-day licensees but I do not think even the Liquor Commission members themselves adverted to what an extension of the hours for the seven-day people would mean.</P>

      <P>They actually made a recommendation.  They examined the case made by a group that came before them.  I presume the group made the case which they thought would influence the Commission and the Commission, having heard them, made a decision which I shall read for the benefit of the House.  This was in addition to two decisions made in previous years.  The 1957 Commisssion had this to say: &mdash;</P>
      <P>The provisions of the 1927 and 1943 Intoxicating Liquor Acts governing the transfer of a full licence from one premises to another were considered by us in connection with representations made on behalf of six-day and early-closing licence holders with a view to the removal of the restrictive trading conditions in their licences; having regard to these provisions we are not prepared to make any recommendation in the matter.</P>
      <P>That was the decision of the Commission, having heard the group that made the case before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the group that put the case did not visualise the extended opening hours for the seven-day licensees, nor, to be fair to them, could they project themselves into the future and see exactly what effects the <Col N="2003" /> Bill now before the House would have on them.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies, judging by their speeches, do not know what is happening now, after all the debate and after all we have said to try to hammer it home.  I heard Deputy Davern's comments on the amendment and he said that we were forcing a six-day licence down their throats.  We are not.  In one case, the six-day licensee can apply to the court, if he desires, to get a seven-day licence, if this amendment is passed.  In the other case, he gets a seven-day licence but he has ample time after the passing of the Act to notify the Minister for Justice that he is not accepting it.  That is clear proof that some of the Deputies do not know what they are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry came in this morning and it seems that he was put up to make a long, rambling speech.  That is the only word to describe it.  It was rambling from one end to the other.  Apparently in his area in Cork everything is all right and he does not mind what happens.  He should remember that there are 1,100 six-day licensees all over the country and the majority of them will be put out of business by this Bill if it goes through.  Harking back to what happened 60 or 70 or 80 years ago is purely a waste of time, in my opinion. The Minister and the Government are asking us to pass this Bill.  Most of the provisions of the Bill are long overdue.  I cannot understand the Minister's opposition to the amendment when it is clear that this provision in the Bill will put a number of people out of business.  Deputy Corry mentioned £500,000 compensation. Who is asking for compensation? All we are asking for is equality and uniformity between the two classes of publicans, and this Bill is definitely doing away with uniformity. There is no question of compensation.  This will not cost the Government one penny.  Not one <Col N="2004" /> seven-day licensee has raised his voice against the proposal in the amendments, and I have been speaking to many of them.  Not one of them likes what is happening.</P>
    <P>The question of the number of public houses has been harped on.  It is said there are too many licensed premises.  There are too many congests. There are too many unemployed. What does the Government propose to do about them?  I shall speak plainly and bluntly.  The Government method of dealing with this particular situation is to introduce conditions of class warfare so that the six-day licensees must inevitably wipe themselves out.  They will have to commit business suicide.  That is what they are being asked to do by the Government.  If there are too many licensed premises, surely it is not beyond the capacity of the Government and their advisers to devise a method of limiting the number of licences.  That would be the commonsense approach.</P>
    <P>By asking the six-day licensees to wipe themselves out under this Bill, as it stands, the Government hope there will be fewer public houses in the future.  It would be just as intelligent for the Minister for Lands to tell all the uneconomic holders to sell out and go to England.  The Government would then have no problem of congestion. It would be just as intelligent for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell the unemployed to clear out to England, to wipe themselves out, and take themselves off our registers.  That is not the proper approach to any problem.  Merely because there are too many licensed premises does not justify the Government asking the six-day licensees to wipe themselves out.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the provisions whereby the six-day licensee would now find it easier to purchase a seven-day licence.  Does the Minister think that the average six-day licensee has a crock of gold under the hearthstone?  Most of them are struggling to make a living.  If they got a licence for £100 they could not purchase it.  I am sure Deputy S. Flanagan, and other western Deputies, <Col N="2005" /> will agree with me in that.  If we pass this Bill as it stands, then I prophesy that some future Government will have to rectify the evil we perpetrate today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last intervention of the Minister for Justice was a considerable disappointment to me because I felt the case we made was so compelling he would at least postpone a decision by the House until he had given the matter further consideration. Last night he mentioned the number of dormant and redundant licences in the country.  I gathered that he regarded it as a significant concession to the six-day licensees that it would be open to them for a period of two years after the passing of this Bill to revive or acquire seven-day licences.  I wonder was the Minister listening to his colleague, the Minister for Lands, earlier in the evening when the Minister for Lands detailed the difficulties confronting anyone who wants to revive a dormant licence at the moment.</P>
      <P>In my remarks earlier I made certain suggestions to the Minister which would, in fact, make it easier for the six-day licensee to get the benefit of a revived licence.  In his contribution, the Minister for Lands made no reference whatever to the suggestions I had made.  On the other hand, he quite clearly indicated the enormous difficulties facing anybody who tries to revive a dormant licence at the present time, difficulties it is not proposed to remove under the terms of the Bill as it now stands.  In practice, that means that, while in one or two instances, such as those mentioned by Deputy Lindsay, a person may succeed in obtaining the revival of a licence, more or less contrary to the law, this will happen very, very rarely indeed in the future.  Indeed, I should imagine that, when attention is drawn to it, it will never happen again.  It is not altogether accurate then for the Minister to say that a concession is being made by the continuance for two years of the right to revive an old licence.  If it continues to be necessary to prove suitability of premises, then these licences are not dormant; they are dead.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands said that somebody had mentioned area exemption orders.  I am the &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; who mentioned are exemption orders, and I propose to mention them again now.  Castlebar was used as an example by the Minister for Lands and reference was made to the number of such orders obtained, in the main, in connection with football matches in McCabe Park.  I agree that a great number of exemption orders have been obtained over the years in Castlebar.  I should, however, like the Minister to make inquiries to find out how many exemption orders were obtained for Ballaghaderreen, Ballyvary, Cong, Ballyhaunis, Louisburgh, Hollymount and all the other small towns in the affected area.  The Minister will find that in Charlestown, for instance, possibly three or four area exemption orders were obtained, again on the occasion of football matches of some kind.  In all the other towns area exemption orders are practically unknown and they have, therefore, no bearing whatsoever on the problem we are discussing now, with the exception of Castlebar, and one or two other big centres in the West.</P>
      <P>We are talking about the everyday trading position in these towns where the problem is acute.  Even if all the days, on which area exemption orders have been granted were added together, they would come to very few as compared with the number of days when they did not apply at all.  The position on those other days, in regard to some of the towns I have mentioned, there being 52 Sundays in the year, is the position, no matter what anybody else may say, which I say applies, namely, both the six-day and the seven-day traders operate illegally.</P>

      <P>I would prefer to deal with that problem from the aspect of the second intervention of the Minister for Justice this morning when he said nothing was being taken away from the six-day holders.  I should have thought that by now the Minister for Justice would realise that something in fact has been taken away and, perhaps more important, that something has been added on to the seven-day holders which is not being added on to their six-day counterparts. I fully accept that the Minister for Justice does not desire to do anything unfair or unjust to the six-day licensees. Indeed, the Minister for Justice would be the last man, in my experience, to try to do anything unfair to anybody. But it is simply not true that the <i>bona fide</i> business, as such, meant anything to 90 per cent of the small towns where this problem is acute. It is simply not true that people drove three miles in order to keep within the <i>bona fide</i> law.  It is true that regular customers, nearly all within the three-mile limit or the bulk of them from the town itself, went into a seven-day or a six-day public house indifferently and equally illegally.  The fact that there were occasionally here and there &mdash; only occasionally and only here and there &mdash; area exemption orders has no significant bearing on the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was mentioned by the Minister for Lands that there has always been an equity in favour of the seven-day licence.  He forgot to mention that <Col N="2008" /> that equity applied against the background of this <i>bona fide</i> law and that the Report of the Commission of 1925, or whenever it was, the law passed in 1927 and the law passed since, preserved that equity, always against the background of the existing <i>bona fide</i> law.  That equity if it existed, and it did, ceases to be significant and to apply when the background or basis of the <i>bona fide</i> law is removed, as it is now being removed by the provisions of this Bill.  Therefore, we must look at this problem anew, if we are to look at it with any hope of fairness.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister for Lands gave figures about the costs, in his personal experience, of acquiring seven-day licences.  I think he said that £300 was the highest he came across himself.  I fully accept what the Minister says.  In my personal experience the highest was £600, and in the course of the last three weeks a member of the Oireachtas was involved in the purchase of a seven-day licence for £450.  A person whom I know, on being approached to sell a six-day licence recently, quoted a figure of £400 as his price.  What I want to bring home is that when the Minister for Lands says that the provisions of the Bill go a long way to meeting this problem and says, more significantly, that these provisions will have the result of reducing the costs by 50 per cent.&mdash;I quote from what he said last night &mdash; I wonder if it is right that we should ask these people to pay £200 instead of £400, £300 instead of £600, £225 instead of £450, or even £150 instead of £300?</P>
    <P>The basis upon which those in favour of that argument justify it is that in 1872, or because of that Act, the six-day licences paid one-seventh less by way of duty than their seven-day counterparts.  It is perhaps forgotten that a public house having a six-day licence might have a valuation of £10, while a next-door neighbour with a seven-day licence might have a valuation of £7.  Therefore, over the years, the six-day licence holder has, in fact, been paying substantially more than his seven-day colleague. That is an incontrovertible fact.</P>
    <P>Some play was made as well about the increase in valuation on somebody <Col N="2009" /> who purchases a seven-day licence at present.  Is it seriously suggested that the Commissioners of Valuation will put a great deal more on the premises merely because it is a seven-day and not a six-day premises?  Rather is it not true that the basis of valuation is the cubic space of the premises and its locality, and that the existence of a seven-day or six-day licence is an insignificant factor in the assessment?  I believe that is so and I find it difficult to believe otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have not suggested at any stage that the amendments put down by the Minister do not represent a considerable concession to the six-day holders. They do.  I have suggested, and I repeat now, that they do not go far enough.  Without accepting the amendment in the name of Deputy Dillon or the amendment in the name of Deputy Blowick, I think the Minister might go some further distance to relieve what I am sure will create serious difficulties for the six-day holders, particularly in the areas where the problem is acute.</P>
    <P>One final matter.  When I was speaking here last night I did not say that the six-day licences were imposed on the owners by landlords or magistrates. I did say that it was rather odd that the problem should be acute in one section of what was then the county of Mayo, and that there might be something in the suggestion that it was by other than voluntary action that situation arose.  I made it perfectly clear that, as far as I know, there was no historical basis for the suggestion that they were imposed upon the owners, but that it would seem peculiar, so if a ghost is being laid I did not float the ghost in the first instance.  I do not know what one does with ghosts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of enhancing the value of a six-day licensed premises <i>vis-a-vis</i> a seven-day was also raised.  If one comes back to the basic argument, which I said last night was the compelling one, one will realise that under the <Col N="2010" /> provisions of the Bill as it stands, and even including the Ministerial amendments, the value of a six-day premises will, in fact, be greatly reduced, not merely because of those provisions, but because the Minister has stated, repeated, and meant, that when this Bill goes through it will be enforced with the full rigour of the law.  If that happens, and it is my hope that it will, then the six-day licences will have been very seriously and drastically reduced in value, while the seven-day licences will have been very appreciably enhanced.</P>
      <P>As I said at the beginning, I am somewhat disappointed that the arguments, which I think are good, have made no impact at all on the mind of the Minister for Justice, if I am to judge by his intervention this morning. It might be suggested that some of us are playing to the gallery.  I certainly am not.  I have been a member of this House for nine years and in that time I have not stood up in these Benches to criticise one of my own Ministers except from conviction, and as long as I am in the House I shall not play to the gallery.</P>
      <P>If there are votes in this, let them be calculated by the number of seven-day licences instead of the number of six-day licences.  There is something more important than votes and that is to try and preserve people from the adverse effect of our legislation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a brief intervention.  First of all I would like to say that the Deputy is not correct in saying that he has made no impression upon the mind of the Minister for Justice.  That is not correct.  Secondly, I want to say that the Government gave very long and careful consideration to the whole question of six-day licensees being given the right to become seven-day licensees.  Deputy S. Flanagan is more aware of that than most other Deputies in the House because he was responsible for some of the advances which were made from the original decision of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally the Government decided to adhere to the existing position that <Col N="2011" /> six-day licensees could become seven-day licensees only if they were prepared to extinguish a seven-day licence in the same or an adjoining District Court District.  Partly due to the representations of Deputy S. Flanagan, this is now being extended to the whole State.  We thought that this was a rather generous gesture because we were widening the limits to which a six-day licensee could go to secure one of these licences for extinguishing.  But we went still further and we agreed that if two six-day licences were extinguished in any part of the State or one six-day in the same District Court area, we would accept that and the six-day licence holder could become a seven-day licensee.  I do not know how much further we could go than that unless we were to work these approximately 1,400 six-day licensees into the 10,000 seven-day licensees at present in business.  It would be completely unjust to the seven-day licensees to take such a step and to throw into competition with them something like 1,100 more licensees.</P>
    <P>While having to resist these amendments in the names of Deputy Dillon, Deputy Lindsay and Deputy Blowick, as I stated last evening, every argument that is put forward here in respect of any of the provisions in this Bill will be brought by me before the Government for their full consideration. What that consideration may result in, I cannot say, but at least I have made that promise in the earlier stages of the discussion and I am repeating it now.</P>
    <P>In this Bill I am carrying out what the Government agreed to and I must resist any attempt to deflect me from that course, but when I submit the arguments that have been made here in respect of the six-day licensees it will be a matter for the Government to decide whether we should stand firm or whether we should be prepared to make some other extension of the provisions which we have already proposed. I can make no promise other than that.  I think the House decided to have the Committee Stage decided to-day.  We have been discussing it for <Col N="2012" /> a considerable time and I think the House should decide upon it now and let the Government consider whatever action is necessary afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that, before any decision is taken, there are a couple of things I must say.  I think the Minister for Justice is looking at this question in an entirely inverted way.  By saying that I do not want to make any suggestion that he is not <i>bona fide</i> in his approach.  He approaches this matter on the basis that by this Bill, including his amendments to it, he is giving a benefit to the six-day trader.  That is not the fact.  The fact is exactly the reverse.</P>
      <P>The fact is that by this Bill, even with the amendments suggested by the Minister, the six-day licensee is being given either of two options &mdash; to have his living completely extinguished in so far as he and his family live on the profit from the sale of drink under it, or to go and lay out other moneys for the purpose of buying a seven-day licence.  I do not think it is fair to put a six-day licence holder into that position.  The Minister for Justice must be aware that a person is not going to drink on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday in one house, shall we say in the town of Athy, and on Sunday in a different house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I wanted the Minister to say.  That is exactly the situation and if the Minister approached the situation correctly he would appreciate the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two classes of persons drinking, shall I say, in the town of Athy at the present time.  There are the people who are drinking illegally &mdash;these are the people to whom the Minister has just referred &mdash; and there are the people who wish to obey the law. The people in Athy, obeying the law, cannot drink in the town on a Sunday and have to go outside to drink.  They cannot drink and obey the law in Athy on a Sunday.  Does the Minister not <Col N="2013" /> accept and know that that is the fact &mdash; that if people in the urban area of Athy are drinking on a Sunday they are drinking there illegally?  They have to go outside and drink in some other public house outside the <i>bona fide</i> limit.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister is providing that people in Athy can drink in the town on a Sunday and he is providing, therefore, that the whole of the urban population of that area, within an area of three miles there, who could not legally drink in that area on a Sunday, now can drink in that area in certain houses only.  Does that not mean that the livelihood of those who are not within that particular scope will be taken away by this Bill overnight? Is it fair, is it just, is it right that the House should do that?</P>
    <P>It is not a question of giving concessions to anybody and it is not a question, in my argument, of taking it on the line of what has been done illegally heretofore.  We all know that, illegally, the position has been that people have been drinking on a Sunday, and that, illegally, they have been drinking regardless of whether it was in a six-day or a seven-day licensed premises, but it has been illegal.  I want to deal with it purely on what is the law, what people should have been doing legally and what people will, I hope, do legally after this Bill is enacted, because one of the things, throughout rural Ireland in particular, that has undermined the morale of the Guards has been the fact that there has been absolutely no respect whatsoever for licensing laws.</P>
    <P>People in an area, the neighbours and the friends, up to this have not been legally entitled to drink in the public houses of their neighbours on a Sunday.  Now, we are abolishing that restriction that has been there, but only in respect of certain houses, and we are retaining it in respect of other houses.  The only possible effect that that can have is completely to take away all the trade of the six-day house that the publican gets from the neighbours around him. Those people heretofore, obeying the law, knew that they were able to walk <Col N="2014" /> down the street, in Athy, for example, on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and go into the six-day house and they were entitled to get their drink.  If they wanted to obey the law, when they wanted a drink on a Sunday, they had to be on a journey; they had to go outside that area.  They knew that they could not walk down the street and, legally, walk into the seven-day man and get a drink there.  They knew they had to walk past the seven-day man and the six-day man and go on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  They were good citizens for doing that and I admire them for doing it.  As long as that was the position there was no legal competition between the neighbours of the six-day and the seven-day houses.  Now the Minister is changing all that position.  Now he is enabling a man to get his drink legally on a Sunday in one house but not in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister must realise that whereas heretofore in the case of the man who was drinking on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday in the town, it was immaterial to him whether he drank in the six-day or the seven-day house. If he wanted to obey the law, he had to go outside on Sunday.  There was no competition between those two houses for the Sunday trade and, therefore, there was no competition for his custom during the rest of the week. Now that is being changed.  In future the situation will be that the man who wants to obey the law will be able to go into the seven-day house next door to him, every day of the week, Sundays included, and he will not be able to go into the six-day house that is opposite him on a Sunday.  The inevitable effect of that will be that everybody in that street who heretofore has been inclined to give his custom to the six-day house will shift from the six-day house to the seven-day house because he knows that if he gives his custom to the other house <Col N="2015" /> on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday he will not be welcome in the seven-day house on the Sunday.  The effect of the Minister's measures will be to shift the whole volume of trade from the six-day house during the week-days to the seven-day house.</P>
    <P>That is not a fair method of approach by this House.  If we examine the problem analytically and fairly it cannot be suggested that we are doing something for the six-day house.  That is not so.  We are not.  We are merely endeavouring by this amendment to protect the trade that he has, to ensure that he who has obeyed the law up to this will be in exactly the same fair competition for the neighbour in the street as he was heretofore.  Without this amendment, that will not be the case.  The position will be that the effect of the Minister's Bill, even as amended by him, will be that the six-day man will have to lay out a very substantial sum of money.  Personally, I agree entirely with Deputy Flanagan's estimate of that sum of money and disagree entirely with the estimate of the Minister for Lands.  I know nothing about the West but I know that, so far as Leinster is concerned, you would not get one person in a thousand to say that the story given to us here last night by the Minister for Lands was other than utterly fanciful and entirely divorced from the truth. I know nothing about the West.  I am talking only about Leinster.</P>
    <P>The figures given by Deputy Flanagan are far more comparable in Leinster than those given by the Minister for Lands.  In this Bill the Minister is forcing the six-day man to spend a substantial sum of money which in many cases he has not got, or to face, not the probability but the absolute certainty, that the trade which has been able to sustain himself and his family will be taken away from him overnight by an Act of this Oireachtas and given to somebody else.  That is the issue; it is that issue, and that issue alone, that is involved in this amendment.  The House, if it wants to stand for justice as against <Col N="2016" /> injustice, should accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>What I shall say on this amendment is largely the result of listening to the Minister for Lands. The Minister for Lands is a person who, I always thought, would not be bound by convention or precedents. Therefore, I was surprised to hear him reminding us last night, on this very far-reaching Bill with very far-reaching implications for the licensed trade, that since the State was founded every Liquor Bill has clearly recognised the differentials in regard to six-day and seven-day licensed premises, and warning us about the apparent sacrosanctity of recommendations by commissions. I would not have thought the Minister for Lands would give two hoots about such considerations if he thought the legislation was desirable and necessary.</P>
      <P>I do not think we need give two hoots about precedents, conventions or commission reports in our assessment of the merits of the proposals put forward here.  If we were to be hidebound by precedents, we would never pass any laws.  We have broken many conventions under other legislation in respect of the Departments of Health, Education and particularly Lands.  We have driven a coach and four through many precedents in relation to equity, differentials and conventions.  Therefore most of the arguments the Minister for Lands put forward in that regard would carry no weight with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These licensing proposals are designed primarily to codify and bring up-to-date many of the outmoded conventions which have existed in the licensing laws for many years.  That is long overdue and for that reason I welcome this legislation.  I am not going to concern myself &mdash; as Deputy Dillon pointed out, it would be difficult to concern ourselves &mdash; with the human problem involved here.  Listening to rural Deputies, we know there are human problems in this question. I am concerned with the point that this legislation was brought in out of consideration for public convenience and equity in relation to the public in their drinking habits and for the fact <Col N="2017" /> that there should be equity of treatment between rural and city dwellers.</P>
    <P>This legislation was also brought in to facilitate the enforcement of the law.  I am quite certain that every Minister for Justice since the State was founded has been well aware that the police have found it impossible to enforce the Sunday drinking laws.  Consequently steps are being taken by the Minister to rectify the position.  The other purpose of the legislation is to get rid of the anomalies in regard to differentials which have existed in our licensing laws since they were formulated.</P>
    <P>In the proposals which the Minister has put forward, most of which have been accepted, it has been necessary to drive a coach and four through many precedents in relation to the drinking habits of the public.  However, from the point of view of equity, it must be remembered that many <i>bona fide</i> traders have spent a lot of money modernising their premises in order to attract customers and spent a lot of time, energy and money in building a clientele.  Such a trader is now put certainly in a less favourable position as a result of this legislation and the case could be made that his livelihood is being interfered with and for that reason some compensation for him should be considered.</P>
    <P>Equally, the city publican could claim that, if Sunday trading is allowed in rural Ireland, the rural publican has an advantage over him he had not got hitherto.  The suggestion by the Minister for Lands that they had liberty under the 1927 Act, to get a six-day or a seven-day licence, has no validity. As Deputy Flanagan pointed out, we are talking about licensing laws in a completely different context.  The seventh day is a very important day from the point of view of trading and consequently none of the points the Minister for Lands put forward seems to have any validity.</P>
    <P>My main objection to the retention of the differential in relation to six-day and seven-day licences is supported by the broad thesis upon which the Minister decided to introduce this legislation, that is, to get <Col N="2018" /> rid of differentials.  If the Minister for Lands had not got so deeply involved in this as being a purely licensing question, if he could stand back and look at the position, that we have, on the one hand, a trader allowed to trade for six days and another trader given the privilege of being allowed to trade for seven days, he would have a more realistic approach.  He would see the absurdity of saying: &ldquo;We shall extend this trading practice to grocers, shoemakers, drapers, and so on.&rdquo;  That, as we know, would be anomalous and absurd and would bring chaos into the trading of any town.  It is something we would not initiate and, certainly, if it were established, we would get rid of it as quickly as we could.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the retention of the two types of traders is one of the most serious of the anomalies we should have got rid of.  We have the opportunity to do so, because we are dealing with legislation in relation to the entire licensing trade.  If we leave that anomaly, we are certainly leaving the two types of traders in an unjust situation, and we are leaving an anomaly, which the Minister said he would get rid of, by introducing this legislation.  Secondly, of course, he is leaving the other test, on which he seemed to me to examine all the legislation introduced here in relation to the licensing laws &mdash; the question of enforcement.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us it is essential that we should have Sunday opening in rural Ireland, because the law was completely in disrepute.  The Garda were unable to enforce the law and the people were just laughing at them.  The Minister made a very compelling case, excellently put, to convey to us, to persuade us, that this anomalous position of the seven-day licensees in the city and six-day licensees in the country, as it was virtually, should be abolished and that we should have seven-day facilities in the city and in the country as well.</P>
    <P>How then can we justify retaining that position which was related to the cities <i>vis-a-vis</i> the country before he introduced this legislation&mdash;he has <Col N="2019" /> now decided to retain precisely that position in a particular town &mdash; when the whole of the machinery of the law will be altered in order to get rid of what he has told us, and rightly told us, was a silly anomaly in the licensing laws as between urban and rural Ireland?</P>
    <P>He told us it was unjust and unfair to the public, that it was enforced on the traders and, of course, his main point, and probably his best point, was that anyway the differential could not be enforced.  We heard a most impassioned plea by the Minister for Lands suggesting that we must enforce another differential and that it would not be desirable on grounds of equity to get rid of it.  We have got rid of many differentials and precedents.  We have done that in the public interest, and that is the main interest.</P>
    <P>Pleas on behalf of the bereft widows of city publicans, widows in rural Ireland and other such cases that have little real force were put forward here. These are human considerations which are, I suppose, relatively important, but the general public considerations, the public interest, it seems to me, must be the prime consideration in discussing legislation, no matter whether it is licensing legislation, social legislation, health legislation, or anything else.  Where the general public welfare is concerned, then, it seems to me, there is a compelling case.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made that case himself by introducing this Bill.  A most compelling case is made by the Minister in the very fact that he has introduced this Bill with far-reaching effects.  To introduce seven-day trading in rural Ireland in order to get rid of the inequity of the position that had existed up to then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not a bit concerned with that.  We are dealing with a serious situation which requires revolutionary changes &mdash; and the changes put forward by the Minister are revolutionary changes in legislation &mdash; which are being very strongly resisted.  I admire the Minister for resisting the resistance to these changes.  He has brought in a Bill, and we are dealing with a very serious situation and it is impossible, as they say, to make an omelette without breaking eggs.  Probably a certain amount of hardship will transpire as a result.  Some will follow decisions he has already taken.  It is a question of degree, of how much he is prepared to do in order to carry through to a logical conclusion the whole fundamental basis upon which he has founded this legislation he has brought before the House.</P>
      <P>It seems to me it would involve relatively minor proposals, and relatively minor eventual changes, if this were a question which affected the whole seven days, but it is a question of one day not seven, and it will affect approximately 1,000 houses.  It is a relatively tiny problem, a relatively minor problem, compared with the very big sections he has attacked with great energy and originality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2021" /> This is a case which exemplifies, above all, the old saying about the man swallowing a camel and straining at a gnat, because it is really a relatively insignificant proposal.  So far as I am concerned, for the reasons I have put forward, I support the Minister's anxiety to get rid of the differentials, to get rid of the anomalies, to try to help the Garda to enforce the law in rural Ireland.  These are matters I am concerned with and that is why I am prepared to support the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the advantage of sitting here throughout the greatest part of this debate and listening to the interventions by the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Justice.  The last time he spoke, the Minister suggested that the Government had taken this decision already, and that the debate might be closed now, and that it might be referred back to the Government, by him, for further consideration.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied in my own mind that the Minister has yet an appreciation of the arguments put forward from this side of the House.  In fact, I am almost certain of that.  First of all, from his intervention when Deputy Sweetman was speaking, it is quite obvious that he did not get the real drift of what Deputy Sweetman was driving at.  I listened to Deputy Seán Flanagan's last intervention.  It is nice to hear a person speaking in Dáil Éireann who is fully conversant with his facts.  He is fully conversant with the facts and, furthermore, he is fully conversant with the facts as they apply to the part of the country in which he lives.  He knows that there will be untold hardship if this legislation goes through.  That must be obvious to every Deputy by now, if the Minister himself has not seen it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, ten or 12 Deputies have stood up, one after the other, and have made it crystal clear that the six-day licensee, when this Bill, as is intended by the Government, becomes law, will be at a disadvantage, not only in respect of selling drink, but in every other way, with his counterpart who has a seven-day licence.  The <Col N="2022" /> Minister for Lands argued last night, in so far as I understand him &mdash; he even went back 100 years &mdash; that these six-day licensees had an opportunity for 100 years to opt to change their six-day licences to seven-day licences, but that they had not opted to do so. That shows a total misunderstanding of the facts.</P>
    <P>The six-day licensees have never been up against it as they are now.  They were able to ply their trade.  It has been put by quite a few Deputies that they live in difficult circumstances. Many of them were in a poor way of living, just able to pay their licences and just able to carry on.  The argument is put up by the Minister that he is making it possible for them to buy one licence in their own court area, whatever the correct legal interpretation of that is, or two elsewhere. Does he stop to think where they will get the money?  From what we have heard here and from arguments put forward by people from the west of Ireland, who know the conditions there, we gather that the majority of them have not the money to do that and will not be able to do it.  It simply means that they will have to put a padlock on their doors and leave the country.</P>
    <P>I heard only one speaker on the Minister's benches argue in favour of this amendment and that was Deputy Davern, who seemed to think that some injustice was being done to the seven-day licensee.  I met the six-day licensees of my constituency at their request on two occasions.  I also had present several seven-day licensees.  I asked them, in the first instance, if it were not true that the six-day licensee was probably paying less, was not paying as big a licence as the seven-day licensee and could it not be argued that the seven-day licensee had paid more for a great many years and, therefore, that the six-day licensee might be looking for something, on those grounds to which he possibly was not entitled.</P>
    <P>To my surprise, I discovered that some of the six-day licensees were paying a greater licence fee than the <Col N="2023" /> seven-day licensees.  In fact, it bears out the point made just now by Deputy S. Flanagan that the basis of the licence is the square foot space and the appearance of the premises &mdash; not whether it is a six-day or seven-day licence.  I have had no representations from any seven-day licensee in my constituency protesting that if the six-day licensees are given justice, he will be affected in any way whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Here are the figures for my constituency. The situation there is not as acute as in county Mayo or county Monaghan or in some other constituencies. In county Wexford, we have 68 six-day licensees and 331 seven-day licensees, that is one-fifth of the number.  I cannot understand how, in a democratic Parliament, when a Bill like this comes up for discussion, a Minister will not take cognisance of the arguments that have been put before him.  It is not that the arguments came from this side of the House alone.  They came from a Deputy on the Government benches who knows what he is talking about.  He is a legal man.  He lives in one of the counties most vitally affected by this unfortunate section.  Furthermore, from that same Party, the Minister's predecessor in office, the former Minister for Justice in the Fianna Fáil Government, argued on the same lines.</P>
    <P>One is bound to accept that the Minister has been badly advised.  Every Minister has to rely on the advice he gets from experts.  I have had every opportunity of listening to this debate from end to end, to hear the points of view expressed by both sides of the House.  It seems to me the Minister is being advised to stand firm.  Surely there was never a case like this before? Surely there was never a case in which, by direct legislation &mdash; that is what it is tantamount to&mdash;a certain number of people, with dependants, who were struggling to make a living in their own country were deliberately put out of business?  If that is not a restrictive practice, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister <Col N="2024" /> because I do not think he has seen the arguments yet that are so crystal clear to the rest of us.  It would be easy for the Minister for Justice to say: &ldquo;In view of this debate, in view of the opposition that has been directed against this section, in view of the support shown for the amendment, in view of the arguments put forward in its favour, I feel this is a matter for consideration.  I am prepared to concede that these arguments are sound in substance and in fact.  I am prepared to consider the matter on Report Stage.&rdquo;  That would then be the end of it.</P>
    <P>I do not see how this House could accept the Minister's last statement that he proposes to bring the matter back to the Government and let them take a decision.  I have never been a Minister; I have never been in a Government.  I should imagine that there is certain collective responsibility in a Government, but at the same time if the Taoiseach appoints a Minister to a certain Department, he will take his advice, whatever it may be. Having heard this debate, I feel satisfied that the advice the Minister will give the Government&mdash;I hope his expert advisers are listening to this&mdash; is to stand firm.  I fear Dáil Éireann, our native Irish Parliament, may perpetrate an injustice which cannot be put right.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick said that some other Government will have to introduce legislation to rectify the situation.  It will be too late.  The padlocks will be on the doors of those people's houses.  They and their wives will be among the other emigrants leaving Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I would like to say has already been said.  I appeal to the Minister to take this opportunity of meeting the amendment and to end the State of inequality, so far as six-day licensees are concerned.  The Minister proposes to put the six-day licensees in the position that they will have to break the law, if they are to exist.  That is very wrong, especially in view of the fact that the Minister intends to enforce the law rigidly.  In other words, he intends to wipe out the six-day man because if he is not <Col N="2025" /> wiped out one way, he will be wiped out another way.  I appeal to the Minister not to perpetuate the attitude of &ldquo;To Hell or to Connaught&rdquo; that has prevailed for years as far as six-day licensees are concerned who abound in such numbers in the west.  I believe the minds of the framers of this Bill are far removed from the facts and the realities as they obtain in the west.</P>
      <P>I said I would be very brief.  I merely want to put it to the Minister that there will be no loss of face on his part if he is prepared to consider this question, especially in view of the fact that the amendment has got support from his own Benches.  I would ask him to submit it to the Government again.  If they take note of all that has been said they will grant justice to the unfortunate six-day licence holders.  That is all I have to say on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this question because of the fact that the Minister referred to the Report of the Commission on a number of occasions in connection with this problem of the six-day licensees. I happen to have been a member of that Commission and I am afraid that I cannot agree with the Minister's interpretation of what the Commission's views were on this problem of the six-day licence holders.</P>
      <P>The Commission put a number of advertisements in the papers and called upon interested parties, associations and individuals, to give evidence on the various aspects of the licensing law. The six-day licence holders were given an opportunity of putting their case before the Commission.  At any rate, my recollection is that of all the six-day licensees in the country only a group in Ballinasloe come forward to give evidence.  The Commission expressed their appreciation of the fact that the Ballinasloe people took such an interest in it and were alert to what the possibilities might hold as far as the future was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission in their Report stated that they heard evidence in connection with the six-day licence problem but that is as far as they went.  It should be clearly understood <Col N="2026" /> that the Commission made no positive recommendation as to whether the privilege extended to the seven-day licensees should be given to the six-day licence holders.  Neither did they make any recommendation that the six-day licence people should be penalised further.  I think what really happened in the long run is that for lack of evidence the Commission found themselves unable to make what we can describe as a positive recommendation. Therefore, I think it is unfair to suggest that the section in this Bill dealing with the six-day licensees is brought in as a result of the recommendation of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I find it very hard to understand why the Commission is being used so much with regard to six-day licensees when, in fact, there was no positive recommendation by the Commission on other important aspects, the Minister failed to adopt them.  I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister because I know what he has been up against since the very first day this Bill came into the House between pressure groups inside and outside it. I feel that they should be given every opportunity to consider this matter again rather than press the amendment in the House to a division.</P>
    <P>In spite of the fact that insufficient evidence or rather very little evidence was available to the Commission on this matter, I am satisfied that, since the sitting of the Commission, quite an amount of very concrete evidence has been brought to the attention of the Minister and to that of Deputies in connection with the hardships that will be suffered by the six-day licensees when this measure becomes law.</P>
    <P>It is no argument in the final analysis to say that because these six-day licensees failed to give evidence that they should, as a result of that, be more or less victimised in the proposed legislation.  I feel that the official view in the Minister's Department was: &ldquo;If these people did not think it worth their while to give evidence, we see no reason why they should get special privileges or that <Col N="2027" /> their case should receive more sympathetic consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  What I suggest is that every reasonable Government take to a great extent the advice given to them or give very serious consideration to the official advice given to them by their advisers. I am certain that the official advice given to the Government was: &ldquo;Those six-day licensees are all right as they are and we do not think there is any necessity for accepting the view put forward that they will suffer a disadvantage if the proposed changes are made in legislation.&rdquo;  I think that the Government took the advice in this instance of their very excellent Departmental advisers.  The Government have a wider duty to the community and that is to ensure that in so far as it is possible, uniformity is established.  That was one of the ideas the Commission had in mind all along in other respects &mdash; uniformity in the licensing laws.</P>
      <P>At the time I felt annoyed &mdash; I said so publicly in this House since &mdash; at the six-day licensees for failing to come along to the Commission.  Still, I feel that should not clinch the argument against them.  The majority of them come from Mayo and Monaghan and the town of Ballaghaderreen.  That covers practically the majority of the six-day licensees.  Some of them came to me not so long ago and I asked them why they did not put the case they made to me before the Commission. I thought that was a fair question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the spokesmen they had, I began to realise it was a waste of time.  I doubt if some of them had even read the papers as to what was going on.  I know some of them did not know the Commission was sitting. That may be interpreted as a slur on County Mayo.  In fact, it is true. It was only when the discussions started properly on the matter that <Col N="2028" /> these people began to wake up to the possibilities of what was likely to happen.  Consequently the House is now in the position that it has a lot of evidence with regard to what the dangers will be.  I agree it is a pity that all this evidence was not available 12 months ago.  It would have saved an embarrassing position in this House when a decision has tentatively been taken by the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will be put forward seriously that automatically the six-day licensee should be put on the same terms as the seven-day man.  There is no justice in that, but I do think that the case put forward by the six-day licensees themselves merits a little consideration. They maintain they are prepared to pay a substantial fine, if the Government will consider allowing them the seven-day licence.  If the six-day licensees go so far themselves, I do not think the House should seek to go further.  I would say to the Minister that if he intends to give further thought to this, he should consider the question of a penalty or a fine on the six-day licensees in order to preserve some idea of equity between them and those who have been paying for the seven-day licence all along.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that we are all inclined to think, in the case of the seven-day licence, that all you need to do is to travel three miles to qualify for a drink.  We are inclined to forget the old tag: you may drink to travel, but you cannot travel to drink.  Remember, the seven-day licences had not got the advantage over the six-day licences the House is inclined to think they had.  They had not got that advantage. It was only certain people, one out of every ten, in my opinion, who were strictly <i>bona fide</i> travellers.  Out of ten people, who have been drinking on Sundays during the legitimate hours, only one was a <i>bona fide</i> traveller.  We should bear that in mind.  We all agree that we connived at breaches of the law.  The people, the Guards, the Church, everyone, agree that we connived at breaches of the law.  Now, what is going to happen?  We are going to let the seven-day man open, the man who, <Col N="2029" /> up to now, had connived at breaches of the law.  His neighbour is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He did.  We all agree that Sunday opening was never observed properly.  Remember that you had to drink to travel, but you could not travel to drink.  If a person goes to Goatstown, strictly speaking, he is not a <i>bona fide</i> traveller, because he travels there to drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not <i>bona fide</i> even at three miles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, even if a person travels six miles &mdash; I think the Strandhill case decided that a good many years ago &mdash; he is not <i>bona fide</i> if he travels there for the purpose of drinking.  We all know that 90 per cent. of the people drinking on Sunday travelled for the purpose of drinking and for no other purpose.  The Guards could not distinguish them from <i>bona fide</i> travellers.  It is like the law in Scotland, where you have to travel through a place to drink. You cannot have it at your destination. You cannot have it unless you intend to move on or to return. Under the law, as we are now framing it, we are allowing the seven-day man, who has been conniving at breaches of the law, to open and we propose to enforce the law strictly against his neighbour who has also been conniving at breaches of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we could get some equitable way in which both could open during the same hours.  I am not suggesting opening under the same conditions.  We are of course forgetting the fact that if the six-day man is permitted to open on Sunday, he will have to pay the extra one-seventh of the licence duty which he has escaped up to the present.  If he paid it, he would be paying a find of some description. Last night, the Minister for Lands tried to distinguish, in law, between breaches of the law by a seven-day licence holder and by a six-day licence holder.  For instance, he told the <Col N="2030" /> House &mdash; and I was rather surprised to hear it come from him, a very prominent lawyer who is greatly respected in his profession &mdash; that a six-day licence holder could not be charged with the ordinary five counts for breaches of the licensing law if he sold drink on a Sunday and that the charge would have to be the charge of shebeening.  That is not so, although I did try to argue it myself a few times.  The Minister said the reason he could not be charged with breaches of the law for selling on Sunday was that he had no licence to sell on Sunday.  You might as well say the same thing about a seven-day licence holder who sells drink after 12 o'clock at night.  He has no licence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the six-day licence holder has no licence to sell on Sunday, then should not the seven-day licence holder who has no licence to sell after 12 o'clock on an ordinary week night be charged with shebeening after 12 o'clock?  Is it not the same position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>But it has never been recognised as such.  Both are in the same position.  The Minister for Lands said that down through the years we had this distinction between the six-day and the seven-day holder. That is so; it did exist and there is no doubt whatever about it.  But we must go back to the creation of the six-day licence.  Why was it created?  When it was created first in 1872, a seven-day licensee could open only for a very limited number of people, people who travelled, <i>bona fide</i>, a distance of three miles.  Remember, that their method of travel in those days was either on foot or on horse and how many people did legitimately travel in those days?  The licensing authority at the time said, &ldquo;Well, of course, possibly it does not pay you to keep open on Sunday.  We will give you the option of closing on Sunday.  We will give you six-days.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2031" /> I wonder what would those people opt for to-day if they knew that a House of Parliament was going to give them the opportunity of throwing open their premises for five or six hours on a Sunday?  Would they opt for a six-day licence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe they would.  I think it was Deputy S. Flanagan who pointed out that some of them opted for a six-day licence on religious grounds.  They opted for it on religious grounds, but they never for a moment thought that an Act of Parliament would draw this very big distinction between the seven-day and the six-day licensee.  If they did, they certainly would not have opted for a six-day licence.  The Minister should consider very carefully what Deputy Sweetman said this morning.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In my own town, there are only two 6-day licences. They have very nice businesses; they have opened lounge bars and installed television.  At the moment any person who wants to have a drink can have it on Sunday in a six-day premises just as well as in a seven-day premises.  Now we are going to close these two on Sundays and throw open the other nine or ten in the town.  Suppose any customer of one of these six-day licensed premises goes there five or six days in the week or even two days every week, he will find that on Sunday he cannot have a drink on those premises.  He must transfer his Sunday business to one of the seven-day premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can imagine the look of contempt a seven-day licensee will give him when he sees him coming in on Sunday. I can also see that customer trying to get into the good graces of the seven-day licensee by transferring his week-day business from the six-day to the seven-day premises, and I <Col N="2033" /> should be very sorry to see two decent publicans in my own town lose their business as a result of the deliberate action of this House.  As I said last night, this is a very good Bill, but here is one section I take exception to and I think the Minister would be doing a more equitable job if he accepted this amendment.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister cannot see his way to accept it as it stands, but if the Minister would give an undertaking that he will give to existing six-day licensees a seven-day licence on certain terms and conditions, perhaps, those terms and conditions would be acceptable to them and possibly to the House.  If that were done, it might offer a way out of the impasse, which has arisen in this matter.  The Minister can carry his section.  There is no doubt about that.  Deputies may have to vote with him who are certainly very much in favour of the amendment.  I think it is unfair to them because, as Deputy Dillon said, whether we close six-day licensed houses on Sundays or not, the business of the country will go on.  There is no great constitutional or political issue involved, and it is a pity this could not be left to a free vote of the House.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the point of view of some of the seven-day licensees who object to their six-day licensee neighbours, or rather, of some of the Deputies who spoke on their behalf: I have not heard an objection from one seven-day licensee himself &mdash; stating that it would be very unfair to have additional licences for sale of intoxicating liquor on Sunday.  The six-day men are now selling drink on Sunday and there is no grouse from the seven-day licensee about it.  There is no great vote-catching issue in this.</P>
    <P>Speakers in favour of the amendment have pointed out that the publicans for whom we are speaking are a very small minority and no Deputy can be accused of vote-catching.  In my own town, as I said, there are but two six-day licensees and I do not think if I turned them into seven-day licensees, I should ever get their votes. That is not the point.  I am sure some Deputies who would like to express <Col N="2034" /> their views on this matter could advocate much more strongly than I can the advantages we are giving to seven-day licensees.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister.  I certainly found him at all times a very reasonable man.  I do not think he is anxious to victimise anybody. It may be that his Department &mdash; certainly not for reasons of victimisation but for other reasons &mdash; have told him that he should not accede to this request&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I must correct that. That has been said before.  It is the Government that makes these decisions, not the Department.  The Department may advise the Government and the Government may accept or reject that advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but the Minister is usually the spokesman who puts the pros and cons of legislation he is advocating before the Government and unless members of the Government are particularly interested, they usually accept the advice tendered to them by the promoter of the legislation, so far as I know.</P>
      <P>Nobody can accuse Deputy G. Boland of being in any way partial. He is generally most impartial in the views he expresses here.  He was a member of the Commission and, as a member who signed the Majority Report, he admits that he was unaware of the case that could have been made for the six-day licensees.  I think it was Deputy Corry who attacked the six-day licensees for not putting their case before the Commission.  That is not so easy.  As I said, in county Donegal, you may have only six or seven six-day licences.  Other counties may have less and it is very difficult for these people throughout the Twenty-six Counties to get together, form an organisation and employ secretarial staff or legal representatives to present their case.  They depend entirely on Deputies to present their case to the Minister in a debate such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now Deputy G. Boland has been so impressed &mdash; as far as I know, he is a <Col N="2035" /> temperate man and a strict T.T. &mdash; by the arguments put forward by both sides of the House advocating acceptance of this amendment that he says now that had he been aware of the position, he certainly would have done something for the six-day licensees. The Deputy and the Minister are very much alike.  They are both what some people describe as &ldquo;Limejuicers.&rdquo; They are both men amenable to reasoned argument.  If the Minister changed places with his predecessor, Deputy G. Boland, he would, I think, be one of the first to get up and say: &ldquo;This is a good amendment and one which should be accepted.&rdquo;  Appreciating that, I think the Minister should meet it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been welcomed by the country generally because it will do away with the <i>bona fide</i> trade, enable more uniform hours to be kept and do away with all-night drinking in certain circumstances. The Bill has been put forward as making for uniformity and for easier enforcement of the law.</P>
      <P>There is an even more important aspect.  Every member of this House is anxious that there should be respect for the law.  If we want to have that respect, then we must make reasonable laws.  The ordinary people must be behind the Government and behind Parliament.  Those personally concerned must be behind Parliament. Our objective should be to ensure that both the public and the licensed traders feel that justice has been done in this Bill.  If they do not feel that, then we are back even further than where we started when we first set out. If we do not allow the six-day licensee to open on the seventh day, as is suggested in this amendment, we shall do him a grave injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the general consensus of opinion in the country.  That is the feeling the Garda have.  We are opening up the way to unfair competition. Up to this, the seven-day licensee had, like the six-day licensee, to close on Sunday.  He could serve travellers, but his front door was closed to the general public and, above all, to his own <Col N="2036" /> neighbours.  Under this Bill, the seven-day licensee will have the right to open his doors on Sunday and to serve his neighbours.  The six-day licensee will have no such right.</P>
    <P>There was a meeting of the licensed traders in Kilkenny at which the three Kilkenny Deputies were present.  The licensed traders agreed at that meeting that the six-day licensee should be allowed to open on the seventh day. Take the ordinary country town; if one house, a grocery and bar combined, is allowed to open and two or three other houses are compelled to close, the people will naturally go to that house for their groceries.  Wives will make their purchases in the grocery, while their husbands are having a drink in the bar.  The other two or three houses will be, to all intents and purposes, out of business. That is not right.  We should not in this House do anything which might result in that situation.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister for Lands said there has always been a differential. There was no differential when one was dealing with one's neighbours. Neither the six-day licensee nor the seven-day licensee could open his doors or serve his neighbours on Sunday. That will not be the position in future if this legislation goes through in its present form.  In fact, the differential will become more accentuated. Under this Bill, the seven-day licensee will be able to open his door wide and serve his neighbours, while the six-day licensee will have to remain closed.  I do not think it is fair that there should be that differential in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In some section of this Bill, the Minister has already removed endorsements and convictions against publicans. Surely, it is not too much to ask him to do justice where the six-day licensee is concerned and remove any restrictions there are on them. Surely, it is not too much to ask him to give them the right to open on the seventh day.  The Minister for Lands painted a vivid picture of the people in Castlebar queueing up in the street for hackney cars to bring them out to roadhouses to drink.  It sounded almost like an airlift.  In future, if this Bill goes through, these people <Col N="2037" /> will not have to hire hackney cars. They will be able to go into certain seven-day licensed premises in Castlebar. Why not permit all licensed premises to open on the seventh day? That would be the fair way of meeting the position.  I must admit I have never seen a queue in my town waiting for transport to go outside the three-mile limit for a drink.  Possibly, that is peculiar to Castlebar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>Hackney cars will no longer be necessary when this Bill becomes law.  There is a danger that the man who patronises the six-day licensed house now may transfer his patronage when he finds that he can drink in the seven-day licensed premises on Sunday in future.  He will not just drink in it on Sunday; he will put in an appearance once or twice during the week in order to ensure that he will get good service on Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, the Minister for Justice said that the laws up to this have not been recognised.  That is a very serious statement, coming from the Minister for Justice.  The enforcement of the law is his responsibility. Yet he stated last night that the licensing laws have not been recognised. That statement is the most telling statement that could be made in support of this amendment.  I think the country has grown up now. There was a time when one was clapped on the back for breaking the law, because it showed one was &ldquo;agin the Government.&rdquo;  We have our own Government now and people are no longer &ldquo;agin the Government.&rdquo;  They have their own native Government, and it is our duty as legislators to help them to respect the laws we <Col N="2038" /> make.  This Bill goes a good way towards doing that, and it would be a pity to retain in it some sections which would bring the law into disrespect.</P>
    <P>Up to the present, the Minister and the Commissioner of the Guards have not been able to enforce the existing law.  If the Guards feel in their hearts that the present Bill perpetrates an injustice against any person, it is only natural that they will not penalise that person because they feel an unfair advantage is being taken of him.  The Minister said this Bill will be enforced, but I doubt it.  Even a Government cannot stay in office if they have not the good-will of the people and I doubt if this law can be enforced, if the people are very honest in their Irish people are very honest in their own way.  If they feel an injustice is being done to any person, they are inclined to support him.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice said last night that there were 1,000 six-day licences in the country and 11,000 seven-day licences.  I should say that every member in the House will agree with me when I say that the extension to these 1,000 people of the right to open on Sunday would be a very small price to pay to secure the respect of the people for the laws of this country. Remember, if you bring the licensing law into disrespect, you are also bringing the general laws of the country into disrespect.  As I said, our people are nature and the Government should recognise that.  Although the Minister said this Bill will be rigorously enforced, I tell him now it cannot be. You can lead the Irish people but you cannot drive them.  The Government cannot drive the Irish people but they can lead them.  They should give justice in this Bill to this small minority of publicans, the small men who up to now have been able to exist but who will be put out of existence by this legislation.  The price we are asking the Minister to pay in order to bring the laws of this country into respect is a very small price indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJBurke" hpid="Mr. J.J. Burke Mr. J.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment. <Col N="2039" /> I am convinced that if the Minister fully appreciated the injustice he is doing to the six-day licence holders under this Bill, he would accept it. As far as my knowledge of the Minister goes, he is not a man who would wittingly inflict an injustice on anybody, but I think he is looking at this from the wrong angle altogether.  He is going on the assumption that he is taking nothing from the six-day licensee and is, therefore, not doing them an injustice.  What he appears to forget is that he is giving their neighbours, the seven-day licensees, something they never had before, something which gives them an unfair advantage over their six-day colleagues. Therefore, is he not doing an injustice indirectly to the six-day licence holders?</P>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to appreciate that the six-day licensee is not very worried about his Sunday trade.  What he is worried about is his whole business.  We have to admit that up to the present the licensing laws have not been enforced.  The case is made that there was a vast difference between the six-day and seven-day licensee, as far as Sunday opening was concerned.  If the law were enforced, there would be very little difference.  The fact was that if you travelled three miles, you could have a drink.  If any Guard went in and examined the customers in a seven-day public house on a Sunday, he would find that 99 per cent. of them had travelled for the specific purpose of getting a drink.  Therefore, 99 per cent. of them were breaking the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the law were enforced under the old Act, the position would not be as bad as it would be under this Bill. Take the case of a town where you have a certain number of six-day licences and seven-day licences.  I know such a town but I shall not name it because several Deputies have already made the case for it.  Up to the present, there was illegal drinking in that town on Sunday and everybody who wanted a drink could get it in a six-day or a seven-day house.  But what will happen if this Bill is passed in its present form?  Take the case of <Col N="2040" /> a man who not only drinks in a six-day house but who buys his groceries and so on in such a premises, because many of them carry on such trade. In nine cases out of ten, that man will become a customer of a seven-day house where he can have a drink on any day of the week he wishes.  Would the Minister not agree that he is doing a grave injustice to the six-day licensee by putting him in that unenviable position?</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter as well as the publican's aspect.  You are depriving the public in certain areas of a right you are giving to the public in other areas.  In places where there are seven-day houses, the public can go in and have a drink at certain hours on a Sunday, but in places where there are only six-day houses, they will not be able to do so.  In those places, the public will not be able to have a drink without travelling three, four or five miles to a seven-day house.  If these places are tourist resorts, they will be injured if drink cannot be obtained there on Sundays.  I think the Minister is creating an impossible position, if he does not put all these licences on a par.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern said this Bill confers no benefit whatever on seven-day licensees.  The Minister appears to take that view, too.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  Under the present law, nobody could legally go into a seven-day house who had not travelled three miles.  Under the Bill, the seven-day licensee can open to the general public for certain hours on Sunday.  Therefore, is the Minister not conferring a great benefit on the seven-day licensee and in that respect widening the gap between the six-day and seven-day licensee and, in fact, putting the six-day licensee completely out of business?</P>
    <P>He also said that most of these six-day licensees were wealthy men and that they did not want this trade at all. As far as I know, in my constituency, the six-day licensees are the poorer section of the licensed trade.  They are barely hanging on, but if what Deputy Davern says is correct, if the Minister accepts this amendment, we <Col N="2041" /> will not force those men to open on Sunday.</P>

      <P>If they do not want to open, they need not bother.  The Minister also said that he does not want to increase the number of public houses in the country which will be open on Sundays and that these amendments will tend to increase the number. That is ridiculous.  There are a certain number of people in Ballaghaderreen, let us say, or in any given town, and they have only a certain amount of money to spend.  If there are six public houses in that town, they will spend their money in them but if there are 26 public houses in it, they will not spend one penny more on drink.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is very much more to say about this matter because it has been debated very fully by all sides of the House.  Some Fianna Fáil Deputies have made a very good case for the six-day licences and that should make a very great impression upon the Minister because, no matter what Party we belong to, unless we feel very strongly on a subject, we are not going to oppose our front Bench on it. The Minister should reconsider his decision on it and if he cannot see his way to accept the amendments, the least he might do to make this a fair and equitable Bill is to leave it to a free vote of the House.  If the majority of the Deputies decide that six-day licences should be left as they are, I shall accept that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point that struck me, that both the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Lands always drag in the fact that there are too many licensed premises in the country.  We are all agreed on that but the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Lands seem to want to convey to the House and the public that the two amendments at present being discussed, if carried, will increase the number of licensed premises.  These amendments do not seek to do that at all.  We are not asking to increase the number by even one licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2042" /> The second point I want to bring home at present is that the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Lands, who have been sponsoring this Bill, want to convey that the seven-day licensee is getting no concession.  That is not true.  At the present time, the position roughly is that six-day licensees and seven-day licensees cannot open their doors on Sundays. Under this Bill, the seven-day licensee is getting a perfectly free concession, while the six-day licensee, if he wants the same concession, must purchase a seven-day licence and no one can say how many years he may be waiting for an opportunity to buy one because they are not available for sale so readily.  It boils down to the fact that we are giving a free concession to the seven-day licensee, while, at the same time, we are compelling the six-day licensee to purchase that concession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point to which I want to advert.  Some people seem to be under the impression that those of us who favour this amendment are desirous of extending the drinking hours considerably.  We are not.  Some of us held the view, during the early stages of the Bill, that the hours proposed were excessive, but as Deputy Corish stated, the House has ruled what hours should be accepted and we accept the decision of the House.  There is also the point that, in practice, there was disregard and disrespect for the law and that six-day and seven-day public houses were opened on Sundays.  If the front door was not open, at least the back door was, but there are six-day and seven-day licensees who have no desire at all in the world to do business on Sundays.  Their numbers may be very small but they have no intention of availing of the extended facilities granted by this Bill.  They want to lead a certain life; they consider that they are indoors all week and, even at the expense of loss of income, they will not surrender their freedom on Sundays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are asking the Minister to do is not to apply in such a mandatory fashion a restriction on relatively small numbers of those engaged in the <Col N="2043" /> trade in that respect.  We want those who are in a particular position, because of the fact that they may be contiguous to the church in a town or parish and may have certain facilities to provide by way of convenience to country people who come in some distance to church, to be free to do so.  They may be obliged, because of the absolute meagreness of their income, to guard jealously and protect that limited income by making the sacrifice involved in making these facilities available on Sundays, and we want to ensure that by Act of Parliament we do not drive out of business a limited number of the more depressed engaged in the licensed trade.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason we feel strongly on this amendment and I do not want it to be taken that, by supporting the amendment, we want an extension of hours for drinking.  We want to see justice done to everybody and it is for that reason we have been so emphatic and so persistent in pursuing our arguments for acceptance of these amendments.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few comments upon what certain Deputies said here this morning, especially the comments made by Deputy Moloney.  Deputy Moloney cannot speak with any real authority on the activities of six-day licensees on Sunday because I have discovered from the records of the House in relation to a question asked by Deputy Sweetman that in Listowel, the home town of Deputy Moloney, there is only one six-day licensed public house, so he could not have any real experience of dealing with six-day licensees; whereas in my home town and that of the Minister for Lands, there are 33 six-day licensees, in Ballyhaunis, 49; Westport, 21; Ballina, 45; Ballinrobe, 22; Claremorris, 21; Kiltimagh, 27; and Charlestown, 17.  You would not be a Mayoman if you did not know what was being carried on, legally or illegally, on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Deputy S. Flanagan knows the facts; the Minister for Lands knows the facts.  The Minister for Lands was quite insincere last night when he said that he could not find any illegal activities in Castlebar on Sundays.</P>

      <P>I know there were queues &mdash; they were not really big queues &mdash; but hackney cars were <Col N="2047" /> employed to bring people for pleasure and refreshments three miles outside the town to the various public houses in the country.  Why was this done? It was done because the law was rigidly enforced for a period of 15 years.  People left the town and went to the country public houses and at the same time the country people came in from the six-day areas into the towns.  Brendan Behan has said that the only day you could not have a drink in your own public house was Sunday, that you meet country people going to town and the towns people going to the country and suggested that it was an awfully ridiculous situation. We are tending to the very same thing if we do not accept this amendment. There will be frustration, discontent and disappointment in the towns where the activities of the six-day licensee will be at an end.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilbride accuses certain Deputies from Mayo of playing to the gallery.  We definitely are not playing to the gallery.  Rather are the Government playing with the very lives and livelihoods of the six-day licensees and their families.  They are putting an end to their activities.  They did an illegal trade on Sunday, the very same as the seven-day licensee.  If a person went into a seven-day licensed premises and found locals there, he was breaking the law.  The Minister has stated that our arguments would be brought to the Government for consideration.  If the Government want their pound of flesh, they will get it but with it they will get the blood and the livelihoods of the six-day licensees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a comment, as a neutral.  I am a city Deputy and not so interested in this amendment as are the rural Deputies. I suppose the people I represent have all they want.  The principle underlying this Bill is uniformity.  The people in the country have a grudge in that, in their case, there is not uniformity. For the purpose of uniformity, we have done away with the <i>bona fide</i> trade and are taking away from unlicensed persons the right to sell cider. In other words, we are making the <Col N="2048" /> hours for clubs the same as for hotels. Uniformity seems to be the underlying principle.  In this case, a lot of people are not to have the right to open on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Another underlying reason for the Bill is that the law should be enforced. This will encourage breaking of the law.  When people feel morally justified, justified in their own conscience, they will break the law.  If the other fellow can do it, they believe that they should do it.  People break the law in such circumstances.  Certain people justify criminal actions on the grounds that they cannot get a job.  That is their argument.</P>
      <P>Six-day licensees possibly will feel morally justified in their own conscience in breaking the law and once they feel that way about it, the law will be broken.  I would advise the Minister to give this matter second thoughts.  It is mainly a matter for rural Deputies, but, in my opinion, this section is contrary to the principle underlying the introduction of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I am going to do.  We had a great deal of discussion on this amendment.  There is considerably more agreement now <Col N="2049" /> on the basis upon which the matter should properly be considered than there was when the discussion started.</P>
      <P>When the debate started on this six-day licence question, many Deputies approached it genuinely in the belief that what was being sought was that compensation would be given to the six-day licensees.  I think many of them realise that is not the basis at all, that the entire basis is whether the six-day licensee would be enabled to keep the legal trade he has at the present time.  It is perfectly clear that if you have a man living in a street in any town in Ireland and if he has on his right hand a seven-day licence holder and on the left hand a six-day licence holder, if that man wants to obey the law he can drink either on his left or on his right, on Monday to Friday and also on Saturday up to half an hour earlier.  However, when Sunday comes he is not entitled legally to go to either the house on his right or on his left.</P>
      <P>If a Bill is passed without this amendment then the position will be that they man may drink in the house on his right on seven days of the week and in the house on his left only on six days.  Inevitably it will mean that he will go to the house in which he can drink every day.  People do not like changing their habits or changing their places of refreshment day in and day out.  Wherever they go, they want to make that their regular place of refreshment.  If the amendment or something like it is not passed it will mean that everybody in that street who has been accustomed to go to the six-day house will move to the seven-day house and the six-day man will be deprived of his livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in that spirit the matter should be approached, not in the spirit of giving concessions to anybody, but of enabling a man to retain what he has at present.  If we do not approach it in that way we are proceeding on an entirely fallacious basis.  I appreciate the way the Minister is considering the matter but he is considering it from an altogether wrong approach. He is considering it from the point of view of giving something to the six-day man.  I do not want anything given <Col N="2050" /> to him.  I want merely to ensure that what he has will not be taken away from him by this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The six-day man is at present trading on six-days of the week.  He has certain customers who live within, say, a three-mile radius, for want of a better phrase.  He has that trade legally.  The people in that area can trade equally with him and with the seven-day man.  The only people entitled to trade on Sunday with the seven-day licensee are people who come from three miles away.  If this Bill passes without the amendment we have put down or some amendment like it, the people will be in the situation that they must choose if they want to drink in their own street whether they will drink in one house on weekdays and in a different house on Sundays.  People will not do that. Therefore, they will go and drink on weekdays and Sundays in the seven-day house.  That means the Bill will take away trade the six-day man has at present.</P>

      <P>...when I submit the arguments that have been made here in respect of the six-day licensees it will be a matter for the Government to decide whether we should stand firm or whether we should be prepared to make some other extension of the provisions which we have already proposed.  I can make no promise other than that.  I think the House decided to have the Committee Stage decided to-day.  We have been discussing it for a considerable time and I think the House should decide upon it now and let the Government consider whatever action is necessary afterwards.</P>

      <P>The Health (Officers Age Limit) Declaration, 1960, fixes age limits for all pensionable offices under local authorities for which the Minister for Health is the appropriate Minister.  The age limit is seventy years for district medical officers and sixty-five for other officers. For an officer, who would not be entitled to a pension were he to retire at the fixed limit, the age limit is the age at which he becomes so entitled.  The declaration will become effective on 1st July next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already announced that certain concessions are to be made in the application of the age limit for district medical officers.  A new declaration will be made shortly to give effect to this.  For most of the <Col N="2057" /> other offices, to which the declaration applies, there is already an age limit of sixty-five years, fixed by earlier declarations, and the holders of such offices are practically unaffected by the declaration.  There are, however, some minor offices for which there is no age limit at present.  I have received representations on the application of the declaration to these, and am considering whether any concession can be made for them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that thirty-four permanent nurses attached to Saint Mary's Chest Hospital, Phoenix Park, have been requested to transfer to another institution caring for persons suffering from tuberculosis; whether he is aware that the permanent staff are anxious to avoid such a transfer and are willing to nurse, if necessary, patients other than those suffering from tuberculosis who may be admitted to the hospital; and, if so, if he will request the Dublin Corporation to make other arrangements for staffing their institutions which care for patients suffering from tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the number of tuberculosis patients in St. Mary's Chest Hospital has been declining, and as James Connolly Memorial Hospital is almost completely occupied by tuberculosis patients, I understand that, in January last, Dublin Corporation invited applications from permanent nurses in St. Mary's Hospital who have special qualifications and experience in tuberculosis nursing, for transfer to James Connolly Memorial Hospital.  Nurses employed in the Dublin Corporation Sanatoria service are liable for service in any of the Corporation's Sanatoria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the following month, the Dublin Assistant City Manager, who deals with health matters, met a deputation sent on behalf of the nurses who feared that they would lose status, seniority, etc., if they transferred or were transferred.  He was able to give them the necessary assurances and undertook to meet them again if they <Col N="2058" /> so wished.  No request for a further discussion has been received.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, the nurses have any proposals to put forward, I suggest that they discuss them first with the Assistant City Manager.  From what has happened to date, I have no reason to believe that in the present case the local authority will act other than with the utmost sympathy and consideration, subject, of course, to its over-riding obligation to ensure that the best possible service will be provided for the patients under its charge.</P>

    <P>In January last, officers of Dublin Corporation, Grangegorman Mental Hospital Board and Dublin Board of Assistance discussed with officers of my Department the question of the use of the surplus accommodation available at St. Mary's.

Certain details in regard to numbers and type of staff to be provided remain to be finalised, but I hope to be in a position shortly to give the necessary sanction so that the proposal can be implemented at an early date.

      <P>I have seen the report referred to and I regret to say that the position in the Mallow County Hospital was correctly stated by the acting county surgeon.</P>
      <P>The I.M.A. boycott of medical posts was applied with particular severity to Mallow County Hospital and to the acting county surgeon who is employed there.  The local authority found it impossible to recruit a locum or deputy for the Surgeon; indeed when long overdue holidays were granted to that hard-pressed officer in October and November last the grave and unprecedented step of closing down the surgical side of the hospital was forced on the local authority.  Fortunately, nobody died as a result of this serious action.  If they had, it could scarcely be denied that the boycott of the I.M.A. would have been responsible. In any event, lives were endangered, and inconvenience, stress and strain were imposed on the hospital services in the area and on the surgical patients who, as a result of the boycott, were dispersed to other hospitals.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, I regret to say that doctors who would have worked in Mallow County Hospital were intimidated from taking up duty.  The approved resident medical establishment of Mallow County Hospital is one registrar and two house-doctors. Efforts of the local authority to recruit young doctors for these posts have failed; I have documentary evidence that the I.M.A. refused to accept advertisements for these posts in the Journal of the Medical Association although they accepted advertisements for similar medical posts in other local authority hospitals.  I also have documentary evidence that the I.M.A. prevailed on the British Medical Association to refuse to accept similar advertisements in the British Medical Journal.  All this, no doubt, as part of the Association's &ldquo;Advisory Service&rdquo; to its members.</P>

      <P>The placing of Prize Bonds on sale throughout the year would involve higher publicity and other issue expenses.  In addition, in order to place all purchasers of bonds on an equal footing as regards participation in the draws for prizes, it would be necessary to hold draws more frequently than at present thereby entailing further expense.  I am not at present satisfied that having the bonds on sale all the year round would result in sufficient extra investment to justify these higher costs to the Exchequer.  In common with other aspects of the Prize Bonds scheme, however, the question of the sale periods for the bonds will continue to be kept under constant review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if in view of the profits far in excess of the risks carried being made by assurance companies in respect of industrial life policies he will in the interests of justice to the poorer sections of the community take steps, including the introduction of amending legislation, to relate the premiums more equitably to the amounts paid under such policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are five companies or societies transacting industrial assurance business in this country, and the competition generated as a result should ensure that premiums are not fixed at unduly high levels. There is no evidence available to me which would indicate that excessive profits are being earned on this class of business and I would not propose to amend the legislation in this connexion, even if it were practicable, <Col N="2070" /> which it is not, to control premium rates by Statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that if a policy were taken out 20 years ago, with a weekly premium of 2/- to cover the sum of £37, the total amount of premiums already paid would be in the region of £110&mdash;three times the amount covered by a policy 20 years ago?  Is the Minister further aware that if a policy were taken out ten years ago to cover a sum of £135, with a weekly premium of 12/6d., over £315 would not be paid in respect of such a policy and in light of that would he not reconsider his attitude?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The companies to which I have referred have a system whereby they can distribute surpluses among shareholders and/or their policy holders.  I suggest to the Deputy that by these means, with any surpluses or excess profits that they might get, they can make a reasonable distribution amongst those who contribute to the funds of the insurance company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, either on his own initiative or in collaboration with other Ministers concerned, he will give guidance along practical lines to local authorities who are anxious to provide covered swimming pool facilities but are faced with serious difficulty on account of the cost; whether he will encourage the carrying out of pioneer work by local authorities as an experiment in the direction of providing less elaborate pools than those now regarded as traditional, for instance by employing fibre glass or similar material as an alternative to glazed tiles for lining material; and whether he will consider the promotion of a scheme whereby architects or consultants could be invited to design a pool on a competition basis with an award of special marks for low cost.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if it is the policy of his Department to make grants available to local authorities who are anxious to provide covered swimming pool facilities; and, if so, if he will indicate what kind of assistance he might be prepared to give in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The number of local authorities proposing to build swimming pools, whether covered or outdoor, is limited.  The capital cost of these works is a major deterrent in many instances, and I would, therefore, welcome any proposals from the local authorities concerned for the construction of such pools in the most economical manner.  My Department will be prepared to give all the advice and assistance at its disposal in such cases.  Owing to the great variety in the nature of the proposals involved in different areas, I do not think that a competition would produce practicable designs capable of general application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards financial assistance, contributions may be made from my <Col N="2076" /> Department's Vote towards loan charges incurred by sanitary authorities either in providing swimming pools themselves, or in making grants to local committees for their provision. The following general conditions apply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Plans, specification and estimate of work proposed for subsidy must be submitted in the usual way.</P>
    <P>(b)  In areas where water and sewerage schemes are required such schemes must have priority.</P>
    <P>(c)  The rate of contribution for each case will be determined individually having regard to the circumstances.</P>
    <P>(d)  In the case of pools provided by local committees, satisfactory assurances as to maintenance must be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Loans may be issued from the Local Loans Fund in suitable cases, at the rate of interest obtaining at the date of issue.  The maximum repayment period for such loans is 30 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Minister for Finance, in a letter dated 30th January, informed the Dublin Corporation with regard to its proposal for building a swimming pool that a similar proposal had been made by Dún Laoghaire Corporation, and that he said that there was a greater advantage in having such a pool in the Dún Laoghaire area?  May I assume that whatever proposals there are for Dún Laoghaire will not interfere with any proposals coming from Dublin Corporation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The abnormal difficulties associated with this estate, due to its connection with an adjacent commonage extending over some 4,000 acres, were mentioned in reply to a previous Question by the Deputy on 25th February, 1959, and more recently in reply to a Question by Deputy Corish on 18th November last.</P>
      <P>It is felt that the most satisfactory over-all plan for disposal of the Brennan estate can be formulated only when the numerous legal complications &mdash;involving such matters as boundary difficulties, grazing and turbary claims and rights of way&mdash;affecting the commonage have been eliminated.</P>
      <P>Progress is necessarily slow and tedious, and, because of the amount of local adjustment needed, I must frankly say that it is not easy to foresee a speedy solution.  Nevertheless, I have asked that the case be given unremitting attention.</P>

      <P>I understand that the 1955 listener research inquiry was undertaken primarily to provide Radio Éireann with information and assistance in connection with the planning of programmes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 45:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9) On the hearing of any application for a new licence brought by virtue of the provisions of this Act or any other Act, the Court may, at the request of the applicant, treat the application as an application for a declaration under this section and on making such a declaration the Court may include therein, if such be the case, a declaration that the Court is satisfied as to the character and fitness of the applicant and that the application for a licence is refused solely on the grounds of the unsuitability of the premises at the time of hearing the application.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to enable an applicant for a licence to ask, on the hearing of the application, that the application be deemed to be an application for a certificate, as envisaged by the Bill.  The reasons for the amendment are quite simple.  Frequently one comes across cases where the applicant applying for a licence either has not got the work entirely finished at the time of the application or a position arises in which the judge, hearing the application, indicates that he is not satisfied with the premises as they then stand, but that he would be disposed to grant the application if certain alterations were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion in my amendment <Col N="2095" /> is that in such circumstances the applicant, rather than be put to the trouble and expense of starting entirely new application proceedings, should be entitled to ask the court to deem his application at that stage to be an application for a certificate.  The certificate would be the type of certificate envisaged in the Bill.  That would enable the applicant, if granted such certificate by the court, to finish the work, on the one hand, or to carry out the alterations indicated by the court, on the other, and then come back to the court and get his licence, rather than that he should have to start all over again because of some possible minor lack of finish at the time he went in to make his application or because of some trivial minor alterations indicated by the Court as necessary.  That is as far as amendment No. 45 is concerned.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 46 is consequential and deals with Section 13 of the Bill.  Section 13 refers to the licensing of premises which are the subject of a declaration under the Act.  If my amendment No. 45 is accepted it would be necessary to provide for that in Section 13.  I think the Minister for Lands in any event will have a knowledge of the type of situation to which I am referring and which does require simplification.  In any event, I think there are definite merits in favour of this amendment.  I do not proposes to press the Minister to accept the amendments precisely in the form in which they are moved.  If the Minister would indicate that he agrees in principle to an amendment to cover this situation, I would be quite satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that these amendments are defective in form.  Section 12 provides for the granting of what is, in effect, a declaration of approval in principle for the granting of a licence for a particular premises that the applicant proposes to build, to reconstruct or to buy.  The declaration will, as a rule, be given on the basis of plans of the construction work proposed, and the declaration is, above all, a declaration of the suitability <Col N="2096" /> and convenience of the premises. Deputy O'Higgins's amendment envisages that this declaration could be granted, even if the premises are unsuitable. He goes on, in amendment No. 46, to provide that a licence must in due course be granted if the premises are completed or altered in substantial accordance with the terms of the declaration.  But there could be no question of premises being completed in accordance with a declaration given under Deputy O'Higgins's amendment, for the simple reason that that amendment deals with the case where an application is being made for a new licence and where, therefore, the court is dealing with premises as they are and not with plans of new premises or of proposed reconstruction.</P>
      <P>One cannot speak of premises being completed in accordance with a declaration unless the declaration is linked with plans.  It would not be so linked under the Deputy's amendment.  If the applicant has plans, and they are approved, then, of course, he can get his declaration under Section 12 as it stands.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from the fact that the two amendments, Nos. 45 and 46, are defective for the reasons I have explained, I am afraid that I cannot agree with what the Deputy is trying to achieve.  The Deputy is concerning himself with a person who has neither a suitable premises nor plans for a suitable premises.  If he has one or the other, he will be catered for in full without any amendment by the Deputy. What the Deputy wants amounts to this.  He wants to create a situation in which a person with an unsuitable premises or inadequate plans can go into Court and get from the Court a declaration saying, in effect: &ldquo;You are a suitable person to have a licence and the site or location of your premises is also suitable and objection by other publicans in the neighbourhood will not be sustained.  If you produce suitable premises, you will get a licence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question to be asked about this is what is the necessity for it. We are providing in the Bill that a person may go into court and seek <Col N="2097" /> a declaration without committing himself to the expense of buying or building the premises that he has in mind. We are providing that the court may give an approval in principle to the granting of a licence for the premises, irrespective of who the licensee may be in due course, as long as he is a suitable applicant; he does not have to be the person who applies for the declaration.  The Deputy apparently wants to cater for a person who will not even go to the trouble of producing adequate or acceptable plans. Why should we cater for such a person?</P>
    <P>But it is not merely a question of why should we cater for him.  We cannot do so.  Opposition to the grant of a licence, and the court's decision as to whether a licence ought to be granted, would often be greatly influenced by the type of premises to be licensed. A court might very well be disposed to grant a licence for premises planned to provide amenities other than drink where it might otherwise refuse.  The opposition of other publicans and of residents in an area might well be influenced by the size of the premises proposed.  It is, surely, quite obvious that before a court could give approval in principle to the granting of licensing facilities, it would have to see at least a plan of what sort of premises is proposed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also wants the applicant to be able, at the preliminary stage, to get a declaration of his own personal suitability.  There are several reasons why we ought not do so. First of all, such a declaration would be unnecessary and pointless except in borderline cases, where there is a doubt about personal suitability.  I see no reason why we should go out of our way to cater for such cases. As far as 99 applicants out of 100 are concerned, no question of unsuitability would ever arise.</P>
    <P>If, however, we do look at the exceptional type of case, we must recognise that a person might appear suitable today but might be shown to be unsuitable long before the final application would come to be made perhaps two years hence&mdash;he might well be convicted of offences of a kind <Col N="2098" /> which would make him quite unsuitable. This alone puts out of question the idea of giving a certificate of personal suitability perhaps two years before this could possibly become an issue.  But apart from that, the declaration that is provided for is a declaration attaching to premises, actual or planned, and has nothing to do with any individual.  The declaration will be valid for any particular applicant who may, before the premises are licensed, acquire the necessary interest in them, provided of course he is not unsuitable.  For these reasons, neither in form nor in substance, could I accept the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to miss the point of the amendments. I think the reason is that he is reading out a prepared brief in reply to a case which has in fact not been made and which it was not intended by me should be made in these amendments. The Minister appreciates when he talks about an applicant having suitable or unsuitable premises that that is a question which is decided by the Court.  As far as the applicant is concerned, he is going into Court and presenting his premises to the Court. He does not know at that stage whether or not those premises will be dubbed as suitable or not by the Court.  The simple point I am trying to cover is this.  You do not infrequently come across cases where the Court says to an applicant: &ldquo;Your premises are not entirely suitable, but with a slight alteration here or extension there your premises would be suitable.&rdquo;  At present the Court carries out its functions through the existing legislation.  Under this Bill, as drafted, the court must refuse that application on the grounds that the premises are unsuitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That possibly could be done but if the law, as the Minister informs us, is hereafter to be fully enforced, the court should refuse the application and I am simply trying to cover that case by enabling the court&mdash;remember it rests with the <Col N="2099" /> court, not the applicant, under my amendment&mdash;if requested by an applicant to say it is prepared to deal with this matter on the basis of considering it as an application for a certificate. The court could then give a certificate to the effect that if the applicant carried out certain alterations on the premises, the premises would be suitable premises in the view of the court.  That is all that is involved in these two amendments.</P>
      <P>There is no need to set up bogies which do not exist, as the Minister did in his prepared reply.  I am not urging the matter on the case which the Minister tried to knock down.  I am not interested in the particular form of the amendment and, if the Minister thought there were more suitable ways of framing the amendment, I should be quite happy about it.</P>

      <P>I agree there is no obligation on the court in strict law but the judges invariably are not unreasonable men in matters of this kind.  Certainly if the application is any way reasonable, is just something small, I have no doubt that any court would give the applicant, on grounds of expense and convenience, the opportunity of putting it right.  What could be done under the type of amendment which the Deputy suggests is an entirely different matter and I think, as far as Section 12 of the Bill is concerned, it gives a new power, a very useful power, and I cannot see the necessity for the amendment suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement this time with the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Lands. <Col N="2100" /> This amendment is not really one which simplifies an application for a new licence.  It relieves the applicant for a new licence of responsibility of providing money for the erection of his proposed licensed premises so as to enable him to proceed.  At least that is what I gather the amendment visualises and I think that this matter, as explained by the Minister for Lands, is adequately dealt with in the Bill.  I do not really see any necessity for the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 46a:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) A declaration under Section 41 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, which is in force at the commencement of this Act, shall, notwithstanding the repeal of that section, remain in force for the period provided for in subsection (5) thereof and shall be deemed for the purposes of subsection (7) of Section 12 of this Act and subsection (1) of this section to be a declaration under subsection (1) of Section 12 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is little more than a drafting amendment to repair an omission from the section as it stands.</P>
      <P>The Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, made provision whereby a person who intended to build or acquire premises for an hotel could apply to the court on the basis of the plans of the premises and, if the court was satisfied in the matter, it could grant to the applicant a declaration that a licence would in due course be granted for the premises, if constructed in substantial accordance with the plans.  As the House is aware, this Bill, in Section 12, proposes to apply that principle to all licensed premises, and the relevant provisions of the 1952 Act are being repealed because they become superfluous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> It is possible, however, that at the time the Bill becomes law there may be in existence some declaration granted under the 1952 Act, the holder of which will not have completed the construction of the premises to which the declaration relates, with the result that the relevant licence will not have been granted under the terms of the declaration.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that if any such cases exist, licences will be given in accordance with the declarations, notwithstanding the repeal in this Bill of the provisions under which they are granted.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may at this point mention briefly that it has been suggested to me that I should extend the principle of the section a little further by allowing applications to be made to the court on the basis of plans, by persons who wish to obtain a restaurant certificate, that is, a certificate that the premises are structurally adapted for and mainly used as a restaurant.  I should like to consider this and perhaps bring in an amendment on Report Stage in this regard.</P>

      <P>There is no juggler or prestidigitator in the known world who could understand the meaning of that, and I merely wish to record a legislative protest against legislation in that form. Some effort should be made by the draftsmen to make the law reasonably comprehensible, not only to those who are required to enact it but to those who are afterwards required to advise their clients in regard to its provisions.</P>

The position at the moment is that every hotel that has been granted a new licence is carrying on a trade similar to a public house trade and in a great number of cases these small hotels who have gained licences are doing a trade far in excess of that carried on by the public houses and are paying a far smaller licence fee.</P>

      <P>In page 13, line 16, before &ldquo;registered&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;entitled to be&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide that if premises are entitled to be registered, even though they have not yet actually been registered, they should be eligible for renewal in the terms of Section 16 of the Bill.  I am urging it on the Minister.  Does he accept it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 provides that hotels which get new licences in future must, as a condition of the renewal of those licences, be registered <Col N="2103" /> with An Bord Fáilte.  It does not apply to hotels now licensed other than hotels which are subject to the requirement already, that is to say, hotels licensed by virtue of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, and there are very few of these hotels, if there is any at all.  Practically speaking, therefore, the section is confined to hotels which get licences for the first time after the Bill becomes law. Deputy McGilligan's amendment proposes, in effect, that it should suffice if the hotel is entitled to be registered with Bord Fáilte, even if it is not registered in actual fact.</P>
      <P>When the section was being drafted, we deliberately decided to require registration only for renewals and not for the first granting of the licence, because we felt that it might happen for one reason or another that the original application to the court might have to be made before registration with the board had been completed. The section as drafted takes care of the time factor in this respect&mdash;as long as the registration is completed before the first renewal becomes due, that is sufficient.</P>
      <P>Once we get beyond this initial stage, however, I think that it would be wrong to accept anything less than actual registration with Bord Fáilte. If premises are entitled to be registered with the board, I do not see why the proprietor should not register them as soon as possible.  I do not think that it would be in accordance with public policy, as enshrined in the various Tourist Traffic Acts, to allow concessions to be given for premises on the grounds that they are an hotel, if the premises are not registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that, in the first instance, if a person applies for registration, he has substantially a year's grace and that it is only if he comes back for renewal and has not by then registered, he will be caught by the section.  Is that substantially correct?</P>

      <P>I should like <Col N="2104" /> to be clear on this, because, if I understood the Minister aright, possibly the need which I was trying to meet in the next amendment does not arise.  As I read Section 16, it refers to the certificate for the renewal of a licence in respect of the Tourist Traffic Act but it seemed to me, carrying on from that, to refer to the granting of a certificate after this Act by virtue of Section 2, subsection (2), of the 1902 Act.  I took that to mean, not simply the first renewal of a certificate granted under Section 2, subsection (2), of the 1902 Act but the actual granting of a certificate. Am I mistaken in that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally on the section, I should like to say that I do not regard it as being entirely satisfactory.  I am relating this to Deputy McGilligan's amendment.  It seems to me that the Government, by virtue of this provision, are now setting up the Tourist Board as the arbiters as to whether or not a hotel should continue to hold a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that this is a very great departure from the law.  It seems to me that whether or not a hotel or any other licensed premises should continue to hold a licence is a matter which should be dealt with by the court and not by the Tourist Board.  Under Section 16 <Col N="2105" /> of this Bill, the say is being given to the Tourist Board as to whether these hotels will get a renewal of their licence or not, because, if the Tourist Board decide that whatever requirements are imposed by them for registration as a hotel are not being complied with, the board will not continue to register that hotel in their register.  If it is not registered, the licence cannot be renewed.  I think that is the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan's amendment might afford some protection against a capricious use by the Tourist Board of their powers because the amendment at least would put the hotelier in a position, if he thought he was entitled to be registered, of claiming then that he was entitled to a renewal of his licence and having the matter tested out in the court, whereas if the section remains as at present, unamended, the hotelier who is not registered or whose registration is not continued by the Tourist Board, has no business going into court looking for his renewal because the first question that must be asked is: &ldquo;Are you registered with the Tourist Board and, if you are not, you cannot get a renewal.&rdquo;  It seems to me that that is taking the power away from the court and vesting it in the Tourist Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually, the principle to which the Deputy has referred has been accepted largely already by the House in the 1952 Act.  In actual fact, without this at all, under the form of procedure, the courts these times in practically all cases of hotel licence applications insist on the Tourist Board's recognition being proved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>They may not always be satisfied.  The best check and safeguard a court can have that the premises for which the licence is sought will not be used as a glorified &ldquo;pub&rdquo;, that the application is not being made solely for the purpose of getting a licence to sell liquor, is to ensure that Bord Fáilte have passed it as a hotel suitable to be licensed. That is the best safeguard for all concerned, including those in the licensed trade.  Under the 1952 Act, the House did accept the principle, which is, I <Col N="2106" /> agree, extended very slightly by this provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that under the 1952 Act Board Fáilte approval applied only in respect of new licences?  Under this section, it will be obligatory on applicants to satisfy Bord Fáilte in respect of a renewal of a licence.  Under the 1952 Act, existing licenses had not to get a certificate from Bord Fáilte but under this change, it is proposed that all licensees, whether applicants for renewals or new applicants, must have a certificate from Bord Fáilte.</P>

In addition, you must have the usual accommodation for staff, and so on.  Therefore, I do not quite understand the Deputy's point when he says the board might recognise six bedrooms and that you could throw in a few boxrooms in order to come within the hotel law. As a matter of experience, I know that you must show that you have these ten bedrooms fully furnished and set aside specifically for guests, irrespective of the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in thinking that under Section 2 of the 1920 Act, there is an artificial definition of a hotel.  Under that section, the expression &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; refers to a house which has at least ten bedrooms set aside exclusively for the use of travellers.  The register of hotels kept by the Tourist Board is a different <Col N="2109" /> thing entirely.  My objection to the section is not because of any possible conflict between the register of the Tourist Board, on the one hand, and the definition in the 1902 Act, on the other hand.  It is because it seems to give the Tourist Board the last say as to whether or not a genuine hotel is to continue to hold its licence or not.</P>
      <P>The Tourist Board, in respect of registration of premises in its register of hotels, has a whole set of requirements which, within the past 12 months, have been stiffened up.  They intend to look into such matters as the provision of a proper reception desk and reception facilities, hot and cold water, and so on, in bedrooms and certain minimum standards which will have to be observed in the case of premises which want to get on the register of hotels.</P>
      <P>Some of these requirements which are minimum requirements by the Tourist Board may have nothing at all to do with whether or not the premises are suitable to hold a licence for serving drink.  It seems to me that it is not right that the Tourist Board requirements, which may be in no way related to the drinking facilities of the hotel, should be allowed to override the decision of the court that a premises should be licensed.</P>

      <P>I think there is some confusion as between my understanding and the Deputy's understanding of the situation.  We are dealing here in Section 16 with new hotel licences. The Deputy will understand the reasons, without my elaborating on them, why a court must be very careful about the granting of a new hotel licence, and particularly a hotel licence in a country area.  The tendency has been to try, since 1952, in many instances to get a hotel licence, shall I say, for the purpose of getting a liquor licence.  This principle, as I have said, has been accepted in the 1952 Act.  Under this section, it is proposed that a hotel to get a new licence, in future, must be on the register of the Tourist Board.</P>

      <P>In respect of the 1902 Act, the position, in fact, is that the applicant did have a choice.  I have seen that choice exercised for different purposes.  By proceeding under the 1902 Act, without going near the court a chance is taken to complete the premises and then go to the court, all in one go, if I may put it like that.  By going on the other procedure under the 1952 Act, they were expending no money except the architect's fees.  They applied to the court to have the plans approved and then they were all right, if the building subsequently complied with the plans.  Under the 1902 Acts, even since the passing of the 1952 Tourist Act, in actual practice, before granting a hotel licence, the courts had, of necessity, some evidence from the Tourist Board.</P>

      <P>There is another way. The applicant who takes the risk of going into court and looking for a hotel licence under the 1902 Act without availing of the most simple proof of the suitability of the premises for a hotel, has no chance, in my view, of getting a licence from any court now. I think the Deputy will agree now on the desirability of that assurance where a new hotel licence is granted. Remember, under this section, we are granting a hotel licence possibly in areas where the hotel bar will be in competition with the local licensed premises and these facilities should not, on that ground, be granted, except in the case of a genuine hotel.  They <Col N="2111" /> will be new premises and, therefore, there is no reason, in my view, why they should not comply with the requirements laid down for hotels by the Tourist Board.</P>
      <P>That would be in the national interest, in the interests of the tourist business, and in the interests of the Tourist Board.  With all due respect to the courts, they are in a far better position to assess, or to judge, the suitability of hotel accommodation than a learned judge might be.  At all events, it will save the courts a lot of trouble if the Tourist Board witness is prepared to say: &ldquo;We have already passed the premises as being suitable in accordance with our standards&rdquo;. The court need then concern itself only with the character of the applicant.</P>
      <P>I suggest the section is a good section and, if I may say so, it is very necessary in order to prevent people from trying to get any kind of gazebo licensed for the purpose of selling drink, and not a genuine hotel.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) This section shall not apply to an application for a certificate for the renewal of a licence which was granted after the passing of this Act by virtue of paragraph (2) of section (2) of the Act of 1902 if the notice of application in respect of which the licence was granted was pending for hearing in the Circuit Court prior to the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite clear, now that that discussion has taken place, whether or not this amendment is necessary.  I am rather inclined to think it is, for the purpose of seeing that by this legislation we do not prejudice the position of any applicant who may have his application before the court at the moment.  It seems to me that under the provisions of the Bill at present, if the Bill were to go through to-day, and if there were an application at hearing in court to-day, if that application <Col N="2112" /> were to be continued to-morrow, there might be an alteration of the law.  That might lead to the rediculous position that where to-day an applicant is entitled to a hotel licence under the 1902 Act, to-morrow he is not.</P>
    <P>The type of case I have in mind is: under the 1902 Act, Section 2, a hotel with ten bedrooms is entitled to get a licence from the court, whether in the city of Dublin or outside it.  This Bill will provide that hereafter, so far as the city of Dublin is concerned, an applicant must have 20 bedrooms before he can get a licence.  It seems to me that we must safeguard the position in all fairness and in all justice for the applicant who at present has an application before the court.  I do not know how many cases are involved.</P>
    <P>In relation to Section 16, the necessity for Tourist Board registration for renewal of licences will apply only to new licences, as I understand from the discussions which have taken place.  If the existing licences are not to be prejudiced, I think the applicant who, before this Bill goes through, has his application before the court and is, on foot of that application, granted a licence, should be in the same position as an existing hotel licensee.</P>

      <P>The Explanatory Memorandum has the explanation of Section 20.  The explanation reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the 1902 Act made provision for the granting of a new licence to cover an extension of a licensed premises where the extension made the premises more suitable for the business.  Its scope is limited, however, to premises licensed at the date of the passing of the Act and there is no provision to enable a new licence to be granted in the event of substantial extensions to public houses which were licensed for the first time since 1902 under one or other of the provisions of the law which allow new licences to be granted in particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>Section 20 is designed to make such provision.  It is designed to make the same provision for extensions of a suitable kind to these premises as was available under the 1902 Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
      <P>50. Before section 21 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Section 19 of the Act of 1943 is hereby amended by the deletion of the definitions of &lsquo;licence&rsquo;, &lsquo;publican's licence&rsquo; and &lsquo;beerhouse licence&rsquo; and the insertion of the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;licence&rsquo; means a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor for the grant of which the production of a certificate of the Circuit Court or of the District Court is required.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Reference to the Circuit Court in sections 21 and 22 (which relate to the grant of new licences in respect of more convenient premises or premises substituted for destroyed premises) of the Act of 1943 shall in relation to applications made thereunder by virtue of the amendment effected by subsection (1) of this section for certificates entitling the applicants to the grant of off-licences, <Col N="2115" /> be construed as references to the District Court and the reference in the said section 22 to the County Registrar shall, in relation to such applications, be construed as a reference to the District Court Clerk and the sections shall have effect accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is one of a couple of amendments designed to remove some anomalies and to simplify procedure in relation to the granting of new licences in certain cases.  The purpose of the amendment is, first of all, to extend to off-licences certain facilities which holders of on-licences have at the moment.  Under Section 21 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1943, the holder of an on-licence in a rural area may, in effect, transfer that licence to new premises in the immediate vicinity, provided, of course, the Court allows him.  Section 21 does not apply except in rural areas, no doubt because the likelihood of interference with existing equities would be very high if it were extended to urban areas, where even a small change in location could make a great deal of difference.  Section 22 of the 1943 Act allows a new on-licence to be granted for premises in the immediate vicinity of premises that have been burned down or otherwise destroyed.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see why these sections of the 1943 Act were confined to on-licences, since there is just as much reason for applying them to off-licences as to on-licences.  In fact, under an Act of 1825, if premises are burned down, an off-licence may be transferred to other premises in the immediate vicinity, but the transfer must be made during the same licensing year, and that is a serious weakness in the provision, as it does not allow sufficient time.  Section 22 allows a full 12 months, which is more reasonable.</P>
    <P>As well as removing the anomalies to which I have referred, the amendment prepares the way for the adoption, in respect of all licensing applications, both in respect of on-licences and off-licences, of a simplified procedure which is proposed in the next amendment, that is, amendment No. <Col N="2116" /> 51.  I shall deal with that when we come to the next amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 51:</P>
      <P>Before section 21 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in sections 21 or 31 of the Act of 1943 (which sections relate to the grant of licences in respect of more convenient premises and the transfer of beer-house licences), where the person making an application under either of those sections is not the holder of the licence to be extinguished or transferred under the section but shows to the satisfaction of the Court hearing the application that he has procured the consent of the holder thereof to the extinguishing or transfer thereof, as the case may be, the application shall not be refused on the ground that the person making it was not the holder of the licence to be extinguished or transferred and the said sections shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
      <P>(2) Section 22 (which relates to the grant of new licences in respect of premises substituted for destroyed premises) of the Act of 1943 is hereby amended by the insertion in paragraph (c) of subsection (1) after &lsquo;remains thereof&rsquo; of &lsquo;or that he has procured the consent of the lawful occupier of such premises or of the site and remains thereof to the making of the application, and if the licence referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection is then subsisting, to the extinguishing thereof if and when a licence is granted pursuant to this section&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>(3) (a) A conviction recorded on a licence transferred under the said section 31 shall, upon such transfer, case for all purposes to be so recorded and shall be deemed never to have been so recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) Where a new licence is granted to any person pursuant to an application under the said section 21 or the said section 22, <Col N="2117" /> a conviction recorded on the licence extinguished pursuant to the application (not being a conviction which became so recorded at a time, if any, when that person was the holder thereof) shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the said sections, not be deemed to be recorded on the new licence and the said sections shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, this is an amendment to simplify procedure and incidentally to reduce costs in applications for new licences in certain cases.  While the amendment is not dependent on acceptance by the House of my amendment relating to six-day licences&mdash;that is, amendment No. 52&mdash; I would mention that the simplified procedure proposed in the present amendment is also incorporated in amendment No. 52, and to that extent the two form part of a pattern.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know the law does not normally allow new intoxicating liquor licences to be granted, that is to say, licences for premises that have not been licensed previously.  There is, of course, a well-known exception for hotels but, apart from that, new licences may be given only in exceptional circumstances and then only in substitution for existing licences.  In these latter cases, where the granting of new licences is permitted in substitution for existing licences, the law has generally provided that the new licence may be granted only to the holder of the existing licence.  In practice, however, this requirement did not prevent what amounted to the sale of licences by persons going out of business to other people who wished to obtain licences for their own premises, but the procedure was cumbersome and costly.</P>
    <P>A licence attaches to a premises and cannot exists apart from a premises. Consequently, the procedure which solicitors had to adopt usually involved the sale, not of the licence but of the premises, to the person who wanted the licence, then an application to the Court by the new licensee to have the licence extinguished and a new one granted to him for the other premises, <Col N="2118" /> and finally the re-sale of the first premises, now unlicensed, to the former owner.  The sale and re-sale were of course no more than a legal fiction, but I understand that stamp duty had to be paid on the transaction as if they were <i>bona fide</i> sales.  And, of course, the legal fees for such a complicated transaction must have been fairly substantial too.</P>
    <P>What I am now proposing is that, in all cases where the grant of a new licence is conditional on the extinguishing of an existing licence, the complex procedure that I have outlined will no longer be necessary and that where the applicant for the new licence does not already hold the existing licence it will be sufficient for him to procure the consent of the holders of the existing licence to the extinguishing of the licence.  The court will, of course, satisfy itself that a valid consent has been obtained.  It will be for the parties concerned, as at present, to fix the price to be paid for the consent to the extinguishing of the existing licence.  This will, in effect, be the price of the licence.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2120" /> Before section 23 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Court may at any time within one year from the passing of this Act grant an application by the holder of an off licence to transfer such licence from the premises to which it is now attached to other premises in the immediate vicinity which also are in the ownership of such holder and which in the opinion of the Court are more suitable for such licence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to give all areas the facility the Minister mentioned is already available to rural areas only.  I can see the Minister's point of view in regard to where a vested interest had been built up in relation to an on-licence.</P>
    <P>I should not have thought that the same case was to be made in respect of an off-licence where the off-licence is to be moved to another premises in the immediate vicinity.  If it is not to be in the immediate vicinity, there will be a considerable difference.  It seems to me that what we want to do as far as we can is to get premises which will be the most suitable premises in that vicinity licensed.  I should like to hear the Minister's observations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say right at the outset that I cannot accept the amendment.  Many Deputies, and perhaps all Deputies, will have received representations from a particular firm in Dublin in support of this amendment. They may, indeed, have received representations twice, once before the amendment was tabled by Deputy Sweetman when the firm concerned asked for an amendment of this kind and again since the amendment was tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When an amendment like this is put down and expressed to be limited to one year, it would be unreal for me to speak to it without at least some reference to the circumstances in which the firm for whose benefit it is put down have sought the amendment. They wish, as they say, to transfer an off-licence from a branch in one street to a branch in another <Col N="2121" /> street.  On the face of it, that may not be an unreasonable request and I hope that it is unnecessary for me to emphasise that nothing I have to say in connection with the amendment is in the slightest degree directed against the firm concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not, however, propose to argue the matter on the basis of whether or not it is reasonable that a particular firm should be allowed to transfer a licence from one street to another.  I would mention, in passing, that the case made for that firm is by no means unusual or even exceptional.  There must be dozens of licensees in Dublin alone who would like to move to what they regard as more suitable premises and letters received in my Department during the years show that there are many others outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that the amendment cuts right across the principles that have been followed in the Licensing Acts for nearly 60 years&mdash;since 1902, to be precise.  The Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, prohibits the grant of a new licence&mdash;either on-licence or off-licence&mdash;in an urban area, even in substitution for an existing licence attached to another premises, except where there has been a 25 per cent. increase in population in the parish concerned.  There is an exception for hotels and one or two other special cases that do not affect the general picture.</P>
    <P>The result of this is that for nearly 60 years now existing licensed premises in urban areas have had what amounts to a statutory protection against any new competition in the vicinity.  In the central Dublin area, that protection has been absolute, as it is only in certain suburban areas that the necessary increase in population has taken place. Inevitably, of course, all licensed premises thus acquired a certain monopoly value and premises have changed hands during the years at prices that reflected that position.  Furthermore, the various Licensing Acts passed since 1902 have recognised and taken account of this fact and of the equities thus created.  In these circumstances, to alter the law now, except for some serious reason connected with the public interest, would be a breach of faith with existing licensees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2122" /> What we have to ask ourselves is this: Does the public interest require that this amendment be made?  I think it is evident that it does not and that if it did, the amendment would not be expressed to be limited in operation to a period of one year.  If the amendment were justified for a year, it would be justified as a permanent amendment. I know, of course, that a precedent for an amendment limited to a year has been mentioned in some of the representations made to Deputies.</P>
    <P>That was in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, when holders of on-licences were given the option of converting them to off-licences within 12 months. At this stage, over 30 years afterwards, it is very hard to see why that amendment was limited to a year, since it could not adversely affect anybody's interests, except, perhaps, the Exchequer which would collect less duty from the off-licence, and, as one might have expected, the amendment was re-enacted in permanent form in 1943.  That provision, therefore, is in no way comparable with what is now proposed.</P>
    <P>This amendment could involve a very serious interference with existing equities and there is no case whatsoever for it, other than the convenience of a particular firm.  As I said earlier, there are several other firms that could make much the same case. It really comes down to the fact that we are here to legislate in the general interest and we cannot, or at any rate, we ought not, to depart from general principles merely to benefit individual persons or firms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, we should not legislate for individual persons or firms.  The circumstances in which one firm, as the Minister told us, found itself are also the circumstances in which other firms find themselves. It just happens that if one person draws the circumstances to the attention of a Deputy, the circumstances that apply to one person also apply to many other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the form of the amendment is concerned, it is specifically designed to cover everybody who would be so concerned and not the one firm alone.  The Minister, if he looks <Col N="2123" /> at the amendment, must realise that it is an amendment general in type and not for any specific person.  Frankly, the reasons I put in the year was the provision in the 1927 Act and also that I think there is a certain desirability in having an off-licence&mdash;I would not make the same case for an on-licence &mdash;fixed geographically for periods at a time.  I do not think it desirable to have it changed from year to year. There does come a time now and again when premises become unsuitable and having regard to the provisions of the Acts introduced to bring shops up to standard, quite apart from the particular firm, I can see an very definite case for changing an off-licence.</P>
    <P>Let me make one case to the Minister which is entirely unconnected with this.  Let us assume you have an off-licence in a corner shop and it is desired to widen that corner.  It would be desirable in those circumstances, not for the licensee to have power, but for the court to have the power&mdash;and it should be the court alone&mdash;to transfer an off-licence to the adjoining premises which were being taken away for street-widening purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I cannot altogether agree with the amendment, it has been but down.  I think it is definitely accepted that off-licences are required mainly in central shopping areas.  Unfortunately, these central shopping areas are most unlikely to show an increase in population since the basic date of 1902.  In fact, in view of Corporation planning and house planning programmes, it is more than likely that they will all share a decrease of population.  There are also, as a result of this and as a result of the changes in the various bus routes and bus stops, shifts in the shopping habits of the people.  Some streets which were very prosperous business streets have now become very poor business streets and properties have deteriorated in value, even premises other than off-licence premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one street in mind in which <Col N="2124" /> there are two off-licence premises. They are competing with each other to see which can sell the cheapest and spirits are being sold there practically at wholesale price.  That is simply because the Corporation has moved a great many of the population away from that shopping area to outlying areas.  Now the tendency is starting to reverse and the central city area is being rebuilt.  Even still, the new families who are brought into the Corporation schemes are fewer than the families taken out.  Each time the Corporation takes over a street and erects new flats, fewer people go into the flats than were in the street originally.</P>
    <P>This is a very desirable thing and we approve of it but it means that equities established in 1902 cannot reasonably be said to apply to-day. I believe some opening should be left, to the High Court rather than the Circuit Court, whereby people seriously affected as a result of Government policy of shifting populations, can apply to have the court consider the merits of their case.  I consider the value of off-licensed premises in Grafton Street went up considerably when the buses started to travel down that street, whereas in Camden Street and Capel Street, they have deteriorated according as people were rehoused out of these areas.  I think the Minister should look at the equities from this point of view, to see if there should not be some opening and not say, once and for all, that we shall not allow any off-licence premises to be transferred unless there has been the necessary increase in population since 1902.  On that basis, we are not ensuring equity at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be a good deal more in this than meets the eye.  On Second Reading, I pointed out that there should be a very definite minimum standard of sanitation and other points in regard to public houses and I am not in any way withdrawing that view.  The object of this section is to enable the local health authority, in whose area the public house is situated, to object to the renewal of the licence in respect of any premises which they consider do not meet the requirements of the Act.  A problem might possibly arise here in regard to the acquisition by, for instance, six-day licence holders of seven-day licences.</P>
      <P>There are quite a number of premises now in a rather dilapidated condition scattered throughout the country.  The licence duty continues to be paid and no objection is made, although in some instances premises have ceased to carry on the business of a public house and carry on a different one; in others, they are not carrying on any business at all. Now, in regard to those in which some type of business is being carried on, they do not enter into this section but the others do, and if somebody vacates his premises and it becomes slightly dilapidated, he might still like to retain the licence as a saleable asset. If the health authorities come along in 12 months' time, when the premises have become dilapidated, and go into court, I do not see how the court could reasonably reject their objection to the renewal.  It would be quite clear at that stage that the premises would not be suitable.  In other words, this section could be used drastically to reduce the number of licences available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I said at the beginning I am most anxious that public houses should be obliged to reach certain minimum standards from the health point of view, I hope this section will not be used in the manner in which I suggest it could be used, and in that way to achieve a reduction in the premises and, in effect, a reduction of the market open to potential purchasers who are desirous of converting their <Col N="2126" /> premises from six-day to seven-day licensed premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that an objection could already be taken by certain people under the law as it stood.  The particular provision contained in Section 24 was recommended by the Commission and is to be read in conjunction with another recommendation by the Commission in regard to unfitness of premises which is being given effect to in Section 25. Under the law, the local health authority was not entitled to object and Section 24 now allows them to object. Under the existing law, the people at present entitled to object to the granting of the new licence are a district justice, a superintendent of the Garda or any inhabitant of the parish in which the premises are situated.</P>
      <P>This recommendation of the Commission is just bringing us up to what is necessary in modern practice and I think it is reasonable that the health authority should have these powers. After all, the health authority are now provided with power to object to the granting of dance hall licences on the grounds of unsuitability of sanitary facilities and so on.  I think the possible answer to Deputy S. Flanagan's fears is the fact that if this section were operated in any unreasonable way by the health authority, I could immediately visualise the county councillors having something to say on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that when this matter was discussed by the Commission, I felt I could not support the recommendation of the Commission.  It was among the points I disagreed with because I feel the health authorities already have sufficient power to take action against licensees in regard to hygiene on the premises.  There are sufficient people supervising the publican now without adding the local authority in another capacity.  There is nothing to prevent the local authority through its health inspectors ensuring that a proper standard of hygiene is maintained or brought into operation on the premises and the power exists in the Health Acts to do this at present. This new section will add to the existing <Col N="2127" /> power in the hands of the local authority and allow them to go into court and actually object to the public-can obtaining a licence.</P>
      <P>I think that is going a little bit too far.  Various local authorities will interpret this section to suit themselves and their own localities and what would be reasonable in one local authority might not be held to be reasonable in the next local authority. If a certain local authority had an over-all majority of a political Party they could make it very &ldquo;hot&rdquo; for their political opponents who might happen to be publicans.  I do not suggest that is going to happen but the position is, as the Minister himself said, that it could happen that a local county council would be in a position to move and object if there is close supervision.  The same authority could insist on close supervision.  I do not think it is necessary to give this power to the local authorities in addition to that which they have already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is far more reasonable to provide for this objection than for the objection of a local resident.  I believe the Deputy's knowledge of rural Ireland, although I suppose I should not say it, would indicate that conditions in some of the licensed premises leave very much to be desired from this point of view. Personally, I feel that in the interests of all concerned it is desirable that this power should be there.  I do not share the fears expressed by Deputy Flanagan that it would be wielded in any unreasonable way.  Deputies should realise that we have these powers now as the law of the land in respect of all kinds of business, grocery shops, butchers' shops and all types of mixed businesses, and I see no reason why the same law should not be applied at least in principle to publichouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister and I disagree with Deputy McQuillan about the desirability of having this section inserted and this power given to the health authorities. I think it is necessary and desirable but I have the greatest fear about the <Col N="2128" /> manner in which the section could be implemented by the health authorities.</P>
      <P>I shall give one or two examples to illustrate exactly what I mean.  There is hardly a town in Ireland where there is not at least one licensed premises which now is, and which perhaps has been for a year or two, closed up, the owner having gone away.  Really, the only asset that person has is possession of a licence which continues in operation.  Were the health authority to come along on the application for renewal and object, the court would have no option but to uphold the objection because quite clearly the premises is not fit for use as a public-house. The fact is that it has not been used as a publichouse but that would not be a valid objection, the section being what it is.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there are certain people, elderly perhaps, and living alone, who are carrying on a very small business selling an odd bottle of shout here and there, in rather dilapidated premises. If the health authority were to object to some of these I think there is no doubt that the renewal would be refused.  I ask the Minister to look into this matter with a view to giving some guarantee or loophole to these people.  For instance, if a premises is licensed, vacant and dilapidated, notice could be served on the owner to the effect that in, say, twelve months, an application for renewal would be opposed.  In the case of a person in the second class, a notice could be served on him&mdash;again not sprung on him in court&mdash;giving him twelve months to comply because he would certainly need that period before he would be able to put his premises in any reasonable condition.  He simply would not have the money to do it otherwise.  Giving the power, having inserted the necessary safeguard against abuse or excessive use of it, is one thing and just giving the power is another.  I should like serious consideration to be given to what I have said.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise one point in regard to Dublin city.  I think either the Health Authority <Col N="2129" /> in Dublin or the Minister for Health in consultation with the Health Authority should lay down certain specific requirements so far as the licensing of premises is concerned from this point of view.  I see the difficulty of different health inspectors with different interpretations of what they are meant to do.  We have seen that happen in other matters in connection with the Health Department. Perhaps the Minister will consider having some sort of basic requirement.  In particular, I have this in mind in regard to the bottling departments in publichouses, having stout bins properly cleaned, washing of glasses and care of toilets and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with this section but I have a slight fear as to how it will be implemented.  I agree with Deputy S. Flanagan that a certain period should be allowed to a licensee to effect whatever repairs are suggested by the health inspector. I would not be terribly concerned about the city of Dublin, as Deputy Lemass mentioned, as regards bottling stores because the health authorities are on the war-path&mdash;and have been for some years&mdash;in relation to these. I would be more concerned about toilet accommodation in licensed houses.  I suggest to the Minister that the conditions that obtain in rural parts of Ireland are appalling but I should also like the Minister to consider the financial position of the licensee in these cases because the improvements to be carried out would cost a good amount of money.</P>
      <P>I know that an ordinary notice would be served on a publican in such a case but as soon as the health inspector discovered that the toilet facilities were not quite adequate, at the next licensing court he would go in and object to the licence.  Then, if the health authority in those circumstances objected to the licence, the justice could refuse to renew the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a period of one or two years might be allowed in certain exceptional circumstances to give the licensee time to effect whatever improvements <Col N="2130" /> might be suggested by the health authority inspector.  I would not have quite the same fears that Deputy McQuillan has in this matter. This provision merely gives the health authority the right to object to the renewal of the licence.  There is a higher authority who will decide whether or not the licence should be granted, and that will be the justice concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The real answer to the fears expressed by the Deputies is that justices are reasonable men.  This is an enabling section to give a statutory right to the health authority to object.  It is not conferring power on the authority to be the <i>ne plus ultra</i> authority in the matter.  I am sure the court&mdash;this has certainly been my experience under another type of legislation&mdash;will not alone give the people time, if time is necessary, but will also raise the standards gradually, step by step.  All this started with the Dance Halls Act of 1935.  From that time local authorities began to come into court and make certain objections, starting with the dry lavatories in rural areas.  They progressed from that to Elsans and they have now reached the stage generally throughout the country in which water closets must be provided in these places.  All that took many years.  It involved considerable expenditure in some instances on the part of the applicant.  The courts are not unreasonable and I have no doubt that in endeavouring to get licensees up to the standards expected in this day and age district justices will give reasonable time if anything in the nature of substantial alteration or a new structure is involved.</P>
      <P>District justices also invariably take into account the cost to the applicant and the circumstances of the applicant. I think there is full protection.  The answer to the fears expressed by Deputies is that we have reasonable men administering the law.  They will not make impossible demands.  I do not know if Deputies have looked at Section 25 dealing with unfitness of premises.  It is stated in that section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;An objection under this section shall not be entertained by the <Col N="2131" /> Court unless notice in writing of the intention to make the objection together with particulars in writing of the unfitness alleged is given not less than 12 months before the hearing of the application to the person who, at the time of the giving of the notice, holds the licence in respect of which the application is brought.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is provision there for 12 months' notice.  It is quite obvious to me that that will be the practice under this Bill when it becomes law. It will be the practice adopted by any reasonable Court.</P>

      <P>My opposition to this section arises out of a concern for the consumer.  It appears to me that publicans would under this section be allowed to sell whiskey of a lower strength than is now available.  I feel it is unlikely there will be any corresponding reduction in the price.  Since I recorded my opposition, however, those who know more about whiskey than I do have informed me that we are not the race of men we once were. Apparently, we can no longer take the &ldquo;hard tack&rdquo; the hard way as our ancestors did.  The modern trend, whether it arises out of fear or physical inability, is to go for a whiskey of a lower strength.  As a nation, we are in the undignified position of finding ourselves having to imitate the Scot, and it was our ancestors <Col N="2132" /> who taught the Scottish people how to make whiskey.</P>
      <P>I have been told that Fíor-Ghaela to-day, particularly those who drive motor cars, are tending to consume whiskey of a lower strength.  However, I thought it desirable to record opposition to enable the Minister to make his case for the section.  I know the members of the Liquor Commission accepted the arguments put to them that whiskey ought not to be sold at 30º under proof.  In view of the wide public interest in the matter I thought it desirable that the full case should be put before the people before the section is passed. If the Minister does that, I shall be prepared to withdraw my opposition.</P>

      <P>This section is simply designed to obviate the necessity of a publican hanging up in his bar a notice that the whiskey sold in his premises could be under 24º.  Hitherto you could sell Scotch at 30º u.p.  If you sold Scotch by the glass and not by the bottle you had to hang up that notice.  You also had to hang up a special notice if you sold Irish whiskey 30º u.p.  This enables the publican to sell Scotch and Irish on an equal basis.  Is that not so?</P>

      <P>Under Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, it is an offence to sell to a purchaser any article of food or any drug which is not of the nature, substance and quality of the article demanded. The essence of the offence is that the sale must be made to the purchaser without notice and, if a purchaser is properly put on notice by the seller that the article, as sold, is not precisely as ordered then, of course, there is no offence under the section.  Under the provision it would be an offence, therefore, to sell spirits diluted to any extent unless the purchaser was put on notice.  By an Act of 1879, however, it was provided that notice need not be given to the purchaser where the dilution consisted of the addition of water only and did not make the spirits weaker than 25º u.p., in the case of whiskey, brandy or rum, or 35º u.p., in the case of gin.  In other words, <Col N="2133" /> from 1879 onwards, the sale of whiskey, brandy and rum at a strength of 25º u.p., has been legal without special notice to the customers. I do not profess to know at what strength these spirits were normally marketed at that time, 1879, but it is a reasonable inference that many of them were marketed at 25º u.p., that this was commonly known and that there was no reason why a special notice of the strength should have been given once the spirits were at least of a strength of 25º u.p.  The purpose of Section 28 is to alter the standards set by the 1879 Act from 25 u.p. to 30 u.p.  In other words, to provide that notice need not in future be given to the customers so long as the spirit sold is at least of strength 30 u.p. which, I need hardly say, is weaker than 25 u.p.  I have a note here which tells me all about the meaning of proof.</P>

This obviously is the nuisance section under which all traders who do not display this notice have to face <Col N="2134" /> prosecution in the district court.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The correct history of this is as follows.  Originally, nobody hung up a notice about 30 u.p. but as the consumption of Scotch whisky increased, all of which is bottled at 30 u.p., the production of this notice became an essential.  You had to hang it up if you were selling whisky, other than in a sealed bottle, under 25 u.p. But we ought not to pass the section without realising that the universal practice of the trade has been to sell a certain type of Irish whiskey at 24 u.p., a certain type at 25 u.p. and all types of Scotch at 30 u.p.  This section now makes it practicable and lawful, without notice, to reduce the proof of all Irish whiskey to 30 u.p.  You could not do that heretofore without hanging up your notice.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, any public house in which Scotch whiskey was sold on draught, so to speak, had to hang up this notice and was free to sell Irish whiskey at the lower proof.  It will not now be necessary to hang up the notice any longer.  Everyone can sell whiskey at 30 u.p.  The truth is, of course, that if you hung up the notice heretofore, you could sell Irish whiskey or Scotch whiskey at 30 u.p., but the practice was to sell Irish at 25 u.p. and Scotch at 30 u.p.  Now, without hanging up any notice, it is lawful to sell either at 30 u.p.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are opposing Section 29 on different grounds.  My amendment seeks to ensure that the same law will apply to clubs as applies to public houses and that the rank of the officer or member of the Garda Síochána who would be entitled to inspect a public house would be sufficiently high to inspect a club.  An ordinary member of the Garda Síochána can raid or investigate an ordinary licensed premises but it takes either an inspector, or a written permit from an inspector, before an investigation or raid can be carried out on a club premises.  The Commission, which has been quoted here so often by the Minister in support of a number of sections, were very clear in their minds in connection with this privilege afforded to those people who are wealthy enough to be members of various clubs.</P>
      <P>The Commission, with the exception of two individuals, reported that they could see no justification for distinguishing between clubs and public houses.  I would refer the Minister to page 13 of the Report of the Commission which states:</P>
      <P>Testimony was offered to us that disregard for the hours and conditions of sale of drink was a feature of some clubs and, while there was not sufficient evidence before us to determine whether this abuse was general, we were satisfied that the abuse existed, and we had particular evidence in one case where the huge turnover in bar receipts indicated that the main function of the club would appear to be the supply of intoxicating liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1925 Commission recommended <Col N="2137" /> that the hours of sale in clubs should be kept the same as in public-houses and we see no reason to depart from that recommendation.</P>
    <P>They went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nor do we see any justification for distinguishing between clubs and public-houses or hotels in the matter of supervision and we recommend that clubs be subject to the same methods of inspection as licensed premises.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason in the world why there should be one law for the wealthy and another for the poor, as far as having a drink is concerned, and the idea of providing something special for the snobocracy is deplorably in disregard of the ordinary amenities which should be available to all sections, irrespective of their standing in the community.  I shall not bore the House with the history of how this segregation began, but it should be sufficient to say that this division with regard to the powers to be exercised in relation to the inspection of ordinary licensed premises and clubs stems from the Licensing Acts of 1872 and 1874.  At that time a constable, as he was then described, was entitled to raid public-houses but, from then on, clubs could not be raided by the ordinary rank and file of the police force.</P>
    <P>The idea was that in the clubs you had the gentry and the gentry could not, under any circumstances, be put on the same basis as ordinary citizens. It would be a shocking state of affairs if policeman McGuire or policeman Murphy were able to walk into a club where Lieut.-Col.  So-and-So was having his ball of malt after hours and charge him with a breach of the licensing laws.  That is only one aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>One striking thing emerges from the sections which still deal with this in previous Acts.  In the 1924 Intoxicating Liquor Act we have the provision in subsection (3) of Section 25 that:</P>
    <P>In the event of any person or persons found in such premises refusing to give their respective names and addresses when requested by <Col N="2138" /> any such sergeant, constable, or guard or giving false names and addresses, such person or persons so doing shall be liable severally on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Commission strongly urged that Gardaí and sergeants should be in a position to raid clubs we felt that Section 29 met the wishes of the Commission, but Section 29 was completely misleading because it substituted &ldquo;member&rdquo; for &ldquo;officer&rdquo;, but the rank is that of inspector and not lower.  If the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; meant an ordinary member of the Garda Síochána there would be no need for me to put down this amendment, and it was just by luck that I hit upon it at the last moment before matters had gone too far.</P>
      <P>In the section dealing with powers to raid public-houses, Section 22, subsection (2) of the 1927 Act, states:</P>
      <P>Any member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant any person who, on his name and address or such corroborative evidence as aforesaid being lawfully demanded of him under this section, fails or refuses to give such name and address or either of them or such evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Garda is entitled to arrest a man in a public-house for failing to give his name and address but no such power exists with regard to clubs.  In the section in the 1924 Act which deals with clubs it merely states that if there is failure to give names and addresses the persons concerned can be liable to a fine not exceeding £10, but the officer making the raid has no power to make an arrest of any individual <Col N="2139" /> who fails to obey the law whereas, in the ordinary public house, Joe Soap can be taken out by the ear by a Garda and arrested for failing to disclose his name and address.  If that is not showing a differentiation between the various citizens of this State I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that one way of dealing with this is by accepting the new section which I propose here, which merely brings into operation in respect of clubs the same provision as applies to licensed premises.</P>

I cannot recall the word Deputy McQuillan used.</P>

      <P>There are several working men's clubs, soccer clubs, football clubs and other clubs all over the city.  The most usual feature about them is that most of them are up to their ears in debt to their banks.  In fact, even the Catholic Commercial Club this year&mdash;which I do not think is full of snobs&mdash;was forced to increase its members' fees considerably. A club is the next nearest thing to the home.  People subscribe a fee to the club and support its activities. There are several fund-raising activities in order to run a soccer team, promote some other form of sport or just for the sake of having a social amenity and meeting place.  The members, in fact, own any drink that is on the property.  They are shareholders in that intoxicating liquor.  As such, they should be given more consideration than the ordinary licensed publican who is in business for profit.  There is adequate protection against abuse. They can be raided.  It is most desirable that there should be recognition of their special position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, I certainly cannot <Col N="2140" /> support the views of Deputy McQuillan and I am more prepared to go along with Deputy Ryan, to leave the position as it was heretofore.  I think the Minister should consider the very special position of the club.  However, since Deputy McQuillan has spoken, I am quite satisfied with the section as it stands if &ldquo;member&rdquo; means inspector.  I take it the Minister will deal with that point and if this word &ldquo;member&rdquo; does mean the rank of inspector, then, of course, the section is perfectly satisfactory to my mind.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy McQuillan has missed the point.  A guard, as he says, may arrest Joe Soap for refusing to give his name in a seven-day licensed premises but in a club every person knows who the person on the premises is because, first of all, he must be a member and if he is a member he is known by everybody and, secondly, if he is not a member, he must be introduced by a member and must sign the visitors' book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>All the inspector need do is to check the book and he finds out who the person is.  I am in full agreement with Deputy Lemass and with Deputy Dillon who has said that the club should not be subject to a raid by every Guard on patrol simply because his curiosity may get the better of him.  He has a method of checking any hour of the day by looking up the register and seeing who is there, if they are members and, if not members, by whom they were introduced.  Deputy Lemass is quite right.  A club is somewhat similar to the home and one would not like to have a Guard dropping into the house at every moment of the night and asking one to account for all the visitors to one's house, particularly when they are usually partaking of hospitality, and they would be in a case such as this partaking of the hospitality of the members of the club because no profit, as Deputy Lemass <Col N="2141" /> has pointed out, or very little profit other than a marginal one, is made.</P>
      <P>I think the Legislature, in its wisdom, was very correct in confining the right of entry to a club to an officer of a certain rank but I should like to hear the Minister confirm that &ldquo;member&rdquo; means no person of a rank less than inspector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely disagree with the opinions expressed by Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Lemass and Deputy McGilligan who has put down this amendment.  First of all, Deputy Lemass suggests that in a club the drink belongs to the club member and he is in his home.  Why is he subject to licensing laws at all if it is his own drink and if he is in his own home? It must be considered that if the person to raid a club must be a person with at least the rank of inspector, the number of clubs in certain police districts is so great that there would not be sufficient inspectors to go round.</P>
      <P>I do not see why the member of a club who is a member of the drinking fraternity should not be subject to the same police supervision as the customer in an ordinary public house.  The purpose of this Bill was to create uniformity in the licensed trade.  Three things govern uniformity&mdash;trading hours, supervision and licence fee.  The clubs get away with a very nominal licence fee whereas the public house which is competing against it, down the road, is paying top wages, which the clubs are not, and paying top licence fee.  Therefore, to my mind, Deputy McQuillan's amendment is a very, very good amendment.  In my view, all the people who want to partake of intoxicating liquor should be subject to the same police supervision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say at the outset that I have misled Deputy Lemass just as the particular drafting of the Bill itself has misled me.  This section as it is worded is a classic example of the drafting to which Deputy Dillon, <Col N="2142" /> the Leader of the Opposition, has already taken exception to-day.  At the time I was considering this Bill I had not before me the precise terms of the Act of 1924 but I was speaking from recollection, from my experience as a lawyer, in relation to the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  I was not in the fortunate position of having before me an opinion of the Attorney General as to the meaning of the Act, which is not on record, and the section as it goes down on paper is full of so many brackets and substitutions in relation to subsections which are again in brackets, inverted commas and otherwise, that one would need the time that only civil servants can afford for consideration of a Bill of this kind in order clearly to understand the section.  Despite all that has been said, written and recorded, Deputy O'Donnell is apparently still in some doubt as to the precise effect of the section as drafted.</P>
      <P>The precise effect of the section as drafted is to permit any member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector to issue a warrant for the search and inspection of clubs but I am of the same opinion as Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Belton that there should be no distinction between the searching and inspection of clubs and the searching and inspection of other premises which have liquor licences.  I take my stand from experience.  I very frequently pass two clubs in the City of Dublin at a late hour of the night on my way home, outside of which there may be anything from 12 to 20 cars, some of which are there long after even the <i>bona fide</i> houses close.</P>
      <P>Under Section 25 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1924, any officer of the Dublin Metropolitan Police or of the Garda Síochána who is of the opinion that there is reasonable ground for supposing that a club is committing an offence may issue a warrant.  If the presence of 12 or 20 cars at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. is not reasonable ground for supposing there is a commission of an offence, I cannot imagine what the judges would consider a reasonable ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if there is that reasonable ground for supposing that there <Col N="2143" /> is a commission of an offence such as the presence of a large number of cars in the concourse outside a golf club or out on the public street or if there are sounds of hilarity, laughter and jollification coming across the night air, it is desirable that an ordinary Guard on the beat might make his presence felt, come in and inspect the club and prosecute those found committing breaches of the law, irrespective of whether or not the club is solvent or not solvent, irrespective of whether the main objects of the club are sporting, religious or commercial.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of this Bill is to impose uniformity.  Against the very clearly stated wishes of Deputies in different parts of the country, the Minister and the Government have ploughed on indiscriminately insisting on this principle of uniformity but here, for some strange reason in relation to this item, we are conferring privileges on that relatively small section of the people who may belong to clubs which hold liquor licences.  I believe that is very bad.  I might say that at one time I was of opinion that it was not desirable that noncommissioned officers of the Garda Siochana should be raiding clubs because so many clubs were in off the public highway there was a possibility that a Guard, as soon as he went into a clubhouse would be persuaded by the members to overlook the fact that a breach of the licensing laws was taking place, that he would be given a few &ldquo;jorums&rdquo;, and there would be no more about it.  However, I think that fear of mine was imaginary and not within reason, as with the men we have in the force at the present time there is not that likelihood.</P>
    <P>I would not agree completely with the wording of Deputy McQuillan's amendment because I believe it would allow Guards to inspect clubs without having a reasonable suspicion that the law was being broken.  I do not think that desirable because they could easily pester a club.  I appreciate the point that Deputy Lemass and Deputy O'Donnell were making that a club is a private institution and should not be <Col N="2144" /> raided without a reason.  However, if it is known to the Guards that people leave club premises at a late hour of the night long after public houses are supposed to be closed and if the Guards can see with their own eyes a large number of cars outside a licensed premises, they should be able to inspect that building without having to return to the station to get a warrant from an inspector or a superintendent.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with the views expressed by Deputy Lemass and Deputy O'Donnell but I am in disagreement with the views expressed by Deputy Ryan and Deputy Belton.  There has been a bit of mixed thinking involved in this amendment proposed by Deputy McQuillan.  Reference has been made to the section as it stands conferring privileges on clubs.  I do not think that is so.  I think the section as it stands and the earlier provisions in the licensing code merely recognise a difference which is there already.  There is a vast difference between a public house, that is, a business in which the owner engages in the sale of drink to the public, and a club.  A club is an institution in which a number of people band themselves together jointly to own and run a building and own and dispose of whatever stock of drink may be in it.  It is a private concern of the members and it is not in any sense an enterprise in which drink is sold to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licensing provision have always recognised the distinction between a public house and a private club and there is no question of &ldquo;snobocracy.&rdquo; It would be quite intolerable if any Guard on the beat, for whatever idea might come into his head, had the right and authority to go into a club and raid it.  When the term &ldquo;club&rdquo; is used I suppose one is inclined to think of golf clubs, tennis clubs and clubs in which persons who enjoy a large income spend their leisure hours.  As Deputy Lemass very correctly pointed out, the vast majority of clubs in the city are clubs in which ordinary working people have banded together. I have been for many years a member of a club not very far from this <Col N="2145" /> building which would, under no circumstances, qualify for the definition used by Deputy McQuillan.</P>

      <P>Indeed it is not, but I know well the members of that club would very much recent the fact that a Guard on the beat outside could raid their premises, invade their privacy and treat them as if they were persons in a public house.  They are not in a public house.  They are in premises which they own jointly and they are exercising their ordinary rights of property.</P>
      <P>The provisions as they stand are proper provisions and recognise the essential difference between the law applicable to public houses and the law applicable to clubs, and I see no reason why they should be changed. The fact that in order to inspect or raid a club a member of the Garda Síochána must seek the authority of, and act through, a senior officers is a very desirable provision.  I have little doubt that it has not been abused.  It has worked well in the past and I see no reason why it should be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a case of much ado about nothing.  This is the existing law.  Deputy McQuillan has created the impression in the minds of members of the House that the Government were endeavouring to deceive them in some manner or other by the use of the words which are contained in the section.  In the explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill it is stated in the clearest possible language that the reason we had to put in a Government amendment was that in the 1924 Act the word &ldquo;Officer&rdquo; is used and this is probably news to members of the House; I myself was, until I went into the Department of Justice of the firm belief that an inspector was an officer&mdash;an inspector is not an officer of the Garda Síochána. Therefore, we have to use the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; in order to exclude an inspector so that a warrant can be secured from an inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any person thinks that something <Col N="2146" /> untoward is happening in a club, all he has to do is to inform an officer, who will be a member of the Garda Síochána, that something undesirable is happening in that club, and the officer of the Garda Síochána, or an inspector, who is now included, can issue a warrant and a Garda can go in and search the premises.  I think it would be highly undesirable for a Garda to go indiscriminately into what is purely a private concern.  He is allowed to go into a public house because a public house is a place where the public can congregate and it is run purely for profit.  A club is run to provide amenities for the members and it is, I think, as private as a home.  Members meet there to converse, to talk about the affairs of the day, to play games or something of that kind.</P>
    <P>It would be highly undesirable that every Garda patrolling the street could, at will, walk in and search the premises.  He can do that if Deputy McQuillan or Deputy Ryan or any other individual thinks something is going on there that should not be going on and he can have the place searched but only in the circumstances in which it should be done.  There is something wrong about that.  I think it is desirable that a power should be there, if it is necessary to use it, but what I want to impress on Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Ryan is that that has been in existence and has been operating since 1924 and we have not had anything in the nature of what might be described as bad reports about what has been going on.</P>

If we had an assertion from the Minister that those powers will be exercised as often as necessary, the strong objections of some members to this section would be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It comes as a complete surprise to me to hear the views expressed by Deputies who favour this proposition.  I am completely bewildered by the suggestion that there should be any difference between a Garda and an inspector.  I simply do not understand it.  If a person has broken the law&mdash;and that is what we are dealing with: we are dealing with laws which have been made by this House to control the operation of publichouses and clubs or whatever you like to call them; they are the licensing laws which are made here, and they must be implemented by the members of the Garda Síochána &mdash;I cannot see, for the life of me, why a Garda should not have the same right as an inspector to go in, to inspect the club and see whether or not the laws are being broken.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass suggested that clubs are like private houses, that it would be wrong to have an individual Garda going in to inspect them, and that an inspector should be sent in. That does not seem to follow at all. In the case of the burglary of a private house, there is no objection to a Garda going in to see if the law is being broken, and if a burglary has, in fact, been committed.  An inspector is not sent to a private house if a burglary has taken place. When a crime is suspected between two people living in a private house and it is necessary to see whether the law is being broken, we do not have to get an inspector to investgate, because it is a private house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, that is completely absurd.  It is an evasion, and an attempt to retain a privilege which was begun, the Minister said, in 1920 something or other, and Deputy McQuillan said in 1870 something or other.  As the Minister said, that is <Col N="2148" /> the law as it stands.  That is why we object to it.  We object to it because it is a law which was introduced at a time when these privileges were very marked between ourselves and the aristocracy of the time.  For the reasons stated by Deputy McQuillan, they felt they should not be soiled by an ordinary member of the Garda putting his hands on their shoulders and saying: &ldquo;I arrest you.&rdquo; We are now to have the same differences in our own society in that a club member would be contaminated by being dealt with by an ordinary plain member of the public Garda. The only person who can arrest him or charge him with a breach of the law in an inspector.  That is obviously and demonstrably absurd.</P>
    <P>This suggestion that because one is a commercial undertaking and the other is run for the benefit of the members of the club can be pursued. Let us have legislation organised in this way.  A taxi man runs his taxi to make money and a private motorist runs his car for pleasure.  Very good. The taxi man has an accident and is arrested by a member of the Garda but the private motorist cannot be arrested by a Garda and must be arrested by an inspector.  In that way, we cannot have a Garda dealing with anybody who is not engaged in a commercial undertaking, and an inspector can only touch somebody who is in a private business and does not contaminate himself by being involved in this invidious practice of making a living.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that a Garda may pester a club is quite clearly absurd.  If we have a man who is so irresponsible, why are we not worried by the fact that he might pester a pub too?  Suppose he does pester a pub, let us insist in order to get a responsible type of officer, a man who will not pester a pub that only an inspector can raid a pub as well as a club.</P>
    <P>It is obviously quite absurd that a Garda might see, as Deputy Ryan suggested, 12 or 13 cars outside a club and have to go back to the Garda station and say: &ldquo;I suspect a breach of the licensing laws; I want a warrant.&rdquo;<Col N="2149" /> Why all this unnecessary fuss? Why cannot he do what he would do if he were passing a pub and saw the lights on and cars outside and say: &ldquo;I believe there is a breach of the law; I will inspect in the ordinary way.&rdquo;  I do not think this whole idea of a differential between the pub and the club is right.  The pub is the poor man's club, the working man's club. He cannot afford to band together with his friends in this way and have the amenities which Deputy Lemass points out are to be found in clubs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass made another bizarre suggestion that these people should not be pestered or worried in this way because they may be up to their ears in debt and, by inference, he seemed to suggest they should be allowed to break the law to get out of debt.  What about the unfortunate publican who is making a loss?  Are we to give him special privileges so that he will not be worried by the Garda, and say he will be raided only by an inspector?  There are so few inspectors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point was made by some Deputies that the law should not be the same for clubs as for pubs. The Minister introduced this legislation to establish unity in our licensing laws.  Various anomalies have been discussed during the past few days&mdash; the differentiation between the country and the city, the <i>bona fide,</i> Sunday trading, and so on.  This is another anomaly which the Minister would be well advised to remove so that pubs would be raided by inspectors as well as clubs.</P>

I can understand some publicans taking the line: &ldquo;Maybe we have a slight disadvantage here but these clubs providing football pitches, handball alleys, billiard tables, card rooms, and so on, must submit to rules.  They must cease the sale of intoxicating liquor at the prescribed hour.  They may play billiards or a game of cards in the club until a late hour but they may not sell intoxicating liquor.&rdquo;  I think the National Progressive Democrats are trying to work up a lot of wind about nothing.

I thought for a moment his description of a club sounded much more like a place where a branch of the Legion of Mary hold their meetings.</P>
      <P>From my limited experience of clubs, I have found that from the official closing time onwards, until all hours they are without supervision. There would seem to be no question about that.

Evidence given before the Commission was to the effect that more illegal drinking goes on in clubs than in publichouses.  As a result, a number of us on the Commission felt so strongly about it that we persuaded all but two members of the Commission to agree that there was only one way to sort this out&mdash;apart from the inequality of having one law for people in a club and another law for people outside&mdash;and that was that, in order to have proper supervision, it was necessary to bring the clubs more under the control of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel a slur has been cast by a number of Deputies on the ordinary member of the Garda Síochána.  It was suggested it would be wrong for an ordinary member of the Garda Síochána to poke his nose, out of curiosity, into the inner sanctum of some club&mdash;that it would annoy the members of the club.  They only question that arises is an offence under the <Col N="2153" /> licensing laws.  The inspection would not be for any other purpose.  It would not be for the purpose of seeing if they were playing pitch-and-toss or anything like that in one of these exclusive clubs.

It is suggested in this House now that if a group of people band together for the purpose of having social events organised and so forth and register themselves as a club&mdash;sporting or otherwise&mdash;they are immediately outside the normal scope of the law as far as the sale of drink is concerned. That is what you are establishing.  I believe that where you have drink on sale, it is not a question of the property of the members of the club. The members of the club purchase their drink.  They can invite visitors in who likewise purchase.</P>

There is no use in the Minister telling us that that is there since 1924 and that, because it has been there since then, it should remain now.  There is no argument on that basis.

    <P>(c) the addition to the section of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (1) of this section, where a person is convicted in relation to any premises in respect of which he holds a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor by retail of an offence to which this Part of this Act applies and the conviction is the first conviction of that person in relation to those premises of an offence to which this Part of this Act applies, the conviction shall not be recorded on the licence.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>(2) Every conviction which, immediately before the passing of this Act, stood recorded under section 25 of the Act of 1927 on a licence then in force, shall, upon the passing of this Act, cease for all purposes to be so recorded and where, before the passing of this Act, the holder of a licence then on force had been convicted of an offence to which Part III of the Act of 1927 applies, such holder shall, for the purposes of subsection (2) and subsection (4) (inserted by this section) of the said section 25, be deemed never to have been so convicted.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.56:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 30 to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Where an order under section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924, prescribing the sizes of bottles in which an intoxicating <Col N="2156" /> liquor specified in the order may be sold is in force, neither section 28 nor section 29 of the Act of 1878 shall apply in relation to a bottle to which this section applies.</P>
    <P>(2) The denomination of a bottle to which this section applies and a line defining its capacity shall be indicated on the bottle by indelible marks.</P>

    <P>(c) prescribing the limits of error to be allowed in relation to the capacity of the bottles as defined by the line aforesaid,</P>
    <P>(d) prohibiting any feature in the design of the bottles which appears likely to facilitate the perpetration of fraud.</P>
    <P>(4) Where in relation to a bottle to which this section applies there is a contravention of subsection (2) of this section or of regulations made under subsection (3) of this section, the bottle shall be deemed to be an unjust measure for the purposes of section 25 of the Act of 1878.</P>
    <P>(5) Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>(6) In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;the Act of 1878&rsquo; means the Weights and Measures Act, 1878;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;bottle to which this section applies&rsquo;<Col N="2157" /> means a bottle which is required by an order referred to in subsection (1) of this section to be of a size prescribed thereby.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment to replace Section 30 of the Bill by a revised section.  May I say, right at the outset, that the new section as now proposed will achieve in full the object of the original section while at the same time allaying the fears of certain trade interests who expressed their satisfaction with the amendment.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the object of Section 30 was to put an end to the present elaborate system of verification of the sizes of beer bottles by inspectors of weights and measures.  As I explained in my reply to the Second Reading debate, the system was imposed, not as a result of a considered decision, but by what I might term a legal accident.  An Order was made which required beer bottles to be one of three standard sizes.  After that was done it was found that this simple provision made each bottle into a legal measure and attracted all the provisions of the Weights and Measures Acts.</P>
    <P>I have, of course, never sought to make the case that this system was a costly one in terms of so much per bottle, or even so much per gross bottles.  What I said was that it began by accident, that it is quite unnecessary and that the cost of it, irrespective of who pays for it, is for the most part wasted money.  And the waste is there, however small the cost per unit may be. It is, I hope, a good principle that one should seek to dismantle controls that are unnecessary even though the gain to any one person may be negligible.</P>
    <P>I pointed out in my reply to the Second Reading debate that the effect of Section 30 had obviously been completely misunderstood by certain trade interests who appeared to believe that the section would lead to the introduction of new sizes of bottles and would facilitate fraud by publicans.  I think I can claim to have shown conclusively that these fears were unfounded.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, however, another aspect of the matter was brought to my notice. <Col N="2158" /> Here I should like to express my thanks to Deputy Dillon who wrote to me to draw my attention to it and went to the trouble of sending me some samples of bottles to show what he had in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon's point which I may say was later endorsed by interested persons outside the House, was that, even though the section as introduced did not leave the way open for fraud or the deliberate introducing of non-standard bottles, there was a distinct possibility that firms handling non-standard bottles for the export trade might get some of them accidentally mixed up with the standard bottles for the home trade if there were not some marks which would readily distinguish the standard bottles from the others.</P>
      <P>I accept that as a valid point and the amendment will meet it.  The position under the amendment will be that the bottles will, as at present, have to have the size marked clearly on them.  The vast majority, of course, are half-pints but pints and thirds of pints are legal as well.  The bottles will also be required to have, as at present, a line showing the point to which they should be filled in order to contain the appropriate quantity.  All that will be missing from the bottle as at present marketed will be the small official verification mark and the absence of this will make no obvious difference to the appearance of the bottle.  The non-standard bottles do not, of course, have the size or a filling line embossed on them.  It is this fact which makes them immediately distinguishable from the standard bottle.</P>
      <P>The verification mark it at present required and imposed under Sections 28 and 29 of the Weights and Measures Act, 1878.  Under subsection (1) of the amendment those sections will no longer apply to beer bottles.  All the other provisions of the Weights and Measures Acts will, however, continue to apply to them, including the provisions for enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) of the amendment gives the Minister for Industry and <Col N="2159" /> Commerce power to make certain regulations.  Such a power exists already and there are, in fact, regulations in force at present dealing with the various matters set out in the subsection in so far as they affect beer bottles.  The authority for the making of these regulations, however, is so worded that it could not readily be adopted to apply to the new situation which the amendment will create and it had, therefore, to be re-enacted in a slightly modified form.</P>
    <P>The amendment will, therefore, involve no upset to the bottle trade. Needless to say, all existing standard bottles will continue to be valid and, as I have explained, the markings of the size of the bottle and so on, will continue unchanged, so that there will be no interference with the manufacturing process.  As I said at the outset, I understand that all the trade interests that might have an interest in this matter are satisfied with the amendments now proposed.  I therefore ask the House to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that event, I am as much opposed to the Minister's amendment as I was to the original section and I believe the Irish people will also be when they realise what is happening.  The Minister said he never made the case that there was a tremendous waste of money by reason of the existing system, but he did say in a comment which he made on Section 30, and which he circulated to the trade, that the community pay for the present system and whether they pay as taxpayers or consumers does not alter the fact that the system is wasteful and unproductive. The truth of the matter is that the present system is an absolute guarantee, an absolute assurance that when you buy a bottle of stout, you are getting half a pint.  The present system means that for that guarantee every publican pays only 6/- a year.  When you drink that half-pint of stout from a bottle, you are paying, for that privilege, one seven-thousandth part of what you have paid&mdash;about as little as the fluorine which is to be put into the water; less than one-tenth of a bubble of the froth of a glass of stout&mdash;and it is the intention of the Government to remove that.</P>
      <P>The present system operates as a complete guarantee.  If we remove the inspectors at the source of manufacture, the result may well be that bottles of less than the stated quantity may get on to the market.  The only way of checking it will be for the Guards or the weights and measures inspectors to go into the public-houses and get a bottle and test it.  Can you imagine what may happen if there is a run of 10,000 bottles which are under measure? What will happen is that these will be distributed throughout the country long before the mistake is ever discovered.</P>
      <P>It is necessary, I think, to understand the system of manufacture of glass bottles.  They are manufactured by means of moulds and, as Deputies can well imagine, a considerable amount of heat is used in relation to the manufacture of glass bottles as well as in relation to all glass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at present is that there are four weights and measures inspectors permanently in the glass bottle factory checking each and every bottle as it comes off the machine.  Only when they are satisfied that it will accurately contain a half-pint, or a third of a pint, or a pint, as the case may be, is it let loose on the consuming public.  If we remove that check and simply require the manufacturer to put a half-pint mark on the bottle, the danger may be that hundreds of thousands of bottles may well escape on to the market before a fault is ever discovered.  I am not suggesting for one moment that there would be any intention to defraud, either on the part of the manufacturers or on the part of the wholesale distributors of bottles, but the present system guarantees there will be no mistake.  Remove that and mistakes may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the cost, I have already pointed out that the cost of this absolute guarantee and check is less than one seven-thousandth part of the <Col N="2162" /> price of a bottle of stout.  The case may be made that by bringing in this, you will have four inspectors, four members of the Garda Síochána, returned to other duties and the State saved the expense of paying four inspectors and one part-time inspector. I would direct the attention of the members of this House to a Parliamentary Question which I asked on 25th February.  The reply shows that over the past seven years, the total amount paid in fees was £27,000 and that the salary paid to these inspectors came only to £18,900, and that the State had made a profit of £8,162.  In other words, there is no question of the existing system being an undue burden on the State's finances.  In fact, they are getting a handsome return out of providing what is an absolute guarantee against bottles with a wrong measure getting on to the market.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this section.  As I understand the various Acts which relate to this, the manufacturers of bottles which have a wrong measure may not be prosecuted. If there is to be any prosecution, it will be against an innocent publican who buys the bottles in good faith from the wholesaler or the manufacturer. It is extremely difficult to test the difference between 16 bottles to the gallon and 17 bottles to the gallon.  It cannot be done with the naked eye and in order to protect himself from prosecution, every publican would want to have a half pint or a pint measure.  He would need to have the appropriate measure and to test every bottle coming in.  If any duly authorised person should find that he is selling a quantity under the appropriate measure then, that innocent publican could find himself prosecuted. He would not have even the right that a shop-keeper has who sells goods which are found to be defective. If an action is taken against the shop-keeper he has a right of indemnity against the persons who supply him with the goods.  That does not apply in regard to the amendment that the Minister is trying to bring in.</P>
    <P>I am always reluctant to make comparisons between ourselves and <Col N="2163" /> the neighbouring island but, unfortunately, I have not had an opportunity of inquiring elsewhere to see what the state of the law is.  It is pertinent to note however, that in Britain and in the northern portion of the country, which is not for the time being under our jurisdiction, they have not got the protection, the guarantee, that we have here but they are crying out for it.</P>
    <P>It is being suggested that the amendment gets over the objection which I am voicing and which manufacturers of bottles, wholesale bottlers, and the public have previously voiced.  I cannot see that it does.  It simply means that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may require a mark to be put on a bottle to indentify the measure it contains but it still allows bottles of short measure to get on the market.  It means that instead of the system that is operating of having four inspectors at the point of manufacture checking the bottles, you would have inspectors throughout the length and breadth of the country hounding every other publican to check whether his bottles are of the right measure.  Think of the unfortunate publican whose shop is full of people drinking beer and stout when a Guard comes in and asks for a bottle, checks it and finds it is short measure.</P>
    <P>We have been asked already this evening to agree to a section of the Bill about under-proof whiskey in order to save the unfortunate publican embarrassment.  I think the embarrassment regarding under-proof whiskey would be nothing to that which would be caused in a beer or stout-selling house if the measure were found to be short.  We have a system which is cheap: it costs 1/14th part of the pint of stout.  I think it is a good and sound guarantee; it is a system that has worked well and a system which we would be very foolish to throw aside.</P>

I do not think there is any substance in Deputy Ryan's argument. The former system was a waste of effort in the first instance and I think that is the reason all the interests concerned are satisfied that it should go.</P>

      <P>May I interpose a word?  Am I to understand that the effect of the Minister's proposed amendment is substantially to maintain the situation in which the pint, the half-pint and the one-third pint bottle will remain a marked bottle with a line on it indicating the correct measure to be filled and that it will be an offence to sell beer or stout in a bottle not so marked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is an offence to sell beer or stout in a bottle not so marked, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce hereafter will prescribe the capacities of the bottles and that we are simply using different machinery to produce virtually the same results? Deputy Ryan may not agree with me and he may be more discerning than I am but that is the impression I got of what is in the Minister's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan does raise an important point.  I think it should be made an offence to manufacture or sell bottles that do not conform to the specification of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. <Col N="2165" /> I do not think it is fair to throw the whole burden on the publican.  He takes bottles from the only source from which he can get them in this country, the Irish Glass Bottle Company, and I think the Irish Glass Bottle Company should have a responsibility to see that the bottle itself conforms to the Minister's requirement.  Is not that reasonable?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy not agree that it is extremely unlikely that anything would ever arise in this way? In the first place we have many interests coming into this, large firms, large bottlers and large brewers and so on. The Deputy will appreciate that they will be very concerned lest anything should be wrong in their measuring. These marks on the bottles, I assume, will soon become familiar even in the lowly country public house.  I cannot visualise any of the fears of the Deputy as being likely to be justified in practical form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Irish Glass Bottle Company allowed bottles to leave their premises without being marked they would be committing an offence.  A manufacturer of a bottle would commit an offence if he sold a half-pint stout bottle that did not bear the Weights and Measures mark?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am aware&mdash;and the Deputy must also be aware&mdash;that it has been the practice for stout to be sold by publicans in different types of bottles such as sherry bottles.  It is a regular practice to sell it to people to take off the premises&mdash;in a form that is known in the West of Ireland as &ldquo;a large one&rdquo;.  It is generally sold in bottles such as whiskey or sherry bottles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is illegal to sell bottled stout other than in one-pint, half-pint or one-third pint bottles.  It must be sold in stamped bottles.  I think <Col N="2166" /> we all agree on that, but the question that does occur to me is that every stout bottle must be stamped.  You cannot sell stout under the existing law except in a stamped bottle.  I always thought it would have been illegal under the existing law for a purveyor of bottles such as the Irish Glass Bottle Company to sell stout bottles unless and until those bottles had been stamped.</P>
      <P>It is very different if you buy a set of weights or buy a set of pewter measures.  You buy them at your own hazard and you must then submit them to the weights and measures officer who will stamp them if correct and, if not, he will destroy them or indicate they are not suitable for use. You have not that option with bottles; you cannot submit a gross of bottles to a weights and measures inspector at the local Garda Station and have him stamp them.  They must be stamped at the point of manufacture. I always understood that if a manufacturer issued bottles unstamped he committed an offence.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy not agree that it is easier for a man who is purchasing a bottle of stout to hold it up, look at it and see if the liquid is up to the mark than to have on it a mark which is stamped invariably on the bottom of the bottle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With great respect, the Minister is obviously no publican. Every stamped bottle has a mark on it at present up to which it has to be filled in order to conform to the existing mark.  These are technicalities into which we do not want to draw the Minister in case we seem to seek to trip him.  I am certainly agreed with the Minister&mdash;I know Deputy Ryan is not&mdash;that the provisos he proposes here are adequate to meet the problem that I pressed upon him.  But I am uneasy about one feature of the new proposals, which appears to me to release the manufacturer of bottles from an obligation which heretofore bore upon him and to move the responsibility from the shoulders of the manufacturer on to those of the publican.  If heretofore, a publican bought a gross of bottles and received <Col N="2167" /> them with the mark upon them, that was a good defence for him if he were prosecuted by the Weights and Measures Garda because a bottle of stout sold by him did not contain half a pint.  He could produce the bottle and say: &ldquo;That was filled to the point specified as the correct point to which it should be filled, and it is marked with the mark; therefore, I acted in good faith.&rdquo;  If the bottle, in fact, was not of half-pint capacity, although it was so marked, responsibility then fell on the Weights and Measures administration. It was not the fault of the publican and he had no responsibility for it.</P>
      <P>My apprehension is that, suppose under the new rule the Irish Glass Bottle Company were to sell bottles which owing to some mistake due to innocence on their part&mdash;the mould having shrunk, as Deputy Ryan suggests, or something of that kind&mdash; provided to be below the capacity stated, and they inadvertently continued to use the mould to manufacture 20 gross of bottles out of 5,000 gross, and these bottles are sent out, the responsibility does not rest on them in law; but the unfortunate publican, into whose hands the bottles have innocently come, may be prosecuted for selling less than a half pint of stout in the bottle.</P>
      <P>I want to make a suggestion now to the Minister.  I fully appreciate this is a matter of some little complexity. Deputy Ryan has a different point from mine, and a wider point, but, in respect of my narrow point as to where the liability should rest for selling a bottle which conforms nominally with the provisions of the two new amendments but which is, in fact, deficient, that, I suggest, is a matter into which the Minister might look between now and Report Stage, examine it and see if there is substance in it.  I fully appreciate Deputy Ryan's solicitude, but I do not agree with it. I think adequate provision is being made under these proposed amendments by the Minister.  However, Deputy Ryan has his own point of view on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 56a:</P>
      <P>Before Section 31 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Intoxicating liquor shall not be sold by retail in a sealed container unless the quantity of the contents of the container is indicated on the container.</P>
      <P>(2) A person who contravenes or permits a person under his control or in his employment to contravene subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall on summary conviction thereof be liable, in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding ten pounds and, in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds.</P>
      <P>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8 (which prohibits certain sales of intoxicating liquor otherwise than in marked measures) of the Licensing Act, 1872, a person who sells intoxicating liquor in a sealed container on which the quantity of the contents of the container is indicated shall be deemed not to act in contravention of that section.</P>
      <P>(4) In this section &lsquo;container&rsquo; does not include a bottle.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out, this amendment and amendment No. 56b go together.  Section 8 of the Licensing Act, 1872, provided that intoxicating liquor when sold by retail in quantities of half a pint, or more, should be sold either in cask or in bottle, or in legal measures, and therefore makes illegal the sale of canned stout or beer. Deputies will probably have noticed that in recent years cans of stout and beer have come on the market in increasing quantities.  In fact, no prosecution <Col N="2169" /> for the sale of these cans of beer has been brought under Section 8 of the 1872 Act, which, needless to say, was not intended to apply to canned stout.  The introduction of this Bill, however, provided an opportunity to regularise the position.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the 1872 Act is, therefore, scheduled for repeal.  Recently, it has been suggested to me that since the customer has no way of knowing how much stout or beer a can contains before he opens it, unless the quantity is stated on the label, a statement of the quantity should, for the protection of the consumer, be made a statutory requirement. That seems to be a reasonable suggestion and one which should be adopted.  Hence this amendment which, taken with amendment No. 56b, allows Section 8 to stand and permits the sale of canned beer only where the quantity of the contents is stated on the can.</P>
    <P>I understand at present most&mdash;possibly all&mdash;types of canned stout and beer sold in this country have, in fact, a statement of the contents on the label and the primary purpose of the amendment is, therefore, to guard against future omissions rather than to remove an existing abuse.  The amendment does not refer explicitly to cans but to sealed containers of any type.  The reason for this is that it may be possible in the future to market beer in plastic containers of some kind. Already I understand certain cordials may be bought in plastic containers. The amendments contain no provision making it an offence to have on the label a false statement of the contents. I am advised that such provision is unnecessary and that any such false representation would be an offence under the Merchandise Marks Act.</P>

Licensed premises will be closed between 2.30 p.m. and 5 p.m. and again will be closed on Sunday night at 9 o'clock. In certain places&mdash;I am thinking particularly of the seaside resorts of Bundoran, Salthill and Enniscrone&mdash; where District Justices in their wisdom granted facilities to visitors to have liquid refreshment of intoxicating liquor and otherwise in licensed premises for a certain limited number of hours, sometimes those hours were staggered.  I think it was a very good system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest the Isle of Man.  The Deputy is the type who would go there.  They have forestalled us.  Now you can have a drink there on Sunday up to 10 o'clock.  That is what I am asking the House to do, to let us do what they are doing in the Isle of Man which has the most conservative Parliament in Europe.  On Saturday, for the first time, they threw open their public houses to visitors during the tourist season until 10 p.m.  I make an appeal to the Minister.  All I am asking him to do is to leave it to <Col N="2174" /> the discretion of the district justices. Remember that unless an individual publican makes the application and pays £5 stamp duty, the application must be made by a superintendent of the Garda.  He must satisfy the justice that there will be such an influx of visitors into the locality as to make these facilities necessary.</P>
      <P>In my own native county, and I am sure in county Monaghan, county Cavan and other Border counties, we have a big influx of visitors from the Six Counties on a Sunday.  I am thinking particularly of the town of Raphoe, which is quite adjacent to the Border.  A number of visitors come over there from the Six Counties after lunch on Sunday, have some light refreshments and go back again.  Now you are asking them to remain over until the public houses open.  They have reasons of their own for coming across that we do not know about down here.  They have meetings and functions for which they come over, and they are very welcome at all times.</P>
      <P>I should be disappointed if these people could not obtain the refreshments they have been accustomed to for the past five or six years.  Remember that we had great difficulty satisfying the superintendents of the Garda Síochána and the district justices that a <i>bona fide</i> catering trade was done in public houses in these border towns and small seaside resorts where there was no hotel accommodation, and we did eventually succeed in establishing to the satisfaction of the courts that exemptions should be given and that area exemption orders should be granted on certain occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their wisdom, the legislators of the 1927 Act defined the hours.  I think three hours was the maximum number which could be granted under that Act, and that would just meet with our present licensing laws, if during the summer months, or on the occasions of football matches in winter time, the district justices were permitted to grant area exemption orders for three hours, between 3 and 5 p.m. and again between 9 and 10 p.m.  By doing that, we would be catering for a class of people who would normally expect this <Col N="2175" /> and who have enjoyed these amenities in the past.  I would oppose the Minister's amendment on that account and, if I am in order, I move my amendment to the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>Arising out of this discussion, and I pass no judgment on the merits of the case when put by Deputy O'Donnell, does the small voice of conscience not suggest to many Deputies here, in the light of all we have heard, culminating in the representations made by Deputy O'Donnell, that we are talking of establishing new closing hours which are to be rigorously enforced?  Does any Deputy believe that the new hours will be one bit more rigorously enforced, 18 months hence, than the hours we used to have?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it and I am going to suggest to the Minister that some day, sooner or later, we shall be forced back to the whole question of considering whether we ought to have closing hours at all, or whether we ought to have a period during which we have no closing hours, and let the social practice of our people settle this matter for itself.  Then, if regulation should prove to be necessary, and I very much doubt that, public opinion would manifest itself in a very clear and incisive way which would evoke from this legislature legislation of a kind which would really command that quality of assent from the public which would effectively reinforce the arm of law enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to say, though not really sorry, listening to the debate on the various sections of this Bill, that I am being slowly forced to the conclusion that we are not going to get effective enforcement of any closing hours.  I am not at all sure that we are doing the right thing in making the attempt because we are all committing ourselves to the proposition that the Minister for Justice for the time being is assured of the unanimous support of Oireachtas Éireann in his attempt to enforce the laws.  I have grave misgivings that we are assigning to the <Col N="2176" /> Garda Síochána an impossible task.  I very much doubt the wisdom of it and, the longer I have listened to the debate proceeding on this legislation, the more the conviction grows in my mind that closing hours, as defined by law, are a mistake and the best service we could do our community would be to suspend them all.</P>

      <P>The tradition of Parliament being what it is, the Minister is the person responsible, but, though it is his responsibility, a week ago he declined to answer the question which he had to answer to-day when he was asked it in another form.  My objection to the fact that Radio Éireann has not published the results of its listener inquiry is that it is a public body, spending the taxpayers' money, and when it held this inquiry, It went about it for the purpose of improving a service which it is supposed to be providing for the public.  I think that <Col N="2178" /> if the findings of that inquiry were in favour of Radio Éireann, they would have been published in detail and not in the form of a summary of some unimportant aspects.  Unfortunately, I have not yet in my possession the summary which was given to the Press in June, 1955, but, as far as my recollection goes, that summary was confined to an indication of the hours of maximum listening.  It showed the hours of peak listening and the hours of valley listening.</P>

I believe that the reason the result of this inquiry was not published was that it showed that the majority of the Irish radio audience do not listen to Radio Éireann at all.  I say further, and I honestly believe, that it showed that 25 per cent. of the Irish listening audience, or a figure that is in that region, never listen to Radio Éireann at all.</P>

    <P>I believe also that it showed that less than 2 per cent. of the Irish public listen to any radio programmes in the Irish language from Radio Éireann.

I am saying that because there are foolish people in this country who, if <Col N="2181" /> you try to have the truth known and recorded, accuse you of being hostile to the Irish language.  I believe that the reason that the results were not published is that the official side did not want to explode the balloon which has been hanging above the Irish people for years.  The fact is that the only way of testing Irish public opinion in relation to the Irish language was through the radio, and it showed that when people had an opportunity of turning the radio on or off they turned off the programmes in Irish.</P>

Does anybody here think for a moment that if the findings of this inquiry were in favour of Radio Éireann and showed that 85 per cent. of listeners were listening to it and that 95 per cent. were listening to programmes in Irish that it would not have been published?  Of course, it would have been.  The real reason that it has not been published is that it explodes many of the myths and fantasies that certain people would have us believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say also that I believe that one of the reasons there is such a very small percentage of people listening to programmes in the Irish language is that the programmes are of such a deplorably low standard that <Col N="2182" /> no matter what language they were in nobody would listen to them.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for Radio Broadcasting for the coming year is in the region of £145,000.  I believe that an authority which is getting money directly from this House ought to be answerable to this House even if it is not prepared to give wide publication of its own volition.  I believe that when a Deputy puts down a question in relation to the conduct of a State body or in relation to statistics or information available in any Department of State it ought to be given. It must be remembered that, apart from any practice which may have grown up, Radio Éireann is still directly responsible to this House.  It is only when it does not suit Radio Éireann to give the information that a Minister comes into the House and says that he cannot answer it as it is a matter for the Radio authority in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2183" /> As members of the House will recall, last week, I had two questions addressed to the Minister, on one day about Radio Éireann, one in relation to this inquiry.  I was not given any information in relation to it.  I was referred to the Director of Broadcasting. My second question was with regard to the discontinuance of a particular sponsored programme.  I got the answer to that question.  I was not told that the Minister had no function and that I had to go to the authority.  It did not matter in the second case whether the information was given to the public or not.  In the first case, it mattered a great deal but it did not suit the people who are running such a poor service to give the information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow the Deputy to travel all that way. Raising a Question on the Adjournment should be an extension of the original Question, seeking to get more information than was given in the reply to the Question.  The Deputy may not travel outside the bounds of this Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully bow to your direction, Sir, but it is obviously desirable at this stage, when there is so much interest in radio and television programmes, that the inquiry should be published.  It is a fact that it is now some five years old but Radio Éireann has not changed so much over five years.  Therefore, the Minister is not quite right in saying the statistics would be out of date.  I doubt very much that they would be, except in so far as the number of people who formerly listened to the radio now look at television.  The statistics would still be very much the same in relation to the people who listen to the radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason they have not published and will not publish the information is that they reflect on those who are administering the service and who are putting on the programmes at the present time.  I appreciate what the Minister said in reply to a supplementary of mine to-day that the best course might be to carry out a new inquiry.  I would support the <Col N="2184" /> Minister in that if I thought for one moment the findings would be published, but the attitude of the powers-that-be indicates they would not be published.  If they were not published in 1955 and will not be published now. I fail to see that the results would be published if another inquiry were to be established.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe the findings of an inquiry at the present time would coincide, in the main, with the principal findings of the 1955 inquiry, which were that the majority of the Irish listening public tend to listen to a foreign station and that programmes which are supposed to be encouraging the people to love and respect their national culture and their national tongue are not being listened to at all, because they are of such a deplorably low standard.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that it is necessary to raise this matter on the Adjournment. It is regrettable that the information paid for by the Irish taxpayer was not given to the people at the proper time.  It is also regrettable that we should have to wait some five years before the matter is raised in this way in Dáil Éireann.  That certainly is no fault of mine.  I am sure the Minister will not blame me for that but it is most unfortunate that that should be.  However, the matter is topical by reason of the current discussions on radio and television affairs.  On that account, a new opportunity is given for the publication of these figures and if the Minister maintains his attitude, then it will only convince the people even more as to the reasons why the information was not published, that is, that the findings reflect upon those who conduct the programmes.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the Minister correcting me if I am wrong in the reasons I have given but I respectfully ask him not to abuse me and say I am jumping to conclusions, that I have not got any basis for them.  It is quite possible I have a basis for them which the Minister does not know and which I am under no obligation to communicate to him, seeing that a public authority will not communicate information to the <Col N="2185" /> public.  I believe the findings of the inquiry are a sad reflection on us all as a people, but I do not think there is anything to be gained by hiding unpleasant facts.  That is what is being done and what has been done since the inquiry was first made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was tabled today by Deputy Ryan, in which he asked if I was aware that the Director of Broadcasting had declined to publish the detailed results of the last listener enquiry conducted by Radio Éireann.  I answered that question.  I told Deputy Ryan that I understood that the 1955 listener research inquiry was undertaken primarily to provide Radio Éireann with information and assistance in connection with the planning of programmes.  I also told him that such a length of time had elapsed since the survey was carried out that the statistic, if they were now published, would be rather out of date. In the circumstances, I did not see that any purpose would be served by publishing them now in detail.</P>
      <P>I am, I know, responsible legally to this House for the day-to-day administration of Radio Éireann but, in 1953, a decision was taken by the then Minister to establish Comhairle Radio Éireann and he indicated then to the public and to the House that he proposed for the future to leave the day-to-day administration of Radio Éireann to that council and that practice has been followed by each Minister up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This survey was undertaken, a summary of which was published in 1955. The Fianna Fáil Party were not then the Government There was then a Coalition Government in which there were several members of the Deputy's Party, and they decided, in 1955, to publish only a summary.  They had reasons of their own for not publishing the complete survey.  It is a very long and detailed document and it would <Col N="2186" /> cost a good deal of money to publish it.  The Deputy thinks now that it would be advisable for me as Minister to ask Radio Éireann to publish this inquiry now and spend further public money on its publication five years after the survey was taken by Comhairle Radio Éireann.  I do not think I would be justified in spending money on the publication of a document five years after the survey was carried out.</P>

I told the Deputy last week he should address his inquiry to Radio Éireann.  We have passed through this House this week a new Bill known as the Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1959, which will give legislative effect to the decision taken by the Minister in 1953.  In the future, if we have a listener survey, it will be carried out by that Authority and I shall have no responsibility whatsoever as to whether that Authority sees fit to publish that survey or not.  It will be a matter entirely for the Authority under the legislation passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
