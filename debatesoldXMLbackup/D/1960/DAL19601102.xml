      <P>The Deputy will no doubt have read the recent announcement by the Minister for Lands that he is getting a site in Galway on which it is proposed to erect a fisheries' research station and offices to which about half of the Headquarters staff of the Fisheries Division of his Department will be transferred.</P>
      <P>While every effort is being made to promote, generally, the decentralisation of Departments to such an extent as may be found practicable, the Deputy will realise that it would be injudicious to make public any progress reports as to decentralisation proposals under consideration in Government Departments until the time is opportune for announcements in particular cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government however regards the present rate of emigration as the most disturbing problem facing the community.  We have set ourselves the task of removing the economic causes of emigration by the promotion of a major programme of economic expansion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with the emphasis on productive expenditure rather than on projects designed merely to give immediate employment. The Minister for Finance will shortly issue a progress report on the programme for the half-year ended 30th September last.</P>
      <P>As regards the West of Ireland in particular, I would refer the Deputy to the reply to a question addressed to me in this House on 27th April last in which exceptional measures adopted for the economic rehabilitation of the West of Ireland were detailed.  I should like to draw the Deputy's attention to the following additional measures adopted since then:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  the Programme of Sanitary Services Works envisaging an aggregate capital expenditure of about <Col N="351" /> £35,000,000 over ten years, with special emphasis on the extension of piped water supplies to rural areas&mdash;increased subsidies of 50 per cent. and 60 per cent. of loan charges have been offered to local authorities undertaking the works, the higher rate obtaining in Western counties.</P>
    <P>(ii)  the increase from £500,000 to £750,000 in the funds available for the acquisition of land by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the decision to develop five major fishery harbours, three being on the West Coast, viz., Killybegs, Galway and Castletownbere,</P>
    <P>(iv)  the expansion of the training schemes for skippers and fishermen,</P>
    <P>(v)  the decision to establish the fisheries research station in Galway and to transfer to Galway half of the staff of the Fisheries Division of the Department of Lands,</P>
    <P>(vi)  the commencement of exploratory drilling in the Connaught coalfield, and</P>
    <P>(vii)  the decision to investigate the possibility of utilising the &ldquo;crow&rdquo; coal deposits at Arigna.</P>
    <P>I might add that under the Undeveloped Areas Acts the financial commitments incurred by An Foras Tionscal are now close to £4,000,000; payments by that body exceed £2,000,000 and projects approved represent a capital investment of £9,250,000 and are expected to give employment to 7,330.  Sixty-one projects aided by those Acts are now in production.</P>
    <P>In the reply referred to I mentioned the Moy and Corrib-Clare Drainage Schemes.  I understand that the maintenance of these schemes on completion will employ 200 men.</P>
    <P>The expansion of State forests in recent years has been particularly marked in the Western Counties and this year 45 per cent. of the planting programme arises there.  There are over three times as many employed by the Forestry Division in the West as there were ten years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Finally, I should like to stress my view that emigration is not merely an economic problem.  While our economic effort is of the greatest importance it needs to be supplemented by action on the part of all elements in the country whose words or acts can influence community thinking in order to eradicate its social and psychological causes, the importance of which tends to be overlooked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach serious in his statement made in this House that the rate of emigration is not in excess of that in relation to the period prior to 1954/58 and that it is not at an unprecedented rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in rural Ireland at the moment the small farmers in addition to their sons and daughters are pulling out as fast as they can?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach has at this stage given sufficient consideration to the matter to be able to tell us whether he has any plans with regard to the development of agriculture and the stability of markets in order to give some chance to those people who live in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible that the Taoiseach is really not aware of the acute crisis that has come upon the farmers of this country with special reference to the small farmers who are the primary producers of our agricultural produce?  If he is not aware of it, the situation of the country is quite desperate.  If the Taoiseach is aware of the very grave situation in which the farmers find themselves, perhaps he would give some indication as to whether the Government have any plans to deal with the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware, from the ordinary accepted sources that are usually taken in the absence of census of population figures, that the rate of emigration from Ireland at the 30th June of this year was 40,000 persons?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach informed of the critical state in which the farmers of this country are at the present time, with special reference to the small farmers who are producing what is the ultimate end product of the industry and, if he is not, will he consult the Deputies of his own Party who represent rural constituencies and learn from them that the state of the farmers, particularly the small farmers, at the present time is as bad as I have ever known it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that a reduction in the rate of emigration and its eventual elimination depend mainly on the success of the Government's efforts to improve the country's economic position, both in relation to agriculture and every other activity, and in accordance with the plan which was accepted and approved by all the farmers' organisations in the country, the Government's whole efforts are directed towards that end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I have not, and if the Deputy will take account of the information already given to him on this matter he will <Col N="354" /> see, for example, so far as a very high number of the proposals that came in from local authorities related to water supplies and sewerage schemes, we have already made decisions to augment the facilities available to them and, in relation to another large number of proposals which dealt with tourist amenities, similar decisions have been taken.  We did not get very many proposals for specific projects relating to particular localities but, in so far as we did, they are being dealt with in a systematic way by the Departments concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that the Minister for Finance informed the House that there were 700 proposals made by local authorities and that none of them had been approved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of the disclosures contained in the most recent Central Statistics Office publication on employment and unemployment that there has been no new significant increase in non-agricultural employment and a further decrease of 9,000 in the numbers employed in agriculture, he will take immediate steps to establish State-owned and operated industries in all these sections of the economy not already operated by the State and hitherto the responsibility of private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication referred to in the Deputy's Question <Col N="356" /> appears to be that on the Trend of Employment in 1959, and the summary statement mentioned by him relates to the year ended April, 1959, and is, therefore, more than a year and a half out of date.  The Deputy must be aware that much more recent information has appeared in that publication and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>For example, the number of persons engaged in transportable goods industries rose by 4,800 from June, 1958, to June, 1959, and by a further 3,100 from June, 1959, to June, 1960.  This is one indication of the economic growth which is proceeding.  Others are: that the quarterly index of the volume of output in manufacturing industries has substantially exceeded the corresponding figure for the previous year in every quarter since June, 1959; that, in mining, quarrying and turf, output was 50 per cent. greater in the June quarter of 1960 than in the corresponding quarter of 1958, though slightly less than in 1959; that there is evidence of a rise in building and constructional activity; and that the total number on the Live Register was over 10,000, or about 20 per cent., less on the 22nd October, 1960, than on the corresponding date a year ago.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Deputy that one of the Directive Principles of Social Policy in the Constitution is that &ldquo;The State shall favour and, where necessary, supplement private initiative in industry and commerce&rdquo;. The Government's Programme for Economic Expansion is, accordingly, based on the principle that the private sector will continue to be the principal source of new productive projects.</P>

      <P>The only current information regarding unemployment is that derived from the content of the Live Register at the Local Offices of the Department of Social Welfare.  The total number of such registrants at 22 October, 1960, the latest date for which the information is available, was 40,592.  The percentage of currently insured persons on the Live Register (excluding agriculture, fishing and private domestic service) was 5.4 per cent. at mid-October, 1960.</P>
      <P>Most of the young people seeking work for the first time do not register at the Local Offices.  The latest information regarding those who have left school and are &ldquo;not yet at work&rdquo; is that derived from the Census of Population, 1951.  The total of such persons aged 14 years and over at the time of that Census was 16,226 males and 17,327 females.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously not.  A percentage of these would not be actively seeking employment in the sense that an unemployed worker would be seeking it, and it is not possible to divide these figures into those who are engaged in household duties, those who are continuing their studies and those who are actively seeking work.</P>

      <P>Certainly, but the Deputy would arrive at a false conclusion if he considered only the number of passports issued because it is well known that people sometimes apply for passports and visas for travel purposes who eventually do not use them.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of dispensary doctors who have acted in a temporary capacity for fifteen years and more; and if he will take steps to introduce legislation to permit such doctors who have given satisfactory service to be <Col N="362" /> permanently appointed without requiring them to present themselves for competitive examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from the records in my Department that only one dispensary doctor has acted in a temporary capacity for fifteen years.</P>
      <P>The present system of appointment through the Local Appointments Commissioners has proved itself over a long period and while, naturally, I sympathise with the doctor who finds himself displaced after such long service, I would not feel justified in suggesting legislation which would have the effect of altering that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know how hard the Minister finds it to agree with me on anything, but would he not agree that where a dispensary doctor has served in the one area for upwards of 21 years it is unfair to the poor people and an undue hardship on the doctor involved, because of the mutual feelings of trust, respect and understanding which have developed, to end that happy situation by one unnecessary bureaucratic sweep?  On that account, would the Minister not feel, seeing there is only one case of this nature, that he would be justified in introducing a special Act to cover the circumstances of this particular case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to agree with the Deputy I should be criticising legislation passed by this House and criticising the manner in which the Local Appointments Commissioners, who have been appointed to carry out the legislation, discharged their duty in this instance, I am not prepared to do so.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="363" /> Health whether he has received any representations urging that portion of Walkinstown, Dublin, be amalgamated with the Drimnagh dispensary district; and, if so, whether he proposes to approve of that amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have approved in principle of a proposal by the Dublin Health Authority for the transfer of portion of the Walkinstown area to the South City No. 7 (North Crumlin) Dispensary District.  The Drimnagh area is included in this dispensary district.</P>
      <P>The necessary formal Order will be made shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is prepared to approve of the appointment of an additional dispensary doctor in the Drimnagh area in view of the large number of dependants of each holder of a blue card in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of an additional dispensary doctor in this area is a matter for the Dublin Health Authority in the first instance and I have not received a proposal from that body for such an appointment. However, the latest information available, regarding the number of persons eligible for dispensary services in the district and of the number attending the dispensary at Curlew Road, does not appear to warrant the appointment of an additional dispensary doctor in the South City No. 7 Dispensary District, in which the Drimnagh area is situated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the addition of Walkinstown to the Drimnagh Dispensary District will mean an increase of about 1,000 persons requiring dispensary attention in the Drimnagh Dispensary District? On that account, and in view of the fact that he will shortly make an Order authorising the transfer of the Walkinstown area to Drimnagh, would the Minister not continue in office the doctor who has given 21 years' service in the Drimnagh area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no power to continue this doctor in <Col N="364" /> service.  The Deputy, as a member of Dublin Corporation, must know that the doctor is, or was, an employee of the Dublin Health Authority and was employed by them in a temporary capacity for a great many years.  I sympathise with the doctor in the position in which he finds himself.  However, I am like the Deputy&mdash;I cannot do anything about it.  It is up to the doctor himself really on the next occasion on which a vacancy is advertised to ensure, if he can, that he will be the best qualified person.  Then, I am perfectly certain the Local Appointments Commissioners will be delighted to recommend him.</P>
      <P>On the Supplementary the Deputy has put to me particularly addressed to the position of Dublin South City No. 7 Dispensary District, I would say this.  Even if the Walkinstown area is added, the number of eligible patients to be attended to by the three doctors in that district will be considerably less than it is in many other dispensary districts in Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no dispensary district of Drimnagh but the Drimnagh area is included in the South City No. 7 (North Crumlin) Dispensary District.  On the 14th October, 1960, the latest date for which the information is available, 2,918 persons were covered by general medical services cards in this dispensary district.  There are three district medical officers in the district and each attends the dispensary at Curlew Road from 9.30 a.m. to 11 a.m. each weekday.</P>

      <P>I understand that discussions have taken place between the City and County Managers and representatives of the various groups mentioned in the question and that, as a result of these discussions, the Managers are about to submit to their Councils proposals for revisions of the salaries or salary scales as the case may be of most of the groups concerned. I have already indicated publicly that my approval would be forthcoming for any reasonable proposals for revision submitted to me by the various health authorities.  It can, therefore, be taken that when the proposals are submitted to me, there will be no delay in dealing with them.  Further, I have caused it to be <Col N="367" /> known that, in view of the delays which have already occurred, I shall be prepared to approve proposals which involve a reasonable degree of retrospection.</P>

      <P>I have notified the Local Agent at Duncannon, County Wexford, that, in the event of his not resigning from membership of the Wexford County Council, his appointment will be terminated because as a Civil Servant he is debarred under general Civil Service regulations from membership of a local authority.  I should state, for the Deputy's information, that, on his assimilation into the Civil Service on the 1st August, 1950, the Agent in question acknowledged in writing the receipt by him of the relevant regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this man is part-time, unestablished, non-pensionable and employed at a wage of £2 10s. 0d. per week, can the Minister say whether or not it is fair to define him as a civil servant for the purposes of the regulation he has just quoted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the agent in question is a part-time employee, but the nature of his office brings him into very close contact with members of the general public.  In these circumstances, it was decided in the year 1950 that, as a civil servant, he could not be a member of a local authority.  I am merely enforcing the regulation made in this regard in 1950, with the spirit and letter of which I fully agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that this man has a very big connection with the public.  That is agreed.  However, would the Minister consider that teachers are allowed to be members of <Col N="368" /> local authorities and that they certainly come in contact with the public through the children?  Would the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach also consider the fact that postmen are allowed to be members of local authorities and that members of the Defence Forces are so allowed and they also come in contact with the public?  If, as the Minister seems to imply, this man's job would be affected by membership of a county council, how much more would a person be swayed in his attitude to the public, if he is a postman, a teacher or a member of the Defence Forces?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will remember that I discussed this case with him and that I pointed out to him that, whether the regulations are good or bad, they could not be ignored.  I also pointed out that a decision could not be given in this matter retrospectively applying to a single case as that would be unfair to any number of other civil servants who may have considered seeking election and felt themselves debarred by their ineligibility for membership of a local authority.  I must say that the validity of the regulations has never been challenged by any Government since they were made in 1950.  I have not myself considered the matter of their validity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

The whole business was very fully considered at the time of the taking over of the unified society in 1950, when this regulation was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs what orders were issued to the United Nations Command in regard to the premier, Mr. Lumumba, on the occasion of his attempt to use the national radio service in the Congo or at any other time; if he was made aware that such orders were issued to United Nations troops; and if any such orders issued at any time to members of the Irish forces now stationed in the Congo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware that the United Nations Command in the Congo took certain action in relation to a proposed broadcast by Mr. Lumumba, I am not aware of the <Col N="375" /> detailed orders issued on that occasion, nor am I aware whether such orders applied to the Irish contingent, who, however, as the Deputy knows, have been stationed elsewhere than the Leopoldville province.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I should like to point out to the Deputy that his question seems to me to rest on a misconception of the role in relation to the United Nations operation in the Congo of the Governments which have made troops available for that operation.  I would recall in this connection that in the course of my statement in the Dáil on 20th July on the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1960, I spoke as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The contingent will be acting on behalf of the United Nations, subject to orders of the Supreme Commander and not to the orders of the Irish Government.  It will be for the Supreme Commander and not the Irish Government to determine the day-to-day measures and dispositions necessary to achieve the purpose of the force.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have all along taken the view that the handling of this operation is a matter for the Secretary-General alone, acting under and in accordance with the directions of the Security Council and, as the case may be, the General Assembly.  We think that this is the only reasonable manner in which to proceed if the operation is to be successful; and we were very happy to see this viewpoint endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the Assembly when the conduct of the Secretary-General was called in question at the Fourth Emergency Special Session of the Assembly which met from September 17th-20th, 1960.</P>

      <P>My question arose out of an order which appears to have been given to a soldier in charge of the United Nations Command to shoot Mr. Lumumba.  The Taoiseach is aware of that order, I assume.  I should like to know from the Taoiseach was such an order issued by the United Nations Command and <Col N="376" /> with the consent of Mr. Hammarskjoeld?  Did our delegation know that such an order was issued and, if it was issued, did our delegation, as the other nations did, protest against this order to shoot the elected Premier of the Congo who had asked United Nations to go to the Congo to deal with the problem that arose there?</P>

      <P>Returns furnished to my Department by the licensed flour millers indicate that approximately 57½ per cent. of the wheat milled by them in 1959-60 was home grown wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to 1960-61 it is not possible at this stage to say what percentage of the wheat milled by the flour millers will be home grown wheat.  The millers are required to use 300,000 tons of home grown wheat if it is available. If flour output is maintained at the same level as last year this 300,000 tons would represent about 78 per <Col N="382" /> cent. of the total user, but if less than 300,000 tons of millable native wheat is available or if the level of flour consumption changes this percentage will also change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If in fact it is not possible to get from Irish wheat sufficient wheat of a millable character to produce the target grist envisaged by the Minister, is it proposed to review the price of bread and flour by reason of the fact that a cheaper wheat, namely, an imported wheat, will be used in the grist because of the shortage of millable wheat of Irish origin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy had better address that question to the Minister for Agriculture.  However, he will remember that that Minister made an arrangement with the mills that in the event of 300,000 tons of native wheat not being millable, they would use imported wheat to make up the difference and the same price would be charged for the wheat to the mills.  The Grain Board would be empowered then to dispose of any surplus for feeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the increased price of wheat and flour is justified or was sought to be justified on the basis that a higher quantity of the native wheat would be used in the grist for 1960/61.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, being concerned with prices, is aware of that fact.  If it now turns out that there is not sufficient Irish millable wheat to reach the target grist, which would justify the higher price of bread and flour, will the Minister for Industry and Commerce concerned with prices endeavour to ensure that the matter of the present high prices is reviewed since the justification for them will have been removed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That arrangement made with the Minister for Agriculture was made with my agreement and that arrangement requires the mills to pay for any slack in native wheat the same price for imported <Col N="383" /> wheat as they would have to pay for native wheat.  That will not allow of any reduction in the price of flour.</P>

With the recent change in the grist from 80 per cent.  Irish to 60 per cent., instead of the price of household flour being reduced by 11/6d. per sack and the price of bakers' flour by 15/6d. per sack there has been no reduction.</P>

      <P>The only change in the price of wheat of which I am aware is the reduction of 4/6d. a barrel represented by the levy.  How then can the price of domestic wheat be quoted as the reason for a further increase in the price of bread by ½d. in the 2 lb. loaf?  We know the first 5½d. in the increase is due to the abolition of the food subsidies but there now has been another ½d. on the 2 lb. loaf, making a total increase of 6d. at a time when the domestic price of wheat has actually gone down.</P>

      <P>The amount of native wheat used by the licensed flour millers last year was 221,204 tons.  As I have said in reply to the Question, that represents 57½ per cent. native wheat in the grist.  The amount of native wheat the millers will be required to take this year is 300,000 tons and, based on the present consumption of bread, that 300,000 tons will represent 78 per cent. of the grist. That is the reason for the increase in the price of bread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is prepared to reconsider his decision in regard to the use of gravel instead of stone for county road improvement schemes in County Roscommon; and if not, whether he has alternative proposals for the employment of workers who are unemployed as a result of his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made no decision in favour of the general use of gravel instead of stone for county road improvement schemes in County Roscommon. It is primarily for the county council itself to decide on the material to be used on any particular scheme but, in coming to a decision, they should advert to all the relevant considerations, including the technical and other advice available to them. One of the general considerations already placed before them was the very high percentage (83.4 per cent.) of the Roscommon county roads that have yet to be made dust-free.  Another was that the provision of improved county roads is a considerable amenity to the farming community.  It has been Government policy for many years to speed up the improvement of county roads and where the use of gravel can yield a striking economy a greatly increased mileage of county roads can be improved under the grant by the use of that material.  I am concerned in so far as the cost of any particular scheme is recouped from the Road Fund.  I cannot recoup expenditure where the technical advice available to me shows that such expenditure is clearly excessive.  The technical advice available both to Roscommon county council and to me shows that that would be so in the case of a <Col N="387" /> number of schemes if they were executed in stone.</P>
      <P>I have gone as far as I possibly can to meet the county council by indicating that where the difference in cost is not substantial, I will accept the more expensive method favoured by the council.  Where the difference in cost is substantial&mdash;and my advice is that in the extreme case it can be the difference between 1/11d. and 6/3d. per square yard&mdash;the council are still free to go ahead with the dearer method, provided they are prepared to meet the extra cost involved themselves, the Road Fund meeting the basic cost.  I should add that following these principles 10 schemes submitted by Roscommon county council for execution in stone this year have been approved.</P>
      <P>The effect on employment of the use of gravel is sometimes exaggerated. While the construction of a certain length of road in gravel may have a lower labour content than the construction of the same length in stone, a much greater length can be done in gravel with the same amount of money, and this offsets to an extent at least the lower labour content.  Making allowance for the fact that the grants have been increased to some extent this year, I am still inclined to think that the effects of modernising road work, in keeping with the tendency in every other county, have been exaggerated and unduly criticised in the case of Roscommon.  For the first six months of this financial year the average number employed monthly in Roscommon was 649 as against 642 last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in localities where stone is available in reasonable quantities gravel is now being brought a distance of five or six miles, and as a result a large number of men are losing the limited amount of employment they have been getting in rural Ireland?  Does the Minister now suggest that he will give permission to the local authority to go ahead and use stone for making the roads provided that the local authority carries the extra cost?  Is that one of <Col N="388" /> the solutions which the Taoiseach now has for his responsibility to give employment, namely to put the onus on the local authority to carry the extra cost?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the present Bill is to enable Ireland to become a member of the recently established international lending agency known as the International Development Association.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill indicates the objects and activities of the Association.  Its Articles of Agreement, containing the regulations relating to membership, capital, operations and organisation and management, are included as a schedule to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Association is a further addition to the Bretton Woods family of international organisations.  Deputies will recollect that there are already in existence three associated institutions, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, or World Bank as it is called, and the International Finance Corporation, of each of which Ireland is a member.  The International Monetary Fund is mainly concerned <Col N="390" /> with the encouragement of international foreign trade by the maintenance of stable exchange rates, the removal of restrictions on international payments and the provision of short-term assistance for temporary balance of payment deficits.  The World Bank devotes its activities to aiding the development of its member countries by the making of loans, mainly in the public sector of the economy, and by technical advice.  The International Finance Corporation concentrates on promoting the expansion of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that in one particular sphere&mdash;and that a very important one&mdash;the World Bank has found its operation seriously hampered. That is in the provision of aid to the less developed countries.  The Bank under its Charter is required to observe strict commercial standards in its operations; it must charge economic rates of interest and require loan repayments in hard currencies.  These requirements have borne hard on countries in process of development, which often find high rates of interest onerous and foreign exchange scarce.</P>
    <P>The consequence has been that the Bank has found itself prevented from making loans in certain circumstances despite the obvious utility of the projects concerned.  To remedy this situation the International Development Association has been set up as an affiliate of the Bank.  Its principal advantage is that it will have considerably greater latitude in its financing operations than the Bank.  Paragraph 4 of the explanatory memorandum gives details of the types of financing in which it will be able to engage.  It should prove a considerable boon to the less well off nations to be able to obtain loans on these terms.  While the Association will have wide latitude in its loan operations, it will still submit loans to a careful scrutiny to ensure that they are of high developmental priority; loans will also be given only as a supplement to&mdash;and not in substitution for&mdash;loans made from private sources or by the World Bank.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum indicates the financial commitments involved in becoming a member of the <Col N="391" /> Association.  Details of the subscriptions fixed for the 68 member countries of the Bank who, subject to signature of the Articles of Agreement before 31st December, 1960, may become original members of the Association, are given in Schedule A to the Articles. An unusual feature is that for subscription purposes member countries are divided into two groups.  The first group, the seventeen more industrialised member countries of the Bank, are required to pay their total subscription in gold or freely convertible currencies.  The second group, comprising the less developed countries and including Ireland, need pay only 10 per cent. of their subscription in fully convertible form.  Payment of the balance is made in national currency, which the Association will not be free to convert into other currencies or to use to finance exports from the country concerned without its consent. The Executive Directors of the World Bank have, however, expressed the hope that the more developed of the second group of countries, among which Ireland may be included, would be prepared to release at least some part of the 90 per cent. of their subscriptions in convertible currency.  The payment in national currency can be made in non-negotiable non-interest-bearing demand notes.  At intervals of approximately five years, the Association will review the adequacy of its resources and if it considers it desirable will authorise a general increase.  The decision to subscribe to such an increase will be at the discretion of the member country.</P>
    <P>If Ireland joins the Association, her subscription will amount to $3.03 million or £1.08 million.  Of this amount, £108,000 will be payable in gold or freely convertible currency, £54,000 initially and £13,500 annually for the four succeeding years.  The balance of £972,000, payable in Irish currency or non-negotiable non-interest-bearing demand notes, is to be paid in five equal instalments, one immediately and the remainder annually over the following four years.</P>
    <P>Under the Articles of Agreement, the finances of the Association will be used for further development in the less <Col N="392" /> developed areas of the world included within the Association's membership. It is not possible at this stage to say whether in fact Ireland will at any time seek or receive aid from the Association. The Government consider it desirable, however, for Ireland to become a member of the Association and thus give practical evidence of continued support for international economic co-operation.  The initial subscription is not onerous and, as I have indicated, need only be paid to the extent of 10% in convertible currency.</P>
    <P>Ireland has established good relations with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and International Finance Corporation.  A World Bank mission visited the country this summer to make a review of the present agricultural situation and development programme and in particular to examine the milk and pig processing industries and recommend possible lines of improvement.  They have now completed their study and are at present engaged in preparing their report.</P>
    <P>Apart from the obligation of subscribing to the capital stock of the Association, membership involves the granting of certain immunities and privileges to the Association.  They are similar to those granted to the International Monetary Fund and to the World Bank by the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1957, and to the International Finance Corporation by the International Finance Corporation Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>Before Ireland can become a member of the Association it will be necessary for the Government to sign the Association's Articles of Agreement and to deposit with the World Bank an instrument setting forth that it has accepted the agreement in accordance with its law and has taken all steps necessary to enable it to carry out its obligations.  This Bill is designed to give approval for the acceptance of the agreement by the Government and to provide the powers necessary to enable the Government to implement it.  The Bill follows generally the lines of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1957, in so far as that Act relates to the World Bank, and the International Finance <Col N="393" /> Corporation Act, 1958.  The purpose of the various sections is indicated in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this Bill arises from membership of the World Bank.  It is closely associated with that membership.  It is obvious, therefore, that so far as we on these benches are concerned, we shall support such an arrangement because the step taken to join the World Bank was taken in pursuance of a decision made while I was Minister for Finance to send the head of the Department to America to negotiate the terms on which we could join. It is clear that if one is to be a member of an international association, one must belong to all facets of the association, but while that is true in a general way, it does not necessarily mean that the details should not be more clearly understood by everyone in the House before the Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>The Minister circulated an explanatory memorandum in relation to the Bill.  That memorandum takes up three pages.  It deals with the first page-and-a-half of the Bill but it does not cover, in any shape or form, the remaining 16½ pages of the Bill which we are now being asked to pass.  I know quite well that we are not empowered to alter the Articles of the Agreement; we must take them <i>in toto</i> or not at all.  It is not open to us to amend in any way these Articles as they are set out in those 16½ pages of Schedule but I think the Minister might have made some effort, when circulating the explanatory memorandum, to explain the Articles in somewhat less technical language so that we might understand to what we are being asked to adhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I am lucky in that I have certain facilities available to me to help my understanding of such a document more easily than other people but I find it almost impossible to understand certain of the sections in that Agreement.  I cannot see any reason why, or any principle whereby, for example, the countries were divided into two sections.  The Minister has said that those in Part I are the countries which are more industrially developed than the others.  So far as <Col N="394" /> I can gather, I do not think that follows from consideration of the names of the countries, nor is there anything to suggest, anywhere that I could find, how the various subscriptions for the different countries were determined.</P>
    <P>We should like to know how it is that our subscription came to be fixed at just over £1,000,000, the equivalent of 3,000,000 dollars, and that certain other countries, as set out on page 19 of the Bill, do not seem to bear the same burden, having regard to our potentialities and theirs.  That should have been explained to us in the Bill, and what is going to happen in relation to the 90 per cent. of our subscription which will be made in Irish currency should have been explained far more clearly.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the International Development Association will be completely free to spend the ten per cent. we have to contribute in gold or hard currency.  That £108,000 can be spent anywhere in the world, but in relation to the other 90 per cent., as I understand the position, it cannot be spent outside this country but must be spent here.  It cannot be spent here for the purpose of financing exports, except with the consent of the Government. I cannot see, therefore, how the Association can spend it, except for development within the country concerned. What operates for us operates for everyone and if our subscription cannot be spent outside of Ireland without the consent of the Irish Government, a similar position will likewise obtain in relation to the other nations.  If their subscriptions cannot be expended on exports, except with the consent of the respective Governments, how can the flow of exports be maintained&mdash;with particular reference to productive goods and factory machinery&mdash;to the less developed countries?  On the face of it, that does not seem to me to be clear. I suggest it is one of the matters the Minister should have clarified in the memorandum, but it is not touched on at all.</P>
    <P>There are some other elaborate arrangements made in relation to Article VI, Section 3, which deals with voting rights.  In relation to the <Col N="395" /> determination of the user of the funds of the Association is it clear that it will be entirely an executive decision or do those voting rights shown at the bottom of page 10 mean that before any country can use the funds of the Association to promote development, there will have to be the canvassing which inevitably arises in international associations?  Unless the position is that these voting powers are purely for the purpose of electing the executive officials and that the executive officials then carry out their work, it seems to me that there will be chaos.  I think that is what is intended, but again, when he was asking the House to pass this Bill, the Minister might have included an appropriate statement in his memorandum instead of leaving it completely in the air.</P>
    <P>In his closing remarks, the Minister referred to the technicians and experts who were here during the summer examining our milk and pig industries.  He indicated that they have finished their survey and are now writing their report.  Has the Minister any indication as to when that report may hope to see the light of day, and can he say what is the procedure in relation to such reports in general?  Are they communicated to the Governments concerned first&mdash; I assume they are&mdash;and having been communicated to the Government concerned, are they then at liberty to publish such reports?  When the Government here receive the report, have they to go back to the World Bank authorities and ask for permission for publication?  If we are to be a member of an association such as this, it is highly desirable that every member of the Irish public should be made aware, at the first available opportunity, of whatever comments and suggestions these people have to make.  If we are not entitled to publish the report without consent, I suggest that consent should be requested before the reports come out.  There is no sense in paying public money for these advantages or services, unless the country as a whole has an opportunity of assessing what the results will be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> I should also like to inquire about the position in relation to the Central Bank being a depository.  Is it intended that that arrangement will operate in the same way as the Marshall Aid moneys operated, with a Grant Counterpart Fund and a Loan Counterpart Fund but with separate credits with the Central Bank which can be drawn off as and when required? During the period of that deposit, are the Central Bank entitled to invest that money here in Government loans, long-dated stocks.  Exchequer Bills, or in ways and means advances to the Government?  I am not clear from the explanation what the position is in that regard.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell me what the total voting strength of the Association will be, on the basis of the subscriptions expected and indicated, and what our voting strength out of that total will be?  I suppose what will happen is that the representatives of the various countries will be able to operate their voting on a par basis. It seems to me that so far as we are concerned our voice, and our strength, in that respect will be almost infinitesimal. I suppose we must accept that but I hope the business of the Association will be carried out by the executive officials without reference back to the Association as a whole, because if there is to be the pulling and tugging such reference back will inevitably create, quite clearly nothing whatever will ever be done by the Association as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to enable Ireland to become a member of the recently-established International Development Association.  That Association really stems from the parent organisation, the World Bank, of which Ireland is a member.  We are also a member of the International Monetary Fund.  Those three organisations are now tied together but they have different functions and operate under different conditions for the purpose of dealing with the problems of the undeveloped and underdeveloped countries throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can adopt either of two courses: we can wash our hands of these organisations and stand aloof, taking <Col N="397" /> a grandstand seat and doing nothing in respect of the general problem of helping undeveloped and underdeveloped countries of the world to build their economies on a basis which will ensure stability of government and economic security for the people; or we can say that this is a type of work in which Ireland is interested and, as well as developing our own economy, we want to play whatever part our resources permit in the development of underdeveloped countries and emergent nations which are now for the first time feeling the effects of the heady wine of liberty.  The Labour Party is strongly in favour of participating in any international movement designed to raise living standards throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Many countries which are now breathing the air of liberty for the first time will realise, before their liberty is many months old, that political freedom is not in itself a passport to immunity from the economic blasts. They will realise that political freedom does not, in itself, provide employment, high living standards, social security and up-to-date services; neither will it ensure complete economic development. These things can only be achieved by hard work on the part of the citizens and by the utilisation of all the mass of brain and brawn.  But human activities must be financed by some source, either native or international. It is good for the world, and good for these emergent nations, that a body of this kind should be in existence to finance activities and help these nations to develop their own resources and reach the civilised standards of living enjoyed by the older, more highly developed countries.  This International Development Association comes at a time when financial and economic help was never more necessary for emergent undeveloped nations. We do right in associating ourselves with the other countries in endeavouring to establish this Association and in ensuring that it will be utilised for the purpose of assisting in the development of underdeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of the Association is to promote economic development, increase productivity and thus <Col N="398" /> raise the standard of living, within the Association's membership in particular, by providing finances to meet the important development required in these areas.  I should like to know from the Minister on what our subscription to this Association has been based.  It does not appear to have been based on either territory or population because the figures given do not relate either to the size of our territory or to our population standards.  No doubt there is some formula.  The fractions set out on page 19 would certainly suggest there is.  I should like the Minister to give us some information as to the basis governing our subscription.</P>
    <P>I take it, too, that it will be possible for the Association to make its resources available here, if it is determined that Ireland is an undeveloped country.  I should like to know what body so determines.  Is it by a vote of all the countries?  Is it by a decision of the secretariat after an examination of certain fundamental economic questions? One phase of the Association's activity is commendable inasmuch as it has not to follow strict commercial standards in its lending operations.  It can permit long periods of grace before repayments start.  Repayment may be made, in whole or in part, in local currencies.  This gives the Association a flexibility not possessed by either the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.  Once established the Association will be in a position to come speedily to the aid of undeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>Beyond inquiring as to the basis governing our contribution, this Party is in favour of the Bill.  This is one of the best international organisations established so far.  It can make a tremendous contribution in helping to prevent difficulty and strife, which arise inevitably out of bad economic conditions, in different parts of the world.  We welcome the Bill and will facilitate any measure necessary to permit Ireland's participation as a member of the Association.</P>

      <P>Everyone will agree that this is a most important Bill.  In view of its importance, I join with Deputy Sweetman in criticising the Minister for giving us so <Col N="399" /> little information.  One of the most important things in the world today is aid to undeveloped nations.  This Association is a successor to the International Development Authority. This Association will be able to make money available at a very low rate of interest.  The World Bank is confined to certain monetary conditions. It has to give those who invest in it a proper return for their money.  The position was that one had the World Bank, on the one side, and the Soviet Union, and its satellites, on the other, competing for the goodwill of emergent undeveloped nations.  The Soviet Union were able to give grants at a very low rate of interest, perhaps as low as two per cent.  The World Bank could only lend money at a commercial rate of interest.</P>
      <P>This Bill is of paramount importance. It is for international development. The Minister has given us very little information.  There are many things we want to know. Countries in the Far East, in the Middle East and in Africa are coming into government for the first time. The Bill contains a list from which many new nations are omitted.  As I read the limited information the White Paper gives us, the Bill deals only with those countries which are specifically mentioned.  On the list, we find Burma, Ceylon, India, the South American group, mostly the smaller Republics in South America, and other countries such as Greece, Italy, Iceland and Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill specifically states that the fund of 1,000,000,000 dollars which is being created is for the purpose of giving aid to the countries in this group.  I thought the Bill was to counteract the sphere of influence of the Iron Curtain countries who lavish money free of interest or at a very low rate of interest.  I thought the Bill was an effort to improve the position of the free nations, <i>vis-a-vis</i> that of the Iron Curtain countries.  It is of paramount importance to Ireland, as to any country, to ensure that the new nations are included within the sphere of influence of the Bill.  It is necessary to utilise the money <Col N="400" /> wherever it may be required.  Is it for these countries alone or for relief wherever it may be required in any part of the underdeveloped world?</P>
    <P>According to the White Paper, the money is not for the whole world but only for specified countries.  It says: &ldquo;The purposes of the Association are to promote economic development. increase productivity and thus raise standards of living in the less-developed areas of the world included within the Association's membership.&rdquo; If that be the case, where will this money be spent?  Will it be spent in the Far East, in Burma, Ceylon and India?  Although they probably require help, as other countries do, they are already substantially covered by the Colombo plan.  That brings us back to the other countries. Will we be helped?  The White Paper says: &ldquo;The Association will operate in the territories of its less-developed members.&rdquo;  I presume membership comprises the nations mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>What countries will be included in this category and whether Ireland will be one of them is not yet decided. Who will decide?  How will this money be utilised?  If the Bill is to give rapid necessary aid where it is wanted so as to counteract, as in many cases it may be, Soviet propaganda and pressure in those countries, how will it be arranged?  Is it a question of some 56 nations sitting around a table and deciding what will be done with the money?  From my knowledge of international organisations, I can envisage about 200 persons sitting around a table to spend this 1,000,000,000 dollars and a period of about two to six months elapsing before they reach agreement on any one point.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give us that information when we are voting this sum of money.  We ought to know how the money will be spent; how the arrangements will be made; to what sphere the money will be directed. There are many reasons why we should know the full position as quickly as possible in the circumstances that arise in so many of these countries.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who has just spoken mentioned countries which received <Col N="401" /> their freedom and believed that once they had got that the rest would follow as a happy sequence.  Most of these countries require some immediate assistance and advice.  I notice that our contribution is fixed at approximately £1.8 millions.  Will we have a say in proportion to the amount of money we have in this fund or will we just have an ordinary voice along with the other nations?  Will we have a one-fifty-sixth voice, or whatever it may be, or will we have a voice in relation to the actual money we subscribe?</P>
    <P>This is an eminently desirable Bill. It is probably the only way, at the beginning, of dealing with the extraordinary situation in which the world finds itself.  The Minister for Finance should have given us some idea of the mechanics or the implementation of the Bill, so that we may know where the money is going.</P>
    <P>The Bill says that legal responsibility rests only with the countries in which this Association has an office. I gather that these offices will be situated in the lesser-developed countries. Is it intended that Ireland will have an office belonging to the Association? Is it conceivably possible that we may have an office here and that quite a considerable amount of the fund will be expended in this country? Therefore, we may feel not only that we are playing our part in an international organisation but are getting our due reward for joining the Association and taking on the responsibility that everything it is possible for us to manufacture or produce in the agricultural or industrial sphere will be used for the great purposes which lie behind this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to how the subscription was determined.  Deputy Sweetman spoke of sending a representative of the Department of Finance over to negotiate on the Bretton Woods Agreement.  At that time, our subscription to the World Bank was based on a number of considerations: population, national income, trade, etc. Ours has not been altered since but others have.  The World Bank came along with its subsidiary organisation, <Col N="402" /> as it were.  They fixed a subscription on the same basis as the subscriptions were fixed in the first instance for the World Bank.  They were negotiating in the first instance on a composite basis&mdash;world trade, national income, population, and so on.  Ours at that time was fixed on a certain basis for the World Bank and now this subsidiary of the World Bank is based again on the same proportion. Our subscription in this case will bear the same proportion to the whole as in the case of the World Bank.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy asked about membership. Membership is open to every member of the World Bank.  Nobody who is not in the World Bank can be a member, but, of course, as we are all aware, any country can apply for permission to join the World Bank and in that way can become a member of this organisation also.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat criticised for not giving more information with regard to the Articles of the Agreement.  The first eight paragraphs of the Schedule deal with the Articles of the Agreement and some information at least is given.  As a matter of fact, some of the questions put by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Esmonde are answered in Paragraph 5 of the explanatory memorandum, so that we did not altogether ignore these Articles in supplying this explanatory memorandum.</P>

I was also asked, either by Deputy Norton or Deputy Esmonde, who was going to determine on the particular applications for loans and the terms under which they will be issued.  The procedure is laid down again in the Articles of the Agreement fairly plainly in Article VI.  We have a certain voting power&mdash;I think our votes would add up to 1,106.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of a total of?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of a total of 234,000, which represents about half of the total vote.  Of course, the subscription is more or less in the same proportion. In fact, I should say that we get a little more.  The lower subscription gets a little better representation than the subscription warrants.  Everybody gets 500 votes.  In addition to that, it is proportionate to the subscription.  It is obvious that the small subscribers have a little more in proportion to their subscriptions than the bigger. The voting rights are used to elect the executive directors and the executive directors then manage the bank much the same as the directors of any other bank.  They consider the applications and they may reject or grant them and will determine, in negotiation, on what terms the loan will be made so that the ordinary representative of this country, let us say, on the board of the bank on which everybody is deals only with very general questions.  These representatives would, of course, elect the executive directors but they deal only with very general questions&mdash;perhaps taking a new line in development or something of that kind&mdash;and would not deal at all with individual applicants.</P>

      <P>We would have to take the first step ourselves and make application.  At the moment I personally cannot see that we shall be making an application to this organisation. Some particular project might crop up, however, for which we would like to get finance&mdash;a project that would appear to be particularly suitable for this form of financing and a Government might decide to make an application.  I do not see at the moment that we shall be making an application.  If we do make an application, then the board of directors will first of all determine whether the project is worthy of consideration from their point of view and whether the country needed it under the general scheme of the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand, therefore, that the question of our classification as a developed or less developed country would arise only if we decided to make an application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; as far as that goes, the Deputy is correct.  There is another point, however, with which I was about to deal, that is, that we are in the second category of countries in making our subscription.  We subscribe ten per cent. in gold or convertible currency and 90 per cent. in our own currency. We may, however, be called upon to convert some of the 90 per cent. into convertible currency and then we shall have to consider whether we shall do so or not.  I could not answer the question whether the board of directors in that case would apply the same percentage all round or would take individuals and say: &ldquo;You are a little better off and could afford to give us a little more&rdquo;.  It will be open to us either to agree or disagree when we are asked to do that.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, we subscribe at ten per cent. over four years and the other half over four years&mdash;roughly £100,000.  That will be in gold or in convertible currency.  The remainder will be held by the Central Bank.  It will be non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes held by the Central Bank.  It does not cost this country anything unless we are called upon to convert them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say, with great respect to the person who occupies the position of Attorney General, that the views of the Attorney General have been more than once upset by the Supreme Court and it would be disastrous if the Solicitors Bill were to be upset for a second time in that Court. We are told that the general purpose of the Bill is to improve what public opinion thinks of the solicitors' profession but, if that profession and the leader of the Bar are to be found twice wrong in a decade, any confidence the public might have in the legal profession would be very gravely impaired.</P>
      <P>We find it very hard to understand the reason behind the reluctance of some people to allow an appeal to the Supreme Court.  I would say that the number of cases in which such an appeal would be allowed would be very, very few indeed.  In most cases when a solicitor is struck off the roll the reasons for that action will be very clear and not open to question but, if there are cases where there are doubts about the legality of what occurs, there ought to be an appeal.  I believe that if you do not provide for right of appeal&mdash;which will be used in very few cases&mdash;you are weakening the whole case.  You are running the risk of upsetting the matter again and, as Deputy Sweetman said, on your head be it, and it will not be for want of warning from these benches.</P>

      <P>If I understood Deputy Ryan correctly I think he used the words &ldquo;the legality of which will be in some doubt,&rdquo; and we are giving an appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law.  The point is that on matters of fact there will be no appeal to the Supreme Court.  Does Deputy Ryan realise that?  There will be an appeal on points of law.</P>

      <P>I do, and I should not have used the word &ldquo;legality.&rdquo;  If you like, I shall use the word &ldquo;propriety&rdquo; in relation to a solicitor's conduct, but I cannot understand why you limit it to the question of the legality of any decision.  I appreciate that that might be interpreted by the Supreme Court as referring to anything which would cause a man to be struck off the roll.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why you do not want to provide this right of appeal to the Supreme Court.  Is it felt that it would be used unnecessarily?  I think the history of cases of this nature in the past indicates that there have been only two appeals to the Supreme Court in all the years in which solicitors have had that right.  It is very dangerous to take that right away now and I cannot see the desirability of doing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>First of all, I should like to make it clear that if Section 12 is found to be unconstitutional, that will not be any reflection on the solicitors' profession.  We must take the full responsibility for this provision.  With regard to the question of constitutionality generally, we can only take the best advice we can get and proceed on that basis.  We must take all reasonable precautions, and, having done that, I think we are entitled to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan asked why we would not allow a full appeal to the Supreme Court in every case.  It is fairly likely if that appeal were allowed that every solicitor struck off would be inclined to go to the Supreme Court.  To be struck off the roll is a very serious matter for a solicitor and I imagine he would be certainly inclined to go to the uttermost limit before giving in.  If that were so, and if every case were to be reheard as to the facts in the Supreme Court, it would be almost equivalent to making a nullity out of <Col N="410" /> this Bill.  There would be no point at all in having the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society and having the procedure we have set out in the Bill. It would eventually amount to the fact that every case would be fully reheard in the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>In giving the appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law we are being completely fair.  Indeed I think we could put up a very strong case for giving no appeal at all to the Supreme Court, but, rather than have any accusations of unfairness levelled against us, we are giving this appeal on a point of law to the Supreme Court. By any reasonable standards it is a fair proposal.  If Deputy Ryan asks why we do not give the full appeal, I answer that he should not forget that in all these cases the money with which the solicitor would be fighting an appeal to the Supreme Court would probably be clients' money.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where the Society take possession of documents produced or delivered under a requirement under this section&mdash;</P>

    <P>This amendment is to assist the Law Society.  The effect of the amendment will be that where papers on a particular <Col N="411" /> matter in a solicitor's office are grouped together as, for instance, on a file, the notice giving particulars of the documents received from the solicitor need only refer to the group and the matter to which it relates.  The amendment is designed to save the Society the labour of having to give particulars of every single document on a file.

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), line 20, to delete &ldquo;1962&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1963&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for my amendment is twofold. On the Second Stage the Parliamentary Secretary said this was a Bill introduced at the request of the solicitors' profession but what in fact is not known is that the solicitors' profession, as a body, has never been given an opportunity of considering this Bill.  It is the Council of the Law Society, by agreement with the representatives of the Department of Justice and of the Minister, who have introduced this Bill.</P>
      <P>Since this Bill has come before the House, I, for one, have received representations from several solicitors protesting about some of the items in the Bill and particularly about the fact that their views on the Bill were never sought.  On that account, it is undesirable that this House should, without warning, say to the general body of the solicitors' profession some time in December or thereabouts: &ldquo;Before you are going to practise as a solicitor next year you will have to fork out £20 to the Compensation Fund.&rdquo;  It is a form of taxation on which the profession as a body has not yet had an opportunity of speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most undesirable that that type of penalty should be imposed on any profession.  I wonder what this House would say if it were announced that a vet., an accountant or a doctor could not practise his profession until he paid an additional annual levy of this amount and if he were given only one month in which to produce this money?  I appreciate that, as far as the majority of adult solicitors are concerned, it is merely a postponement of some other pleasure in order <Col N="414" /> to have the use of the £20 for the Compensation Fund, but there are plenty of struggling solicitors throughout the length and breadth of the country who find it hard enough to make ends meet without having this imposition on them in the middle of December when all domestic expenses are inclined to be high and when all the various bills and tax demands on the 1st January are due.  It is most unfair, and there are many members of the profession who think it unfair.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of avoiding responsibility for making compensation to people who have suffered at the hands of dishonest solicitors.  I think it is an unfair burden which arises to some extent because of the fact that the Law Society were afraid to use some of the funds which they had under the 1954 Act.  Some of the difficulties arose because of the collapse of the 1954 Act.  Another year should be given in this case.  I appreciate that apart from this there was to be a levy of £10 beginning next January.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extra £10 and not £20.  I appreciate that this will be a burden on certain solicitors. We all understand that, but I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will alleviate that burden in some of the ways which I indicated to him on Second Reading.  It is up to the solicitors, even at the expense of its costing them something extra, for the sake of the confidence of the public to put their own house in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with Deputy Sweetman and I appreciate the attitude which he has taken up on the Second Stage and again to-day.  Whatever about the amount of the subscription being £20, there is no case for putting it back for one year as is intended under this amendment.  If saving £10 a year will make all that difference to a solicitor or a firm of solicitors, the probability is that they should not be in business anyway.  I should like Deputy Ryan to understand that the Fund is bankrupt at the moment.  There are people with claims against the Fund who are waiting <Col N="415" /> to be paid and it was intended that by now these people should be entitled to compensation in full.  Does Deputy Ryan want the Fund to remain bankrupt for another year or would he prefer that it be put on a business basis as soon as possible?</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the argument that the Council of the Law Society does not represent the profession.  It would be inconceivable that there would be acceptance of that argument. The Council of the Law Society is elected by the members of the profession and the solicitors' profession is probably one of the best vocationally organised professions we have.  The Council is entitled to speak with absolute authority for the members of the profession who elect them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well. Sir.  I appreciate that the Council is elected by the general body of the profession but there are some solicitors who are not members of the Law Society.  I have not a great deal of sympathy with those but I agree that, in the main, the Council of the Law Society is elected by the members of the profession. It has to be understood, however, that one has very little chance of being elected unless one is a solicitor of standing, long established and of mature years.  I say with great respect that many of these men have forgotten the years of struggle which they experienced as young solicitors.</P>
      <P>It is hard enough for a young solicitor to set up on his own without having a levy of £20 imposed on him. In the main, solicitors when they qualify, unless they are sons or other relatives of established solicitors, go into another office as assistants.  The wages they get are not equal, in many instances, to those of law clerks or typists.  There are some firms who will pay this subscription for such young men but there are some who will not and these assistants, who are not themselves handling clients' money, will have to pay it out of their own pockets.  It is not the money of their own clients that they are handling and in all cases they would not be signing cheques or having any dealings with the money of clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it unfair that such people should have to pay this sum of £20 towards a compensation fund.  Being solicitors, they should have to pay something and I think the figure of £5 would be sufficient for such young solicitors to pay.  The period of three years is far too short.  It means that a solicitor, when he is 24 years of age, would have to pay £20, as the majority of them qualify at the age of 21 or 22. The time should be five years from the date on which he started to practice on his own, that is, five years from the date on which he starts to handle the money of his own clients. I do not think that we should levy £20 on these young men.  You may say that it would be unfair to give <Col N="417" /> them this five years at £5 per annum if they were handling client's money. I am trying to be practical and I can say that a solicitor frequently has to wait for many months, and sometimes for years, before he gets in his costs. It is not in all cases that you can get costs immediately.  There are many poor people who have genuine claims at law which they have not the money to finance.  Very many solicitors advance outlay to contest these cases.</P>
    <P>If we had a system of free legal aid, the burden on solicitors would not be as great as it is but, with the costs of litigation and other costs of running an office as they are, solicitors very frequently have to lay out very large sums of money before they get a penny.  On that account, I think we are not being unreasonable in suggesting that we allow at least five years from the day a man starts practising on his own.  If we add this last straw to the camel's back I am afraid that some young solicitors may use clients' money to pay this £20 levy to the Compensation Fund.  That would be a rather Gilbertian situation.  Most solicitors who have gone wrong have done so by starting in a small way and then trying to make it up later but like gamblers the good thing never turns up and they get in deeper and deeper.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he is not prepared to give me an affirmative answer at this stage he should take up the matter with the Council of the Law Society.  I might say in passing that the views I am expressing are my own views and those of a few solicitors who approached me in the last few days and who were not aware of this provision until very recently.  I believe no harm will come of it if we allow some further time to permit young members of the profession to get themselves established in practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the merits of the amendment itself, I should like to point out, in the first place, that this suggestion that young solicitors be given a concession emanated from our side and not from the Council of the Law Society.  In the circumstances, it represents a pretty fair compromise.  One could argue that a young solicitor starting off should be in a position to meet all the obligations which any colleague in the profession has to meet.  On the other hand, we should all like to give encouragement to the younger members of the profession and help them to some extent.  It is simply a question of where to draw the line.  I think to give the reduced subscription of £5 for a period of three years is pretty fair in all the circumstances when one bears in mind that it is their colleagues who will have to make up the discount we are giving them.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second amendment of Deputy Ryan, amendment 11, I am afraid I cannot accept that amendment either because it would lead to some anomalies.  The position could arise where a solicitor would qualify, take up a position outside the profession for perhaps 10 years and &mdash; if Deputy Ryan's amendment were accepted&mdash;come back and start practising at the end of that time and be entitled to claim this concession.  We intend the concession to apply only to young solicitors immediately after qualifying, and I do not think there is any case to be made for applying it in other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You might also have this anomalous situation.  Take the case of a solicitor, again if Deputy Ryan's amendment were accepted, who works as a solicitor in the office of another solicitor for more than the three-year period and <Col N="420" /> becomes liable for the full subscription of £20 a year and then subsequently decides to practise on his own.  That solicitor would then revert to the £5 a year subscription.  Such a situation would be ridiculous and unfair and, as Deputy Ryan's amendment would have that result, I must ask the House to reject it.</P>
    <P>May I say in relation to all this that I feel very strongly inclined to the same view as the present President of the Law Society who, in a recent address, urged on young solicitors the desirability of pondering well before they went into practice on their own?  He pointed out to them that in existing circumstances a fair amount of backing and a fair amount of capital are required for practice, and he urged them, if at all possible, to try to join some existing well-established firm of solicitors and to be absolutely sure of their ground and of adequate resources before venturing into practice on their own.  That was very sound advice. Neither the President of the Law Society nor I, myself, would like to discourage completely any young solicitor from starting on his own.  If he does consider starting on his own, he should, I feel, consider it well beforehand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan should not come along and say that young solicitors are entitled to start on their own and entitled to be trusted and that one need not worry about their becoming honourable and reputable members of the profession if, at the same time, he argues that they would not be in a position to meet this requirement of £20 a year towards the Compensation Fund after three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself taking exception in one way to what the Parliamentary Secretary says.  If we want the solicitors' profession to be a snob profession, a profession for the sons of solicitors, then there is nothing to be said for these ideas which suggest that a lesser man who may not come from a long line of solicitors or from a family of substance can be an honest solicitor.  It is all wrong to try to turn the solicitors' profession into the preserve of the well-to-do who have big capital.  I believe it is quite possible for men to be good and honest solicitors and yet to be unable to bear without some pain this unnecessary expense which is being imposed upon them.  Incidentally, may I say in passing that the Parliamentary Secretary is taking my two amendments as being two separate ideas?  When I asked leave to discuss them together I emphasised that they were one and the same idea. Under the Bill, the position of a man who is an assistant in a firm and is not handling his own accounts or clients' money would be that, after a period of three years from qualification, he would have to pay £20, even if he continued as an assistant.  That is most unfair.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has wrongly interpreted my remarks.  My two amendments provide that a man who remains an assistant all his life will not have to pay into the compensation fund any more than £5 per annum, but if he becomes a solicitor on his own account, he will pay £5 per year for the first five years and thereafter will have to pay £20 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the necessity for solicitors having some resources.  As I said earlier, I emphasise that they have to expend a considerable amount of money before they get anything back in costs.  In fact, a solicitor has to have some considerable machinery and overhead expenditure in order to furnish his bill of costs at all long before being paid.  He has to maintain costs drawers and typists.  Other people can sell goods or services, and there <Col N="422" /> and then present bills or accounts and demand prompt payment, but a solicitor has to expend years of energy and brainwork on one case and after completion must expend an amount of money to draw up a bill of costs. Those costs may be taxed and he may not get them in full or a considerable time may elapse before he is paid.  I appreciate that he must have some resources but I think it would be undesirable if this House should for any reason at all endorse the notion that the solicitors' profession must be reserved for the well-to-do sons of existing solicitors, and that one cannot be a good or an honest solicitor unless one is in a long established firm. Honesty is something ingrained in a person.</P>
    <P>I believe that if an examination were made into the reason why some solicitors went wrong, in many cases it would be found that it was not a question of their being poor or finding it hard to make ends meet, but that they had been living beyond their means, which is an entirely different thing.  It would not be desirable for us to over-emphasise what the Parliamentary Secretary has said and what successive Presidents of the Law Council have said.  I appreciate the wisdom of it, but I should hate it to be accepted as being so true that no other opinion could be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to appeal to Deputy Ryan on this point and to ask him to face the realities of the situation.  He is arguing the case of a young solicitor starting off in practice and he wants to suggest to me that we should be concerned about such a young solicitor who, after a period of three years, would not be in a position to meet, out of his resources and fees, a charge which amounts to less than 8/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it has to be paid at one time.  That is the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If a young solicitor decides to go into practice at all, and to face up to all the expenses a practice involves, and even the delay in receiving costs to which Deputy Ryan referred, surely it is foolishness to suggest that&mdash;if he is ever to be solvent&mdash;<Col N="423" /> he will not be in a position to bear this charge after three years.  By the way, I hope it may not be very long before the Law Society are able to reduce this subscription of £20 a year.</P>
      <P>The situation we are dealing with at the moment is, therefore, an unusual and, I trust, a unique one.  The fund at the moment has accumulated liabilities and it is unable to meet those liabilities.  We are trying to put that situation right.  The solicitors' profession honourably and manfully, as Deputy Sweetman pointed out here, have faced up to that situation and have taken on their shoulders the obligations proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>We have made a concession to young solicitors.  We think it is a valuable concession, and I think it is a bit unreal of Deputy Ryan to argue, as he is arguing, that we should extend this concession from three years to five years.  As I said, it is a question of holding the scales evenly between the young solicitors and their older colleagues. I think our proposal is a good one.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (4) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) At any time in any practice year, being&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) the practice year next following that at the end of which, for the first time, the total amount standing to the credit of the Fund (including the value of all investments forming part of the Fund but after deducting all outstanding liabilities) is more than £25,000 or</P>
      <P>(ii) any subsequent practice year,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the Society may, if they think fit, determine that every solicitor taking out a practising certificate in respect of the next following practice year (not being a certificate issued to him within the period of <Col N="424" /> three years beginning on the day of his admission) shall pay to the Society, as the annual contribution payable under subsection (2) of this section in the case of that year, such amount greater or less than twenty pounds as the Society may fix.</P>
    <P>(b) In exercising the powers conferred by the foregoing paragraph, the Society shall have regard to the principle of maintaining the total amount standing to the credit of the Fund (including the value of all investments forming part of the Fund but after deducting all outstanding liabilities) at £25,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to clarify the purposes of subsection (4) of Section 22.  The contribution is to remain at £20 until a reserve of £25,000 has been built up.  Thereafter the Society may, for any year, reduce the contribution but in so doing they must have regard to the principle of keeping the reserve at £25,000.  Similarly, if the question of increasing the contribution arises.  As we visualise it, the normal contribution will be not more than £20, unless circumstances justify an increase. However, the Society's powers to increase are limited by the fact that they must have regard to the amount of the reserve.  If they wish to keep the contribution at £20 and build up a more substantial reserve than £25,000, there will be nothing to prevent them doing so.  Reducing or increasing the contribution is a matter for the Society, subject to this.  Any decision involving reduction or increase in the contribution must be arrived at having regard to the £25,000 reserve.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that the Bill envisages an annual accountant's certificate side by side with a compulsory compensation scheme.  As I stated in my speech on Second Stage, one of the objects of the accountant's certificate is to protect the Compensation Fund.</P>

      <P>To-morrow.  Might I put one matter to the Parliamentary Secretary?  As I understood him, the provisions of Section 32 do not come into force where a bankruptcy takes place before the passage of the Act, where the death of the solicitor takes place before the passage of the Act, where the primary decree for administration has not been made.  I should like him to consider, between now and Report Stage, whether it might not be better that these provisions should come into effect in the case where a solicitor may be dead and where a primary order for administration has <Col N="430" /> not yet been made.  The Parliamentary Secretary may be aware that the primary order for administration is the equivalent of the order for bankruptcy in the case of a person who is still alive.  The administration operates in the case of a person who is dead. If this section be not included, the amount of difficulty in ascertaining priorities is fierce.  It is a very good section from that point of view.  If it can be done without going into retrospective and retroactive legislation, it might be worth considering it.</P>

There must be some principle governing the increase. Whether or not it is sufficient I shall not argue now.  However, there must be some principle by which the figure was arrived at.  I agree to the increase but it is a peculiar line of action on the part of the Minister that he increases this pension by seven and a half per cent. and the military service pension by five per cent.</P>

In the general Pensions Bill the Minister for Finance brings in there is a similar case to that of this lady and the two ladies dealt with in the next Bill.  It was decided that that case should rank for the seven and a half per cent. increase rather than the five per cent. increase.  That set the headline for these other ladies and they also have been given a seven and a half per cent. increase.  However, it was definitely provided in the Budget statement that the increase in military service pensions would be five per cent.  This is not a military service pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The objects of the Bill are mainly fourfold.  In the first place it is designed to provide a general and uniform legislative procedure governing borrowing by local authorities.  Secondly, it proposes to improve the land acquisition powers of local authorities for certain purposes. Thirdly, it will clarify the position in relation to land acquisition and borrowing by a local authority where the one proposal covers a number of purposes, as, for example, the provision of office accommodation. And lastly, it will enable county councils to increase their contributions to the County Councils General Council, should they desire to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part I of the Bill contains the usual provisions for citation, interpretation, and the laying of regulations before the Oireachtas.  The definition of &ldquo;appropriate Minister&rdquo; has been drafted with the intention that control of borrowing, lending or compulsory land acquisition will be exercised by the Minister dealing with the matter to which the particular transaction relates. Borrowing by most local authorities is at present controlled by the Minister for Local Government: the major exception is borrowing by health authorities, which is subject to the approval of the Minister for Health.  The Bill proposes to disperse this control to some extent but the dispersal <Col N="436" /> is perhaps more apparent than real, since very few loans are raised for purposes for which other Ministers are responsible.  It will, however, make for better administration if the Minister responsible for the service for which the loan is needed is also the sanctioning authority for the loan.</P>
    <P>A difficulty arises in relation to what may be called mixed projects, that is, proposals involving more than one Minister.  An example is a building designed to accommodate a county council and its various staffs &mdash;roads, housing, sanitary services, health, public assistance, and so on. The Bill contains certain provisions to overcome the legal problems created by such a proposal, but the immediate question of which Minister should be the responsible authority for land acquisition and loan for such a project is dealt with by Section 2.  The general aim is that the Minister with the greater or greatest interest should be the appropriate Minister, and this aim is embodied in paragraph (b).  It is felt, however, that this simple rule may give rise to difficulties in certain cases, and I shall introduce an amendment on the Committee Stage to clarify the position further.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill proposes to substitute a few simple statutory provisions relating to borrowing and lending for the numerous, various and complex enactments, spread over more than sixty statutes, dealing with this aspect of local authorities functions.  It is also proposed to remove the remaining statutory limitations on borrowing, in the realisation that the effective control of local indebtedness must be exercised by Ministers in the light of national economic and social policies.  Statutory limits have never proved either effective or useful, and have already been discarded for a wide range of services.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the making of general regulations relating to borrowing. It also introduces a number of new provisions which should prove of value.  Among these may be mentioned the power to de-control certain borrowings by Ministerial directions. <Col N="437" /> Local authorities are also being empowered to borrow on behalf of other local authorities.  Contributions towards loan charges which is the form taken by Exchequer assistance to local authority housing and some other services, may moreover, under the Bill, be paid direct by the Department concerned to the lenders.  Since the lenders are in the majority of cases the Commissioners of Public Works, this provision should enable a greatly simplified procedure to be introduced in the transactions at present affecting the repayment of loans and the subsidising of such repayments.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains provisions relating to land acquisition, office premises, and the County Councils General Council.</P>
    <P>As regards land acquisition, there are at present two main procedures governing the compulsory purchase of land by local authorities.  Land required for housing, health, public assistance, and mental hospitals purposes may be secured by means of a compulsory purchase or compulsory acquisition order made by the local authority concerned, and confirmed by the appropriate Minister.  This procedure superseded for the purposes mentioned the older provisional order procedure which involved a petition, to the Minister asking him to make a provisional order, the holding of an inquiry, the making of a provisional order, further objections by interested parties, and then confirmation of his own order by the Minister.  This older procedure still applies to the acquisition of land for roads, sanitary services and certain other purposes.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to standardise for the purposes mentioned the compulsory purchase order procedure operated under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  It is clearly desirable that a uniform code of land acquisition procedure should be available for all local authorities, for most, if not all, of their powers and duties. With that in mind Section 10 of the Bill can be regarded as merely an interim measure.  It is necessary, however, for several reasons to introduce it now rather than await the preparation of more comprehensive proposals.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the urgency, <Col N="438" /> I may say, is the anxiety of Dublin Corporation to get ahead with their civic offices project.  Section 11 of the Bill also has a bearing on this matter: it will clarify the position in relation to land acquisition for office purposes. The next section although expressed in general terms is related primarily to the land acquisition portion of the Bill, in that one of the principal matters ancillary to an agreement between local authorities may be the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is intended to rectify something of an anomaly in relation to the General Council of County Councils.  This body is, as Deputies are aware, supported by annual contributions from member county councils. The upper limit to contributions, fixed at £10 in 1902 was raised to £20 in 1925 and has remained at this figure through all the vicissitudes of the intervening years.  It is high time that the limit was readjusted, and this the Bill proposes to do.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate from what I have said that the Bill is almost wholly procedural or technical; it is concerned with the machinery rather than the substance of local government. Its aim is to improve that machinery, and in the belief that it will facilitate local authorities in the discharge of their business, I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with a number of matters which, to some degree, are unrelated and from that point of view, it would be better to discuss them on Committee Stage. Speaking generally, however, at first sight, it does appear that a criticism could be made of it in that, in Part II, it does certain things by Ministerial regulation which should more properly be done by legislation.  This House has always been, and rightly so, very jealous of any attempt to carry through by regulation matters which are more properly in the realms of legislation and that is a matter one would have to consider in relation to the individual sections, and what is visualised in them, on Committee Stage rather than now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly intrigued by Section 9.  I do not know whether I have <Col N="439" /> correctly understood that section, but, if I have, my interpretation of it is that it is a slovenly way of avoiding the repeal of the other powers which a local authority has for borrowing and lending money.  If there are no other powers which have not been repealed by this Bill, then there would be no reason for the section and it seems to me that, as it is framed, it is tantamount to saying: &ldquo;No matter what there is in any other Act, it is not to operate any more.&rdquo;  Therefore, the proper, tidy, and correct way of dealing with that situation would have been to repeal the other Acts empowering the borrowing and the lending of money.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, new that housing authorities or local authorities should have power to acquire land for the purposes of office buildings and other purposes, just as if they were acquiring it for the purposes of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, and I should have liked the Minister to have given some more elaborate indication as to what the difference in the two will be.  Perhaps, however, he has deferred pointing out that difference to the Committee Stage, but I am inclined to think that, in many instances, there has been far too ready an acceptance by local authorities of proposals put forward by their executive officers for new local authority buildings.</P>
    <P>It is natural that executive officers should always prefer to work in new offices because it would save them a lot of trouble, but a balance must be struck between the saving of trouble, on the one hand, and the creation of efficiency, on the other, recollecting the impact on the rates of the cost of the new buildings.  I am all for an expenditure if, in fact, that expenditure will mean so much greater efficiency that the additional money that has to be collected by way of rates for the cost of any civic buildings, be they in Dublin Corporation area, Cork Corporation area or any county council area, will produce a worthwhile and adequate return by way of a saving on the rates in other directions due to efficiency and better <Col N="440" /> work.  However, I am afraid that tendency has not been towards that.</P>
    <P>I fear there has been some indication of what one might almost describe as megalomania, that people feel they are not carrying out their job worthily unless they are carrying it out in large, extravagant offices which carry prestige.  If you like, it is another symptom of what we know as Parkinson's Law, and it is a symptom of Parkinson's Law which must be resisted.  The sole test in relation to expenditure on new buildings for a local authority should not be whether it will mean more prestige for the local authority or for those who are working in it, but whether, with new buildings, the business of the authority can be carried out so much more efficiently that there will be a saving equivalent to the expenditure on such buildings by way of interest and sinking fund.</P>
    <P>We would all agree with the Minister that the contribution for the General Council of County Councils was fixed at a time when money had an entirely different value from what it has to-day and, therefore, it is desirable to bring that contribution up to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the Bill itself, which, of course, I and, I am sure, all my colleagues of all Parties in Dublin Corporation welcome, I should like to deal briefly with the remarks made by Deputy Sweetman. It might appear, particularly in connection with Dublin, that there is some foundation for the suggestions he has put forward.  First of all, I should like to tell him that it is not a decision of the executives of the Dublin Corporation. A decision was made a long time ago that we should have proper and adequate offices for the administration of the affairs of the City of Dublin.  That decision was taken by the Council, and was taken in the first instance by the committees concerned with this particular branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Sweetman knows that besides the City Hall and buildings adjacent to it, the Dublin Corporation administers its affairs in 26 separate premises scattered all over the city.  One has only to look at the motor registration office <Col N="441" /> in Kildare Street to find out the inadequacy of that office and the congestion it causes in the heart of the city when the annual or quarterly registrations have to be made by the owners of motor cars.  One has to be a member of the Corporation to see that it is difficult to achieve efficiency under present circumstances.  We have offices in Mountjoy Square and offices adjacent to the City Hall.  On occasion you send for officials from one place to come to another and shortly after you have concluded the business and they are on their way back you have to send for them to come back again with consequent loss of time, efficiency and transport expenses.</P>
    <P>The building we occupy as our City Hall is worthy of a visit.  I think Councillor Sherwin will agree with me that the facilities for members and officials are out-dated.  If these facilities were the only facilities available to the workers in ordinary undertakings, they would long since have been condemned as inadequate, inefficient and unhealthy.  We have lady members of the Dublin Council for whom we have no toilet conveniences. We have a kind of partial convenience for the 45 members.  These are the conditions under which we are working. Our officials in all the offices are working under the most horrible conditions, and were we not the authority to enforce the condemnation of unsuitable premises, somebody else would have condemned our buildings a long time ago.</P>
    <P>The Deputy talked about the ultimate cost on the rates, and more or less suggested that the desire to have a proper place, where efficiency could be developed and where healthy conditions could exist, resulted from megalomania.  We have examined this matter with great care over a long period of years.  We know it will cost money and that the capital expenditure will have to be borrowed and repaid. We know the approximate impact this venture will have on the rates.  We are quite prepared to face that before the ratepayers.  We also know we shall be able to redeem some of the cost of this building by the sale of premises we shall be able to <Col N="442" /> vacate.  Therefore, we shall get some contribution towards the capital cost, the exact amount of which is now being ascertained.</P>
    <P>As I said before, we welcome the Bill wholeheartedly.  It is some years since we made a decision to build civic offices.  When we reached the stage of taking a decision, we found we had not the powers to enable us to proceed.  In 1955 our law agent pointed out to us that we had not power to borrow the amount of money required nor had we power, under the compulsory acquisition Acts, to acquire that part of the site which is not in our possession.  However, the site chosen covers a good deal of what we want.  Therefore, we were glad when the Minister for Local Government promised us the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few suggestions to the Minister which might obviate the necessity of bringing in amendments for the Committee Stage. The City Manager and those of us concerned with the Bill examined it when we got it and sought the advice of our capable and able law agent.  He sent us certain suggested amendments which are not controversial but which may possibly save us problems in the future.  I understand the Department has had a letter more or less indicating the amendments suggested by the law agent and we shall only refer to them in brief.</P>
    <P>In Section 10, Part III, there is need for an amendment from the point of view of syntax.  At the end of paragraph (a) the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; should appear as it appears in other places. It has been suggested, and we agree, that in subsection (2) of Section 10, paragraph (a), there should be a definition of &ldquo;offices,&rdquo; a definition such as exists in Section 10 of the Local Government Act, 1898.  &ldquo;Offices&rdquo; has a definition there which would enable us to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>Again, Section 10, subsection (4), paragraph (b) refers to the provisions of certain sections of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.  It starts off with Section 30 and then suggests the next in sequence is Section 45.  We feel that Section 42, which <Col N="443" /> would enable the local authority to have the necessary powers to enter a site for survey or inspection, should be included.  Otherwise we would probably be kept out of the site until we acquired it.</P>
    <P>Finally, subsection (6), a very brief subsection, says:</P>
    <P>An order made by virtue of this section may extinguish any public right of way over the land to which it relates.</P>
    <P>We feel that is giving a local authority too much power.  We feel that such authorisation should only be given with the right of appeal to the Minister for Local Government by any person affected by our attempt to extinguish the public rights.  We feel that there might be some little safeguard included in this subsection.</P>
    <P>We are very happy about this Bill. We have been expecting it for some time.  We are anxious to have adequate offices from which the affairs of the city can be properly administered and to have all our officials in one building rather than have them scattered all over the city, giving rise to all kinds of problems.</P>
    <P>We feel that apart from all this it will add to the efficiency of the Corporation's operations.  The cost may be about one penny in the £ on the rates.  That is subject to further examination but it is something that, taken it all in all, will bring about a remedy for a situation that has been a sore point for so long.  We find these things out only as we meet them. When we come to cross bridges we find obstacles.  We found these obstacles; we made our case to the Local Government Department and they have given us this Bill which will enable us to proceed with all speed.</P>
    <P>The building of offices of this kind at this time will give not inconsiderable employment to numbers of our people for whom it is hoped to find permanent employment.  I want, on behalf of Dublin Corporation, to express our thanks to the Minister for the speed with which the Bill has been put before us and I hope that the Department <Col N="444" /> will incorporate the suggestions I have made in it so that we can avoid introducing amendments to make these alterations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Briscoe.  To some extent I would say that part, at least, of this Bill is his baby because he has been interested in the proposal for a long time.  These proposals have been under consideration since early in the century.  Plans for such offices were drawn up as far back as 1903 and there is such a draft plan at present in the City Hall.  We could never quite make up our minds to go on with this until Deputy Briscoe gave the matter a few pushes and now we have this Bill to bring into existence this fantasy of 50 years ago.</P>
      <P>There is need for this Bill and for these offices but we had no power to build them under existing legislation. Corporation Offices are spread all over the city.  Deputy Sweetman has mentioned the cost to the ratepayers but it must be remembered that the Corporation, if they get these offices, will have 26 premises to dispose of. In other words, when we think of the cost of these new offices, we should remember that that cost could be reduced by as much as one-third by the sale of the various offices in the possession of the Corporation throughout the city.</P>
      <P>I am acquainted with one aspect of Corporation activity and that is housing.  As a member of the Housing Committee I know that we are dealing with very large numbers of tenants every week of the year.  There are at present over 40,000 Corporation dwellings and soon there will be 50,000.  Within the next six or seven years half the population of Dublin will be housed in Corporation dwellings, so Deputies can see the amount of activity that will have to be carried on in these offices.  The Corporation will control half the tenants of the city and these people will require some place to go for information about their rents and rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want to force people to run from one end of the city to another; we would like to have all our offices dealing with housing on <Col N="445" /> the one floor.  That will mean a considerable saving eventually on the rates.  It will wipe out the duplication of staffs, the waste of transport and of officials' time.  Apart from all that, the buildings we possess have no amenities.  Many of them have no lifts.  People have to leave their children in prams on narrow footpaths or on the public streets.</P>
    <P>I see people regularly in Lord Edward Street about housing and I have to meet them on the street.  I actually have to hold meetings on the public street because there is nowhere else I can speak to them.  The present offices have no waiting rooms for tenants.  There is a little cubicle where tenants go to apply for houses and there is always a queue so that in inclement weather these people have to face all the hardships of wettings while they are waiting on the open streets, so there is every need for big offices with amenities to cope with half the tenants of the city.</P>
    <P>The corporation deal with everybody, not merely tenants.  We all know of the queues at the registration offices in Kildare Street on certain days.  There are certain points which will arise on Committee Stage but that will be another day's work.  There is the question of this word &ldquo;office&rdquo;.  We may wish to do something else with a certain part of these premises and we might be told in court that it is not an office.  Up to now, we have had power under the Housing Acts to acquire property for housing purposes and we could say that we would be ready to build at a particular site in six to nine months' time, but for other purposes we have no power.</P>
    <P>For the past five or six years, the plans of the corporation for the widening of Church Street have been held up.  Church Street is a narrow street and, at certain points, very narrow.  Several people have been killed there within the past couple of years.  It is only a year since an elderly woman was killed in it and only 18 months since a boy was killed there.  If one car is passing out another, it must go into the channel <Col N="446" /> to do so.  Most traffic moves on the centre of the road but not in Church Street.  If anybody steps into the channel when one car is passing out another, it is just too bad for him. There is an absolute need for widening Church Street and apart from that, there are hundreds of old dwellings there, many of them inhabited. The Corporation do not want to demolish them all and they are awaiting a vital decision.</P>
    <P>This Bill will enable local authorities to get possession of sites and, therefore, we can hope that there will be nothing to hold up the widening of Church Street and the demolition of the slums.  All over the city, there are sites about which we can do nothing and which are holding up progress.  Unless a site is wanted specifically for housing, we cannot acquire it compulsorily.  If the owners refuse to deal with us, everything is held up for years.  This Bill gives us the necessary power and therefore I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>A Bill such as the one under discussion must be welcomed by all who have the interests of the city and county at heart.  As a Dublin Deputy, I have no hesitation in supporting a measure designed to help the Dublin Corporation in its task of providing amenities and services worthy of our capital city.  Much has been done by that body, and the people responsible are to be complimented on the success which has attended their efforts to clean up the debris of centuries, but much remains to be done. There are still many unsightly derelict sites in and around the city which are a sad reflection on our civic pride. They should be cleaned up with the least possible delay.  If the Dublin Corporation take advantage of their power to borrow money under this Bill, there should be no lack of capital. A local authority no less than the central Government should be able to take advantage of the prevailing confidence and may rest assured that a request for a substantial borrowing will meet with a ready response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the Dublin Corporation over the years has become more <Col N="447" /> extensive, varied and complex From time to time, they have found it necessary to take over offices and buildings in various parts of the city.  I believe that some of the corporation's employees are actually working in condemned dwellings throughout the city.  I submit that this city-wide dispersal of the corporation's departments, set up to deal with the ever-increasing volume of work, has led to a wastage and a delay in making decisions on the day to day work of the officials of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>For this reason, the section authorising a local authority to acquire property which they believe would be suitable for the provision of offices satisfies a long-felt need.  In Dublin, we need a central municipal building in which the manifold activities of the corporation can be co-ordinated and centralised, where the permanent officials can be constantly in touch with one another and so given an opportunity to deal efficiently and more speedily with the various problems as they arise.  As a concession to those who might worry about the cost of providing such a building, I would say that efficiency in the long run is economy.</P>
    <P>A citizen of any city is proud of his city's buildings.  Beautiful buildings, the products of brains no less than brawn, can be solid and permanent and symbols of a citizen's affection and pride.  The city of Dublin could be and should be second to none in architectural beauty.  We possess all that is necessary.  We have the artists, the designers, the architects, the craftsmen and the workers of all sorts, and by the terms of this Bill, we are empowered to raise the money.  All that is necessary is the will to do it and the desire to do it well.  It should be remembered also that the building of central municipal offices would provide work for many men for a long time and the wages drawn by the workers would add to the prosperity of the city.</P>
    <P>I should like to take the opportunity of paying tribute to the various officials of the Dublin Corporation. <Col N="448" /> It is sometimes difficult to please all the people all the time but the corporation officials have always shown themselves anxious and willing to bring all problems, individual and municipal, to a successful conclusion. Any measure designed to help them to perform their various duties more speedily and more efficiently is welcome. It is generally agreed that the housing problem is nearing solution but there are still areas in the city which are badly in need of development. There are sites already owned by the corporation on which it is intended to build blocks of flats but the work has had to be postponed because the sites are too small.  All that is necessary to bring these sites to the required size is the acquisition of some small properties surrounding them.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, there is a need for the speeding up of compulsory purchase orders.  Admittedly, the law's long delay is our democratic safeguard of the citizen's right to own and to hold property, but allowing for that, I believe that the time between the taking of a decision to develop a site and the date when actual building commences could be shortened to the benefit of all concerned.  I believe that this Bill is a valuable contribution to efficient local administration and should be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in common with other Deputies.  Listening to the debate so far, one might assume that the Bill applies only to Dublin City and that Dublin City is the only local authority suffering from lack of accommodation for its staff but I am sure the Minister is aware that the City of Limerick is also suffering seriously from a lack of accommodation for its staff.  The present Town Hall occupied by the city council officials was vacated by the Chamber of Commerce about 100 years ago. That should give some indication to Deputies of the lack of accommodation in Limerick City.  Furthermore, in order to squeeze some additional accommodation into the building it was found necessary some years ago to cut the council chamber in half, <Col N="449" /> thereby destroying a very beautiful room.  Unfortunately, there was no other solution at the time.</P>
      <P>Despite the tendency of successive Governments to centralise more and more jurisdiction in Dublin, there is no doubt that the work of local authorities is increasing rapidly each year and that, although we must view the cost with some concern and have regard to the rights of taxpayers and ratepayers, in years to come the work of local authorities will continue to grow rather than diminish.  Having regard to that, I think we would be less than wise if we did not take the necessary precautions and powers to give local authorities an opportunity of acquiring land whether for building offices, for widening narrow streets or, as the Bill suggests, for closing rights of way.</P>
      <P>No doubt, after this legislation is passed and before any municipal building can be done in the country several years will have elapsed and by that time we shall have seen the near ending of the present housing problem.  It is therefore likely that, coincidental with the operation of the powers of this Bill, there will be an end of the housing problem and an opportunity will be given to local authorities to go ahead with other types of building, particularly for local authority staffs.</P>
      <P>I should like to put one question to the Minister in regard to Section 10, subsection (6), which reads: &ldquo;An Order made by virtue of this section may extinguish any public right of way over the land to which it relates.&rdquo; I should like to ask the Minister, if he has time to deal with it when replying, to say if that means that, if such an Order is made, the residents using such a right of way would have no right of appeal from the Order or does such an Order require the sanction of the Minister before it is made effective? It strikes me that there may be very small rights involved but I think some regard should be had to those rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few observations I want to make on this Bill.  I agree with what Deputy Briscoe said and I think the Minister <Col N="450" /> is to be congratulated on introducing the Bill.  However, in this matter I think the horse was put partly behind the cart.  We know that for years back, particularly in Dublin, the lack of office accommodation or adequate accommodation for the Corporation staff and council members has been a great grievance.  The furthest back that I read about it was when Abercrombie recommended that these offices should be built in Parliament Street but, of course, there would be some very costly acquisition involved for that site and it was not proceeded with.  There was also some suggestion that the offices should be in Dublin Castle.  I think that was probably the best suggestion but, at any rate, it was decided to develop on the present site at Wood Quay.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation prepared plans and prepared a beautiful plaster model, a photo of which I have at home.  These are very admirable plans, but a great deal of money was spent preparing to erect offices on a site where the Corporation had absolutely no power to acquire some of the property necessary to go ahead with the building of the offices.  If the Minister had taken an unrealistic view, that money would have been sheer waste and it is a great advance that this power is given to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we must never permit the compulsory powers given to local authorities to get out of hand.  In the case of old houses, for instance, where the owner discovers a roof is leaking and he decides that he had better put some copper on it and repair the roof so that the whole building will not deteriorate, he goes to the Corporation. They tell him that the building will be the subject of a compulsory purchase order or that they are going to acquire it for rehousing the working classes and that they cannot sanction any expenditure on it because they in turn, would have to pay greater compensation and they could not accept that position.  From the time the Corporation decide that the building will be included in one of the sites that they are to develop until the time they actually acquire the site, the buildings are generally deteriorating <Col N="451" /> to such an extent that it can be said that the landlord, as a result of Corporation action, has not got a fair return for his property.</P>
    <P>I shall develop that a little further. I know of three sites in the city, but I shall not refer to them specifically.  In two of these the Corporation notified the owners that they intended to acquire the property in five or six years' time.  In one instance the man concerned was letting the property and was to get £1,000 goodwill as well as an annual rent for it.  He was told that the compulsory purchase order was so near completion that it was more or less made and that it was only a matter for the Minister to sanction it.  That was five or six years ago and the property has not yet been acquired.  I now hear that the local authority is considering excluding this property from the compulsory purchase order.</P>
    <P>To my mind that man has been very unjustly treated in that he has been denied the right to sell his property, the right to develop it.  I believe that once an owner has been given notice that the Corporation intend to acquire the property some schedule or agreement should be worked out, either by arbitration or otherwise, and some price fixed, even though the property may not be required for five years.  Some schedule of payments should be worked out so that a man may get some return for his property from the date of the notice of acquisition.</P>
    <P>I realise that if Dublin Corporation were to say that they would pay compensation for all the buildings which they envisage acquiring, for all the industries they expect to close down under their 40 years plan, the cost would be fabulous and something that neither the State nor the local authority would be prepared to pay immediately.  Yet, if a man is prevented from either selling or developing his property, to my mind when that decision is made an agreement should be entered into quickly, setting out how that property will be paid for, even though it may not be required for a number of years.  I <Col N="452" /> see the Corporation's position.  I understand that if the Corporation say that they require a certain site for housing in their second planned period, after eight years, or that they are to build a block of flats or reserve the site for industrial development and that the houses must be taken down, possibly someone may come along and build a very costly hotel on that site and the Corporation will be faced with a jump in compensation of from £5,000 to £100,000 if they acquire the site.  I see that point.  I am not offering a solution of that problem to the Minister. I am just suggesting that it is a problem which is definitely worth considering.  We have several functions here, and one of them is to endeavour so far as we possibly can to see that justice is done to all sections of the community.  As I said, a case where a man is prevented from developing property and five or six years later, is told that his property is not required, should not arise.  Once a decision is taken to acquire property, that decision should be adhered to.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other matter in relation to this Bill to which I wish to refer, except to mention briefly again the amendments which Deputy Briscoe has suggested should be made.  I believe the definition of &ldquo;office&rdquo; should be very carefully considered. It was evident to the members of the previous council that it is quite likely that any order to acquire certain property may be contested in the courts.  I know of a business that was established about 150 years ago, and their main argument is that they cannot find suitable alternative premises and that no compensation would pay them.  Bearing that in mind, the Minister would be well advised to consider the suggestions made by the law agent of Dublin Corporation, because it is quite possible that the validity of the corporation's compulsory purchase orders in respect of some of these properties will be contested in the High Court, and perhaps even in the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister again, and to assure Deputy Sweetman that the Dublin citizens and <Col N="453" /> ratepayers will definitely get a worthwhile return for the investment in these buildings.  Members of the previous council and the present council realise the shocking position which exists and I am quite sure they are all happy that the Minister has decided to take these steps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief indeed in dealing with this Bill.  One of the things that struck me is this question of legislation by regulation. That is something I have spoken of many times and it is something to which I object.  If we are to legislate, let us legislate and know what we are doing.  By giving the Minister power to make regulations, we are just giving him a sort of blank cheque, which is something I abhor.  However, I am afraid that I, too, was guilty of acting in like manner on many occasions.  We should try to get away from it, if possible, now.</P>
      <P>I welcome the section which standardises the compulsory acquisition of land.  That is a good thing. The position was rather archaic as it was before.  There is one matter to which I should like to refer in relation to these compulsory purchase orders. Before a local authority decide to apply for a c.p.o., they consult the Department.  The Department are made fully aware of the reasons why the local authority, the county council or other council, wish to acquire certain land.  The Department are aware of the facts from the point of view of the local authority.  There may be an objection to the compulsory purchase order for very valid reasons which may be advanced as to why certain land should not be compulsorily acquired.  An inquiry is held and who presides over it?  An official of the Minister.  It may possibly be the man who recommended the sanction to the Minister for the compulsory acquisition of the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is very unfair.  Some person in a quasi-judicial capacity should preside over these inquiries&mdash;a district justice, a circuit court judge or someone completely impartial.  After all, it cannot be argued that one of the Minister's officials, perhaps even the man who sanctioned the preliminary order <Col N="454" /> for the compulsory acquisition should preside.  If we were to examine the files of the Department, I think we would find that in 96 per cent. of the cases, the local authority was upheld and the compulsory purchase order was made.  The Minister should look into this question and see if we could have some impartial judge presiding on occasions such as the making of compulsory purchase orders.</P>
    <P>I am glad indeed that the Minister has introduced Section 13 which enables local authorities to increase their contributions to the General Council of County Councils.  At the moment that contribution is inadequate. There is another matter I should like the Minister to have a look at. What useful purpose does the General Council of County Councils serve?  I do not think it serves any useful purpose at all.  I am a member but I had the opportunity of attending very few meetings so far.  It serves no purpose whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I intend to be brief.  There are some departures in this Bill which are very welcome.  Section 4 facilitates borrowing by local authorities. I should like to ask the Minister is he satisfied with the conditions in county councils down the country?  I shall not speak of the one here in Dublin because I know nothing of it. There are many county councils who have already borrowed quite a sufficient amount of money.  I think that giving them further powers of borrowing is not an improvement.  I speak for my own county council in Mayo. We have already borrowed and have responsibility for repaying about £1½ million.  Does the Minister realise that the time has come when it is very doubtful having regard to the way agricultural prices in particular are going, if it will be possible to have the rates collected in future?  I think that giving the county councils the increased power to borrow which Section 4 provides, is a step in the wrong direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see, the time is fast approaching when the ordinary ratepayer who will be called on to repay loans borrowed under this section will no longer be able to meet these commitments.  There is an outcry about rates in every county.  They are a burden the ratepayers can no longer meet.  The Minister promised to give some relief on farm buildings but, so far, we have not heard anything about that.  It is very doubtful if more borrowing by local authorities is morally justifiable.  It may be legally justifiable. Mayo County Council has already borrowed £1,500,000.  Other county councils have borrowed up to £2,500,000.  The cost of servicing that borrowing in Mayo is £500,000.  That will be a continuing debt for 50 years. <Col N="456" /> Some loans run for shorter periods, 25 or 30 years.  It is time the Minister woke up to the burden on the ratepayers. The flight from the land is contributed to largely by the incidence of rates, among other things.  The income of the farmer is falling rapidly. The cost of everything he buys is rising.  While I favour some sections in this Bill&mdash;that dealing with compulsory acquisition, for example&mdash;I am absolutely opposed to Section 4. The aim should be to relieve the ratepayers of some of the burden imposed on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, with Deputy Briscoe, to compliment the Minister on this measure, particularly in relation to Dublin.  I sincerely hope the powers will be sweeping enough. We might take a lesson from our friends across the water.  They may decide to plan and build a new town; they do not take into consideration absentee landlords or any of the other factors which tend to delay projects here.  They take sweeping powers to enable them to carry their plans into execution.</P>
      <P>If this Bill were introduced solely for the purpose of enabling new municipal buildings to be erected in Dublin it would be a worthwhile measure.  I invite the Minister, or his inspectors, to visit the premises in Cork Hill and Exchange Buildings in Castle Street. There are three levels on one floor. It is a tenement converted into offices, a breeding place for tuberculosis.  It is a veritable fire trap.  The conditions under which the officials of the Dublin Corporation are trying to run the affairs of the city are truly appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Blowick, I hope that borrowing will grow easier.  In 12 years an area extending from O'Connell Bridge to Butt Bridge and Talbot Street will revert to the Dublin Corporation.  I am not in a position even to hazard a guess as to what that will mean.  Apart from municipal offices, Dublin is sadly in need of a proper residence for its Lord Mayor. It puts one to shame when one goes abroad and sees the offices and residences provided in cities which are not even capital cities.  I have always been one of a minority in thinking minorities are right, but I hold that <Col N="457" /> even a right of way should not militate against advancement, when advancement is for the common good. The common good should be the governing factor.  At the moment an individual may hold up a worthwhile project on purely mercenary grounds. That is something which militates against the enhancement of our city. and spoils the architecture of it.  The Custom House is world famous.  We should be able to erect municipal offices which would become equally famous.  I was on a visit to Manchester recently.  I saw what they have done there.  Looking at it, one shudders when one thinks of Dublin.</P>

      <P>In common with other Deputies, I welcome this measure particularly with regard to the removal of those difficulties with which local authorities have hitherto found themselves faced in their efforts to develop urban areas.  Reference has been made to Dublin City.  Many cogent examples can be given of the problems which have existed for many years in Dublin.  Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act it has been relatively easy for local authorities to get land for building houses.  In many cases, comprehensive plans to develop areas in our city in a sane and reasonable way were held up because of prolonged, confusing and difficult legislation.  I have in mind also the steps it was necessary to take in order to get possession of ground, say, for road-building or other purposes.</P>
      <P>One incident in recent years that springs to my mind is of plans for two modern blocks of flats in the Cork Street area.  The project was postponed indefinitely because fronting on Cork Street were a number of premises not directly affected by the proposed housing development but directly affected by proposed road development.  Because it would require from two to three years to acquire them under the legislation and the rules for the acquisition of ground for this purpose, the plans for the blocks of flats had to be postponed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers are entitled to credit where credit is due.  The Minister is <Col N="458" /> to be congratulated on dealing with a problem that should have been dealt with at least 20 years ago.  I fail to understand why it has taken from at least 1946 to the present day to introduce reasonable legislation along these lines.  A succession of Ministers have occupied the position of Minister for Local Government and it has taken the present Minister to introduce this legislation.  In the capital city and in cities and towns throughout the country local authorities wishing to provide for the needs of their people were handicapped by archaic legislation.  Therefore, this Bill is welcome.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Deputy who said that by putting land acquisition in front of the section enabling a local authority to acquire property for office accommodation we are putting the cart before the horse.  There has been a need in Dublin and no doubt in many cities and towns for adequate office accommodation for efficient administration by local authorities. While the problem has, indeed, been difficult it has not been as difficult or as serious as this other problem we have faced for a good many years.</P>
    <P>The provisions which make it possible for a local authority to acquire land for offices for its staff are generally welcome.  Deputy Carroll mentioned conditions in the offices of the Dublin Corporation.  I trust the city medical officer of health and other responsible officers of the Dublin Corporation will read his contribution to this debate.  If our staffs are working in conditions short of those laid down in recent legislation then the officials of the Corporation would seem to have failed to observe various public health enactments.</P>
    <P>The fact that various Departments are scattered throughout the city in unsuitable buildings makes administration uneconomic.  With suitable accommodation, administrative, technical and other staffs of the Corporation&mdash;as with county councils and other authorities&mdash;should be in a position to provide a more efficient and economic service to the ratepayers and the citizens.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe will correct me if I <Col N="459" /> am wrong.  The City Hall which provides accommodation for administrative or other staff of the Dublin Corporation was designed 40 or 50 years ago.</P>

      <P>Fifty-five years ago.  I am proud to represent a constituency of Dublin City in this House as I am sure other Dublin Deputies take pride in representing their constituencies. Our city contains examples of some of the finest architecture.  The building which the Minister for Local Government adorns with his presence, the Custom House, is reckoned an outstanding example of architecture.  We have the Four Courts, the General Post Office, and other beautiful buildings. If Dublin is to be provided with offices for central administration the buildings should be worthy of our city.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, because of the urgent necessity of dealing with the problem of office accommodation, I felt it might be met by a simple type of office structure.  Having regard to what has happened in the meantime and to the difficulties and delays, I now feel that if this legislation makes it possible to provide a centre for Dublin's local administration it should represent, architecturally and otherwise, the capital of Ireland so far as its local authority is concerned.</P>
      <P>I want to express my agreement, which very seldom happens, with the Deputy from Donegal who has just spoken, when he made reference to the General Council of County Councils. I do not know why it exists.  I do not know what purpose it serves.  I do not know who gives it instructions.  I do not know if the members of a large county council or corporation, except those who happen from time to time to be elected as representatives, have any idea of what appears on the agenda of that body.  I do not know whether the bodies that send representatives to the General Council of County Councils give them any instructions, advice or guidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my observation of the matter, it appears that representatives to that <Col N="460" /> body may express there the views of their political Party or their own views as individuals but I do not recollect any occasion on which resolutions that were submitted by corporations or county councils were forwarded for inclusion on the agenda of the General Council of County Councils and were circulated for revision and decision.</P>
    <P>Any other deliberative body that meets in council usually has something to discuss, usually has a resolution or proposal from its constituent members. I do not know whether or not that is the case with the General Council of County Councils.  It appears to me that it has two or three functions: It elects a chairman; there is a speech by the Minister for Local Government of the day; there is a lunch.  Then the respective members of the body return to their local authorities.  They make no report and give no indication as to what was discussed.  They might as well have never attended the meeting.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is Press publicity but if it is necessary to have a statement issued by a number of members of various local authorities I do not think it should be done according to the system now adopted.  I have to speak on this matter from my personal experience.  There may be a different approach in county councils.  My experience is that members of local authorities have no idea of what their representatives will say.  What their representatives say at the meeting may be contrary to the views and expressed opinions of the majority of the members of the county council concerned but nothing can be done about it at that stage except that the county council or urban council may put down a motion of censure of their representative and send somebody else next time.</P>
    <P>The Bill generally is welcome.  It is particularly welcome in this city because it will enable the local authority to deal with problems of housing and the acquisition of land for roads and other purposes in a much speedier and more efficient way.</P>
    <P>It may not be pertinent to the Bill but I should like to take this opportunity <Col N="461" /> to put one question to the Minister and he may be good enough to answer when he is concluding: When can we have his decision on the Dublin Town Plan submitted to his Department as far back as 1956?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I associate myself fully with the sentiments expressed by other speakers from the Fine Gael Benches.  I take special exception to Section 3 of this Bill. Legislation by Order and regulation is a most undesirable type of legislation. In recent years the Department of Local Government and other Departments have concentrated on the making of regulations.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Bill provides for the placing on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas of regulations made thereunder.  Under Section 3, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either House the regulation shall be annulled accordingly. It would be much better, where the Minister for Local Government has to take serious action in relation to local authorities, that it should be done by legislation rather than by regulation.  I suggest that the Minister for Local Government and all Ministers should consider the possibility of departing from the practice of making Orders such as are provided for in Section 3 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Deputy who suggested that there must be some curbing of the amount of borrowing by local authorities.  In many counties a very substantial part of the amount of money levied on the ratepayers is being paid as bank interest.  The Minister for Local Government may have a table of the amounts paid annually by local authorities to the banks by way of interest on loans obtained for development purposes, housing, water and sewerage schemes and county buildings over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always believed that a law should be passed by this House whereby the lending authorities, that is, the banks, should lend money to local authorities at a very nominal rate of interest.  Where local authorities have to apply to the banks for <Col N="462" /> loans for housing or other development a burden is imposed on the ratepayers.  In the case of housing the loan charges are reflected in increased rents.  Since the establishment of the State, legislation should have been passed whereby banks and those responsible would be compelled to see that local authorities were provided with very cheap money for development purposes.</P>
    <P>An alarming amount of money is being collected annually from the ratepayers.  It is hard-earned money which could be used by local authorities for further development work instead of being paid out in exorbitant interest charges.  The Minister and the House are well aware that local authorities have no other means of obtaining money for development purposes than by borrowing it and the lending rates ought to be more reasonable. Now that this Bill is going through the House, a very good opportunity is presented for reviewing the whole question of the financing of local authorities by the banks.  It is a matter which calls for discussion at a high level between the Government and those who finance local authorities.</P>
    <P>Every local authority requires more money for development purposes such as those mentioned by the Deputies representing Dublin City, for instance, housing.  Every county council in Ireland would require further borrowing powers in relation to housing, sewerage and other schemes.  Reference has been made to a number of buildings in the city of Dublin.  The officers of the Department of Local Government know quite well that the county buildings in most of our counties, with the exception of a very few, can be looked upon as out-of-date and unsuitable for the various county council staffs.  At the last meeting of the Laoighis County Council it was found that something like £45,000 would be required for county buildings. The county buildings all over this country, the county libraries, again with the exception of a very few, the offices of the county medical officer of health, the local offices for the registration of births, marriages <Col N="463" /> and deaths and the various other offices for which the local authority is responsible, including a number of courthouses, are in urgent need of attention.  Some of these courthouses for which the various county councils are responsible are in such a state of collapse that those responsible for administering the law are refusing to sit in them.</P>
    <P>If the necessary powers are vested in local authorities and if moneys are made available at rates of interest which local authorities can pay, very useful work giving a great deal of employment which is urgently required could be done.  Much work could be done on housing, on roads, including county roads, mountain roads, culs-de-sac, and on the complete reconstruction of probably most of the paths in every town in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Work also remains to be done on the erection of danger signs convenient to schools, the erection of suitable safety barriers at the entrance to schools so as to prevent children rushing out to the centre of the road and becoming involved in serious and, in many cases, fatal accidents.  While this Bill is probably a step in the right direction in seeing that local authorities will be given the right to borrow more, the borrowing rate, so far as banks are concerned, ought to be more generous and special rates should be provided for local authorities.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question in regard to Section 5 which provides:</P>
    <P>(1) A local authority may, subject to the sanction of the appropriate Minister, lend money, on such terms as to repayment and other matters as they consider proper, to another local authority.</P>
    <P>I presume that means that a county council may lend to a local authority within that county area, such as an urban council or a town commission within the county area.  In the case of the repayment of that loan, would, the repayment of it be a charge on the local town rate or the local urban rate or would it be a charge on the <Col N="464" /> county rate?  I trust the Minister will make reference to that when he is replying.</P>
    <P>With regard to compulsory powers, I think that in many cases those powers are necessary.  From my own experience as a member of a local authority for the past 20 years I know that very useful work can be held up because of some absentee landlord, for instance, in connection with title or some other matter on which a decision may be necessary before the local authority can proceed to build or carry out other development work.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy O'Donnell and I do so as a member of a local authority with a certain amount of experience particularly in this regard in another capacity.  In the case of arbitration, it should be carried out by someone other than an officer of the Department of Local Government. May I say that in the past they have always acted in a very reasonable and fair manner but there might be more confidence in those arbitration boards particularly in the case of appeals against compulsory acquisition if, for example, a district justice or a circuit court judge presided for the taking of evidence and the hearing of arguments as to whether the compulsory purchase order ought to be made?</P>

      <P>There is something to be said for Deputy Briscoe's argument and there is also something to be said for my argument.  A more impartial report might be submitted to the Minister from somebody other than an officer of his own Department.  I am sure Deputy Briscoe cannot find any fault with that.  The officer of the Minister's Department conducts his inquiry, hears the evidence and submits his report to his own Minister. I do not know of any cases in which reports submitted to them by those inspectors were unfavourable.  I do not know of anybody who was victimised by those compulsory acquisition orders.</P>

      <P>I make the suggestion in the full knowledge that the interested parties might have more confidence in those inquiries if there was somebody of a more impartial character presiding over them than an officer of the Minister's Department. I think this section dealing with the extension of compulsory acquisition under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts is long overdue.  I am glad to see that some form of legislation has been introduced to deal with the matter because the manner in which local authorities were held up in the past has been most unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I want to make reference to a section which I hope will be deleted from this Bill.  I hope that some Party in the House will take the necessary action to see that on the future Stages of this Bill an amendment <Col N="466" /> will be tabled to delete Section 13.  If this Bill has any merit at all, Section 13 takes from it.  It is stated in that section that the council of a county may, subject to such limits as may be fixed from time to time by the Minister for Local Government, make annual contributions to the funds of the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    <P>Do we not all know that the General Council of County Councils is a notorious farce?  I am surprised that legislation in this House should be belittled by the reference to the General Council of County Councils. The General Council of County Councils, as set up, is comprised of the leading Fianna Fáil hacks in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Ask them what is their function.  It is to praise and applaud the Minister for Local Government and reinforce every argument the Minister for Local Government may make.  They go a little further.  They can make a nomination to the Nominating Bodies for the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Larkin made a proper reference to the General Council of County Councils.  I do not know who those gentlemen are. I do not know very much about them.  I am not a member of that body but I do know that there are a number of members of the county council of which I am a member on the General Council of County Councils.  I never heard of their being given any instructions.  I never get a report as to what they are doing and I never see the agenda.  If county councils are to contribute in any way towards the General Council of County Councils each member of a local authority represented on the General Council of County Councils should be furnished with a balance sheet giving full details of all the income and expenditure of the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why it is mentioned in Section 13 of this Bill that local authorities may contribute and that the Minister may determine the amount of the contribution from time to time.  The General Council of County Councils is looked upon <Col N="467" /> with very grave suspicion.  Their conduct is not very creditable.  I have never yet known the General Council of County Councils to criticise a Fianna Fáil Minister.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows quite well that three-fourths of the members of the General Council of County Councils are picked by Fianna Fáil councils throughout the country and that they are given their instructions from Fianna Fáil headquarters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If the Minister intends to arrange in this Bill for the General Council of County Councils to obtain funds from a county council, I think there should be an arrangement whereby the General Council of County Councils would circulate to all the members of the county councils full details of their expenditure and income so that members of a local authority may see where their contributions are going.</P>
      <P>I should much prefer to see no reference whatever to the General Council of County Councils because no county council has confidence in them.  The General Council of County Councils is a body which has no statutory powers beyond nominating a person for the Seanad or beyond praising the Minister for Local Government and, as I say, they are in all probability an excessive charge on their own local authorities because I understand there is a very generous scale of expenses paid to the members of the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a body which does not serve any useful purpose.  Could the Minister give us his opinion now as to what are the advantages of the General Council of County Councils?  Do they advise him on matters relating to <Col N="468" /> Local Government?  If so, what recommendations or what advice has he obtained from the General Council of County Councils over the past three years?  What recommendations did they make and what recommendations did he accept?  When we have reference to such a body as the General Council of County Councils, the Minister ought to come into this House equipped with all the information desired and required by Deputies in this regard.</P>
    <P>I feel that we have not heard the end in this House in regard to the section.  Whatever merits this Bill may have&mdash;it has some merits I can assure the House and the Minister, merits which Deputies from all Parties appreciate&mdash;I feel that the reference to the General Council of County Councils has taken the good out of the Bill.  I hope and trust that he will take the necessary steps to have that section removed from the Bill.  I have viewed the work of the General Council of County Councils for a while from the sideline and as Deputy Larkin pointed out&mdash;and I thoroughly agree with him&mdash;there is no such thing as a general line of procedure, decided upon by county councils, submitted to the representatives on that council.  I do not know how often they meet or what their procedure is, but I do know that it is looked upon throughout the country as a laughingstock and a farce, as a means of providing a holiday for three or four members of a county council to go up at the ratepayers' expense.  It is not taken seriously.  The section to which I refer should be removed from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the giving of compulsory powers to local authorities.  In a free democracy such as this I do not like the word &ldquo;compulsion.&rdquo;  It is a pity we must have such compulsory powers.  It is quite understandable that local authorities who find themselves handicapped, because of the impossibility of getting sites for the extension of out-offices or other purposes, or taking over land for development, are up against that problem and will aim to get that work done because they have that promise <Col N="469" /> gressive idea and find themselves ready to seek and get compulsory powers.</P>
      <P>I think persuasion is far better than compulsion.  There are times when whatever compulsory powers are given to local authorities under this measure will be used with restraint and in a judicial way, not in a ruthless way or a way that would cause irritations.  If legislation in that form is going to be enacted, we shall have much confusion, resentment and difficulty.  It is quite understandable that compulsory powers in many cases are necessary to deal with the many derelict sites in the cities, towns and the countryside generally. The local authorities would, perhaps, like to have powers in order to see that title is available under which they could take over some of the sites and demolish them, do away with them, or provide other buildings on these eyesores.</P>
      <P>It is quite true, as many Deputies said tonight, that the responsibilities of local authorities have increased enormously in recent years.  I have a great regard for members of local authorities.  They take on themselves a tremendous responsibility, a responsibility which is not appreciated and one for which there is no requital whatsoever.  They have almost a whole-time job and that fact is not appreciated. Many members of this House are also members of local authorities. Maybe they are ready to fall into line with this Bill because they feel privileged in being members of local authorities and are ready to accept the powers given by this Bill for further borrowing.  However, let us bear in mind that the indebtedness of local authorities is something in the neighbourhood of £155,000,000 to £160,000,000 and, immediately this Bill passes into law, the tendency will be to increase that indebtedness and the only way to liquidate it&mdash;if it ever comes to be liquidated&mdash;will be to increase rates when already there is a justifiable outcry against increased rates year after year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rates are fixed every year.  They are unpredictable from the very start and people live in fear, trembling, doubt and confusion as to what their commitments will be for <Col N="470" /> the following year when their current rates are cleared, and this Bill will cause more uneasiness for them because borrowing done under it is to be financed to some extent by the rates they pay.  I should like the Minister to give us information as to what amount of money is necessary each year in order to pay for the servicing of present local indebtedness. What amount comes from Government grants and Government loans and what amount from the rates?  I ask that because I believe this information is necessary if we are to create confidence in the provisions of the Bill, and we are at least entitled to know these facts before we pass legislation in any sort of hurried fashion.  If we get that information, we shall know where we stand.  We shall know if we are to add further to our local indebtedness and eventually to our national indebtedness. Where will this all end? When the day of reckoning comes will we be able to survive the shock we will get?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The general tone of this debate has been one of welcome for the provisions of the Bill.  However, there were a few hares raised at a very early stage, which have since been chased very arduously by some of the members opposite, and I should say at the outset that it would appear to me the said hares were raised for the good reason that the Bill was not read by the people who raised them, and those who came after those speakers assumed that what had gone before was correct and followed on the same lines.  The three Deputies who slammed Part II of the Bill, on the basis that it was objectionable because regulations were replacing legislation, obviously did not read very far down in Section 4 and, in fact, did not go so far as to find out exactly what the regulations prescribed in the Bill are to be about, and what will be their effect in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that the regulations which were so much condemned by Deputy Sweetman, in the first instance, Deputy O'Donnell quickly thereafter, and later Deputy O.J. Flanagan, are <Col N="471" /> regulations that may be made by the Minister for Local Government, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, in relation to borrowing by local authorities, and in particular, they make reference to the sources of loans, the periods of repayment of loans, charging of and security for loans, and in the case of mortgages, the form thereof, the registers to be kept in relation thereto, the transfer thereof and the form of such transfers and the appointment and powers of receivers.  They are not regulations to which Deputies can possibly take exception because they are regulations which, from reading the actual terms of the Bill, indicate that they deal with things which can change from time to time and which are much better dealt with by regulations from time to time, as circumstances change, than by strict legislation which, in turn, will go out of date and have to be amended.</P>
    <P>The other angle of approach adopted by a number of Deputies, mainly from the Opposition, has been that we are creating further hazards for the ratepayers by creating further borrowing incentives and powers.  In fact it has been suggested that this Bill will impose on local authorities the necessity and the obligation of borrowing further moneys at the ratepayers' expense, with no question whatever as to whether that money is needed for a useful purpose.  Listening to some of these Deputies, one would think that members of local authorities were some sort of maniacs who wanted to see what difficulties and sacrifices they could impose on the ratepayers in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>These are purely permissive powers and, unless the local authorities want the money which these borrowing facilities will give to them, and unless they go through the procedure of making a request to the appropriate Minister, no such borrowing will take place and no such charge will therefore arise.  If it is the case that they do need these moneys, that the purposes for which they are required are good and creditworthy purposes and that they are for projects which are required by the community as a whole <Col N="472" /> and for which the community as a whole is able to pay, then there is the procedure laid down in this Bill which will facilitate the local authorities in attaining that end, the end for which they primarily have been instituted as local authorities and representatives of the people, of giving to people in their areas the various facilities such as roads, houses, water and sewerage schemes and all the amenities which our people require, regardless of the part of the country in which they reside.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy Sweetman at an early stage was that he was afraid executive officers in various local authorities would lead their local authorities into commitments for palatial office buildings which are not really required and which the community could not really afford.  Let us again realise that in regard to any such building project, or any other building, for that matter, a county manager may make the proposal, he may lay the plans, but, in the last analysis, the money which must be raised in order to pay for that building by way of loan must be approved by the elected representatives on the council and, subsequent to that approval, be sanctioned by the appropriate Minister, whether the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Health or whoever he may be.</P>
    <P>Where is the necessity for fear?  Is it that Deputy Sweetman does not regard the elected members of any local authority as sufficiently intelligent, sufficiently strong minded, to resist the squandermania of some manager who wants to build offices merely for the sake of having a better place in which to work, in which to put his staff, and to talk of with pride whenever he leaves his county?  Surely that type of comment is ridiculous on a matter such as this and does not help our discussions here which should be directed towards making a good Bill better, if that can be done?</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell has doubts about rights of way and the extinguishing of rights of way as referred to in subsection (6) of Section 10.  This is a matter to which Deputy Briscoe also <Col N="473" /> referred.  The proper reading of that subsection (6) is that it is the Minister who will make the order.  It will apply only to rights of way through lands which have already been acquired and are actually in the possession, of the local authority.  Deputy Briscoe has suggested that we might amend this to read that the Minister for Local Government may make the order authorising a local authority to extinguish rights of way on property already acquired.  I do not see anything wrong with that suggestion at this stage.  If it is a worthwhile addition I shall give it every consideration and probably bring in an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not think the fears expressed by Deputy Russell are real because, this concerns the extinguishing of rights of way on land already acquired under the compulsory acquisition procedure and on which, presumably, some buildings or other are about to be erected.  It is a matter for the Minister subsequent to the acquisition of these lands, to extinguish by order the rights of way on land already acquired for building purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but doubts have been expressed in regard to its effectiveness. We are merely bringing this into line with the new form of procedure we are suggesting in substitution for the old form.  I should say that the power of local authorities to extinguish rights is in fact limited to housing purposes only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blowick and several other Deputies made the case that local authorities have already borrowed far too much and there was a danger that the powers granted in this Bill in relation to borrowing would mean greater borrowing in the future.  I take it that borrowing, whether under the new provisions or the old, has been resorted to only when it was in the interests of the community and the merits of the proposal warranted borrowing, from whatever source it came.  I take it that the same approach will be adopted by <Col N="474" /> local authorities in the future.  It is because of my belief in the sound judgment of local authorities that I deplore any reflection on their integrity and intelligence by anybody in this House.  That attack was entirely misplaced and it was followed up by an attack on the General Council of County Councils through Section 13 of this Bill.  I can excuse those Deputies who have spoken and who are not members of local authorities but it was inexcusable for Deputies who have been members of local authorities for a considerable time to refer to the General Council of County Councils in the manner in which they did and to use this section as an excuse for an attack on that body. To say the least, I believe it was a breach of etiquette.  Deputy O.J. Flanagan described them here, but nobody pays too much attention to his exaggerated use of words or the limits to which he can go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

      <P>I am sure the members of his own Party, who have participated in this body for a long number of years, will be very interested to learn that the General Council is &ldquo;composed of Fianna Fáil hacks&rdquo; and that their only purpose is &ldquo;to praise the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government.&rdquo;  They will be surprised to learn that 75 per cent. of the members of this body are Fianna Fáil.  But, as I say, this kind of statement coming from Deputy O. J. Flanagan could be overlooked but we would expect a little more restraint from other Deputies when describing their opposite numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We begin to wonder whether all this has anything to do with another function of the General Council, that is, to provide members of the Seanad.  Has it anything to do with the fact that in the recent Seanad election, the General Council did not provide a member for the Fine Gael Party?  Would that have anything to do with the sudden outburst from the Fine Gael benches against the members of this body? Every county council in Ireland is represented on this body by members <Col N="475" /> selected annually.  As Deputy O.J. Flanagan well knows, there is not a Fianna Fáil majority on every county council in Ireland.  How then can he describe those chosen by councils on which there is not a Fianna Fáil majority as Fianna Fáil political hacks?  When his own council was sending members to the General Council, why did he not express his opposition as forcibly as he has to-night; nor did we hear him raise Cain in his local council chamber about the provision of the £20 subscription which is all that can be provided for the General Council funds at the moment?  Why has he hidden his views all these years?  Why has he remained so silent until he got this opportunity of riding this hobby horse in the House to-night?  The Deputy should be ashamed of himself, but I suppose that is too much to expect.</P>

      <P>The Deputy makes the usual circus effort of trying to ride two horses at one time.  While circus acrobats may be able to do this and provide entertainment, the Deputy falls between both horses on every occasion he tries.  We have him making the case that interest charges were too high, that we have borrowed too much and that the banks must be compelled to supply capital to local authorities at a reduced rate.  Then, thinking, I suppose, of the harm that might be done the country if this were applied in the way it should be applied, that there would be no more borrowing and no more money except on Deputy O. J. Flanagan's monetary reform terms and that this would mean no more houses, no more water schemes, no more sewerage schemes and no more of the bog roads the Deputy talked about and, thinking of the effect this might have on his political welfare in the not too distant future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we go, there will be no contradictions like that to be read out to us and the Deputy should remember that they will be read out to him.  He has contributed much to this debate in words but very little in sense.  He has abused men who are revered members of our community and people who are political colleagues of his own, who belong to his own Party.  I think Deputy Flanagan will live to regret that attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell, when Minister for Local Government, entertained the General Council of County Councils properly at different times when the occasion arose and yet he now finds that they are no good, that they are good for nothing and that they should not be there.  I hope that Deputy O'Donnell after a few months as a member of a county council&mdash;and he has been a member of a county council for only a few months&mdash;will <Col N="477" /> come to realise that a view taken so hastily and after such a short experience is not one over which he will be able to stand.  He will by then have had experience of a county council and, I trust, of the General Council of County Councils, of which he is a member at the moment.</P>
    <P>Why he accepted membership of the General Council of County Councils, I do not know.  It is ridiculous that Deputy O'Donnell, who does not believe in the usefulness of that body, should become a member of it.  There are 28 members of the Donegal County Council and there is no reason why the General Council of the County Councils could not survive without Deputy O'Donnell's membership.  I would suggest to Deputy O'Donnell that it would be better for himself and for the members of the General Council of County Councils if he followed up his views on that body by resigning from it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell welcomed the provision for increasing the funds for the General Council but he advocated its abolition.  There we have the two sides again.  How can a man be a member of that body, advocate its abolition and yet welcome the provision that gives the local authorities power to vote more money to the General Council?  It is a mystery to me but that seems to be Deputy O'Donnell's position on the whole matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carroll of Dublin welcomed the Bill, as did all the other members of the Dublin Corporation, Deputies Lemass, Cummins, Briscoe, Larkin and Sherwin.  Deputy Carroll expressed the view, which was also expressed by some others, that the powers of compulsory acquisition contained in the Bill may not be wide enough.  Then there was the opposite view.  Deputy Manley was afraid that the compulsory powers might be too wide and expressed the belief that persuasion is better than compulsion, with which we all agree.  In the handling of these matters, particularly in the cities and more particularly in Dublin, the experience has been as expressed by Deputy Carroll that these powers are necessary in order that the <Col N="478" /> local authorities may get ahead with work which it is essential to do.</P>
    <P>Might I take this opportunity of suggesting to the Deputies from Dublin Corporation and other cities who do not feel too happy about this matter that between now and Committee Stage, they should scrutinise the Bill in every possible detail?  If there are snags in it and if the legal advisers think that there are snags, let us know about them well before Committee stage, in order that we can attend to these matters, so that in the end we shall have a Bill that will give the powers it is said to give and so that we shall not have any more undue delay through lack of powers or alleged lack of powers.  This Bill should be very carefully scrutinised and if there are any snags in it, they should be brought to the notice of the House on Committee Stage.  If I get notice of these matters and if an improvement is suggested, I can promise the House that the matter will be attended to and the Bill improved accordingly.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion which Deputy O'Donnell made tonight and which should be refuted as soon as possible is in relation to the making of compulsory purchase orders.  He said that the Department is informed before orders are made of the proposals of the local authorities and the implication is that the Minister's decision on the order is thereby prejudged. I want to tell the Deputy and the House that such is not the practice. Deputy O'Donnell should know this, that the nature of proposals in regard to compulsory purchase are not made known to the Minister in advance of any inquiry.  He knows that that is not done.  The Department is most meticulous in avoiding any sort of suggestion and in avoiding any action that might be taken as prejudging any part of an issue likely to arise at an inquiry before the making of a compulsory purchase order.</P>
    <P>The fact that it might be an officer of the Department of Local Government, a senior inspector, who may sit and hold that inquiry does not in any way take from the fact that, regardless of the lines on which the Inquiry <Col N="479" /> may develop and regardless of the report that is made on that inquiry, it is ultimately the Minister for Local Government who makes this final decision as to whether the compulsory purchase order is to go through, be amended or knocked altogether.  The fact is that we do not know and we do not want to have any knowledge that might lead us into prejudging the decision.  The person who is sent down simply holds the inquiry and elicits all the information possible from all sides, so that subsequently he may, with that information at his disposal, come to a decision which ultimately is his responsibility and that of nobody else.  Would it not be utter folly to send a person with a biassed mind on a particular case to bring back a full report on all aspects of the problem?</P>
    <P>Then, of course, we have to ask the House in regard to this suggestion of there being a bias, on which side the Minister is likely to be biassed?  Is it to be presupposed that all the time he would be biassed in favour of the local authorities' problem?  Might it not be that if he knew the circumstances he would be in favour of the landholders whose interests were vitally concerned?  This is far from the truth and, as I said, the sooner it is fully and completely contradicted the better.  It would be very unfortunate if any suggestion should go from this House that such a procedure is followed with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley, who spoke last, mentioned derelict sites.  Might I say that it is the intention to bring a Bill before the House in the very near future dealing with derelict sites.  All relevant aspects will then be open for full discussion and I am sure useful information will be gained from that discussion.  The objection to borrowing made by other Deputies was expressed in a much more reasonable form by Deputy Manley and was based on the good idea that persuasion is better than compulsion.  Unfortunately there are cases where persuasion no longer avails and where, in the public interest and good compulsory powers have to be invoked.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> My own experience, so far as rural Ireland and county councils generally are concerned, is that it is the last thing they want to do.  Every other means of reaching a solution is tried. I have even seen things being left as they were rather than seek a compulsory purchase Order in regard to some matter on which they could not get agreement on a voluntary basis.  That I think is, and will be the approach of the local authorities as a whole.  I have no hesitation whatsoever in increasing the powers of compulsory acquisition in, so far as local authorities are concerned, because I feel fully fortified in the belief that those compulsory purchase orders will never be abused by members of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman suggested that there was a certain amount of slovenliness with regard to Section 9 and that new legislation would seem to have been the answer rather than the insertion of Section 9, and the manner in which we have dealt with it.  I quite agree that it would be much better to repeal the older provisions of the limits relating to borrowing but the extremely wide range of the repeals involved, extending to over 60 statutes, make it a very difficult matter and one fraught with great danger, in the sense that by overlooking even one of the provisions of these 60 statutes the whole purpose of this Bill could be entirely upset.  My information is that the repeals of the nature suggested by Deputy Sweetman would be much more appropriate on another kind of Bill, whether on a Statute Law Revision Bill or on a Bill something on the lines of the Local Government (Repeal of Enactments) Act, 1950, I do not know.  That is a matter into which we shall be looking; it is something about which we have thought as a result of our efforts in this Bill but no decision has yet been arrived at and I do not know when it will be arrived at.  That is the reason for the procedure we have adopted rather than the repeals which Deputy Sweetman has called for.  I feel that those reasons were sound in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>We wanted a workable Bill and apart altogether from the length of time it would take and the greater <Col N="481" /> research needed and the delay that would ensue, we have, by inserting Section 9 as we have dealt with it, made this Bill, if it is passed into an Act, into a workable form of legislation. If we did what Deputy Sweetman suggested and tried to do it hurriedly, our last stage might be worse than our first and the general intentions of this Bill might be nullified.  That would not be to the liking of the House and certainly it would not suit the members of local authorities who are anxious that the provisions of this Bill should be put into operation with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Sweetman who also raised the question of the difference in the procedures for acquistion, provisional order procedure and compulsory purchase order procedure.  Briefly, I think the reason we are doing away with the provisional order procedure in these matters is that the compulsory purchase order procedure&mdash;in other words, the method under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts for compulsory acquisition&mdash;has from experience been found the most suitable and most workable system of acquisition.  It is for that reason that we have decided to do away with provisional order procedure which is most cumbersome and which, in many cases, took an extremely long time to get through.  In the last analysis, it did not give any further or greater protection to those from whom lands might be required than does the present more speedy form of compulsory purchase orders.</P>
    <P>This Bill is indeed more a Bill for Committee Stage than for a Second Reading debate.  I have no doubt that when we come to the Committee Stage many and varied suggestions will be made.  In the meantime may I say that through Deputy Briscoe we have received some suggestions in regard to four different amendments, one of which I am likely to accept. The others would appear to have a certain amount to recommend them and offhand I do not see that there is any real grounds for objecting to them.  If on examination that is found to be the case, all of them can <Col N="482" /> be brought in on the Committee Stage and inserted in the Bill.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That in view of the present serious unemployment position and the certainty that unemployment will increase still further during the winter months, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should make money immediately available to local authorities for the relief of unemployment.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Corish.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been wondering in the past few days whether this House is taking the motion in the very serious manner in which it should be taken.  Of all the motions placed on the Order Paper since the Government took office, there has been none of the same urgency or importance.  If it is of great urgency to the Labour Party and to the other Parties, I should like to hear an expression of opinion from some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, apart from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have something to say on this motion and I say it in the knowledge that never in our history have we had such an unemployment problem as we have at present.  Not alone that, but for the first time in many years, we have people who are actually hungry in this country and it is a long time since there was such serious demand on the funds and services of charitable organisations.  I venture to say that with the winter which we commenced <Col N="484" /> yesterday, we are facing the dampest, blackest and hungriest winter since the Famine.  We realise that fathers of families are unemployed and in receipt of meagre benefits.  They have to face their wives and possibly large families with very little to support them.  We have hungry children going to our schools in various parts of the country today.</P>
    <P>Realising the dimensions of the unemployment problem, let us take the statements made at the last general election in regard to unemployment. I am quoting from a speech by the Taoiseach published in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 21st February, 1957.  He said: &ldquo;Unemployment and emigration are the acid tests of policy.  A Fianna Fáil Government will measure the effectiveness of its worth by these standards&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach said that at Trim.  He proceeded to Kinsale and said that the immediate task of Fianna Fáil would be to get work for those who were unemployed.</P>
    <P>Having delivered a long speech including laments for those who were unemployed at the time, he proceeded to speak in Dublin on 22nd February, 1957, and said that the unemployed could not be expected to wait until long-term production plans brought them permanent benefit.  We also had the usual Fianna Fáil advertisements at the last general election dealing with unemployment.  One, issued on 23rd February, 1957, said: &ldquo;The country needs in Government policy an immediate solution for our unemployment problem&rdquo;.  What is the result? Having regard to the promises to provide work, having pledged themselves that if elected as a Government, they would lose no time in providing work, we had every Fianna Fáil candidate at his church gates at the last election saying that all that was wanted was a change of Government and there would be more jobs to fill than there would be people to fill them.  Every Deputy on this side of the House heard those speeches; every Deputy on the opposite side made those speeches.  Here we are on the eve of another general election and if we are to judge the Government on their policy of providing work, may we say <Col N="485" /> they have done nothing whatever towards implementing the pledges and promises which the Taoiseach made in Dublin, Kinsale and Trim ?</P>

      <P>The first step they had to take was to provide work. We now find fewer people in employment today.  There are 4,000 fewer employed by local authorities and the reason is that the Government scrapped the Local Authorities (Works) Act which was a wonderful source of employment in every county. Why did they do it?  Through jealousy, spite and bitterness.  They scrapped it simply because it was an Act brought in by the previous Government and it gave worthwhile employment to many fathers and heads of households. May I say this with the authority of this side of the House: the moment the change of Government takes place, which certainly will take place within the next few months, one of the first actions of the new Government will be to restore the Local Authorities (Works) Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and provide employment for those people who have been put out of work because of the scrapping of that Act?  We can go a step further.  Section B of the Land Project provided great employment in rural Ireland.  Again we see the cold, still hand of Fianna Fáil clamped down on the workers with the scrapping of Section B which resulted in great unemployment amongst those who were doing valuable and useful work draining and reclaiming the land for the farming community.  We can see very clearly that the building trade has practically collapsed completely&mdash;</P>

      <P>The building trade has practically collapsed in rural Ireland.  How many major housing schemes are now sponsored by local <Col N="486" /> authorities?  What great source of employment are they?  A document recently published dealing with the trend of employment and unemployment in 1959 reveals that while, between the years 1958 and 1959, there were 9,000 fewer at work in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, there was no increase in the number of persons at work in non-agricultural economic activity during the same period.</P>
      <P>Is that not the test of the Government's policy?  We see from their own figures&mdash;mind you, they tell us themselves; these are their own statistics&mdash;in a document published and issued by the Government, entitled the <i>Trend of Employment and Unemployment,</i> that there are thousands registered as unemployed.  How does that report dealing with 1959 fit in with the Taoiseach's speech of 1957?  At that time, work was on his lips, power was in his mind and votes were in his heart.  He was only really interested in the votes and the power, and we heard nothing about work since.  The Taoiseach went further than that when he was in Opposition.</P>
      <P>This important motion sponsored by the Labour Party will be supported in the Division Lobby by the Fine Gael Party, because we realise the urgency of this problem and we know there is no leadership, so far as unemployment is concerned.  We know no one in the Government is anxious to see that work is provided for those who form the big queues outside the labour exchanges.  Every Garda barracks in rural Ireland is thronged on signing days, and on the days when unemployment assistance is being paid, there is no room in the post offices for any other business activity because of the queues of people who are waiting to receive the dole payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is an honest man and I am sure that, being an honest man, when he was charged with responsibility of employment schemes and the provision of employment through relief schemes provided by the Office of Public Works&mdash;bog development schemes, <Col N="487" /> rural improvement schemes and other schemes under his charge&mdash;he must have asked the Taoiseach what had happened to the £100,000,000 plan which was to solve the unemployment problem and which was promised by the Taoiseach.  Would one not expect that this would be the proper occasion to find out what happened to that plan and whether it is now on the shelves in Merrion Street, covered in dust and surrounded by cobwebs?  Is it not only right that we should try to find out what happened to that plan which the Taoiseach said he had in mind, and which he promised and pledged to those who were then unemployed?</P>
    <P>I believe the plan and the promise of £100,000,000 was a mere vote-catching device, but at the time of the last general election and for the first six months Fianna Fáil were in office, there were tens of thousands of people in this country who firmly believed that the Government could not be so hard-necked, so thick-skinned and so hard-hearted as to promise and pledge to the workers a £100,000,000 scheme for the provision of work for the unemployed and not implement that promise.  It is very easy to make promises when one knows that five years must elapse before one will be asked to give an account of one's stewardship.</P>
    <P>Nearly four years have passed since the Government made that solemn promise, in Clery's Restaurant, I think.  In the newspapers and from the lips of every Fianna Fáil Deputy were re-echoed the words of the Taoiseach with regard to the huge benefits of that great plan which he had in mind which would provide untold and unending employment.  We may hear a juggling of figures in a few moments from the Parliamentary Secretary giving details of the numbers at present unemployed but what about the endless thousands who have been forced to emigrate in the past three years?  It was an unusual type of emigration so far as the workers were concerned, because the emigration of the past three years was not the emigration of the father of a family, but the emigration of the father, the wife and the entire family.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> This motion, contains great merit and it demands an explanation from the Government for their miserable failure to provide work.  A Government who cannot provide work for the people are failing in their duty and in their obligations, and unless work is provided for the working-class people, the Government may accordingly be judged and that judgment can only be one of failure.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what happened to the Arterial Drainage Act, for which he is directly responsible?  That Act is a means by which great employment could and should be provided.  While a number of rivers have been drained in recent years, surely it is not outside the bounds of possibility that the Parliamentary Secretary's Office should carry out a survey and have at least the preliminary work undertaken on most of the remaining major rivers. I make special reference to the River Nore which drains a large part of my constituency and practically the entire county of Kilkenny and the Suir, which drains the greater portion of south Tipperary.  We should like to know what action, the Parliamentary Secretary has taken in regard to the Shannon.  What employment could be provided if some scheme were implemented to give some relief, if he cannot provide a permanent solution to the unemployment problem.  I recommend the Parliamentary Secretary to take down the Arterial Drainage Act, shake the dust off it, remove the cobwebs from it and, having done that, go through it to see if employment could be provided on drainage for some of the thousands who are now available for employment.  Drainage is most important.  There is an endless employment potential on drainage.  I am convinced the thousands who are now unemployed could be put into worthwhile employment if the Government were prepared to implement a sane and sound policy aimed chiefly at providing employment.</P>
    <P>It is possible that a good deal of employment could be provided if moneys were made available to enable local authorities to prepare building sites, carry out roadmaking schemes and repair culs-de-sac.  I am convinced <Col N="489" /> employment could be provided if special consideration were given in areas where the local contribution cannot be found under the rural improvement scheme; where there are large numbers unemployed in such areas, the Office of Public Works should give at least a 95 per cent. grant, or, where it is merited, a 100 per cent. grant in order to provide employment.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate on this motion to refer to the question of sanction, particularly in relation to Christmas relief work.  In many areas sanction comes a week or ten days before Christmas.  Hundreds of workers employed on these schemes receive no money before Christmas.  It is common knowledge on both sides of this House that last Christmas, because of late sanction, workers on relief schemes had to seek special concessions from local authorities so that they would be paid on Christmas Eve. Because of the late starting, the workers had not worked a sufficient number of hours to qualify for payment on St. Stephen's Day.  That was due to the fact that sanction was not given sufficiently far in advance. Christmas relief work should commence in November and continue right through December.  A number of payments should be made to workers employed on relief schemes well in advance of Christmas Eve.  In addition, these workers should be given a double week's pay, provided they are genuinely employed on relief work and have been sent to employment from the labour exchange.</P>
    <P>Bog development could employ ten times the number now employed.  The allowance provided for bog development is, to say the least of it, very meagre.  In bog development, there is a large element of drainage and road-making. If there were proper co-ordination between the Office of Public Works and the Forestry Division, continuous permanent employment could be given on very useful work. It is a pity there is not more co-operation between the Office of Public Works and Bord na Móna.  While Bord na Móna gives a vast amount of employment, the employment is seasonal in character.  With more cooperation, <Col N="490" /> the employees could be turned over to making roads.  With more co-ordination with the Forestry Division, they could be diverted to the preparation of cutaway and waste bog for planting.  In that way, continuity of employment could be provided the whole year through.</P>
    <P>The sooner we realise that the Special Employment Schemes Office has outlived its usefulness, the better it will be.  If we are to tackle the unemployment problem, we need something bigger and better.  The Office of Public Works is only tinkering with the problem.  What we want is worthwhile, productive, permanent employment.  This motion is not really germane to the Office of Public Works.  The Office of Public Works is scarcely worthy of consideration when it comes to the question of providing employment.</P>

I challenge Fianna Fáil Deputies to speak on this motion.  It is a very important one.  The employment problem is not being tackled.  The white flag has been hoisted by the Government. The only thing left for them to do is the decent thing; it is the thing the unemployed expect them to do.  They expect them to be honourable enough to admit that they made <Col N="491" /> promises they could not fulfil, false promises in order to capture votes. They expect them to say now: &ldquo;We made promises we could not fulfil because they were false promises given to catch votes.  The best thing we can do is to get out and hand over to someone who will tackle the problem seriously and energetically and provide work.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The downward trend continues.  Before I deal with the actual efforts made annually to cope with seasonal unemployment, it is no harm to throw our minds back to what the position actually was during those years which the last speaker seems to regard as years of prosperity.  Was there any motion or any effort by the members who are now on the other side of the House in the winter of 1956-57 when the registered figures of unemployed were considerably more serious than they are now?  The figures of registered unemployed in 1956-57 were 47,343 as compared with 34,669 in the past month.  During that winter, what was the position in relation to what we have been asked to do now?</P>
      <P>The last Estimates prepared by the Government then in power showed a drastic reduction in the amount of money available for the relief of unemployment. When one considers these facts and then listens to the speeches made since the introduction of this motion, it is very hard to take the motion as anything other than a propaganda gimmick, in which light I do not propose to regard it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish was reasonable.  He gave credit to the Government for creating 3,000 new jobs.  He was not trying to be generous in giving credit to the present Administration.  Do Deputies such as Deputy Murphy ever look at the Book of Estimates and calculate what is actually provided for such things?</P>
      <P>Like the last speaker, Deputy Murphy dwelt on the magnitude of the problem and said it was more serious than ever.  The figures are a complete denial of that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After explaining the gravity of the situation, Deputy Murphy suggests that £500,000 would settle the whole situation.  The Special Employment <Col N="493" /> Schemes Office, in its Estimate for the current financial year, provides directly for the relief of unemployment a sum of £877,000 and we are everything but satisfied with the amount of employment that can give.  However, it is considerably more than what was provided in much more serious circumstances in the past and that is something about which we should all be serious and realistic.  Of that amount of £877,000, a sum of £262,000 has already been provided to local authorities in respect of rural employment schemes and urban employment schemes, for which schemes are now being selected.  If they have not been selected in time for Christmas employment, it is the fault of the local authorities concerned.  They are usually prompt.  Schemes are coming in at the moment in good time.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are minor employment schemes, rural improvement schemes and bog development schemes.  All these are calculated to give a few weeks' work and, at the same time, to restore an accommodation road to a better state, to clean a drain, to make in some urban area a better footpath, or to provide some local amenity that is much required.</P>
    <P>Do we really try to appreciate the problem?  When Deputy Murphy suggests that £500,000 would be sufficient to solve this problem, does he realise that, at the moment, under these schemes, it costs over £30 to provide one week's work in Dublin for one man?  Does he realise that if we were to provide continuous employment for all the unemployed in Dublin, at that rate, it would take £2½ million for Dublin alone?  It is not always easy to get suitable schemes with a good labour content, particularly in the urban areas, particularly in Dublin and Cork.  A certain amount of the money must go on materials and on supervision.  No matter how we try, a certain amount of machinery must be used, if the money is to be spent reasonably economically. Actually, it would take more than £30, under these schemes, to give one week's work to one unemployed person.</P>

      <P>In addition to the £877,000 which is provided directly from the Special Employment Schemes Office Vote for the relief of unemployment in the current year, we have several other grants directly related to the provision of employment for a similar class of persons.  I shall run over a few of these and ask any Deputy to compare them with past performances in similar circumstances.</P>
      <P>From Road Fund grants this year, there is almost £6 million.  From arterial drainage, there is a sum of £723,517 in the current year.  From the farm buildings scheme, there is a sum of £770,017.  From the land project, which the last speaker told us was killed, there is a sum of £2,170,894. That makes a total of almost £10½ million.  I am not taking into account the activities of Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. and the Forestry Section&mdash;all of which show increased activity.  I do not know why Deputies seek to create a feeling of crisis when it simply does not exist.  All that we have to go on are the facts as we find them.  We have always gone on the facts.  We must compare the present situation with the situation in preceding years. Those are the facts as I find them and I do not see what is to be achieved by trying to magnify the situation in order to make propaganda out of it, which certainly does not improve the lot of the unfortunate people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little proof that it was anything else.  I should like to deal with one matter that has been bandied around here in every debate in relation to unemployment, that is, the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  In the debate so far on this motion, which Deputies tried to enshroud in a cloak of importance&mdash;an attempt which failed&mdash; the only suggestion made was that money should be provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and that everything would be solved. What is the position with regard to works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act?</P>
      <P>I have been a member of a local authority for 15 or 18 years.  I have been only a short time in my present office.  There has hardly been a week that I have not had one, two or three deputations regarding flooding. In almost every instance, it was indicated that £1,000, £2,000 or £3,000 had been spent a few years ago and that the flooding was as bad now as ever it was.  In many cases, the people who came to me in connection with local authority works say that the flooding is caused mainly by a job which was done upstream last year or a few years ago.  In one case in connection with which I received a deputation recently £2,500 had been spent up-stream which only aggravated the position downstream and the entire river requires draining again.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy is aware that a Drainage Commission was set up and that the vexed question of drainage was thoroughly examined.  That commission reported unanimously that drainage was useless, unless tackled on an arterial basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make it very clear.  The Deputy knows quite well what I mean.  That commission reported that if drainage were to be tackled properly, it should be tackled on an arterial basis.  Machinery was set up to undertake the gigantic work of arterial drainage.  I shall give the figures of expenditure on it this year &mdash;£723,517, as compared with £600,000 on works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, which showed a diminishing figure in each of your last three years in office.</P>
      <P>The difference between arterial drainage and works done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act was that an inadequate amount of money was provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, that in many cases a work was carried out in the middle of a stream or river, that no provision was made for maintenance, that the work was completely inadequate to provide any solution to the problem of drainage of the huge catchment concerned.  Very often, the work carried out caused flooding downstream and aggravated the problem further and, like most of the drainage that has been done for years, finished by leaving the problem worse than it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait until I have answered the first question which I have been asked.  I did not interrupt any Deputy.  I do not think a Deputy who is threatened with intelligence, like Deputy Corish, seriously believes that land projects should carry a provision for future maintenance.  If a man obtains a grant for the draining of his land, the least that might be expected is that the main waterways into which the drains lead should be kept cleaned.  Surely he does not expect a maintenance squad to drain his land each year for him.  Our forefathers would have been surprised if land were drained for them under a grant.  In the old days, they did it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not let anybody try to relate ordinary land project drainage, which is the drainage of a man's farm, with drainage of the main waterways in an arterial scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Drainage Commission report stated that if we did not tackle the drainage at the outflow, remove the obstacles upstream, after a careful survey, and do all the tributaries in the entire catchment, we would be, literally speaking, wasting money on drainage as such.  That is the type of drainage that we are pressing forward at the moment and I am very happy to note that we have accelerated the progress in that direction and have been able to take on a few intermediate schemes which, I hope, will <Col N="498" /> come into operation in the coming year and further augment the huge programme already on hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where, may I ask the Parliamentary Secretary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are nicely distributed over the country.  We hope to put four of these intermediate schemes into operation each year in addition to the priority list on minor catchments and the priority list on major catchments.  The progress has been accelerated as we have been able to build up the necessary technical staff and as that staff have gained experience and knowledge as the scheme progressed.</P>
      <P>It is a huge undertaking but it is drainage of a real type which will ultimately completely solve the problem of drainage.  We could go on tinkering with minor drainage for years to come and be no better off than we were when we started.  When we have sufficiently advanced with arterial drainage, if any Government then feels that the minor waterways could be cleaned by works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, they are welcome to do it.  Otherwise, you are putting the cart before the horse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be worth considering but once we have the main catchment drained and the necessary maintenance provided, if the minor water ways are not going to get future maintenance the position will still be a lot better than it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very strong views and expressed them in this House many years ago and in the Donegal County Council about the same problem.  When schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act were first introduced we interpreted <Col N="499" /> the circular sent around to local authorities, as I think it was intended to be interpreted at the time, as meaning that all works had to be related to roads in some way.  If you examine the work done under that Act you will find that Donegal is one of the, counties which seldom, if ever, departed from that interpretation of the circular issued at that time.  In other counties they were draining fields and farms.  My judgment of the sense or otherwise of the scheme was: if we are to spend money on roads let it all be spent on roads.  If it is for drainage let it be for drainage.  I saw instances where drains were opened along roads that had not a surface capable of carrying a donkey cart.  I could not see the sense of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion asked that money be provided to local authorities for employment.  One of the Deputy's colleagues.  Deputy Murphy, suggested that £500,000 would provide a panacea for all these evils.  I have pointed out to him that we have provided this year £877,000 and if the Book of Estimates was studied this motion, in the face of that, would necessarily be withdrawn.  Money is being provided, to a greater extent than was provided under much more serious circumstances when the Deputy was a member of the Party which formed the Government for three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still much more than £500,000 extra compared with the provision made in your Estimates of 1956-57.  That is the important point.  The Deputy should keep quiet on that.  I do not think it is necessary to say any more.  I do not know whether I should deal with all the points made about whether the present Government made promises and did not carry them out or whether the past Government <Col N="500" /> made promises and did carry them out.  There is one thing of which I have a clear recollection. I had a campaign in the last election to hold my seat like any other Deputy.  I did not in one single instance require to make any promise to anybody because there was a very definite clamour in the country to get stability and the slogan at the time was: &ldquo;Put them out.&rdquo;  I never found it so easy to be elected as on that occasion.  What the people wanted more than anything else&mdash; and every Deputy knows it in his heart&mdash;was stability.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has specifically referred to <Col N="501" /> the period 1956-57 when the inter-Party Government were in power.

This Government is responsible very largely for that situation. Our first period in office was the first time since this country got its freedom away back in 1921, that the downward trend in the population was halted.  You have shattered all that since you got back.  It could not be otherwise, because your leaders, although the Parliamentary Secretary himself boasts that he made no promises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not wish to dwell on this further than to say that the people in rural areas were never so destitute for want of employment, for want of prices for their agricultural produce, and that the boat, the emigrant ship, is the only remedy for them.  My advice to them is that so long as Fianna Fáil remain in office, it is foolish for them to stay at home in the hope that they will get something because it is the big shots in this country who are the only people getting anything from Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed by the remarks made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance in relation to this motion. The Labour members tabled the motion some time ago to direct the Government's attention to conditions in the country and to the desirability of the Government taking active action to cope with the situation then existing, and, even though the motion has been down for some considerable time, nothing has transpired in the meantime to mitigate in any way the demand that the Government take action to remedy the plight of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary falls back on a very unfortunate line of defence, that the number registered as unemployed is down compared with what it was some time ago.  We all know that can be explained by the fact that emigration has increased, and it can also be demonstrated that the Government's figures reveal and prove conclusively that there are fewer people in employment to-day than there were three years ago.  It is for that very reason we emphasise the necessity for the motion.  The Government's statistics reveal that there are 9,000 fewer people employed in the activities to which the motion refers than there were some <Col N="510" /> years ago and we want to say to the Parliamentary Secretary, and, through him, to his Government, that the complacency shown by his Taoiseach and senior Ministers to-day, was appalling in the face of existing conditions. They seem to be oblivious of the fact that people on small holdings in rural areas are completely ground down by the increase in the cost of living and the demands which it makes upon them.</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation is such that it requires to be grappled with immediately and effectively, if more people are not to follow those who have already gone from our shores.  I have not much time left and I only wish I had enough time to deal with the defence made by the Parliamentary Secretary for the abolition of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Remarks have been made about the serious flooding created down-river when some small work has been carried out up-river.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not abolish the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that to-day the rates are bearing the cost of special expenditure on the maintenance and improvement of roads that were ploughed up recently by flooding. These floods ploughed channels down through the middle of the roads and, if the Local Authorities (Works) Act were in operation, that situation need not have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a fact that money was supposed to have been saved when the Local Authorities (Works) Act was stopped by not paying £5 a week to the men who got employment under it, but we, recently had to vote a Supplementary Estimate to enable the Minister for Social Welfare to pay £3.1.0 a week to these men to keep them idle in their homes.  I say that money would have been better spent if they had been given £5 a week and the opportunity to do work which would be worth while and good.  I do not know why the Government curtailed that Act since they assumed office but it has been removed.  It was a wrong thing to do and it was done <Col N="511" /> because there is a unanimous belief in the Parliamentary Secretary's Government that anything we in the inter-Party Government did should be undone.  They have repealed the Local Authorities (Works) Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should be very grateful. There is a story in the country that at one time during an election Daniel O'Connell went along to a road worker who asked him: &ldquo;Mr. O'Connell, who are going to be the next Government?&rdquo; and O'Connell replied: &ldquo;Whoever gets in, you will still have to work.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, listening to both sides of the argument this evening, I have come to the conclusion that whichever side get in, the unemployed are not going to get any work.  The argument used by both sides seems to be that of how many more were unemployed when the other side were in office, but nobody seems to be the slightest bit interested in the undeniable fact that there are over 30,000 people in the country who cannot get a day's work.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not referred to that beyond saying: &ldquo;It was <Col N="513" /> worse when you were in,&rdquo; and he implied that the Coalition Government went out of office because they could not give work to the unemployed. Perhaps that is right but does he think his side have done much better?</P>

      <P>Do you really believe you have brought down unemployment between the time the previous Government was thrown out and now? I am not here to argue about Fianna Fáil election promises or how our Party have done.  I did not stand up for the purpose of doing that.  It is true there are 50,000 fewer employed at present&mdash;I am not talking about unemployment&mdash;than there were in 1956.  That is no credit to anyone, either to the Labour Party, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows that about 40,000 people leave this country each year because they cannot get employment either for themselves or for their sons and daughters. Is there anyone in his senses who will deny that?  I did not stand up to taunt Fianna Fáil on their preelection promises or on what they have done about employment.  Whatever other Deputies have done, I shall keep to the motion and ask the Parliamentary Secretary, as the responsible authority, to give extra money to the local authorities so that the unemployed, particularly those on unemployment assistance, will have an opportunity of securing employment within the next two or three months&mdash; the worst period of the year&mdash;to enable them to eke out an existence and be here when the wonderful things promised by the Government materialise. Is that unfair?  Is that not a reasonable request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary asked was there any motion down in 1956 or 1957.  Any motion by whom &mdash;the Labour Party?  We were a group in the Government then and why should we have a motion down?  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that pressure was put on the Cabinet to provide the extra money, <Col N="514" /> and they did so.  But there was no motion by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>If you had examined the matter, you would.  There was pressure by the Labour Party and I must say, with all due respect to Fine Gael and the other people comprising the inter-Party Government, that that was accepted as reasonable pressure and something that should be done.  Now we are only repeating what we did previously when we were part of the Government and what we shall continue to do either in Opposition or in Government.  We feel it is our job to do so.</P>
      <P>As I say, I am not moving this motion for the purpose of discrediting the Government.  All good luck to them if they can provide extra work. I and every member of my Party will applaud the Government for every extra factory giving constant employment, for every effort they make to provide employment.  But it is no use telling the unemployed that there are fewer on the live register now than there have been at any time in the past.  That will not buy any grub or provide any fire for the unemployed man.  There is no use talking about what you did in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said this motion was down twelve months ago.  That is true.  It was through no fault of the Labour Party that we did not reach it.  It was down exactly twelve months ago because of the fact that this was the month of all months when such a motion is appropriate. It states that from this month unemployment steadily increases.  Private employment and local authority employment dwindles away because of the inclement weather and because tarring, hedge cutting, and most of the normal local authority and private enterprise employment dwindles away at this time.  But the people must still <Col N="515" /> exist until next April when the new money becomes available.</P>
    <P>This motion is not an effort to condemn the Government.  It is a motion on behalf of the unemployed, particularly those on unemployment assistance, asking the Government to provide extra money to enable these people to survive the hardships of the coming three, four or five months. Not only will that money give them sufficient to tide themselves and their families over these months, not only will it give them some little extra at Christmas, the time of good cheer, but it will enable them to get all the contributions on their unemployment cards to requalify them for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Did the Parliamentary Secretary think in these terms when speaking in this debate?  I doubt it.  He did not mention the unemployed in one way or another.  He simply criticised the Opposition in relation to what they had done.  He simply said &ldquo;We gave them more than you gave them in your time.&rdquo;  Surely that is not an answer? Is this problem to be taken seriously or not?  I read where the Taoiseach said we have a long climb ahead.  That may be so.  I can quite accept that you cannot develop industry overnight or expect to get results inside a year or two years.  But if the Taoiseach is correct, if there is a long climb ahead but that finally the country will attain its goal, how are the unemployed going to wait until that time?  What will they do?  Will they live on unemployment assistance or home assistance or will they emigrate to England?  They emigrate in their thousands each year.  I do not know about the situation in the Parliamentary Secretary's area in the north-west mentioned by Deputy Blowick, but I do know the situation in my own area of the south.  There it is not a question of a man going away, but a question of a man going away and taking his family with him.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must now, as those of us connected with the trade union movement know, that if you look for tradesmen in the building <Col N="516" /> industry at present you just cannot get them.  Why?  Because they have emigrated and are not prepared to tear up their roots and come back here again unless they know they can be assured of continuity of employment. Tradesmen, plasterers, carpenters and so on are needed at present for a certain upsurge in the building trade but they are not available and will not be available.  Who can blame them?  Ordinary factory workers and labourers will emigrate unless something is done to keep them here.  I am suggesting that the least that can be done is to provide whatever money is necessary to tide them over this emergency period.</P>
    <P>I remember the last year of office of the inter-Party Government&mdash;the year the Parliamentary Secretary was talking about.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that the Labour Party or somebody did not make any demands. I remember being spokesman at an inter-Party meeting in the Engineers' Hall in Dawson Street when I asked for £500,000, the very same figure Deputy Murphy asked for to-night.  I do not think £500,000 extra is sufficient, but atleast it would be something.  It is in that spirit that we put down the motion.</P>
