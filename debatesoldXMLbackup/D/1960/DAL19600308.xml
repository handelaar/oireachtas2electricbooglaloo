      <P>Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, provides that a health authority shall make available, without charge, general medical services for persons who by their own industry or other lawful means are unable to provide such services for themselves and for dependants of such persons.</P>
      <P>The health authority has the duty to determine whether a person is able to provide general medical services for himself and for his dependants.  In making this determination, the health authority must have regard to the specific circumstances of the particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> Those persons who, on this procedure, are adjudged by the health authority to come within the scope of Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, are entitled to free medical treatment from dispensary doctors.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health what the position is regarding the proposed extension to St. Brendan's Home, Loughrea, County Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for the improvement, on a comprehensive scale, of St. Brendan's Home, Loughrea, were submitted recently to my Department and have been discussed with officers of the local authority and their professional consultants. These proposals envisage, <i>inter alia,</i> the erection of new buildings which would involve the local <Col N="3" /> authority in heavy capital expenditure. Arising out of the discussion referred to, it has been suggested to the local authority that the scope of the proposed improvement scheme could be substantially reduced, with a corresponding saving in capital expenditure, if a number of patients from St. Brendan's Home, which is at present overcrowded, could be transferred to vacant accommodation elsewhere in the county.  The local authority are considering the feasibility of this suggestion and as soon as a decision is reached every effort will be made to proceed with the scheme of improvements at St. Brendan's Home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if in view of the success of the Prize Bonds scheme and to further encourage interest and investment therein he will now consider arranging for draws to be held more frequently with the necessary adjustments in the value of prizes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that more frequent draws under the Prize Bonds scheme accompanied by a reduction in the value of prizes, as suggested by the Deputy, would enhance the attractions of the scheme and result in increased investment in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in reply to a previous question from the Deputy on 25th <Col N="4" /> November, 1958, it is necessary that a draw for prizes should be followed by an issue of Bonds to the public.  The question of the frequency of the draws and issues is one of the aspects of the scheme which are kept constantly under review, but, having regard to the current level of investment in the Bonds and the additional cost to the Exchequer of more frequent draws and issues, I am not at present prepared to make any change in the existing arrangement under which draws are held twice yearly.</P>

      <P>I have no information as to the estimated cost to the planning authority of implementing the planning scheme for Dublin city and I am unable to give any indication as to when the scheme might come into force.  As regards implementation, however, it was indicated in a reply to the Deputy on the 19th June, 1957, that the constructive aspects of the scheme such as roads, bridges and housing, are all referable to the normal statutory activities of the corporation and in this respect the scheme merely indicates the developments which the corporation undertake in the ordinary course. These developments are proceeding in the normal course under the usual statutory procedures as part of annual corporation programmes and expenditure on them cannot properly be described as expenditure on town planning, as such.  Other aspects of the planning scheme relating to zoning, density and general restrictions on development are, I understand, being adhered to by the corporation in the operation of the planning control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no general reduction in forestry employment in Co. Galway recently.  Current employment is, in fact, higher than the employment level at the beginning of the Winter season.  At the end of the <Col N="11" /> planting season, that is at the end of March or early in April, there may be reductions at some centres but this has always been a normal feature of forestry employment.</P>
    <P>As regards Woodlawn Forest, the position is that nine men were laid off recently as the programme of work for the current season was practically completed.  It is hoped that it will be possible to re-employ the men next month when the programme of work for the summer season is commenced.</P>
    <P>On the general work position in County Galway, I can say that this year's planting programme in the county totals 2,440 acres, the highest ever undertaken there.  Next year's programme has not yet been finally settled but I have every hope that it will be at least as big as this year's.  I can assure the Deputies that everything possible will be done to maintain forestry employment in the county at the highest possible level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister advert to the fact that special reference is made to one employee who had 14 years' continuous service with the Department?  Is it not possible, in the ordinary arrangements connected with forestry, to avoid disemploying a permanent employee of that kind, if the gap in general employment is no more than a couple of months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the practice, I understand, to give priority, if priority arises, to people with long service in the Forestry Section.  In this situation, it is necessary at times to lay the men off and as far as my information goes, it would not be possible to keep on men such as the man referred to until the Section is ready for the new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="12" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister bear in mind that even in a strictly commercial enterprise it is not the practice with an old permanent employee, to leave him off for a month or two, whereas with ordinary temporary staff that may be a recognised practice? Would he consider the possibility, in regard to a permanent employee with a long term of service, of taking some steps to avoid a serious hiatus in his employment which can create disproportionate family suffering where a man is depending on that occupation for his livelihood?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point which the Deputy has made.  As I said, I think it is the practice if it is at all possible, not to lay off men with long service.  Where the Forestry Section are compelled by circumstances to lay them off, the men with the longer service get a high priority in coming back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill do now pass.  In doing so perhaps I should refer to the discussion which took place on Section 17 of the Bill in Committee, when Deputy Haughey, Deputy Cummins and others referred to the uneasiness of the staff which would be transferred under this Bill to the new Health Authority with particular reference to those who were to be transferred to the Dublin Health Authority.  I arranged for this matter to be discussed <Col N="14" /> between officers of my Department and the Dublin City Manager. I understand that the latter has in fact been in conference since then with representatives of the staff concerned in the Dublin Corporation with particular reference to the possible loss of promotion prospects and the possible inconvenience to the staff arising from their transfer to offices situated elsewhere than in the City Hall.</P>
      <P>Naturally the matter of promotion prospects has been one of major concern to the staff.  The Manager is sympathetic towards them in this matter but cannot, of course, consider the claim of the Corporation staff who will be transferred to the Health Authority without reference to those who will be taken over from other Health Authorities in the area.  Discussions with the representatives of the officials concerned are, I understand, in progress and at this stage I do not wish to say anything more except to assure the Deputies who raised this matter, and the House in general, that my attitude and that of the City Manager towards the staff to be transferred will be sympathetic.  I am sure that I can say the same for the Managers in the other areas affected by the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the Minister has gone out of his way to help and to facilitate the local authority in Dublin, Waterford, and perhaps Limerick, in connection with the proposals before the House.  I have no intention of repeating any remarks I offered here on the Second Stage but I must say that I am still convinced that the Bill offers little or nothing for Cork and takes away so much.  The Minister has admitted, during the discussion on the Bill, that in respect of the setting up of the new Committee, or the Authority, who will have the final say in connection with the operation of the Health Act in Cork, not alone is it a case of not saving money but it will undoubtedly mean the expenditure of more money in connection with health services in Cork.  If it were a case of that extra money being spent on providing additional benefits for the people, certainly I would find myself in full agreement with the Minister, but when it is only <Col N="15" /> a question of additional administration and of extra moneys being expended through a service which will not offer any additional benefits, and perhaps not even offer a continuation of our present system under the Health Act in Cork, I find myself still in disagreement when the question of Cork comes before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate that because the members from Dublin, Waterford and Limerick are satisfied with the new proposals, it is but natural they should support this measure but they still claim in Cork that in regard to anything affecting Cork City and county, even when discussed in this House, the obligation must be on the members coming from Cork not alone to voice <Col N="16" /> their opinions in opposition to such a measure but to make it clear that they are opposed to the Bill.  I am therefore opposing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say that I trust Deputy Desmond's apprehensions will be found not to be based on reality.  I trust that in the operation of the Bill it will be found that the greater convenience of the people of Cork City and county will be advanced by its provisions.  I do not promise that there are going to be any great reductions in expenditure. I cannot promise that.  I hope that, as a result of this Bill, these people for whom the health services are primarily intended, will receive great benefits.</P>

    <Title>Electoral Law Amendment: Motion for Joint Committee.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a Joint Committee consisting of 15 members of the Dáil and 7 members of the Seanad be appointed to consider and make recommendations for the amendment of the law relating to:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the franchise and registration <Col N="17" /> of electors for Dáil and local elections.</P>
    <P>(b)  the conduct and costs of Dáil elections and expenses falling on candidates at such elections, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the qualifications and disqualifications for membership of each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The function of the proposed Committee will be to examine the electoral law generally, within its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Matters covered by the terms of reference have been raised by Parliamentary Question in the Dáil or otherwise on a number of occasions.  That the electoral law is in need of amendment I think there can be no doubt.</P>
    <P>Persons operating this branch of the law find it necessary more often than not to give speedy replies to questions which may be raised.  The difficulty of doing this is greatly increased by the large number of Acts governing the subject.  Some of these provisions go back for over 300 years.  Many of these are now obsolete, but, nevertheless, they are still there and should be removed. It is vitally important that the law on this subject, covering as it does the constitution of the Legislature, should be crystal clear and should be capable of being interpreted by any citizen.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to go into the various defects in the law at this stage, I might mention that general complaints have been made to me from time to time about the present procedures for the compilation of the register of electors.  The dates for the various stages may be inconvenient but nothing can be done about it, since they are defined by Statute.  I was, however, able to do something this year to meet some complaints by arranging that, in order to avoid confusion, the electors' lists would be printed on a different colour paper from that of the final register.</P>
    <P>Then there is the point that the Constitution provides that any person over the age of twenty-one may, unless he is disqualified by law, vote at a Dáil election.  The law in regard to the registration of electors, however, <Col N="18" /> provides that a person must be twenty-one years of age on the 15th September, before his name is entered on the register which comes into operation on the following 15th April. This means that a person who reached the age of twenty-one years on the 16th September, 1959, could not become a registered elector until the 15th April, 1961, when he would be more than twenty-two and a half years of age.</P>
    <P>The number and complexity of the qualifications and disqualifications for membership of this House and of the Seanad has often been mentioned. The law on this subject, apart from the Constitutional provision, is scattered through a number of Statutes, and apart from the fact that it is not free from doubt in many respects, may well be regarded by some as out of date.  This is a question on which we should particularly wish to have the considered views of the members of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Similar considerations apply to the other matters coming within the Committee's terms of reference.  I cannot think of any body more suited to submit for the consideration of the Government recommendations on questions relating to the conduct and costs of Dáil elections and expenses falling on candidates at such elections, as well as on the question of eligibility for election to which I have referred, than a Joint Committee of members of both Houses, who can bring their large and varied practical experience of elections to bear on the subject and examine it in the dispassionate atmosphere of Committee discussions.</P>
    <P>Part of what I have said about the complexity and antiquity of some of the Statutory provisions may raise in Deputies' minds a picture of long and laborious research through long-dead statutes.  I may mention that much of the spade-work has been done in my Department where the general scheme of a Bill had been prepared to amend the parts of the electoral law coming within the proposed Committee's terms of reference, apart from that dealing with the expenses falling on candidates at Dáil elections.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> This scheme will be made available to the Committee as a starting point and general guide for discussion.  The scheme has not been examined in detail by the Government and does not necessarily represent their views. I do not think, therefore, that I should go into the details of it here.</P>
    <P>The law on election petitions is obsolete and was designed for the conditions which were in operation when it was passed, that is, single-member constituencies and a limited franchise. It would, however, be somewhat premature to decide the exact procedure to be followed in dealing with election petitions, until the Oireachtas has decided what the precise disqualifications are to be and how they are to operate.  An election petitions Bill would then be, to a large extent, a procedural Bill.  This could follow on the enactment of the general law on the qualifications and disqualifications for membership.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I may say that the question was considered of including in this motion some reference, in accordance with Standing Order No. 67, to a date upon which the Committee would be required to report back.  On fuller consideration, however, we decided that it would possibly be wiser not to fetter the Committee's discretion in this way.  I am sure, however, that members opposite will join with me in the hope that the Report of the Committee, if it is decided that it should be established, will not be unduly delayed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall participate in this proposed Committee.  However, I think it proper to make one or two observations in regard to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach was good enough to send me advance information of the Minister's intention to move this motion, for the information of my colleagues. It occurred to me on that occasion that it would be helpful to know what is contained in these draft proposals to which the Minister has now referred.  I think it would be better if that material were made available to the House on the occasion of considering this motion rather than to <Col N="20" /> ask the House to consent to the establishment of the proposed Committee before this basic information is circulated.</P>
    <P>We are of opinion that the electoral law is in some respects archaic and requires at least codification and, at least in some archaic particulars, modification. We are in agreement that this is a matter which can best be approached dispassionately by a Joint Committee.  I cannot refrain from saying that this work might have been put in hand more speedily if we had not spent the past 18 months or two years careering round the country dealing with the Fianna Fáil attempt to abolish proportional representation.  A good deal of time was wasted on that frustrated effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>And money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;described, according to our recollection, as a Fianna Fáil scheme the realisation of which would result in the Fine Gael Party &ldquo;having had it.&rdquo;  I suppose it is unreasonable for this Opposition to expect from the Fianna Fáil Party any better procedure than is envisaged now but, with a general election which cannot be very much further delayed, in a year or 18 months there may or may not be time coldly and dispassionately to consider all the questions that will here arise.  It is certain that if we had not been wasting our time on the Fianna Fáil conspiracy to abolish P.R. such reforms as were requisite would have been made in time for the local elections and that, I think, would have been better than holding local elections under the system which the Minister describes as archaic, unsatisfactory and based, at least in part, on statute law going back 300 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regret that fully informed proposals were not brought before us two years ago in which event they would probably be disposed of now and suitable legislation would either be before the House or already enacted to remove any anachronisms that exist in the electoral law.  Regret over past misdeeds is a natural reaction but I suppose we might as well take things as they are and, with things as they are, <Col N="21" /> we are prepared to collaborate in this work.  I still think that the Minister might properly make available, at least to the Leaders of the Parties represented in the House, the substance of this draft Bill which he has because it will behove each Party to suggest to the Committee of Selection from its ranks the most suitable Members to deal with the problems that are to be considered.  It is hard to do that if you do not know what the problems are.  It can and will be done in any case but we could do it much better if we had in our hands the draft document to which the Minister refers.</P>
    <P>I see no very important reason why that document should not be made available to the Leaders of the Parties so that they might consult with their colleagues with a view to co-operating in the most effective way they can. I suggest to the Minister that he might adopt the course which I suggest to him.  Subject to these observations, even at this late hour we are prepared to work with this Committee and contribute what we are in a position to offer.</P>
    <P>There is one somewhat awkward problem that here arises which I foresee as a danger and which, I think, I should mention now.  Decisions will be taken in that Committee by a majority.  That is as it should be.  I want to be perfectly clear that we are anxious to collaborate in good faith with the work of this Committee if there is an agreed measure proposed by the Committee and that measure is accepted by the Government and submitted to the House.  But if there is not an agreed measure and if the proposals are not accepted <i>in toto</i>, we must reserve our right fully to discuss, criticise and, if necessary, dissent from the consequential proposals that the Government may bring before the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party has also indicated its willingness to participate in the work of this Joint Committee with the reservation that if it is not a majority report we, as individual Parties on this side of the House, reserve the right not necessarily <Col N="22" /> to accept the report and to make whatever criticisms we think should be made when any implementing measure comes before the House.</P>
      <P>This is not the place to discuss the whole gamut of franchise registration, qualification and disqualification for membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I wonder if the Minister has gone far enough in this motion or in the terms of reference set out here. This Committee is to make recommendations in respect of the law relating to the franchise and registration of electors for Dáil and local elections. The first paragraph relates to the Dáil and local elections.  The next&mdash;(b)&mdash; relates to the conduct and costs of Dáil elections and expenses falling on candidates at such elections and (c) relates to the qualifications and disqualifications for membership of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I think everybody will agree with the Minister and Deputy Dillon when they say that the law in respect of these two matters ought to be overhauled and brought up to date but would the Minister not think that the qualifications and disqualifications for membership of local bodies are also an urgent matter and that it ought to be settled now?  If not settled now, it will be 50, 60 or 100 years or, as the Minister said, 300 or 400 years before it can be got round to.</P>
      <P>I do not want to discuss the merits or demerits of the particular case mentioned but public servants in minor offices, and postmen in particular, cannot contest local government elections as members of political Parties but they may contest local elections as Independents.  Whether that is the law or a Departmental regulation, I cannot say but as far as I know there is a fairly strict regulation, or whatever it is, enforced by the Department that these minor officials cannot contest local elections as members of any political Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it a bit daft that we should still have that situation because, in fact, everybody knows that certain postmen and other minor officials in the Government service have contested local elections, described themselves as Independents and attached themselves <Col N="23" />&mdash;there is not anything wrong with it &mdash;to political Parties if they happen to be successful in the particular local election.  That is one example.</P>
    <P>There is also the example of minor employees or servants in local bodies who are debarred from becoming members of the local bodies under which they work.  There may be some argument against officers, especially senior officers, becoming members of county councils, corporations, borough councils, urban councils or town commissioners, say.  I seriously suggest that, as far as minor officials are concerned, the Minister or this Committee should be given power to examine whether or not these servants, people who occupy minor posts, should be eligible to present themselves as candidates for local bodies.  I suggest, therefore, that paragraph (a) is all right and that under paragraphs (b) and (c) the Joint Committee should be given power to examine these aspects of election and the qualifications and disqualifications as far as the local bodies are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully convinced that certain aspects of the electoral laws as they stand at present need renovation and overhaul as certain provisions are out-of-date.  I agree fully with the first and second paragraphs of the Minister's motion but as regards the third, I understood that under the present system the qualification, at least for members of the Dáil, is that of just being a citizen of 21 years or over and that your name appears on the register of electors in any constituency.  Certain matters are laid down which disqualify a person from becoming a member of the House; if he is elected a member I understand that he must or should resign in these circumstances.  I thought these qualifications were quite sufficient as they stand.  I did not think that they needed any overhauling because in a democratic community such as ours the present system is quite all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter I wish to mention in regard to the second paragraph in the Minister's motion in regard <Col N="24" /> to franchise.  I could never understand why the Gardaí are deprived of votes, or at least not allowed to take any part in an election.  Members of the Army have votes; they even have postal votes and are the only section of the community who have.  I cannot understand why the Garda, a force which is approved by everybody, have never had votes.</P>
    <P>We also have the peculiar situation &mdash;which admittedly does not concern a very great number of people in the country, but it is ridiculous&mdash;that people who have acquired United States citizenship and have come home to settle down here are deprived of a vote until they take out Irish citizenship. It seems strange to have a man going to the United States to make a living and to get sufficient money to come home and settle down and during his stay in the United States becoming an American citizen, then coming back, perhaps, to the very townland or village in which he was born, either renting or buying a place, not bothering to acquire Irish citizenship and being unable to vote.  These are matters which I think should be brought to light and considered.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the previous speaker in regard to qualifications for candidates for local elections.  I certainly think part-time officials should not be debarred from standing as candidates. I would go so far as to say that all who are not established civil servants should have the chance, if they wish, to take part in local elections, regardless of whether or not they are attached to a Party or are independent. I see no sense in debarring that type of person; in fact such people who would be able to make a very good contribution to and pull their weight on any local body.  Outside of those points, I fully agree with the terms of the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not speak for any Party although I suppose what I have to say will coincide with the views of other Independent members. I agree that the draft proposals should be sent to each Party and a copy should be sent to one of the Independents because we are almost certain to be asked to name a member for this proposed committee of fifteen.  We <Col N="25" /> ought to know what we are going to talk about, or have some knowledge of it, so that we can decide whom we shall select.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the Independents get a copy of the draft proposals.</P>
      <P>In regard to the proposals themselves, I have strong views on many aspects of them because Independents, especially, are at a tremendous disadvantage in fighting elections.  An Independent candidate may be a poor man fighting a wealthy Party.  In regard to the question of candidates' costs, in the case where a Party owns a newspaper, the use made of that newspaper should be taken into account when considering the Party's expenditure.  Suppose £500 is allowed for each person as expenses.  If I want to get a write-up in the <i>Irish Press</i> I must pay for it but Party members will get it in for nothing so that they could each get £500 worth of publicity for nothing.  It may not be assessed against their individual expenses but if I got the same amount it would be assessed against me.  The question of persons standing for membership of the House and having free publicity, because they are members of a Party, should be taken into account when considering candidates' expenses.</P>
      <P>There should also be some limit on transport.  Possession of wealth should not determine a man's right to be here; these are all matters that must be considered.  Those are two matters on which I shall have a lot to say. There is also the question that no official voting cards are sent out on behalf of municipal candidates.  Again the individual is at a disadvantage and the Party is not.  According to statute, I understand a person may not stand for election to a municipal body if he is in receipt of assistance&mdash; at least I saw something to that effect. It would be strange if that still operates because in 1943 I was drawing assistance and I stood for the local elections.  The time has now come when it is no shame to be on assistance, seeing that there is no work and that many people are on assistance and will be.  If there is any disqualification of that sort it should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> I shall have a lot to say when the proposal to set up this Committee is before the House&mdash;I understand we are not at that stage yet&mdash;and I am asking now that the Independents be sent a copy of the draft proposals so that we shall know what to do and the best person to send to represent us.</P>

      <P>As the Leader of the Opposition has indicated&mdash;and the leaders of the other Parties&mdash;we are prepared to act on this Committee because it is accepted that this revision is necessary in relation to the laws governing election to the Dáil and local elections.  By the time this Committee will have reported it is significant that an examination will have taken place of the methods of election of all members of the Oireachtas with the exception of the Taoiseach's nominees&mdash;by way of referendum on the system of election, by commission in the Seanad and by a Joint Committee of Dáil and Seanad in relation to the issues now before the House&mdash;and this will remain as the one exclusion from any examination whatsoever.  I think it is one which, particularly among the people, occasions some disagreement and is often discussed.</P>
      <P>Whoever conceived the idea of the two-tone electors' list and register were on to a &ldquo;good thing&rdquo;.  It was a brilliant idea which is helping the officials very much and it is a pity somebody did not think of it long ago.  I do not know whether it was sparked off by this, but I know of a Fianna Fáil candidate who wasted some weeks canvassing from the electors' list instead of the register.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> The one inclusion in the terms of reference of this Committee which is foremost in everybody's mind is the right to vote for the Garda.  It would remove an inequity which has existed for a long time and which is constantly brought to our notice.  It may appear at first glance that, in order to get the work done, the Committee is rather on the large side.  I can only assume that that is so in order that the smaller Parties and Independents may be included.  If that is the reason, then we welcome it.  It is a welcome but belated conversion, after the efforts made to deprive these minorities of any representation in the House, to see the Government realise the advisability of even having them on this Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question.  Before doing so, I should say that I think Deputy Sherwin is a bit of an optimist if he thinks the Committee will make a report which is not loaded heavily in favour of the large Parties or groups in the Dáil.  One must be very suspicious of this proposal brought in so soon after the recent attempt to eliminate the minority groups in the Dáil in the proposed amendment of the electoral system by means of the referendum. However, there is an old saying that there are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with butter.  I hope this was not in the mind of the Government when they decided to set up this Committee&mdash;by some other way, to get rid of the difficult minorities they are so impatient of in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, following a motion put down here by Deputy McQuillan and myself asking for, as far as I can recall, the abolition of the Seanad, a Commission was established to inquire into the methods of election for Seanad panel members.  The terms of reference were that the Commission were to examine the law regulating elections of the panel members of the Seanad and make recommendations regarding any legislative changes, within the provisions of Articles 18 and 19 of the Constitution, which they considered desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> I want to know from the Minister to what extent the work of that Commission will overlap the work of this new Committee, to what extent the proposals of the Government in regard to sub-paragraph (c) &ldquo;The qualifications and disqualifications for membership of each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;&mdash;to what extent we are now going to alter the qualifications for membership of the Seanad and if there is any attempt here to give us this proposal as a substitute for a much more comprehensive Commission in relation to the new proposals put forward by the Commission in 1959.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if this is in any way to be a substitute for legislative proposals to be put forward by the Government arising out of the 1959 Seanad Electoral Law Commission Report.  Alternatively, if the Government do intend that the Commission's Report shall be made use of and that it shall become the basis of any considerations or recommendations made by this Committee,. the terms of reference under the motion here should be considerably extended.  I should like to know if this is to be a substitute for the proposals put forward as a result of the findings of the Seanad Electoral Law Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the general points raised, one which was common to a number of Deputies, including the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Corish, was their willingness to co-operate with and act on this Committee while at the same time, making it clear that though the Committee might take decisions and make recommendations, unless they were agreed decisions, they would not feel themselves in any way bound by them. Speaking from this side, I hold exactly the same view as the members who have spoken.  After the Committee have reported, we also will feel free to consider these proposals.  If they come in as agreed proposals or decisions, it is one thing; but whether they come in as agreed proposals or as merely majority proposals or decisions, we shall naturally feel just as free as the other Parties to have a look at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish suggested that members of the Civil Service were rather <Col N="29" /> at a disadvantage in so far as the present laws governing Dáil elections and local government elections are concerned.  Up to now, civil servants have been by law precluded from being members of this House, but only by Civil Service regulations are they precluded from seeking election to local bodies, with the exceptions already mentioned.  In regard to the question of members of staffs of local authorities offering themselves for election as members of their own local authorities&mdash;their own employers, if you like&mdash;the 1955 Local Government Act precludes them from being elected to the authority for which they work. Possibly that matter might be the subject of various views at this stage, but it is such a short time since the Act came through the House that I am doubtful if any other conclusion is likely to be reached, even by those who have spoken against it just now.</P>
    <P>A few Deputies have mentioned the apparent omission of any reference to the matter of votes for the Garda. A few months ago, the Government took the formal decision&mdash;the first time it was ever taken by any Government&mdash;that the Guards are to have votes.  Without any disrespect to the Committee we hope to set up, that decision will stand.  It is intended that it will be implemented, regardless of any report that may come in from the Committee.</P>
    <P>In so far as the fears expressed by Deputy Dr. Browne are concerned, of some motive behind the setting up of this Committee to make life more difficult, if one likes to put it that way, for the smaller groups in this House and, if I understood him aright, that was part of the fear he had, we&mdash;my Department, the Government or myself&mdash;were not actuated by any such consideration in putting forward the terms of reference outlined to this House today.  I think he can rest fully assured that the motive behind this is clear and above-board, that is, to try to modernise and bring up-to-date the present laws in relation to matters dealing with our elections, our mode of election and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne also mentioned the question of possible overlapping of <Col N="30" /> the matters to be dealt with by this Committee and the Report of the Commission on Seanad Electoral Law. I just want to say that so far as that matter is concerned, and in regard to the manner in which it was related to qualifications and disqualifications, it does not really arise because the qualifications we are talking of here are those which are common to the members of this House and members of the Seanad.  Any matters that would have been dealt with in the Report of the Commission on the Seanad Electoral Law would have to do with qualifications for particular panels.  Those about which we are talking here are partly constitutional and partly in the Legislature and therefore anything in the Seanad Commission Report could, in fact, be regarded as complementary to the qualifications and disqualifications of membership of both Houses as we envisage them being discussed, talked about and recommended on by this Committee.</P>
    <P>There is little further I have to say, except that I appreciate the manner in which members on all sides of the House indicated a willingness to co-operate in this matter.  I am not so optimistic as to expect 100 per cent. co-operation but I am hopeful, as a result of the expressions of co-operation here today, that this Committee will, in fact, be able to bring in a report which will enable an agreed measure to be considered by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I omitted it, possibly somewhat deliberately, in the hope that the Deputy would not follow it up.  My reasons for that were that I was not immediately inclined to accede to his request, though I can understand his anxiety to get these proposals.  My hesitation in agreeing to this is that there are two or three Parties in the House and we have the very natural request that Independents should be given exactly the same thing.  Quite honestly, listening to the request and <Col N="31" /> to the observations made on it, it would appear to me that practically any and every Deputy should be entitled to exactly the same consideration.</P>
      <P>My reluctance is also based on the fact that such matters are quite complicated and could possibly be complicated in their presentation.  Indeed, they are very much more the type of document that can be better considered by the Committee members than disseminated in a general sort of way. For those reasons, I am rather reluctant to accede to the request, though I can see there are good grounds for making it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned last week, I had almost exhausted what I had to say on this Supplementary Estimate.  I had adverted to the fact that it was a formidable Supplementary Estimate but one which it was necessary the House should pass so that these aged people will continue to get their present rate of allowance until the end of the present financial year.  I want to make an earnest appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, and, through him, to the Government.  They must know, because it has been brought home as forcibly to them by their own supporters as it was to us by ours, that there is great concern in the country in relation to the conditions under which some classes of aged people are living and in particular, aged people in the city of Dublin who have no near relatives and who are living alone. That applies to such people in Cork and Limerick also, but it is more forcibly brought home to us in the city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>These people are in a special category and I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to give immediate attention to their plight and make some arrangement by which immediate succour will be brought to them, because it is obvious that under present conditions these unfortunate people cannot have anything approaching a reasonable standard of living, on the allowances and with the charges they have to bear.  This is entirely apart from any legitimate demands people who are living with their families may have.  These people are in a special category and I earnestly appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to give immediate attention to their plight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> I may say, in accepting this Supplementary Estimate, that it should be larger because there was considerable delay, unwarranted delay, in paying the increase granted to old age pensioners last year.  The time that elapsed between the increase in the cost of living, following the withdrawal in their entirety of the food subsidies, and the payment of the pension increase was inexcusable, seeing that in the case of increases in other pensions payment was made in a matter of weeks.  Consequently, no excuse of administrative difficulty in making the increase payable at an earlier date can be put forward.  Payments were delayed too long and, if right were right and justice were done, the Parliamentary Secretary would be asking this House to pass a much greater Supplementary Estimate than the one he is now asking it to pass, and we would agree to such an Estimate.</P>
    <P>I want to inquire from the Parliamentary Secretary what explanation has he for the fact that there was such a short-fall in the expenditure on old age pensions and children's allowances over the past 12 months?  From the Vote on Account and the Estimates before us, it would appear as if the Government are estimating for reduced expenditure on children's allowances in the coming 12 months. What is the reason for that?</P>
    <P>I should also like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary how it was that such a substantial saving was effected in old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions in the current year.  Is it proof of the suspicion we have had for some time that there is more rigid application of the means test?</P>
    <P>I repeat that we accept the Supplementary Estimate and consider that everything the recipients of these social services get from the State in present circumstances is certainly fully deserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan appealed to the Parliamentary Secretary to have regard to the special circumstances of the old age pensioner living alone in urban surroundings, who is suffering serious hardship.  I <Col N="34" /> mean no disrespect to the Parliamentary Secretary when I say to him that he acts on behalf of the Minister for Social Welfare and that I conceive him to have a duty to satisfy himself continually that there is nobody in this community to which we all belong who is destitute or hungry.  This is something that has been lost sight of. I do not think it is enough to say to somebody who is destitute or hungry: &ldquo;Why do not you kick up a row about it?&rdquo; and that the fact that nobody is kicking up a row about it is in itself evidence that no such person exists.  That is not my experience.  My experience is that old persons living alone&mdash;an old man or, more often, an old woman&mdash;they simply do not know that they have under the statute law of this country a right to require the appropriate authority to provide them with the means of escape from destitution.</P>
      <P>It is a shocking thing, and one of those evidences of complacency which is deserving of censure, that we, the representatives of the people, should sit in Dáil Éireann shrugging our shoulders, with the knowledge that there are neighbours in this city and elsewhere who are hungry, who were hungry last night and who will be hungry tomorrow or who are cold, with no means of mitigating the rigours of the weather in their humble abode, wherever it is.  I am going to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that his office imposes upon him personally a grave responsibility to institute whatever inquiries may be necessary to provide against the possibility of such a contingency arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the fact, as all of us with any experience of public life are, that there is often a good deal of loose talk about destitution, hunger, poverty and so forth, but experience has also taught us that where talk continues in a certain vein and consistently from people who are familiar with conditions obtaining, it is usually true to say that there is never any enduring smoke, in any case, without some fire to supply it.  I do not want to paint an unduly pessimistic picture of the situation, but, from the information reaching me.  I believe that there <Col N="35" /> are in tenement rooms in Dublin a considerable number of people in receipt of the old age pension who are familiar with destitution.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any Deputy who consciously wishes that situation to continue and I want to say, as Leader of the Opposition, with the fullest sense of responsibility&mdash;and there is no desire to make points against the Government&mdash;that I believe it to be a first charge on the revenues of this State to ensure that any old person who is not in a position to fend for himself or herself shall be delivered from the possibility of destitution, hunger or cold.  I want to add to that that I do not think it is enough for this House to express that pious sentiment and&mdash;here is where I have a slight difference with my colleague Deputy O'Sullivan; he appeals to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he is failing in his duty if, on being informed by responsible Deputies that this situation obtains in certain cases in the city of Dublin, he does not go out and look for them.</P>
    <P>I think that is a new approach to this problem but it is one about which I have felt deeply for many years.  I do not think a Minister in charge of social services has the right to sit in his office and wait for the destitute aged to come to him.  When he hears in this House, as he does hear from members of the Opposition, and when he hears from his own colleagues, as I do not doubt he hears in the confidence of the Party room, that they are anxious about isolated cases of old age pensioners living alone, it is his duty to go out and look for them.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position today, in this country, any old age pensioner who finds himself or herself living alone and with no other income than the old age pension has a statutory right to approach the local health authority and to require that authority to provide in home assistance such sum as will bridge the gap between what the old age pension provides and the minimum standard of living we think suitable for an old person to enjoy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary any <Col N="36" /> responsibility in this matter or does it rest with the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I do not know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  All I am saying is that is my understanding of the law.  It is clearly the duty of such a Minister to see that the social services are correctly administered. He may reply to me, as I think he probably will, that this is a Supplementary Estimate for old age pensioners and that he is also concerned to provide for blind persons, widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions, unemployment assistance, children's allowances.  I am rejoining that that is not enough, that there are some people hungry and cold who are in receipt of these old age pensions and that the gap ought to be closed between what the old age pension provides and what is available.</P>
      <P>These old people do not know how to go about getting it and it is our duty to seek them out and to see that they are told and if there is somebody, outside the old age pension authority, failing in his duty, then we ought to see that he does his duty to eliminate hunger and cold.  If it transpires that ancillary services are not available to abolish hunger and cold, then, under this service of old age pensions, I suggest to the House that we have a duty to see that hunger and cold are abolished in our neighbour's home.</P>
      <P>I do not want Deputies to think that this represents starry-eyed ideals.  I do not believe it does represent any such thing.  I believe it is the minimum obligation that we have to our own neighbours and it is an obligation which it is well within our capacity to discharge, if somebody will take the initiative about it.  I am putting it to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is his duty.  I do not want to sound as if I am making a personal reflection on him but I want to suggest quite deliberately that if there is some old woman in a tenement room in Dublin hungry and cold to-night, he must answer for it.  That old person does not know that she has these rights. The Parliamentary Secretary does know it and I do not think it is any excessive demand upon him that he should seek these people out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> I am throwing emphasis all the time upon the old age pensioner living alone because I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that where there is a family, they have their obligations, too, and I cannot conceive, in our society, daughters, sons or grandchildren being utterly indifferent to the comfort of the old people who reared them.  They may not have, out of their own slender means, the wherewithal to supplement their pension, but they can busy themselves to see that the social services are invoked to relieve distress in a grandparent's or a parent's home.  It is primarily their duty to do it.  If there is a son, a daughter or a grandchild he or she is primarily responsible for seeking out the home assistance officer or whatever other service may be appropriately available to help out old people whom they themselves are not financially circumstanced to help.  However, the old person with no family to fall back on&mdash;and there are many such, if my information be correct&mdash;has a right to expect the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister to whom he is Parliamentary Secretary to look after him or her.</P>

I accept that in respect of old people who have families to sustain or to help them, but the defenceless old person who finds himself destitute, hungry or cold and has nobody to act for him is the responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Therefore, I amend what my colleague Deputy O'Sullivan says: I do not appeal; I query him: How does it come about that there are old people hungry and cold with no one <Col N="38" /> to speak for them while the Parliamentary Secretary is in his present position?  If he does not concern himself with this problem hereafter he, or anybody else in the position, should be ashamed to have to admit in this House that there are individuals hungry and cold in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or any other city because there is nobody to seek them out and see that whatever provision is made under this Vote will be appropriately supplemented.  I hope that we shall not have it to say hereafter that in our society anybody was left uncared for when through no fault of their own they needed care and comfort.</P>

      <P>I have been prompted to speak on this Estimate, having listened to the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy O'Sullivan. There is nobody in this House who would not like to see Ireland an ideal Christian State in which everybody had enough on which to live.  We on this side of the House have our feelings towards the down-and-out and the people to whom Deputy Dillon referred.  However, since our economic circumstances are such that we cannot improve the situation, we can only do our best, as the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are doing.</P>
      <P>The city of Dublin is one of the most charitable cities in the world. There are many charitable organisations which try to subsidise old age pensioners, the unemployed and other needy people.  We have the Catholic Social Service Conference.  Nobody in the city needs to be hungry.  We have other charitable organisations as well. They are operating successfully in my constituency under the patronage of His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I am merely answering a point the Deputy made. I did not interrupt him.  In this charitable city of Dublin, nobody needs to be hungry.  We should all like to see needy people having a good deal more than they have but our economic circumstances will not permit it.  We should be thankful therefore that we have charitable <Col N="39" /> people in the city of Dublin from all walks of life who are trying to make it easy.  Not alone are the old age pensioners looked after but the unemployed and their families, people who are homeless and others, through no fault of their own, the flotsam and jetsam of society.  There is no city in the world which has as many good people looking after the down-and-out and the poor as has the city of Dublin.  We are very proud of that because they are doing a good job.</P>

      <P>I want to be fair in exchanging views.  It is not right to paint us as heartless people who are not concerned with poor people. We are deeply concerned and if it were possible to give them four times as much as they have, we would do so.  However, when we cannot do that, there are other organisations relieving distress and we can be thankful we have not the people to whom Deputy Dillon referred who will sit in their room cold and hungry without anything to eat.  Nobody needs to go without a meal in this city, due to the wonderful charitable organisations we have here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of old age pensioners, there are certain people who are destitute.  Every Deputy, I am sure, knows of a couple of old age pensioners, in the towns particularly, who have no income except the old age pension.  Perhaps their family are scattered abroad and are not in a position to help them out. They have to exist solely and entirely on the old age pension and no matter what the Parliamentary Secretary may say to the contrary these people find themselves close to destitution.  They may not be exactly starving but they are not provided with bare necessities of life, such as heating, lighting and food, to a sufficient extent.</P>
      <P>I suggest that it is time that that type of old age pensioner should get an increase in his old age pension which would leave him reasonably safe.  I am not talking about old age pensioners living in the country, some of whom may have small holdings, but the few people amongst them who are very close to destitution.  The old age pension at the present time, with the high cost of living, is not sufficient by any means to allow such people to finish their days in the peace and comfort that a civilised society should allow them, just the same as other helpless people should be protected by society.  Without dwelling further on the matter, I suggest there is that section of the old age pensioners who deserve the close attention of the Government and of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that I suppose in every parish we have the anonymous letter-writing busybody, whether it be man or woman, who believes he or she has a divine right to interfere in a neighbour's business and who has nothing more useful to do than to take pen and paper and write to the Minister to say that so-and-so should not be getting the old age pension, or drawing stamp money, as unemployment benefit is called.  I want to make one pointed suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I suggest that no <Col N="41" /> anonymous letter should be treated seriously, that they should all be consigned to the fire or the wastepaper basket straight away.</P>
    <P>Several times it has come to my notice that an investigation officer has called to some old age pensioner or to somebody drawing unemployment assistance and after investigation has found that they were fully entitled to get the money.  It is not good enough for the Department to cause so much upset, heartbreak and anguish to people in receipt of something to which they are perfectly entitled under the laws of this country, with, perhaps, their pension book taken up until the investigation is completed.  No doubt in the case of letters which are signed the officials have a duty to investigate the matter but, on the other hand, if the complaints made in the letter are found to be groundless I suggest that the person who wrote the letter should be made to pay the expenses of the investigation.  That would stop practices of that type.</P>
    <P>I remember in the Land Commission there was a special anonymous mail and I am sure that the same exists in the Parliamentary Secretary's office.  It is a despicable practice; fortunately there are only one or two such people in every parish who believe they have a divine right to examine all their neighbour's business, sometimes from a sense of spite, a warped sense of justice or a warped conscience.  They believe they are called upon to set these things right. The Parliamentary Secretary should consider those two suggestions I have thrown out, (1) that anonymous letters should be consigned to the wastepaper basket, and (2) that where letters are signed and subsequent investigation shows that the complaints have no substance, the letterwriter should be made pay the expenses of the investigation.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking he did not tell us how the saving of £82,000 was arrived at. I for one would like to know how these savings were effected.  I presume they were effected in other branches of his Department but I wonder if the campaign that the Parliamentary Secretary has been carrying on for a <Col N="42" /> good while past, particularly with regard to unemployment benefit and refusing to accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The savings were effected and now he is asking for permission to re-expend these savings on old age pensions and so on, which is very laudable, but I want to know where they came from.  I am suggesting that the only economies which could have been made in the Parliamentary Secretary's branch of the Department were through this campaign carried on against those entitled to unemployment benefit.  He could not have saved £82,000 on staff, travelling expenses or the other heads.  I suggest that he should tell us exactly where they came from.  I am not making a case for those who have been drawing money wrongfully but when we meet the type of person who is qualified for benefits under the Parliamentary Secretary's Department and find that every trick in the bag&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to the debate on this Supplementary Estimate will be entirely confined to what I see here with reference to additional sums required for old age pensions, widows' and orphans' noncontributory pensions and the welfare of the blind.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, or indeed any member of his Party, if they are serious in their expression of opinion that the old age pensioner is not to-day, as has already been stated, on the very verge of starvation.  Most of us in this House, no matter how young we are, will, if God spares us, one day be old. To live to be old is probably a great blessing.  We are told that as we grow older, we grow in experience.  Many people work hard and contribute their share as citizens and live to reach the age of 70 years and then have to endure an existence on 27/6 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people, to-day, no matter to what they had been accustomed until they reached that age, unless they have other means, or unless members of their families are good and kind and generous to them, must exist on 27/6 per week.  I say that sum is far from sufficient to keep any individual in existence to-day.  It is only right that, whilst we should place on record, on an occasion such as this, our appreciation of the work done by charitable organisations in assisting people who are in receipt of old age pensions, it must be borne in mind that there are many thousands of people who are too proud <Col N="44" /> to seek assistance from any charitable organisation.  There are many old age pensioners who are far too proud to make an application to the local authorities for an allowance to supplement their old age pensions, and they are the very type of people who should not be pushed into the most embarrassing position of either having to seek charity from these organisations, or to seek influence, let it be political or otherwise, in order to get an allowance, to supplement their pensions, from the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is not too much to expect from any Government, or any Parliament, that the old, the aged, and the blind, should be in receipt of an allowance sufficient to enable them to live in accordance with Christian decency.  Not only should that allowance be sufficient to enable them to live in accordance with Christian decency, but it should be sufficient to allow them to live independently. I am sorry to say we are reaching the stage in this country&mdash;and it is with regret that I and Deputies on all sides of the House must admit it&mdash; where sons and daughters are very slowly forgetting their responsibilities to their parents.</P>
    <P>Even if they are, and we may very easily put the blame on them and say that they have a moral duty to contribute generously to the upkeep of their parents during their last days on earth, but if they do not display the sympathy towards their parents which they should display, it is very little consolation to the old age pensioners who must continue to suffer.</P>
    <P>That is why I agree with the Leader of the Opposition when he says it is the duty of the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Minister to whom he is responsible, to have this problem thoroughly investigated, and to ensure that if an old age pensioner is too proud either to beg, or to seek assistance from any charitable organisation, his old age pension will be sufficient to enable him to live in accordance with Christian decency, and that he will have an allowance which will enable him to purchase the necessaries of life and keep a roof over his head.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether in recent <Col N="45" /> months, and particularly since the main Estimate was introduced, any instruction has been issued by him, or by the Minister, to make it more difficult for people to qualify for old age pensions. In my own constituency, I find from the number of appeals made to the appeals officer in respect of qualification for an old age pension, that of every six cases at least four are rejected. During the term of the inter-Party Government, it must be admitted all round that first things came first. That Government pinned down the cost of living, particularly in regard to the prices of foodstuffs, and at the same time, they also gave first preference to the old, and the aged, on every occasion on which it was possible to do so.  I think some great measure of economy is being exercised in the Department of Social Welfare, because we appear to see a lesser number of people qualifying for the old age pension.</P>
    <P>I want particularly to refer to the cases where people are asked both by the Church and the State, when they reach the age of 70 years, to give up the reins of office in their holdings, and make way for the young people who are coming on.  I have known many cases where small land owners, and the owners of not very profitable property, in order that a son or a daughter may get married&mdash;or there might be some family settlements to be effected&mdash;surrendered their rights to make way for some young person, but immediately they applied for the old age pension they were met with a reply to the effect that they made over their holdings, or property, merely for the purpose of qualifying for the old age pension, and that in such circumstances the old age pension would not be granted.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare should be very liberal, particularly in cases of this kind, and I feel that encouragement should be given to older people to sit down, and relax, and make way for the younger members of the family, particularly in cases where there is property to be passed over to another member of the family.  In my opinion, the old age pension should be of the same standard <Col N="46" /> as that obtaining in Northern Ireland, and not anything less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. MacCarthy) Acting Chairman (Mr. MacCarthy)">

      <P>If the old age pension is to be the subject of cutting down, or if any economies are being exercised in regard to it by the Department, I think that is a very mean form of economy.  The Parliamentary Secretary should convey to the investigation officers of his Department that in all cases the benefit of the doubt should be given to the old age pensioner.</P>
      <P>It is quite true to say that the old age pensioner who lives alone and has nobody to contribute to his upkeep is more severely handicapped at the moment.  It follows that when he has no other means of support, he cannot possibly be in any other state except a state of destitution, want, and hunger. As has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, and it is well known to members of the Government Party, there are many such people in the city of Dublin, in Limerick, Cork, Drogheda, Dundalk, Sligo, Galway and other thickly populated areas in provincial towns and cities.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary if he can hold out any hope for the old age pensioner who is obliged to live alone with no other source of income.  What is the future, and what are the prospects, for such individuals?</P>
      <P>I should like to go on, if I may, to make reference to the widows.  The widows' pensions are entirely out-of-date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not ask for a change in the law in that regard. However, the law being as it is, I am of opinion that it is more difficult to obtain the widow's pension now than formerly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House is now asked for an additional sum of £80,000 for widows' <Col N="47" /> pensions.  We are entitled to some information as to why it is now more difficult for a widow to qualify for a pension than formerly.  There seems to be a more rigid investigation into her means.  There seems to be a longer delay.  There seems to be an inclination to put the granting of the claim on the long finger.</P>
    <P>Widows are people who are deprived of the bread-winner, through an Act of God.  In a Department such as the Department of Social Welfare, I feel that all other work should be put aside to come to their aid.  I have never been able to understand why a decision could not be given on a widow's claim in from 12 to 15 days.</P>
    <P>Blind pensioners are mentioned in this Supplementary Estimate and an additional £4,300 is required.  Most of us who have anything to contribute to a debate on Social Welfare will, on the main Estimate, have observations of even a stronger character to make in relation to blind pensions than to old age pension or the widow's pension.  To be deprived of one's eyesight is the greatest possible affliction that can befall any person.  No matter how disabled a person may be through the loss of limbs or deafness or any other disability, it all fades into insignificance in comparison with the great affliction of blindness.</P>
    <P>If there is any section to be catered for under the Department of Social Welfare I respectfully submit that blind persons are not properly being catered for in this Estimate and that the Department have not done justice to them today.  The amount provided in respect of blind pensions is insufficient. I feel there are blind persons who because of certain circumstances and for personal reasons may not like to seek supplementary allowances from local authorities or charitable organisations.  The blind pension ought to be sufficient to maintain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I <Col N="48" /> make a serious appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary that he who is responsible for services such as old age pensions, widows' pensions and blind pensions will bear in mind that in all probability he is dealing with the sections of the community worthy of the greatest possible benefits that can be bestowed upon them by any State.  In his reply, the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to convey to this House and to the country what future prosperity, if any, he can hold out for the sections of the community for whom this Supplementary Estimate caters and mainly covers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to what is specified in the Supplementary Estimate&mdash;Savings under Other Subheads.  The Parliamentary Secretary should have explained, when opening the debate, the implications of that Subhead.  In our own way, we are entitled to cross-examine him and find out about it because the savings represent a sum of £82,000.</P>
      <P>I understand that these savings are the moneys of which thousands of persons were deprived during the past year through being cut off assistance allegedly because they were not seeking employment.  I have a feeling the Minister is particularly prejudiced against Dublin.  He expressed views early last year to the effect that a lot of them were chancing their arm.  I feel that what he meant was that a lot of Dubliners were chancing their arm.  To judge by the manner in which he proceeded with his inquisition during the year, I am satisfied he is somewhat prejudiced because of the large number of Dubliners who were deprived of assistance allegedly because they were not seeking what does not exist.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that there is less employment than formerly, especially for men, and that all this talk about &ldquo;productivity&rdquo; means that more things should be produced at less cost.  That is being achieved by the introduction of machinery, which means less employment.  So far as I am aware, there are no positions for male persons in this town.  To deny people assistance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will end by protesting against the rather mean practice of cutting people off from assistance on the grounds that they are not genuinely seeking what does not exist. I will let it go at that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the 2/6 granted to old age pensioners, blind pensioners, widows and orphans and married people on assistance, the Minister states that it is beyond his capacity to grant anything more than that sum of 2/6.  Yet, the Taoiseach said he was prepared to give £10 million towards social assistance in Northern Ireland in the event of any understanding coming about between the North and South.  He said he was prepared to grant benefits which Britain is now granting there by finding £10 million but here we are told that 2/6 is the limit that can be found for our own people on assistance.</P>
      <P>There is much talk about those on assistance, the old age pensioner, and so on, but I must urge that there is a lot to be said for the unemployed man with a family.</P>

      <P>Very well, but I shall deal with all this when the main Estimate comes up.

      <P>I want to make only a few remarks because most of the things I intended to say have been said by the principal speakers in the past half hour.  I want to repeat one of them.  The Parliamentary Secretary should take cognisance of a question put to him by Deputy O.J. Flanagan. Did he send out a circular or instruction to officers down the country that there should be a tightening up, that they should get tough?  If he did, it is as well to tell the house; if he did not, it is as well to deny it because it is being freely said down the country that he has done so.</P>
      <P>I myself doubt that a man like the Parliamentary Secretary should, on attaining such an office as he has, turn himself into a Bumble or a Scrooge for his Department.  I was sorry that there was a titter from the Fianna Fáil benches when Deputy Dillon was speaking about destitute old people who were alone and hungry.  Then Deputy Burke stood up to refute that and said there was no necessity for anybody to be hungry in Dublin.  People who went before us in the running of this country said there was no necessity for anybody to be starving in Ireland during the Famine.  They had plenty of soup and yellow-meal but they died in their millions.  There are still enough people in this country, thank God, who have pride and who would die from hunger before they would become suppliants of any charitable organisation, with all due respect to the charitable organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud to say that, in the city from which I come, before the State or anybody else thought of looking after old people there were nearly 20 charitable organisations set up by fine, decent people and endowed by them. Many of them are still running.  Nobody said that they were set up by the Ascendancy.  They were set up by the Catholic James Fanning and the Fanning Institute is still running in Waterford. They were set up by the Catholic Edward Walsh and the Holy Ghost Hospital is still running.  The Walshes and the Matthew Sheas are people who <Col N="51" /> did not come from Czechoslovakia or from the Ascendancy, as can be guessed from their names.  There are also very fine institutions like the Burchill Institute but even in respect of all these, there are people who would die before they would go to them.</P>
    <P>It is for these people that Deputy Dillon was speaking.  It would not be fashionable now to see a man writing a classic in English on this.  I could quote from a classic the part that would be relevant in this debate.  Two gentlemen called on a person who they thought was a likely subscriber for the purpose of asking him to subscribe to the poor at Christmas.  The likely subscriber asked: &ldquo;Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?&rdquo;  One of the gentlemen said there were.  The likely client went on to talk about other places to which poor people could go.  These two gentlemen said: &ldquo;Well, many would rather die than go there.&rdquo;  The answer they got from Scrooge was that if they liked to die, they had better die there and diminish the surplus population.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary would not like himself to be lined up with Mr. Scrooge, but if he is not in a position to deny that he has given instructions to the officers down the country that they are to tighten up on the widows and orphans, the poor and old age pensioners, then he can be lined up with Scrooge.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick mentioned the matter of anonymous letters to the Department.  I would say to the Parliamentary Secretary that if such letters were received, I would deplore any of his officers taking any notice of them or that in this year of grace, we should have the equivalent of a <i>letter de cachet</i> brought in and used as a weapon and as a stab in the back against old or destitute people.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies mentioned savings. The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that in his address here.  He said that savings will arise on other subheads of the Vote, mainly on subhead B&mdash;Children's Allowances and subhead C&mdash;Unemployment Assistance. That is a shameful state of affairs at a time when people are being driven to emigration.  Probably <Col N="52" /> a great many of them are being driven to emigrate because the assistance was denied them.</P>
    <P>Last year, I had to withstand the jeers of Deputy Corry in connection with what I said in this House with regard to children.  I said that in the town of Tallow in my constituency&mdash; in this fine town of Tallow&mdash;last May, there were no children for the first Holy Communion class.  Deputy Corry was able to make great fun out of that.  The point about it is that the Parliamentary Secretary was able to save a substantial sum of money on Children's Allowances.</P>
    <P>There must be other places in County Waterford where the number of children dropped.  We read in the papers every day that it is not merely a case of the breadwinner of the family emigrating but that whole families are packing up and getting out.  If this is the line of country the Government intend to follow, it is a bad line.  If the Parliamentary Secretary says that the raising of the old age pensions will cost so much money and that it is impossible to find such money or that it would be impossible to relieve old people or the widows and orphans, I would remind him that that was said by his former Leader in 1947 when he stated that it would be impossible, in any circumstances, to give any advance in old age pensions.</P>
    <P>Early in 1947, legislation was brought before this House to increase substantially the old age pension and not only that but to raise the means test from £39 to £104. 10s.  That made it possible for a great many more people to qualify for the pension. These are things of which I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary should take notice, particularly the question that I and others such as Deputies Sherwin and Flanagan have asked&mdash; did he give instructions to his officers to tighten up and be &ldquo;tough&rdquo; with their investigations?</P>
    <P>I hope that in his reply he will be able to justify himself as far as these anonymous letters are concerned and that he will even give an instruction to his officers not to be so &ldquo;tough&rdquo; and to members of his own Party to <Col N="53" /> stop writing letters, especially after elections as they did in Wexford, to his Department to ensure that a man who had gone into the polling station on behalf of Fine Gael would have his unemployment assistance stopped just because he did go in.  No anonymous letter was sent about that; the letter was sent by Gorey Fianna Fáil Cumann.  I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say in his reply that a more generous view will be taken in the future and that, as far as the stabs-in-the-back and anonymous letters are concerned, his Department will take less notice of them in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy) Michael Joseph Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the Budget of 1959 the existing provision for Social Welfare was increased by £883,000 in respect of eight months of the present financial year, an increase equivalent to £1,313,000 in respect of a full year.  An additional shilling a week on old age and blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment assistance, disability benefit and unemployment benefit, including an additional shilling for adults and child dependants, where payable, would cost £1,078,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think from the debate that we were bringing in a motion to decrease the amount given to old age pensioners, to widows and orphans, etc. Listening to Deputy Lynch one would think there was a tragic decrease in children's allowances.  The over-estimation was .05 per cent and, in a Vote of nearly £22,000,000 in the present financial year, that is not a great mistake. If you take the whole of the Book of Estimates and see what was spent on social services in the Department of Social Welfare it represents a big percentage of the total expenditure of the State and, for a State of our size, our population and our wealth it is a very big sum.  I cannot give exact figures but I think the population is about 2,850,000 and when you tax the people to the tune of between £22,000,000 and £23,000,000 to provide social services, apart from the cost of administration, it is a fairly good tax. That does not take into account what <Col N="54" /> local authorities spend, or the supplemental grants to old age pensioners or to blind people and other things that do not come to mind at the moment&mdash; the subsidy to the fuel scheme, the free school meals in cities and Gaeltacht areas, etc.  To twit us, as Deputy Lynch has been doing, and put us in the category of Scrooge just paints his picture too luridly and kills any case he was trying to make.</P>
    <P>We have no apologies to offer about social welfare.  We initiated social welfare in many spheres even before it was thought of in most European countries.  When the ex-President was Minister for Local Government he initiated the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Scheme.  It was unheard of in Britain then and did not come into operation there for years afterwards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made a plea for the old age pensioners with no means.  It was not the first time he made that plea.  He is on record as advocating the appointment of an almoner in certain cities to investigate these cases. That is the responsibility of the local authority and the matter needs sympathetic consideration.  Deputy Flanagan referred to some of these people. They are too proud to ask for any supplement to their old age pension and we cannot blame them for that. They are human beings like ourselves; they were reared, perhaps, in very good circumstances and the battle of life got them down when they reached 70 years of age.  They have that little independence and dislike of the slur of the workhouse and to&mdash;I do not know what it was formerly called but what is now called&mdash;home assistance.  Their natural feelings prevent their seeking it.  When I read in the papers about an old person living by himself, falling into the fire and being burned to death, I often think what a tragedy it is. Every Deputy knows that if these old people were approached to go into a home of any kind, they would resist doing so, and very often when their own people come to their relief, they will not have them.  It is a big problem.</P>
    <P>I want to put this question to Deputies: If any Government brought in a Bill to deal exclusively with the people mentioned by Deputy O.J. Flanagan and <Col N="55" /> Deputy Dillon&mdash;the old age pensioners without any means, who account for between 23,000 and 26,000 of the total number of 161,000 old age pensioners &mdash;would the House agree?  Would there not be an uproar because the other old-age pensioners were not getting the same increase?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is not suggesting that such old-age pensioners should go into the county home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest any such thing.  I suggested there was a problem in regard to old-age pensioners living alone.  I have nothing to say against the county home.  In the county homes, they have nurses and doctors and the best of food and care.  The county homes in Loughrea and Carrick-on-Shannon, for instance, are comparable with the best in Europe.  I did not advocate that these people should go into the county homes or any other homes.  I said that old people of 70 and 80 living by themselves would be better off in the matter of their own safety and nourishment, if they could be induced to go into a home.</P>
      <P>The Nazareth Home in Cork has been rightly held up as a model home for old people.  There they study their food requirements and everything else.  In these homes, only a small proportion of the old-age pension is retained for maintenance; the rest is given to the pensioners as pocket money.  Where they are able to go out to the local town, they are free to go.  Under the new physiotherapy treatment coming more into use, they are often rehabilitated. Those who were bedridden previously are now able to move around.  But notwithstanding all these benefits, they preserve their independence and live alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with this matter in the Seanad, I said, in reply to a Senator who was talking about the kind of food necessary, that even if you put the finest food you could think of on their shelves, these people's food would be bread and tea because that <Col N="56" /> is all they are capable of preparing. By and large, I want to endorse Deputy P.J. Burke's statement that the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Legion of Mary in the country areas are doing a lot of good work. However this class of people are very hard to handle.  It is a problem on which we always keep a sympathetic eye.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin told me that I am against Dublin.  I want to take him up on that.  I would refer him to Deputy Dillon's contribution to the debate.  Under our Constitution, in common with the countries on this side of the Iron Curtain, family responsibility is accepted.  The members of the family are not treated as digits or individuals.  It is the recognised thing in a Christian Society that the members of a family have a bounden and moral duty to see after the welfare of the old members of the family, irrespective of any old-age pension.  There is a school of thought in the city here which says that is wrong, that each individual member must stand on his own and be treated individually.  I believe that is the worst thing that could happen in any State.  We do not encourage it; we frown on it; and we shall make war on it, wherever it exists.  It would be bad for society and for the nation that we should go on in that way.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about investigating officers.  I am accused of giving a direction to them to tighten up, to be tough and everything else.  No such direction has ever been given, but there is this fact, that when an investigating officer, a social welfare officer or a pensions officer investigates a claim for an old-age pension and the claimant is the holder of a qualification certificate for unemployment assistance, the valuation of which was based on 1940 valuations, by our direction he must take into account the present day valuations and apply them. He cannot apply a 5/- valuation to an able-bodied son and a £5 valuation to the father, now helpless and looking for an old age pension.  There must be fair administration and the valuation of goods and chattels for the old-age <Col N="57" /> pension must apply all round to the holders of qualifying certificates in respect of unemployment assistance.  That is the only direction in the Department, and that direction remains.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan made a mistake when referring to my introductory statement.  We were dealing at that time only with the institutions catering for the blind.  We have had to increase the capitation grants to these institutions. Good work is being done in these institutions and they are included in the increases under this Vote. Deputy O.J. Flanagan can rest assured that the welfare of the blind is always a prime consideration in our Department. We have co-ordinated the workshops and set them up in Upper Baggot Street.  The Richmond Institute is closed and all the workshops are now under one management.</P>
    <P>We have trained a number of girls who are blind, and some boys, to be good telephonists.  We have placed them in some of the Departments and certain business houses have helped us out by employing them also.  By and large, they have proved themselves better telephonists than those who have full sight and I would appeal to anybody who can persuade any business house, or individual that would employ them, to employ them, not for charitable reasons but for their efficiency and they can be assured of a very good result.  These girls are more than attentive and what they lack in vision they more than make up in brain power and capacity, and we are very proud of them, wherever they work.</P>
    <P>It is within the capacity and the power of local authorities, where the old age pension is not enough to sustain life and give frugal comfort to a pensioner, to supplement that pension. Indeed, there is a duty to do that.  It is done very well in Dublin, and I think, in Cork, and we have always encouraged local authorities to help the old age pensioner who has no means.  Deputy Dillon, at one time, advocated the appointment of an almoner for the city, to find these cases and bring them to official notice. I have indicated that certain charitable organisations do this work, but then there are the isolated cases in rural <Col N="58" /> Ireland, and I admit it is very hard to reach them.  However, it is the duty of public representatives and parish committees to do what they can in such cases and I think there has been an all-round improvement in that matter.  We would like the help of public representatives in pointing out to these old age pensioners the benefits they can get.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan said that it is more difficult to obtain a widow's pension now than formerly but I want to point out that there has been no change whatsoever in the means test and, if the Deputy will indicate to me any case of unreasonable treatment in the awarding of a widow's pension, I shall have it investigated and, if any injustice has been done, I shall see that it is rectified.</P>
    <P>On the question of the assignment of farms, there is provision under the social welfare code that where a father or mother assigns, or both assign, a farm of £30 valuation or under to a son or daughter, the full old age pension can be obtained, provided there is no joint ownership, and they can stipulate in the assignment maintenance and a room for themselves. Where the valuation is over £30 and an assessment is made and a marriage is completed in time, the old age pension becomes automatically payable, but then there are cases of assignments for the purpose of marriage and very often the marriage does not take place.  That is where the Department is strict, and rightly so, because the thing is not straight and above-board. But, where the valuation is £30, or under, there is a complete granting of the old age pension and, as rural Deputies are aware, 64 per cent. of the farms of Ireland are £30 valuation, or under, so that there is no difficulty in getting the pension.</P>
    <P>I have already given the figure of old age pensions, 161,000, and 94 per cent. of them are straight cases that have no trouble with investigation officers, but there is the other 6 per cent. and that is where the trouble lies. Any sensible Deputy, listening to me, in Opposition or in my own Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A person involved in such a case then approaches a Deputy and asks him for his aid in having the pension granted.  Of course, that is what Deputies are there for, to make a case and to make the poor mouth for the person who, under a strict legal interpretation, is not entitled to a pension. By and large, Deputies get away with about 80 per cent. of the claims they make.</P>

Would he now look into the case of a childless couple who adopt a nephew or a niece, and that nephew or niece works on and on with them in the hope of some day becoming the owner of the farm.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My assumption is that over the years, with a certain amount of emigration of persons in the twenties and thirties, they just are not in the State when the time comes that they reach the age of 70 and that <Col N="60" /> accounts for the decrease in the actual number of people over 70 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>People are living longer but there would have to be no emigration from the State for that fact to be reflected in the group of people over 70 years of age.</P>
      <P>I hope I have dealt with the various points raised by Deputies.  This vote is for well over £1 million of an increase.  No direction has been given to social welfare officers to tighten up. The only direction they have got is, when they investigate a claim for an old age pension, if there is a qualification certificate in the same house, they must investigate it also.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a supplementary sum not exceeding £32,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission (44 &amp; 45 Vict., c. 49, sec. 46, and c. 71, sec. 4; 48 &amp; 49 Vict., c. 73, secs. 17, 18 and 20; 54 &amp; 55 Vict., c. 48; 3 Edw. 7, c. 37; 7 Edw. 7, c. 38 and c. 56; 9 Edw. 7, c. 42; Nos. 27 and 42 of 1923; No. 25 of 1925; No. 11 of 1926; No. 19 of 1927; No. 31 of 1929; No. 11 of 1930; No. 11 of 1931; Nos. 33 and 38 of 1933; No. 11 of 1934; No. 41 of 1936; No. 26 of 1939; No. 12 of 1946; No. 25 of 1949; No. 16 of 1950; No. 18 of 1953; and No. 21 of 1954).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving this Supplementary Estimate I am seeking the authority of the House for additional gross expenditure of £65,350 by the Land Commission in this current year on certain items of land settlement.  It is anticipated that the gross expenditure of £65,350 will be offset by savings on other subheads amounting in all to £31,600 and by an increased yield of £1,750 in Appropriations-in-Aid items, thus leaving the required net supplementary provision at £32,000.  The subheads for which additional finance is necessary and the amounts required are:&mdash; subhead I&mdash; Improvement of Estates etc., £50,000; Subhead R&mdash;Purchase of Interests for Cash, £14,000; Subhead S&mdash;Gratuities for ex-employees, £1,350.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, expenditure on improvement works amounted to just over £648,000.  This year, a sum of £639,605 was provided for the Subhead but it will be recalled that, when the main Estimate was introduced last June, it was made clear that revised expenditure <Col N="62" /> proposals would be made if the amount proved to be inadequate.  The present financial position of the Subhead is that a sum of £613,000 has been expended up to the end of February, leaving a balance of £26,605 available for expenditure for the remaining weeks of the year up to the end of this month.  It is in these final weeks each year that land settlement activity reaches its peak, with a pronounced acceleration of improvements operations to facilitate allotment in time for seasonal farming operations. Expenditure in these final weeks is usually well in excess of the average weekly expenditure up to then.  Having regard to total expenditure up to the end of February and to the extent of works in progress, it is estimated that an additional sum of £50,000 will be necessary to finance essential improvement works up to the end of this month and to discharge commitments incurred earlier and now falling due for payment.</P>
    <P>The additional expenditure is attributable largely to two factors&mdash;the exceptional volume of land settlement effected last year and the very fine weather in the Summer and Autumn of 1959 which greatly facilitated the outdoor operations of the Land Commission. Expansion in land settlement inevitably leads to an increase in the volume of essential improvement works.  A substantial propertion of the remarkably high allotment figure of last year was effected in the period January to March, 1959, and on many estates it was impracticable to carry out the improvement works until the early months of the current financial year.</P>
    <P>This carry-over of works, in conjunction with the demands of the present year's operations, added considerably to the expenditure on the Sub-head.</P>
    <P>Subhead R provides the finance for the purchase of land for cash in the open market, pursuant to Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950.  The application of this Section is restricted to lands required to provide holdings for migrants or to facilitate re-arrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots.  Up to July, 1956, limited progress was made in the application <Col N="63" /> of this Section and from then until March, 1958, operations were suspended as an economy measure. Activity was resumed in April, 1958, and, since then, a gradual improvement in intake has been effected.  Last year, the voted provision of £25,000 was fully expended and purchase commitments amounting to £14,000 were carried over into the present year. The discharge of these commitments reduced the effective provision for this year from £25,000 to £11,000.  This sum has proved entirely inadequate to finance current operations and, consequently, an additional provision of £14,000 is now required.  I am anxious to expand the intake of land through this medium and I hope to provide more money for the subhead in next year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>Excess expenditure is also anticipated on Subhead S, which provides funds for the payment of gratuities to persons displaced from employment consequent on the acquisition and resumption of lands by the Land Commission. A sum of £1,750 was originally provided in this year's Estimate but it is now anticipated that £3,100 will be required.  It is virtually impossible to forecast accurately the amount likely to be required by way of these gratuities for a full year.</P>
    <P>Taking account, therefore, of the savings on other Subheads and the increased yield from Appropriations-in-Aid, the net provision for which I am seeking the authority of the House is £32,000, to finance the important land settlement items to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I need scarcely mention that the business of the Land Commission and the whole subject of land settlement will come up for general discussion very soon when the Estimate for Lands for the year 1960/61 comes to be debated in the House.  Meanwhile, I confidently recommend the Supplementary Estimate of £32,000 now presented.</P>

I notice there is a further sum of £14,000 under Subhead R for the purchase <Col N="64" /> of interests for cash under Sections 27 and 28 of the Land Act 1950, and that the Minister forecasts his intention of expanding activities under the provisions of this Act in the coming year.  That is a refreshing declaration for those of us who sat where he is now and heard him and Deputy Vivion de Valera tearing passion to tatters about the iniquitous and deplorable character of these very powers when the 1950 Land Act was before the House as a Bill. It is astonishing the number of conversions of which we are witness; it is becoming a positive embarrassment.  At present the Minister for Industry and Commerce is clasping the Irish Industrial Development Authority to his bosom having denounced it in this House and having solemnly pledged the electorate he would not be back in office very long when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The latest Minister to have caught the measles is the Minister for Lands.  He is now doing public penance for his past folly.  The only thing which sometimes tends to exasperate me is that I have never seen a body of men suffering from political measles which showed less evidence of rash upon their countenances.  They seem to have lost the capacity to blush.  However, it consoles me to remember that in an ordinary case of measles, when the rash does not come out, the measles prove to be a fatal disease.  I trust this will pass over into the sphere of political measles and that the Government's incapacity to blush for their deplorable inconsistencies is evidence of their early political dissolution and the substitution of a Government who have some coherent policy to put before the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing this because of the intention announced by the Minister for Lands to maximise the purchase of interests for cash under Sections 27 and 28 of the Land Act, 1950, which he himself denounced in this House in all its moods and tenses as bad legislation under which no Minister for Lands should operate.  It is good that he should be reminded of it so that he will go back and further study the speeches of Deputy Blowick when he was Minister for Lands and thus acquire more wisdom than this Supplementary Estimate provides evidence of.</P>
      <P>The purposes under which land may be acquired under Sections 27 and 28 are restricted; one of them is migration, and the other is relief of rundale. There would be no difficulty in the mind of any of us as to the desirability of operating, as far as it can operate, the relief of rundale, but we ought to ask ourselves a question as to the general administration of the Department of Lands in regard to the migration of tenants.  When I first had anything to do with the Land Commission, it was thought that a 20-acre holding was an economic holdings.  That was increased to 25 acres and now I think it is 33 acres.  These figures had relation to a situation in the past.  The position now, certainly in that part of Ireland which is west of the Shannon is that there is a very strong pull on our people to leave the land in favour of industrial employment in Great Britain and the United States because the monetary wages obtainable there have become so attractive.  However, that is not the only spur to migration from the land in the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see, this House has completely forgotten, under this Fianna Fáil Government, that as you increase the cost of living you can compensate the wage earner by an upward adjustment of his wages but the small farmer, the 20 to 30-acre farmer in the west of Ireland, is being caught between the upper and nether millstones in that his cost of living is rising steeply and the <Col N="66" /> cost of everything he has to sell is going down.  The situation is rapidly developing in which a 33-acre holding is no longer a holding on which a farmer can rear a family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is losing sight of this point, and I am not without hope he will learn wisdom from me and from Deputy Blowick.  I am asking why we should provide money to migrate a man from 12 acres in Connemara to 26 acres in East Mayo because I think that is nugatory expenditure, that we are simply moving him from the absolutely impossible to the virtually unworkable.  I am suggesting that if we are to migrate families hereafter with the intention of settling them permanently in their new abode&mdash;and it is an expensive operation to migrate a family at all&mdash;we ought to see they are settled in an abode which will provide them with a modest standard of comfort sufficient to dissuade them from abandoning it and moving to London, Manchester or Birmingham. I wonder if Deputies realise the extent <Col N="67" /> to which whole families have migrated in the last few years from what used to be regarded as economic holdings in Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo and Clare.</P>

      <P>The size of the holding allotted to a migrant would not arise for discussion on this Supplementary Estimate.  That would be a matter for the main Estimate on which discussion on administration and general policy would be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing that we should not spend this money transferring migrants in order to enable them to pull up their stumps, abandon the holding and leave the country.  The purpose of this power is to allow the Minister to buy holdings in the relatively&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;relatively&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;uncongested areas.  I am suggesting that if the Minister contemplates doing that and moving families from the extremely congested area or from rundale, he will have to face the fact that he will have to acquire holdings of a size and character which will operate to persuade the migrant to stay in his new abode.</P>
      <P>I might make a suggestion of an alternative character but it would involve legislation and I know I am precluded from discussing that on this or on any other Estimate.  But I do want to urge upon the Minister that in operating this section&mdash;as I am glad to see he intends to operate it&mdash;he should bear in mind the kind of holding that is suitable, in the light of the vastly increased cost of living which the small farmer has to bear and the rapidly-dwindling income which is to be derived from his labour.  I am prepared, in deference to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to pursue this matter in greater detail on the general Estimate and the Vote on Account, but I think the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are here present ought to join with me in extending congratulations to the Minister for the very modest degree of illumination which this Supplementary Estimate suggests he has derived from the wisdom of his predecessor, Deputy Blowick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the five members of the <Col N="68" /> Fianna Fáil Party here present will join with me in suggesting to the Minister for Lands that this would be a suitable occasion on whch to do penance for his past performances.  He repudiated the Land Act of 1950, with special reference to Section 27 and Section 28.  He now wants more money to expend under these sections and he tells us that next year, he will want still more and more.  I am glad that Deputy Blowick is here to see the spiritual regeneration of one whom he and I at one time thought irredeemable. The age of miracles has not passed.  It is a source of satisfaction to me to be able to say of the Minister that one things I know: whereas he was blind, now he is beginning to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tell us that up to the end of February, a sum of £613,000 had been spent, leaving a balance of £26,000 for the remaining weeks, the month of March.  I understood from the Minister that now an additional £50,000 was required, along with the £26,000.  Is the £26,000 on hands part of the £50,000?  In regard to Subhead I, I want to ask the Minister if he continued a device&mdash;I can find no other name for it&mdash;of his immediate predecessor, Deputy Childers, in regard to expenditure under this subhead.  I refer to the attempt to get the allottees who obtained an addition to their holdings to fence their holdings themselves.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is continuing that scheme, I want to describe it, first, as mad, secondly as futile and thirdly as very bad management and as indicating a very poor understanding of the type of allottee.  The ordinary allottee in many cases can only afford to work off the little holding which he has and cannot afford to fence his holding.  If the Minister is continuing that, I want to warn him that he is doing a very foolish thing, because he is asking people to do the impossible because they are absolutely unable to do such a huge job of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to see that expenditure under this subhead is up but the Minister did not give us the reasons for the increase.  He condensed his remarks very much.  Have wages gone <Col N="69" /> up in different parts of the country? Is it due to the increased volume of work, or have the materials for building houses, outoffices and so on gone up, or again, is it all due purely to the increased volume of work which has been carried out?  If that is so, I am very proud of it and I should like to congratulate the Minister, because the Minister will probably find, as I found, that it is not easy to get money for this subhead.  It is money that is employed on one of the best jobs being done by any Government Department.</P>
    <P>As I have said thousands of times, the money spent on improvements, additions and enlargements to uneconomic holdings will give a chance to people to live economically without any help from the State.  These people who find themselves on uneconomic holdings are not responsible for it to a large extent.  It is shrouded in the mists of history and goes back to the days of Cromwell when the people were told &ldquo;To hell or to Connaught.&rdquo; It was fiercely accelerated later on by the disastrous method of subdivision.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister's officials in the Land Commission on the progress made.  The amount of work to be done now in the relief of congestion, migration and the development of uneconomic holdings is very small.  On the main Estimate, I should like the Minister to give us an idea of how long the remaining hard core will take to crack up, because it is a hard core now.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead R, relating to the purchase of land for cash in the open market by the Land Commission, the Minister is looking for an additional sum of £14,000.  I presume that amount is to defray commitments already entered into for the purchase of holdings. Will the Minister tell us where they are, whether they are for migrants only or whether they are for migrants and the part relief of congestion?</P>
    <P>There is rather a big jump under Subhead S, dealing with gratuities to displaced employees.  There is a sum of £1,350 under that subhead and in that regard I want to make one brief remark.  My experience was that under the methods employed to determine <Col N="70" /> compensation for displaced employees the compensation was rather tight-fisted.  I shall not use the word &ldquo;niggardly&rdquo;, but it was approaching that.  I suggest that the Commissioners, in their determination of what is fair compensation for displaced employees &mdash;for what really amounts to loss of employment&mdash;should be a little more generous.</P>
    <P>The inspectors, of course, dealing with cases where employees are knocked out of work through acquisition have to furnish reports and so on. Of necessity, they furnish a very cold and matter of fact account of the displaced person's means and so on, and very often the displacement or the loss of employment, particularly where it was employment over a long number of years, is accompanied by something else, the personal interest the displaced employee had in the work.  That is not taken into account, and it should be.  In the acquisition of land, sometimes allowance is made for disturbance of occupation, which is much the same thing.  It does not apply to displaced employees and it ought to.</P>
    <P>On the general work of the Land Commission, I want to say that I am very glad the progress they are making is so speedy, because, now and again, we read, or hear from uninformed people, that the work has been going on too long already.  That does not take into account the fact that the Land Commission have had many jobs saddled on their shoulders which were never thought of when they first started to work.  It does not take into account the fact that wars, and various other events, have hampered them and frozen their activities.  I know from my own experience of the inspectorial staff and the other officials in the Land Commission and the Department of Lands, that they have done a magnificent job which has been looked upon with envy by other countries which have a fragmentation problem such as we had 60 or 70 years ago.  Switzerland, parts of Spain, and some of the small European countries, are looking with envy and admiration at the work which the Land Commission have carried out here under the British and our own native Governments.</P>

      <P>I should very much like to associate myself with what the Leader of the Opposition stated, with very special reference to the manner in which the Minister's views have altered and changed, particularly in regard to the Land Act, 1950.  There are those of us who remember the determined, energetic and bitter opposition which the Government displayed to the 1950 Land Act, and there are those of us who recall in bitter memory the savage and brutal attacks made on that Land Act, and the unwarranted criticism which hampered the actions of the Minister for Lands at the time and the Government which brought in that Act.</P>
      <P>We were even told by the Fianna Fáil Party that whenever the opportunity presented itself, in view of the serious nature of the terms of that Act, they would lose no time in having it repealed.  However, time and a calm perusal of the position on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party have now forced them to admit the wisdom and the wise counsel of the Minister at the time, and the wisdom of this House in passing the 1950 Land Act.  I welcome the Minister's most recent conversion and I trust that his extraordinary conversion is only one of many conversions to follow.</P>
      <P>In this Supplementary Estimate, we see that an additional £50,000 is provided for the improvement of estates. I should like to urge that many of the improvements carried out on estates by the Land Commission&mdash;and particularly estates on main roads&mdash;should embody more up-to-date and modern structural and architectural work.  I think the concrete stakes and wire are mean-looking on improvement works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting the types of improvement which should be carried out, and I am trying to convey to the Minister that, if he intends to spend this £50,000 on the type of improvements that have been carried out on holdings, it might be <Col N="72" /> better if he sought a larger sum than he is seeking, and did the job in a more up-to-date and modern way, even it were to be of a more expensive character.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, quite a lot of land has been divided and, in the past 12 months, a number of new homes have been erected.  I note that because the out-offices are so convenient to the homes, it takes the good look off the fairly decent and respectable-looking houses erected.  Not too far from the town of Mountrath, the old clodbank fence was used, even though it has not been thought a good deal of in many quarters and it looked better than the wire and concrete stakes.  I would urge on the Minister, when he is in consultation with the Land Commission with regard to improvements to farms, that the question of expense should be taken into consideration in relation to the situation of the holdings improved. I shall have much more to say on that subject on the main Estimate.</P>
      <P>Subhead R. provides funds for the purchase of land for cash in the open market.  In the past 12 months, the Land Commission have not gone sufficiently into the open market.  I remember the Minister making a statement in the House, certainly within the past 12 months, when I asked him a question about the general policy of the Land Commission in getting more extensively into the open market for the purchase of holdings.  I am sure the Minister will agree that, pursuant to Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, entering into the public market for the purchase of lands for the relief of migrants is a very wise and very good step.  Many farms have come on the public market, and many farms are still coming on the public market, and the amount the Minister now seeks is only a fly-blow compared with what I am glad to see will be provided in the main Estimate for the next financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Providing more money for the purchase of holdings in the open market is, in my opinion, a wise and a good policy.  It gives a guaranteed market for the vendor who is anxious to sell. I am glad to say that in my experience, <Col N="73" /> when the Land Commission entered the public market, they have always paid a fair price for land.  As well as that, they are looked upon by the general public as a good purchaser and a good customer.  Most of the disturbance we have had in connection with the acquisition of land for the relief of migrants would not have taken place if more regard had been had to the fact that lands are better taken by purchase and agreement with the vendor, rather than that the Land Commission should use compulsory powers to acquire lands.</P>
    <P>The Minister only now sees the wisdom of that policy, but, if that policy had been implemented continuously since 1950, I venture to say greater strides would have been made in the relief of congestion, the rearrangement of holdings and the placing of migrants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with it in the main Estimate and that is why I shall not say any more about it now.  I should like to ask the Minister would he not use Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, for the purchase of holdings for the resettlement of farmers in the Shannon valley?</P>
      <P>I do not know what type of people the Land Commission have in mind for the holdings they will get when the lands under Section 50 of the Land Act are purchased.  I presume they mean the economic smallholders in the West of Ireland.  We are all anxious that those people will be catered for and will be given good land that will enable them to have a good existence.  Since the 1950 Land Act, such holdings may be provided on the open market and purchased for migrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister consider the Shannon Valley an area in relation to which he can describe those who are anxious to get out of it as migrants? If not, I would ask him to do so. Whatever may be said about the small holders in the West&mdash;in Connemara, Galway, Roscommon, Mayo, Leitrim <Col N="74" /> or wherever they may be&mdash;the small farmers, particularly the very small farmers, on the banks of the Shannon, deserve priority in cases of resettlement on decent holdings in the midlands and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission's generosity has been questioned here on the payment of compensation to those who lose their employment when the Land Commission acquire by purchase, compulsorily or otherwise, a large holding for the relief of congestion.  It is very difficult to purchase a holding without affecting someone's employment. The Land Commission have the power, the authority and the means of generosly compensating such people as may lose their employment.  Unfortunately they have not been overgenerous in their treatment of such persons.</P>
    <P>A man may have given long and faithful service and maybe, on a very large holding, a few generations of his family may have given good service there.  Due to the intervention of the Land Commission, the employment of industrious agricultural workers is immediately endangered.  Most of these people would be very glad to be provided with a small house and a portion of the land on the estate.  For some reason or another, the Land Commission do not seem to offer land to such people and prefer to compensate them financially.</P>
    <P>In many cases, I expect the displaced workers would be anxious to seek employment elsewhere and would be prepared to accept a substantial sum of money from the Land Commission.  In such cases, I would ask the Minister to bear in mind, and to convey to the Land Commission, that the Land Commission should consider the special circumstances of the ability of the displaced person for work in accordance with his age and his family circumstances and whether or not he may be able to find employment in his own country.  If he and his family must emigrate I urge that special consideration be given to his case and that as far as possible the financial compensation to be provided for him will enable him to educate his family, <Col N="75" /> if he has children, and if possible, assist him in setting up any little industry he may be anxious to establish. If the Land Commission see fit not to give him a portion of the land on the estate I urge that they give special thought under this scheme towards assisting him, if he so desires, to purchase a portion of land in the area.</P>
    <P>A number of people have lost their employment through the intervention of the Land Commission in estates. They claim they have not been over-generously treated.  This is a very important section in our Land Acts and it is one in relation to which the Land Commission should extend their generosity.  Such cases are not too numerous.  The Land Commission should treat them as generously as possible.  Whatever the manner in which they are to be treated, I urge that they be provided for.  The Land Commission should look a long way ahead in seeing that wherever compensation is payable will be based on regard to the family position of the displaced person and will be generous.</P>
    <P>I am not altogether in favour of the present administration of the Land Acts.  I am in complete disagreement with the general policy of the Land Commission.  That is not a matter which we can explore to-day; it will come up for review on the main Estimate.  I trust that the Minister for Lands and the Lands Commission will bear in mind that they have probably the greatest responsibility of all in this State to-day, namely, the setting-up of our people on the land; the keeping and maintenance of our people on the land and the provision of proper economic holdings for those who have not got them.  It is a great responsibility.  The amount of money provided in last year's Estimate has not been at all sufficient to cope with the demand.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Land Commission have expended money in my constituency deserves a word of praise.  The manner in which the money has been spent may have fallen short of our expectations but it is only right that the difficult problems facing the inspectors and officials <Col N="76" /> should be recognised.  It is not possible to please everybody.  They are men of commonsense and sound judgment.  All they need is a progressive land policy on which they can work.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have taken the first step towards a good land policy for this country by concentrating on the Land Act of 1950. I trust we shall hear more from the Minister on the main Estimate because of his statement to-day that he is anxious to extend the intake of land through this medium and hopes to provide more money for the Subhead in this year's Estimate.  Is it too much to ask the Minister that, when preparing his speech for the Estimate for the coming year, he will, as far as possible and in as great detail and length as possible, indicate the programme for next year in so far as the spending of money under this Subhead is concerned?</P>
    <P>The improvement of estates, the purchase of interests for cash and the gratuities are the main items to be covered by the Supplementary Estimate. We have no objections on this side of the House to the passage of the Estimate to give these moneys to the Minister for Lands, but I hope he bears in mind the fact that over the past 12 months, the amount of the emigration that has taken place from rural Ireland can be described as fantastic and the small farms in the country that now have galvanised iron across the windows and padlocks nailed to the doors are probably beyond count.  It is only by means of a courageous land policy that we can face up to these problems.  I hope the Minister will devote his energies to giving to our people a land policy which will bring about revolutionary changes in that regard, which are both necessary and desirable, if we are to keep our people on the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first, to refer briefly to what Deputy Dillon and Deputy O.J. Flanagan referred to as being some fundamental change in my view on the 1950 Land Act. My view on the 1950 Land Act has not changed in one iota from the view I formerly held, that is, that it was the <Col N="77" /> greatest political fraud dangled before a fading political public by the Party then in power, in the hope that it would induce them to think that the congestion problem would be solved overnight or, indeed, that it would make some revolutionary change and ease the lot of the land-hungry people in our community.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, in the one breath, when talking about my conversion to the allegedly wonderful provisions of the 1950 Act, suggested that it was too restricted.  Even he in his own mind would appear to have certain reservations about this much-vaunted 1950 Land Act.  I think that possibly the best indication for the House on this issue of the efficacy or otherwise of this wonderful Act about which Deputy O.J. Flanagan waxed so eloquent are the actual figures expended, not by me, but by Deputy O.J. Flanagan's colleagues, including Deputy Blowick, when he occupied the post of Minister for Lands.</P>
      <P>In 1954-1955, the purchase money expended under the operation of this section of the 1950 Land Act for the purchase of land was £4,530.  You would pay as much for one reasonable farm down the country.  In 1955-56, the amount expended was £9,650 and, in 1957-58, £19,228.  These are the figures over a three year period of money expended under the Act that was held up to be the new instrument for the solution of our congestion problem. I must say that at that rate of progress and operation, we would be a very long time, not alone in making any impact on the problem which we face nationally in this regard but in letting the people know that such a section as Section 27 of the 1950 Land Act was written into the Statute Book. Not alone that, but, in July 1956, the people on the opposite benches who have just spoken on this issue suspended completely the operation of this section and provided no money whatsoever from that period until the time they left office for any operations whatsoever under it.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out to the Deputy that, in July of 1956, he himself, being the then Minister for Lands, stopped the expenditure of any money under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950.  I pointed out the figures actually spent for the three years, 1954-55, 1955-56 and 1956-57 until Deputy Blowick stopped the operation of Section 27 of the 1950 Act.</P>
      <P>Does anybody even now, in the light of these figures, suggest that an expenditure of £4,000 for the relief of congestion under this Act would get us anywhere; that a figure of £9,000 in another year would get us anywhere or that £19,000 in a third year would get us anywhere?  This is the wonderful instrument for talking about which Deputy Dillon suggests I should have measles.  I suggest that Deputies who talk that way on the opposite side should certainly have scarlet fever after listening to these figures and the operations that took place under their own direction under this instrument which was placed on the Statute Book in 1950.</P>
      <P>At all events, it is there and in so far as it is there, we have to use it.  It will not, until it is amended or expanded to the extent that it can become workable, make any appreciable impact on the problem with which we have to deal, but in so far as one can operate such a section in such an Act as this, in the last year, my Department spent £36,280 under it, practically doubling the maximum amount ever spent by the authors of this section of this Act.</P>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate a general debate or to be drawn into a discussion on land policy generally because it would be out of order on this occasion.  Some questions were raised regarding fencing.  In reply to Deputy Blowick, I should say that the increase here is not a reflection of increased wages or increased prices but of more activity under the Land Acts during the year under review.  It is that which accounts, in the main, for the increased Estimate I am now asking the House to pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister is on that point, might I ask him if he <Col N="79" /> wants the additional £50,000 for subhead I along with the £26,000 remaining unspent, or is that sum of £26,000 included in the £50,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The two, to complete up to 31st March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, £76,000 approximately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  We need, say, £50,000, plus the balance of £26,000 for improvement works to the end of March and this works out about the average for March over the past few years.  The point I want to make is that cost increases are not a significant factor in the figures I have given the House.  The increase mainly reflects an increase in the volume of work which is going through.</P>
      <P>As far as the people in the Shannon Valley are concerned, five of them were migrated, and there is nothing to stop this section, if it had been utilised and if it were necessary to utilise it, being used for the purpose of acquiring holdings for such migrants, should that be found necessary.</P>
      <P>The other main point mentioned by different Deputies&mdash;certainly by Deputies O.J. Flanagan and Blowick&mdash; was the question of dealing with ex-employees on estates.  Again, I find myself in this position: the change in dealing with ex-employees on estates in this way was provided for by the 1950 Act introduced by Deputy Blowick and the standards and regulations laid down for this purpose were approved by Deputy Blowick as Minister for Lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no regulations laid down in respect of what the Commissioners would decide as fair remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There were forms which I found in the Department of questionnaries which go to these people. They go on certain rules.  These people had to be over three years in employment before they qualified for anything. A kind of rule-of-thumb method of administration was worked out whereby they would get approximately <Col N="80" /> half a year's salary or at most a year's salary.  All these matters were matters that were certainly settled by the Commissioners or by somebody in the Department when the Deputy was the Minister responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of that section and the method of operating it were laid down by the Land Commission in the Deputy's time as Minister and the only comment I can make on it is that, in 1955-56, for instance, 20 gratuities totalling £1,705 were paid, giving an average approximately of £85 and in the last 11 months during which I have been looking at this matter, the gratuities paid were £1,817, the average being approximately £107.  I do not say that these gratuities are in any way generous.</P>

It was brought in specifically to deal with the type of case where an employee, prior to that, was thrown out without either land or gratuity.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £90,250 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946 and No. 6 of 1956), including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate of £90,250 comprises heads of over-expenditure under Subhead B&mdash;Travelling Expenses&mdash;requiring an extra £9,000, Subhead C.2&mdash;Forest Development and Management&mdash;needing £137,000 and Subhead F&mdash;Agency, Advisory and Special Services&mdash;where an additional £4,000 is required.</P>
      <P>Extra expenditure on travelling is due to the accelerated tempo of work in the field by foresters and inspectors. Extra inspectors were recruited during the year for acquisition work and additional travelling expenses have arisen from advisory work in connection with the private planting campaign.</P>
      <P>The anticipated over-expenditure of £137,000 under Subhead C.2 arises primarily from additional labour charges amounting to £83,000 and additional spending of £70,000 on purchase of road materials.  With regard to the anticipated excess on labour, the position is that average employment in the current financial year will turn out at a figure slightly in excess of 4,800 men whereas the original Estimate provided for a figure somewhat less than 4,800.  Moreover, the level of production of labour under the Incentive Bonus Scheme now in course of application to all the forests in the country has been higher than was anticipated at the time of framing of the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This means in effect that the men are being paid more and more work is being done.  It represents a reduction in production costs but the cost per-man-employed has, of course, in consequence risen beyond the figure <Col N="85" /> originally anticipated.  A further factor contributing towards the excess cost of labour is the wage increase of 7/6 per week effective from the 2nd January, 1960, which has been granted in response to trade union demands; this increase is costing £22,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>Approximately £70,000 extra, that is, a total expenditure of £155,000 for the year, will be spent on road materials.  Advantage was taken of the very favourable weather last summer to make outstanding progress with construction of new roads and in the first six months of the year, a greater yardage was done than in the whole of the previous year.  We have for some years past been running in arrears with our road construction programme and the progress made towards overtaking that work is very welcome.</P>
    <P>Further increased spending on subhead C.2 arises from the purchase of fencing materials which will cost this year about £16,000 more than anticipated. Our purchases of fencing materials for the past few years have been cushioned by the fact that we held a substantial reserve of netting wire but we have now come to the end of our stocks and increased purchases have had to be made during the year. There are other minor items of saving and excess within the subhead which combine to produce a net figure of £137,000 in excess of the original provision for C.2.</P>
    <P>Excess spending of £4,000 on subhead F&mdash;Agency, Advisory and Special Services&mdash;arises from the continuing need to retain the services of a consultant in connection with the application of the Incentive Bonus Scheme.</P>
    <P>These items of over-expenditure are off-set in part by savings on other subheads amounting to £10,250. Allowance can also be made for an additional revenue of £49,500 under subhead H&mdash;Appropriations in Aid. There is an increase of £37,000 expected under the head for sales of timber making a total provision for the year of £317,000 for this head. The demand for Irish timber during the past 12 months has proved very satisfactory and it is obvious that an <Col N="86" /> increased output of timber in constructional sizes, if available, would meet a very favourable market.</P>
    <P>There is now a readier acceptance of Irish timber by the building trade who are coming to recognise that the Irish-grown product, properly handled and seasoned, is equal to any of the imported grades.  That is a heartening development and we may look forward to the time when the great bulk of the trade's requirements can be met from Irish grown stocks.</P>
    <P>Another significant item contributing to our additional receipts is the head of Miscellaneous Receipts which is expected to bring in a total of £18,000 for the year, £11,500 in excess of the original Estimate.  This additional revenue flows mainly from the sale of surplus plants.  Favourable conditions in our nurseries for germination and growth over the past few years have combined to produce surpluses of various species which have been made available for sale to the nursery trade.  We have thus been able to ensure that private planters have been able to obtain from the trade their full requirements of plants for the current season.  I understand that demands for plants this year have been on an unprecedented scale and I look forward in due time, when the figures for acreages planted become available, to reporting further increases in the scale of private planting.</P>
    <P>The target for the State planting programme this season is 25,000 acres and there is every indication that the target will be fully achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very tame&mdash;I might say he is almost down-in-the-mouth&mdash;in introducing this Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister, or at least his Department, have every reason to be proud of the fact that 25,000 acres are to be planted next year.  It is a pretty huge undertaking and something to be proud of.  It is not something to be stuck into two lines at the very end of the Minister's speech.  It is something which the country should know about and which should get very favourable publicity. The fact that 4,800 men are employed is also something to be proud of.  I want to tell the Minister that the <Col N="87" /> forestry section of his Department is the only employer of manual labour in the State on such a scale.  If many other Departments had the same employment facilities for the ordinary working man, the ships carrying our youth across-channel would not be getting so much custom.</P>
      <P>Under Subhead C.2 the Minister is looking for £137,000 and savings on other parts of the subhead amount to £34,000.  I want to know where these savings come in.  The Minister should have given us the answer at once in his brief.  I expect it is on nurseries. If so, how?  I do not see any other subhead where such savings could be made.  One thing that surprised me was the amount spent on &ldquo;road materials&rdquo;.  What are &ldquo;road materials&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  An expert bridge builder was lent to the Forestry Section of my Department and a considerable amount of road-making and bridge-building went on as a result.  This figure represents not alone gravel, stone and such material, but also pipes and some bridge material and concrete.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Access roads to forests are just as essential as the forests themselves. Even a schoolboy knows that there is no sense in planting a forest miles away from a road, without providing some means of getting out the thinnings, and later on, the mature timber.  Proper roads through a forest are as much part of a good forest as fencing and the trees themselves and I am only too glad to see that the road-making arrears existing for the past 25 or 30 years are now being overtaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that 4,800 men are employed now.  I remember that during the last year I was in office, 4,500 men were working and at that time, the planting programme had reached the 17,500 acre mark per <Col N="88" /> annum.  I presume that 22,500 acres will be put down in the present planting season and, if so, I am disappointed that a greater number of men have not been put to work.  Without straying too far from the Estimate, I would like to say that this Government&mdash;and it is true of all Governments&mdash;are not spending enough of the revenue that comes to them on the employment of working men, if only for the purpose of stopping emigration and trying to give a living to a few more young men in their own country.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I am disappointed that the planting programme at present in full swing, the programme inaugurated by the first inter-Party Government, is not giving employment to more men.  I had hoped that it would give work to about 6,000 men.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister, further on in his speech, tells us that this year £155,000 will be spent on road materials.  When he is replying, perhaps he might tell us what mileage of roads is being made?  Also, has there been a complete departure from the system obtaining when I was Minister, of using materials readily available on forest sites, thus giving employment to forestry labourers?  I am speaking of gravel and stones and I should like to know if these are now being purchased from outside the forests and lorried in. It would appear to me that there would be an economy in using materials available on forest sites, and there is hardly any forest which has not got these materials, except, of course, concrete, steel, and pipes for culverts.</P>
    <P>I also note that fencing material will cost £16,000 more than anticipated and I take it that is because there was a running out of the stocks acquired five, six or seven years ago at the time of the Korean war scare. Is that so?</P>

      <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Excess spending of £4,000 on Subhead F&mdash;Agency, Advisory and Special Services&mdash;arises from the continuing need to retain the services of a consultant in connection <Col N="89" /> with the application of the Incentive Bonus Scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the Incentive Bonus Scheme which Deputy Childers introduced when he was Minister for Lands, but it certainly gives me a bit of a shock to find £4,000 being spent for the services of a consultant.  The Minister also tells us, in regard to the Incentive Bonus Scheme, that it means in effect that the men are being paid more and that more work is being done.</P>
    <P>I want to put it straight to the Minister: is it a fact that fewer men are being employed and that the lesser number are drawing more wages just because they are fewer in number?  If that is the case, and if we are paying £4,000 to a man to tell us how to run that type of scheme, I think it is a dreadful kind of economy to effect.  I should like to see that £4,000 spent on giving work to men who possibly might not be giving as great an output of work as some of their colleagues in the game, because I do not see what we gain by spending perhaps more money to get the same amount of work done, and have fewer men to do it.  I am completely disappointed with the picture the Minister has revealed and I think what we are doing is making progress backwards instead of forwards.</P>
    <P>When I was in charge of the Department, one of my principal objectives in expanding forestry was to give greater employment and to stem the running tide of emigration as much as I could.  I admit, however, that all the men that forestry could employ would only plug a small hole, as far as emigration is concerned.  Even if 6,000 were employed, we would still be exporting 40,000 of our youngsters each year, but I believe that giving forestry work was a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the Local Authorities (Works) Act was brought in during the régime of the first inter-Party Government, one of the reasons the Land Project was introduced, and one of the reasons the arterial drainage scheme&mdash;which, incidentally, had been hung up for four or five years&mdash;was put into operation was that it was the <Col N="90" /> idea of all Ministers in the inter-Party Government to provide more employment.</P>
    <P>Now I must confess that I am frankly disappointed with the picture the Minister has just given us.  By this time, I should have thought another 1,000 men would have been employed in forestry.  If, at the same time, the Incentive Bonus Scheme has resulted in a lessening of employment, and forestry is costing the State just as much as it cost previously, I fail to see where economy lies.  As I have said, when Deputy Childers introduced that scheme, I thought it would lead to a better quality work and, perhaps, a greater output, but I did not visualise that it would have the effect of reducing the number of men employed, nor did I think it would cost £4,000 to pay a man to tell the Department how to run it.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us how the savings of £34,000 were made on &ldquo;other parts&rdquo; of Subhead C.2?  He has told us at the end of his speech that there has been a surplus in the various species of young transplants, and that these have been made available to the nursery trade from his Department.  Does that mean that the private nurseries are not able, or are not growing enough on their own to meet private demands?  If so, on what terms are private nurseries getting plants from the Department? What kind of arrangement exists between them?</P>
    <P>Are any of the transplants exported, or is there any exchange at the present time between the British Forestry Commission, the Scottish Forestry Commission and the Irish Forestry Section of the Department of Lands such as took place in days gone by?  Such exchanges produced a lot of useful information in the past, created good feeling between the groups I have mentioned, and generally did a lot of good.  There is an increase of £37,000 expected under the head of sales of timber.  Is that sales of standing timber, thinnings or sawn timber at the sawmills?  Would the Minister tell us what it is?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say which is the major sale?  Is it sales of standing timber or sawn timber?</P>
      <P>The Minister has made welcome reference to the fact that there is now a readier acceptance of Irish timber by the building trade who are coming to recognise that the Irish grown product, properly handled and seasoned, is equal to any of the imported grades.  I wish to tell the Minister, without appearing to sound my own trumpet, that one of the difficulties I found early in 1948 was that there was no respect for Irish timber amongst the building trade.  That was justifiable because at that time Irish timber was not properly presented.  It went straight from the saw-bench to the dealer with the sap still running out of it, in contradistinction to foreign timber, which was properly seasoned.</P>
      <P>One of the things I set about at that time&mdash;I am glad it has borne fruit even now&mdash;was to impress on the Forestry Department and on private timber merchants that it was absolutely necessary that Irish grown timber should be presented in proper condition.  If that has taken effect even now, I am very proud.  Prior to 1948, the handling of Irish grown timber was disgraceful.  I had it on good authority from the trade that Irish grown timber, if properly handled, was as good as, if not better than, the imported product.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will enlighten us on some of the points I have raised. The money spent on road materials seems high.  However, I am in favour of having forests properly roaded.  If roads are not made now in the forests, in some years' time we might have to bulldoze growing trees in order to make roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know how the savings on the other subheads have been effected and if the incentive bonus scheme is adversely affecting the number of men employed.  With regard to the £4,000 paid for the <Col N="92" /> advisory service in connection with the incentive bonus scheme, I suggest that that is putting the whole machine into reverse and certainly not the way in which I visualise the Forestry Department should be run.</P>

      <P>Reading over the records of this House I cannot help recalling that when the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government embarked on a policy of afforestation they were criticised.  That criticism came from the Party of the Minister for Lands. Yet he can come into the House today and boast that there is readier acceptance of Irish timber by the building trade, who are coming to recognise that the Irish grown product, properly handled and seasoned, is equal to any of the imported grades.  Where did the timber used in the building trade today come from?  Is it not only now that we are reaping the benefit, in the sales of timber, of the wise policy expounded in this House by the late Mr. Martin Roddy, when Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands?  Afforestation does not give immediate dividends but repays doubly eventually.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands boasts, and we on this side of the House are delighted to share in the boast, that there is Irish timber ready for the building trade today, well seasoned and in good condition.  There are Deputies in the House today who remember that when the trees that are now being sold were being planted and which, it is the proud boast of the Minister, are second to none, the Minister and his Party saw fit to offer the severest possible criticism.</P>

      <P>He now admits that Irish timber is suitable in every respect for the building trade.  We hope that trend will continue.  It is the desire of everybody interested in forestry that, in so far as possible, Irish timber will be used in the building trade.</P>
      <P>I was rather disappointed at the Minister's statement that there are only 4,800 men employed in forestry.  I was eagerly awaiting the Minister's introductory statement and anticipated that he would tell us of an increase in the number employed.  If there is one way in which employment can be provided, one way in which the Taoiseach's policy of providing employment can be implemented, it is afforestation.  There are, according to the Minister, 4,800 men employed in forestry whereas we all know that forestry is capable of expansion to the stage where at least twice that number could be productively employed.</P>
      <P>I want to express disappointment at the increased expenditure on travelling, which is stated to be due to the high gear in which the Department is working. I would not be honest if I did not pay very special tribute to the magnificent work that the Forestry Division are doing in my own constituency but I do not consider the dimensions satisfactory.  There is great scope for development and extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands states that the target for the State planting programme this season is 25,000 acres and that there is every indication that the target will be fully achieved.  How was that made possible for the Minister?  Was not that made possible because of the efforts of the inter-Party Government in putting legislation through the House that simplified the acquisition of land for forestry?  Was not that mainly responsible?  Is that not one of the main reasons why the Minister can tell us today that a target of 25,000 acres may be achieved?  Is it not also true to say that forestry was <Col N="94" /> at a standstill, that our forests were in a state of dire neglect, that no progress was made in the provision of employment or increased expenditure on forestry until the inter-Party Government made the first move in that direction?  It is that move which is responsible for the progress for which the Minister now seems to claim credit.  That progress mainly derived from the fact that the law was simplified so that the Forestry Division could acquire lands which otherwise it would have been impossible for them to acquire.</P>

    <P>This Vote on Account begins the financial business of 1960/61.  It represents, with a few exceptions, roughly a four months' provision for each Supply Service.  Normally, by the end of July the individual Estimates are approved by the Dáil and the Appropriation Bill passed.  So that Government services may be financed in the meantime, however, it is necessary for the Vote on Account and the Central Fund Bill which gives it <Col N="96" /> statutory confirmation to be passed before 1 April.</P>
    <P>The Vote on Account now asked for is £40,988,440, that is, roughly one-third of the total Estimates for the Supply Services, 1960/61.  The individual items covered by it are set out on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have observed that the total of the Estimates for next year is £123.46 million as against the original £115.55 million this year.  When account is taken of Supplementary Estimates the total provision for the current year comes to £120.22 million but next year's figure is £3.24 million above this total.</P>
    <P>The Volume of Estimates itself shows Vote by Vote and item by item where variations occur as between 1960/61 and the current year.  I shall refer only to the more important changes and for convenience I shall try to group similar services together.</P>
    <P>Turning first of all to <i>non-capital services</i>, the 1960/61 total of £105.88 million shows an increase of £4.75 million over the corresponding 1959/60 figure.  Allowing for Supplementary Estimates the increase is still £3.93 million.</P>
    <P>The largest single item of increase is pay.  The Civil Service accounts for £1,074,000, National Teachers for £415,000, and the Defence Forces for £262,000.  A sum of £250,000 has been included in the Estimate for Health to provide for recoupment to health authorities of 50 per cent. of the cost of any pay increase they may grant to health employees.  The provisions for other Estimates, e.g., Public Works and Buildings, Forestry and Defence, also bear the effect of the &ldquo;seventh round&rdquo;, and bring the increased provision for pay to a little over £2 million in all.</P>
    <P>Next in order of magnitude comes the increase in Social Assistance. Because of the higher payments authorised by the Social Welfare Act, 1959, Old Age Pensions require an additional £900,000 for 1960/61 and Widows' and Orphans' Non-Contributory Pensions an additional £121,000. Despite a decrease under the heading of Unemployment Assistance, the net <Col N="97" /> extra commitment for Social Assistance is £873,000.</P>
    <P>Higher rates of pension and bigger numbers retiring necessitate an extra provision of £462,000 for pensions and allowances for the Garda Síochána, Civil Servants, Post Office employees, Teachers and Army personnel.</P>
    <P>Altogether, pay and pensions increases between them account for nearly £3½ million or by far the greater part of the increase in current expenditure.</P>
    <P>The balance of the increase in the current estimates is the net result of a number of variations.  In the Vote for Agriculture the major increase is an extra £350,000 for An Foras Talúntais, which has expanded the scope of its activities considerably during the past year; on the other hand, separate provision is no longer made for the Peatland Experimental Station at Glenamoy which has been transferred to An Foras Talúntais, as have also been Johnstown Castle and Grange Farm, resulting in a reduction of £155,000 in the provision for Agricultural Schools and Farms. There is also an extra £170,000 for the subsidy to manufacturers of home-produced super-phosphate, although this is partly offset by a reduction of £105,000 in the amount required to meet the delivery cost of lime.</P>
    <P>An extra £34,110 in all is being granted to the General Agricultural and Dairy Science Faculties of U.C.D. and U.C.C.  There are two new provisions of £59,900 and £25,800, being grants to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of University College, Dublin, and the School of Veterinary Medicine, Trinity College, Dublin, respectively, arising out of the transfer to the Universities of the tutorial functions of the Veterinary College.  There is a consequential reduction in the provision for the last-mentioned College which continues to be the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Progress towards completing the scheme has enabled a reduction of £100,000 to be made in the provision for grants to creameries towards the purchase of plant for pasteurisation of separated milk.  Losses on disposal of <Col N="98" /> the 1958 wheat crop necessitated a provision of £470,000 in the current year.  Fortunately only a token provision is required for such losses in 1960/61.  In view of the uncertain scale of exports the provision for subsidies on dairy produce has been reduced from £1,000,000 to £250,000. Very little of this year's provision will, in fact, be needed.  I should mention that, in respect of dairy produce exports, it is the intention to match every £ of the balance in the Dairy Produce Price Stabilisation Fund with £2 from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The provision for Supplementary Agricultural Grants is £268,000 above the current year's provision.  Compared, however, with the more up-todate figure indicated by the recent Supplementary Estimate, the increase is only £128,000.  It is due to the higher local rates expected next year.</P>
    <P>In the Lands Estimate an extra £35,000 is included for Purchase of Interests for Cash and an extra £65,500 for Improvement of Estates. The intensification of Forestry activity reveals itself in the provision of an extra £213,500 for the non-capital, i.e., the general forest management and timber conversion, side of Forest Development and Management.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for Industry and Commerce, the exports promotion drive is being assisted by an extra £41,000 for Coras Tráchtála while the Technical Assistance provision is enlarged by an additional £86,500.  No provision is necessary for Repayment of Advances under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts.  The receipts under the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Acts, formerly treated as Exchequer Extra Receipts under the Vote for the Industrial and Commercial Property Registration Office, are to be appropriated in aid of the Vote for Industry and Commerce, the total being estimated at £42,000 for 1960/61.</P>
    <P>The new provision of £143,900 included in the Estimate for Transport and Power for the repayment to the Central Fund of advances made to the Electricity Supply Board arises from the Government's decision to restore the rural electrification subsidy to <Col N="99" /> enable this important work to be completed at an early date.  Provision for fuel losses, for which there was £200,000 in the current year's Vote, is no longer necessary.  Receipts from landing fees and from catering and sales services at Shannon Airport are expected to show decreases of £90,000 and £110,000, respectively.</P>
    <P>Continued progress with local authority housing and sanitary works necessitates the provision of an additional £256,000 for contributions towards loan charges.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of Health a further £280,000 is required for grants to Health Authorities, mostly for increased expenditure on hospital services.</P>
    <P>Most of the extra £137,900 for Secondary Education is for Capitation Grant and Incremental Salary Grant, due in the first case to the greater number of pupils and, in the second, to the increased number of teachers. A further £110,400 is required next year for Technical Instruction.</P>
    <P>The items mainly responsible for the increases in the Defence Estimate, apart from the higher charge for pay and allowances, are General Stores&mdash; particularly the purchase of aircraft&mdash; and Defensive Equipment.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners there is a considerable increase under the heading of staff because of the extra personnel required for the P.A.Y.E. scheme.  The large increase in the Estimate for the Central Statistics Office is due mainly to the inclusion of provision for a Census of Population and a 100% Census of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Apart from pay increases, the only major increase in the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs is under the heading of Telephone Capital Repayments and arises from the expanding telephone programme.  A considerable reduction is made in the provision for equipment for the Civil Aviation and Meteorological Wireless Services.  A new item in this Estimate is the anticipated recoupment by the new Broadcasting Authority of the <Col N="100" /> cost of collecting broadcasting licence fees.  The Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting, showing a decrease of £291,000, is on a provisional basis since, as the Note to the Estimate indicates, it is for four months' supply only and it is intended that it should be superseded by a new Estimate following the enactment of the Broadcasting Authority Bill.</P>
    <P>On capital services, the net increase over this year's original figure is £3.16 million.  When account is taken, however, of Supplementary Estimates totalling £3.85 million, of which £3.15 million relates to bovine tuberculosis eradication, the provision for next year shows a decrease of £0.69 million.</P>
    <P>I need not on this occasion survey the steps taken so far to implement the Programme of Economic Expansion. Deputies have already been furnished with a report on progress to 30th September last and I hope to circulate in due course a further report covering progress up to the end of the current month.  I shall, however, indicate briefly the items in the 1960/61 Estimates which relate to the Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Estimate for Agriculture for the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme is a gross £5,372,000.  When account is taken of receipts from the sale of cattle slaughtered under the scheme, the net provision is £3,454,000, an increase of £1,634,000 on last year's original provision. A Supplementary Estimate was passed last week for an additional net amount of £3,154,000 and the possibility that a Supplementary Estimate will be needed next year should not be ruled out.  This large increase in expenditure indicates the intensification of operations in the Clearance Area and the extension of the scheme to the dairying areas in the south late last year.  I need attempt no justification of this heavy outlay, which relates to one of the most urgent and important objects of public policy.</P>
    <P>The provision for subsidy on phosphatic fertilisers is being maintained at the same level as are the provisions for Farm Buildings and the Land Project.  Arising out of an assurance <Col N="101" /> given in the Programme, a new provision of £50,000 has been inserted in the Estimate for Agriculture for grants for works of modernisation in layout and plant at bacon factories.</P>
    <P>Intensified activity on forest development, associated with increased productivity generated by the incentive bonus scheme for forestry workers, results in an increased capital requirement for 1960/61 of £291,000.  On the sea fisheries side, £39,100 is included in the Grant-in-Aid of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara towards the cost of new boats and of plant and premises for the promotion of this industry.  Continued for 1960/61 are the provisions for inland fisheries projects, pond fish culture and improvement of salmon fisheries.</P>
    <P>For capital items under the heading of Tourism, a total of £145,000 is being made available, an increase of £25,000 on the current year's provision as adjusted by the recent Supplementary Estimate.  These are schemes for the development of major resorts and the provision of additional accommodation for tourists.</P>
    <P>The total provision for grants for the establishment of industries continues at the 1959/60 level of £975,000 that is, including the Supplementary Estimate passed in the last session.</P>
    <P>Related to these items is the grant, appearing for the first time in the 1960/61 Summary of Capital Services, towards expenditure on the promotion of commercial, industrial and trading enterprises at Shannon Airport.  The balance of the increase in the capital provisions of the Transport and Power Estimate is attributable to constructional works at Dublin and Cork Airports.</P>
    <P>Other capital items showing increases are housing grants, due to improved grant facilities made available by the 1958 Housing Act and the 1959 Gaeltacht Housing Act.  In the Estimate for Public Works and Buildings the increase is attributable mainly to the expanded arterial drainage programme and work on fisheries harbours.</P>
    <P>I think that the details I have given are sufficient outline of the changes <Col N="102" /> appearing in the Volume of Estimates for the Supply Services for 1960/61. As I have already indicated, the bulk of the increase in current expenditure arises from an effort to maintain so far as possible the value of pay, pensions and other benefits and the standards of the public services generally at a time when national production as a whole shows some increase. On the capital side, to implement the Programme for Economic Expansion we are providing increased sums for agriculture, forestry, industry, tourism and transport and power, while not overlooking at the same time the country's social needs.</P>
    <P>I ask for the agreement of the Dáil to this Vote on Account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it no exaggeration to say that when the Volume of Estimates was published last week every Deputy, including Deputies in the Minister's Party, and the country as a whole got a profound shock.  The increase in the total of the Estimates which the Minister is demanding for the current year is one that must cause concern on every side.  This year the Minister has made two records.  First, he has introduced the Vote on Account in what must be the shortest speech on record and secondly he is seeking to extract from the pockets of the taxpayers the largest sum ever asked by any Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The increase in the total requested for the next financial year is, as every Deputy is aware, £7,900,000.  I do not suppose the Minister will quarrel with me if, for the sake of brevity, I refer to it as £8,000,000.  It is an increase of £8,000,000 over the amount requested last year and the Minister, even at this early stage, has had to give notice in his speech a few moments ago that already he visualises, notwithstanding that figure, a Supplementary Estimate in respect of Vote 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must surely be a record that not merely does he come in demanding the largest figure ever demanded but, in his speech recommending that figure to the House, he indicates already that in one aspect we are to <Col N="103" /> have a Supplementary Estimate.  Of course, we all know that we will have other supplementaries as time goes on. The total gross figure as I said is up by £8,000,000 on last year and £13,500,000 up on that for the year ending 31st March, 1959.  That is without taking into account anything that might have happened in the meantime, such as the £6,500,000 net which the Minister saved by the elimination of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>It would be very easy for me to criticise this Vote on Account and this Volume of Estimates by referring merely to the gross total figures on the face of the book.  I do not, however, propose to do that.  I feel, and I have always said, that two entirely different criteria should govern the examination of capital expenditure and current expenditure.  I remember &mdash;I think it was on the Vote on Account in 1955&mdash;my predecessor in office, Deputy MacEntee, now Tánaiste, not taking that view, and saying, at that time, that it was the total gross expenditure figure that should be considered, and at which he was appalled, having regard to the means of the community.  I do not take that view.</P>
    <P>I have said in office, and I repeat in opposition, that so far as our capital expenditure is concerned, we should keep our productive capital programme at the highest level which the people will support.  I need not emphasise &ldquo;productive&rdquo;; I need not emphasise &ldquo;programme&rdquo;.  It is in relation to current expenditure, therefore, that I feel so strongly that the Minister, in bringing this Vote on Account to the House, has absolutely failed in his duty, and has completely failed to realise the needs of the community at the present time.</P>
    <P>However, before I turn to current expenditure, I want to dwell just for a moment on the pattern and the picture of this Vote on Account.  I said last year, and I repeat now, that it is a pity the Minister has not carried out my declared intention, in the autumn of 1956, of having a separate capital Budget discussion in this House from the current Budget discussion.  I said <Col N="104" /> then and felt&mdash;and it is just as true now&mdash;that the ordinary Budget discussion on current affairs is bound to overshadow consideration of our capital programme, and that it would be far better, therefore, if the Minister for Finance, whoever he might be, took a different opportunity of considering our whole capital programme, and considering it in an atmosphere in which we were not, at the same time, endeavouring to consider current matters.</P>
    <P>We must, too, consider what we have in mind in this Vote on Account in the general capital picture.  We had some discussions the other day on housing, in particular in relation to capital.  I do not propose to go into any detail again on that matter, nor do I propose, in saying this, to offer any criticism of the Chair.  On that occasion, I was dealing with, and I understood the Supplementary Estimate dealt with, grants for private housing. That is part of the capital programme which we must consider.  After I had my opportunity, others spoke of the position in relation to local authority housing.  Be that as it may, whether that was the right occasion or not, this is clearly an occasion when we are entitled to review the capital programme set out by the Government, in relation to housing, as one of the most important constituent parts.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, the other day, tried to give to the House the picture that we were setting out, in this year, and in next year, on an era of far better housing facilities than ever before.  What he said was also befogged, perhaps deliberately, by certain comments made by other Deputies on the provisions that obtained in the last year for which I was responsible.  I want, therefore, to-day, in the picture of the capital programme we are being asked to vote tonight, to put on record certain facts.</P>
    <P>It was suggested last week, in relation to payments of private housing grants, that more payments were being made in this current year by Fianna Fáil than had been made in 1956/57. Deputies will find, when they look back over last week's debates, that the suggestion was made that we had <Col N="105" /> neglected to make the payments that should have been made, and that because of that neglect, we were under the figures of payments in that regard which the Government made this year for housing.  It was suggested&mdash;in fact, it was more than suggested; it was stated categorically&mdash;that February of this year showed the greatest ever amount of activity.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Local Government may know the position about allocations, but, in the light of the completely untrue picture which was painted here on many occasions by the Minister for Agriculture when he was Minister for Local Government, and which were parrot-wise repeated by Deputy O'Malley and the present Minister for Local Government, let me state the facts which can be obtained by anybody who cares to take those facts from the official publications.</P>
    <P>In the first three months of 1957, our last year, £340,000 was paid out for private housing grants.  In the first three months of 1960&mdash;I speak of the financial year in each case&mdash;the amount paid out was £221,000.  In the second three months of 1957, the amount paid out by us was £343,000. In the same three months of this year, the amount was £211,000.  In the third three months of 1956-57, the amount was £397,000, and in the third three months of this year, the amount was £245,000.  In January of this year, the amount was only £74,000 and in January, 1957, when according to Fianna Fáil we were not paying the moneys due, the amount was £127,000. In February of 1957, when according to Fianna Fáil we were not paying the amounts that were due, the amount paid out was £91,000.  In this year, in February&mdash;which is supposed to be a record&mdash;the amount was £42,000. Those figures appear in reply to a question today.</P>
    <P>That is one aspect of capital payments for housing&mdash;another aspect of the issues from the Local Loans Fund, which I admit frankly indicate not merely housing but certain other activities of local authorities, such as sanitary services.  The House will remember that again the charge was that they were paying now, and we <Col N="106" /> did not pay what was due at that time.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to local authority housing.  In the eleven months from 1st April, 1956, to 2nd March, 1957&mdash;the last date which I can compare this year with our period of office&mdash;the amount we paid from the Local Loans Fund was £8,550,000.  That amount can be found in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of 5th March, 1957.  In the current year, in the same period, the amount being paid by this Government is only £3,450,000.</P>
    <P>If one goes on to other aspects of the capital programme of the two periods, one can get some simple comparisons. Electricity expenditure and generation were matters which I remember the Taoiseach mentioned some three or six months ago as being factors involved in judging the national economy.  In the period before we went out of office, the same period I have mentioned, the amount provided for electricity development was £4,660,000.  Again taken from <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in the current year, the amount the present Minister has expended on electricity capital development is £1,051,426.  The total issue up to 2nd March for capital development in that year&mdash;1956-57 when, according to Fianna Fáil, nothing was being paid&mdash;was £18,064,828.  In this year, the total figure is £12,354,243 and, of that, £1,621,091 is a special payment in respect of the Bretton Woods Agreement which does not anyway come into capital improvement at home.</P>
    <P>It means, therefore, that, in the period when every Deputy of that Party opposite travelled up and down the country saying we were not paying the moneys that were expended, we accepted and paid for a Local Loans Fund capital programme of £18,064,828 and that the current comparison is £10,733,152.  If the fact were that these payments had been made afterwards, I could understand Deputies opposite. Even now, I could understand Deputies opposite who do not know the facts because they have been deliberately misled for political propaganda purposes by certain Ministers of the present Government.  But the figures refute that suggestion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> It is suggested, too, that there was an undue carry-over in respect of the end of the financial year, 1956-57.  The Capital Budget for 1957-58, as Deputy Dr. Ryan, the present Minister for Finance, knows, was on his desk as planned and announced by me in almost every particular before I left office.  In that Capital Budget, the amount included for local authorities for 1957-58 was £14.88 millions, compared to the actual out-turn of £13.75 millions, and again compared to an out-turn for the preceding year of £12.67 millions and showing conclusively, therefore, that there was no carry-over, other than a normal carry-over from year to year, and that what did occur was that we had peak capital socially productive expenditure in that year on housing as well as on other things from which there has since been a progressive decline by Fianna Fáil, a deliberately progressive stoppage by them.</P>
    <P>One can pass, for example, to the Capital Estimate for 1957-58 which was left by me and was adopted by the present Minister for Finance.  One can see that capital estimate was £14.88 millions but that the present Minister reduced it in the following year to £9.76 millions for the same items.</P>
    <P>These figures can be followed by taking the amounts made available for the capital expenditure of Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation.  I made it clear in 1956 and in 1957 that, so far as Dublin Corporation was concerned, I would be prepared to make available the sum of £4,000,000 for capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy cares to look at the Dáil Debates of the 11th February, Column 337, he will find that in each of these three financial years there was paid by the Government, of which I had the honour to be a member, to Dublin Corporation the sum of £4,000,000 that we promised would be made available.  However, in respect of 1958 and 1959, Deputies will find that the figures under Fianna Fáil dropped from that £4,000,000 to £2,200,000 in 1958 and £1,850,000 in 1959.  Do we hear a squawk now from Deputy Briscoe or the other <Col N="108" /> people who, when sitting on this side of the House, tried to suggest that the Government of that day were not honouring their commitments?  There is the proof of it for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any person in the House who would be interested in the figure for Cork Corporation I would ask any such person to look at today's debates.  In a reply to Question No. 9, he will find that each year I honoured the commitments I entered into by making available each year £750,000 for Cork capital expenditure. After we went out of office, that figure dropped in 1958 to £639,000 and in 1959 to £512,000.  Curiously enough, I do not hear anything coming from Cork to compare with the clamour from Cork Corporation in those days that the amount made available to meet the housing necessities of that local authority was insufficient. Now, apparently very much less is quite sufficient.</P>
    <P>I mention these figures to put the whole pattern in relation to housing in its correct perspective so that one may understand the hollowness and the hypocrisy of the criticism made in 1956-57 of the allocations then being given and paid&mdash;the hollowness and the hypocrisy of those who, as last week, tried to suggest that the payments this year for housing are in excess of those that were made available by us.</P>
    <P>The Vote on Account must be considered not merely in relation to one particular facet such as housing but in relation to the general picture of the economy as a whole as we see it. In that pattern, let me consider for a moment the position disclosed in the returns to the 27th February of the current year in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> issued on the 1st March of this year.  There was a considerable expansion in excise revenue, an expansion which arises almost entirely if not more than entirely, as far as I can ascertain from the reply to a Parliamentary Question, from the fact that petrol and similar oil revenue now arises under excise because of the opening of the Whitegate Refinery whereas formerly it arose under Customs duties.</P>
    <P>Excise revenue shows an increase <Col N="109" /> of £4½ million.  I think the petrol revenue that is included in that excise this year, which was not included last year, would be of the nature of £5½ million.  Customs revenue appears to be down by some £3.8 million.  However, because of the transference of the petrol&mdash;and, by the word &ldquo;petrol&rdquo; I cover all sorts of oils&mdash;duty from customs to excise there is an increase in customs revenue.</P>
    <P>Every Minister for Finance who is considering revenue in the general pattern must always bear in mind that if he has been met with an increase in customs revenue and a decrease in excise revenue, as this pattern shows here, it means that we are having less activity at home and more activity in relation to imports.  That, I suggest, is the pattern disclosed by this consideration of the current year's financial returns on the customs and on the excise revenue side.</P>
    <P>There is an increase in Post Office revenue which arises in some degree&mdash; how much I cannot tell&mdash;from a new system of bringing moneys to credit earlier from the Post Office accounts than used to be the case, but it is significant that not merely is there a decrease, after making the allowance for petrol in the excise revenue as a whole, but there is also a decrease in income tax, even allowing for the reduction in the rate.  I suggest that decrease, when one takes into account, on the other side, the well-known fact that efforts such as were never heard of before, are being made now to collect arrears at the present time, shows a further stagnation in our economy that we can ill afford.</P>
    <P>I have referred before&mdash;on this I do not think the Minister for Finance will disagree with me&mdash;to the fact that it is a most unhealthy situation that the national finances should depend, as they do depend in relation to revenue, so much on the tobacco duty.  The tobacco duty accounts, I think, for about 27 per cent. of our total tax revenue and to have all our eggs to the extent of 27 per cent. in one basket is a very unhealthy sign indeed.  It is significant also that in relation to the detailed items of custom revenue <Col N="110" /> which are up, we find brandy and rum, for example, up for imports.  Unfortunately, there is more expenditure on imported spirits, while our home-produced spirits at the same time remain stationary, according to the duty trend.</P>
    <P>One of the signs of difficulties in relation to inflation with which we have dealt in the past has been the figure of motor car imports and motor car registrations.  The figures of imports of motor car parts duty in our customs revenue are up very substantially&mdash;indeed, by, I think, about £300,000.  It seems, therefore, when we consider this pattern, that it shows an increase in activity outside the country being brought in by way of imports, but at best the position is stationary in relation to our own country.</P>
    <P>That is hardly the time in which a Minister for Finance should come to this House and bring to it Estimates of the magnitude and size which the Minister has brought on this occasion.  I said earlier I did not take the view that the Minister could fairly be criticised in relation merely to the total figure appearing on the face of the Book of Estimates, that the important figure was the figure that was related to current services and I mean the figure that is truly related to current services and not current services after hiving off into capital account moneys that should properly be met on current account.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to weary the House again by repeating the analysis I made on this occasion last year when I showed that in last year's Book of Estimates&mdash;and it is repeated this year &mdash;only to an increased degree&mdash; the Minister had taken services to the value of £1,534,000 which we had carried on current account and had put those services to capital account and had carried them, so to speak, on the &ldquo;never-never&rdquo; system rather than on the pay-as-you-go correct method.</P>
    <P>When one speaks of current services, one should speak of true current services and not of current services reduced by transference to capital account of sums which should be met <Col N="111" /> year by year and sums that were, in fact, met by us year by year.  In 1956-57&mdash;the last Vote on Account I introduced here&mdash;the amount of current services was £92,761,000.  The amount which the Minister for Finance now asks is £105,883,000.  Simple arithmetic shows that to be an increase of £13,000,000, but if the Minister wants to make a point that part of the Estimates for the following year had been determined before I left office, I can take the comparison of the following year.</P>
    <P>We see there an increase on the face of the Book of Estimates alone of £3,700,000, but it is £3,700,000 after the Minister had knocked out £9,000,000 by reason of the withdrawal of the food subsidies, counteracted, I admit, of course, by £2,500,000 in respect of the additional social welfare benefits given in that Budget.  I do not think the Minister quarrels with me when I say that the saving in the elimination of the food subsidies, offset by the increases in social welfare benefits, in that year represents approximately £6,500,000.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that when we are dealing with the figure of £3,700,000 to which I have referred, we should add to that the sum of £6,500,000 net which he saved by that operation and which should show itself in this Book of Estimates by way of a reduction.  That would, therefore, mean a figure of approximately £10,000,000&mdash;£10,000,000 more being extracted from the pockets of the people in respect of the current year-by-year Budget for the privilege of having Fianna Fáil in office during the past three years.</P>
    <P>If one takes the individual items in the Book of Estimates and goes through them one can very easily find more reasons why the true comparison is an even greater figure than that. This year the Minister has not to make provision&mdash;thank God&mdash;for the £470,000 which arose out of the bad harvest of 1958.  The Minister is also dropping this year £750,000 in respect of dairy produce subsidies and he is claiming credit for a decrease in the wireless broadcasting Estimate of <Col N="112" /> £291,000 although, in fact, as he admits himself, and as appears in a note on the bottom of page 284 of the Book of Estimates, the amount provided is only for four months and that Estimate will be superseded by a new Estimate following the enactment of the Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1959.  Let me just add that the print used for that note is very small, almost as small and as difficult to read as the type in the new telephone directory introduced by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>That is the picture in relation to this Volume of Estimates.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that in the face of this the people are appalled by the manner in which the Minister for Finance, who must be the guardian of the people's purse, has failed in his duty to restrict current expenditure, to find economies in other directions if it is necessary that there should be increases on some Votes?  I remember being told from this side of the House by one of the Minister's colleagues that if there had to be increases, if it was right that there should be increases in social welfare benefits, or in the pay of civil servants and allied services, any Minister for Finance who was doing his duty should, contemporaneously with providing those increases, find economies by means of which the amount to be extracted or wrung from the pockets of the taxpayers would be met through equivalent reductions in other directions.</P>
    <P>Instead of equivalent reductions in this year's Estimates what do we see? The very first Vote in which there is a substantial increase is that for the Revenue Commissioners.  They require £279,000 more this year to take money from the pockets of taxpayers already harassed and in considerable difficulty although the employers are also to be asked to collect tax this year on the P.A.Y.E. system.</P>
    <P>The next big increase to which I would refer is that in respect of Vote 17, an increase of £268,000 on the original provisions for last year.  That increase means that the Minister is estimating that rates throughout the country will be increased over all local authorities this year by some £750,000 <Col N="113" /> more than he thought would be the figure for rates for this time last year. We all know that when there has been increased provision in Vote 17 it arises because local authorities are having to raise their rates because the Minister understands, believes or estimates that rates on land during the coming year will go up because the grant is given approximately in the proportion of, I think, £2 to £5.  The increase we see in the Book of Estimates means that the Government are satisfied that rates throughout the country must rise substantially this year and, if they must rise, must they not rise fundamentally because of the policy the Government itself has put into operation?</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned local authorities, may I also draw the attention of the House to the provision made in Vote 58 for Health Services?  For these Services, £528,000 more is being provided. That means&mdash;because it goes £ for £&mdash;that there is to be raised this year in rates another £528,000 in the opinion of the Government more than was raised last year.  I think it was the present Minister who, when he piloted the Health Act through the House, said that it would not cost more at any time than 2/- in the £.  If I have misquoted the Minister, I should be happy to withdraw it if he can produce a more accurate quotation but I think that is what he said.  It is now obvious he was entirely wrong. For Health Services, on page 354 of the Volume of Estimates in the current year, we are being asked to provide £8,160,000 under the main heading and £250,000 as a subsidiary, making a total of £8,410,000.</P>
    <P>I want the House to realise and understand that when we are providing that sum it means that our health services are costing £17,180,000.  I wonder is any Deputy satisfied that we are getting value for that money?  Everywhere I go I am told that experience of the operation of the Health Act, 1953, which was introduced by Fianna Fáil, has meant that, notwithstanding that we are spending more and more money on these services, in fact the people who need the services are not getting what they require and feel that <Col N="114" /> in certain respects they were better off before.</P>
    <P>This sum of, say, £17,000,000 is a colossal figure for us in our circumstances to expend on health services between taxpayers and local authorities. It is a sum which, when we are expending it, justifies us in ensuring that we are getting proper value for the money being spent.  Everywhere I go in the country I am told by those who are, or who should be, entitled to claim services of that kind that they feel&mdash;and many members of the local authorities feel&mdash;that the operation and administration of the services are such that we are not getting the value we should for the expenditure of that vast sum of money.  Yet the Minister for Finance walks in happily to-day and calmly asks for one moiety of that sum to be made available out of the pockets of the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go through in any very great detail the items in this Book of Estimates.  However, there are one or two to which I should like to draw the attention of the House and to ask the Minister to indicate what exactly he has in mind.  I referred already to the reduction of £750,000 in relation to the butter subsidy. As I understood the Minister a minute ago, he said that in relation to exports of butter, the Central Exchequer is paying two-thirds and the levy on milk, one-third.  If that is correct, then it appears to me&mdash;and if I am wrong, the Minister can correct me&mdash;from this Book of Estimates, from this sum and from the Minister's speech, that the Government expect there will be no exports of butter during the current year.</P>
    <P>Last year, we were told&mdash;I am talking about the season 1959&mdash;there were no exports of butter, not because of anything for which this Government were responsible but because of the appalling autumnal conditions of 1958. This year, there is no such excuse. As if that excuse were not sufficient, we were also told last year by members of the Government that the drought of last summer affected, as it did, milk supplies and that, therefore, there was a second reason why there was no export of butter <Col N="115" /> last year.  This year, the figures show and the speech of the Minister indicates, that, in the opinion of the Government, there will be virtually no butter exported.  Surely the Government are not estimating for another drought this year?  They cannot estimate for another repetition of the appalling weather conditions of 1958 because that period of the year has already gone.  The only thing one is forced to accept is that, under this Government, the situation has arrived in which our exports of butter have dwindled away and that source of foreign purchasing power that existed in earlier years has now gone as a result of the activity of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister in his reply to explain in far greater detail what he has in mind in that respect. I should like him also to explain the fact that there is nothing in this Book of Estimates for the promise made by the Minister for Local Government on a motion dealing with the Local Authorities (Works) Act just before Christmas.  At that time, the Minister for Local Government said that the Government were not prepared to set aside any moneys for the Local Authorities (Works) Act, but that instead they were going to make provision this year for new works, works which would be carried out by the Board of Works and works which, as far as I can understand the meaning of what the Minister said at that time, could fairly be classed as minor arterial drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>Yet, if Deputies look at page 46 of the Book of Estimates now before us and look at the position in respect of Subhead J.2, they will see the last item of that subhead&mdash;I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary has returned because I want him particularly to explain the last subhead there for &ldquo;Additional Minor Schemes&rdquo;.  If there is anywhere in this Book of Estimates in which there should be included the substitute for the Local Authorities (Works) Act promised this House in December, I should have thought it would be the subhead &ldquo;Additional Minor Schemes&rdquo;, but it is not under that.</P>

      <P>Instead, &ldquo;Additional Minor Schemes&rdquo; are cut in half this year.  When this House was debating the omission of funds for the Local Authorities (Works) Act before Christmas, the discussion did not centre around schemes of major arterial drainage.  Those are schemes such as the Corrib, the Maine, the Inny and the Moy&mdash;the schemes mentioned in paragraph (a) of Subhead J.2.  The case then made to this House, the case put up by the Government, was that they accepted there was a need to do the type of drainage formerly done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It was accepted there was a need for that type of minor drainage and that some provision would be made this year in that respect.  However, the Minister said the Government felt the method of operating through local authorities was not the right method and that this year that type of scheme&mdash;and all of us in rural Ireland know the type of scheme we have in mind&mdash;would be done, not by the county councils through the provisions of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, but by the Board of Works, under the supervision of Deputy Brennan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, but what is open for discussion is that this Government in that respect, as in many <Col N="117" /> others, with the publication of this Book of Estimates, have again broken their word, as they broke it in many other respects since the general election of 1957.  I have no desire to discuss details of these Estimates.  We shall have plenty of opportunity to rub the noses of the gentlemen opposite in the Estimates detail by detail.</P>
      <P>However, the principle is involved, and it is one of major importance. When a spokesman of the Government comes in here, gives an undertaking and makes a statement that the work formerly carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act will now be carried out by the Board of Works, then I suggest, with all respect, I am entitled to comment on the fact that in this Book of Estimates, I find no evidence of the implementation of that promise and, not merely that, but I find, on the contrary, a halving of the provision for &ldquo;Additional Minor Schemes&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Without going into detail on the Estimates I think the Minister for Finance will permit me to refer to the provision made for the Land Project, on page 217 of the Book.  If he examines the record, he will find that the provision for the Land Project is £521,000 less than the provision that was made for Land Project work in 1956-57.  Members of this House are quite well able to draw their own conclusions from that and to judge the sincerity of the speech that was made last week by the Minister for Agriculture on the Supplementary Estimate for his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go through the whole picture of the economy as it can be seen at present.  Last week the Central Statistics Office published figures in relation to agricultural production. Let us see what we find there.  In 1959 there was a reduction from the previous year of 137,000 acres of wheat; yet I thought Fianna Fáil were always the apostles of wheat, always boasting that when they got into power they were going to increase and <Col N="118" /> to expand the wheat acreage.  There was a reduction in the acreage under sugar beet last year from 84,600 to 69,200 acres.  That is a reduction of 18.3 per cent., or 15,500 acres.  The wheat reduction to which I referred was from 418,900 acres to 282,200 acres, a reduction of 32.6 per cent. Given that there was bad weather the previous year and that, on that account, some farmers might have shied off wheat, is it not rather strange at the same time that under Fianna Fáil the acreage is cut to two-thirds of what it had been the previous year?</P>
    <P>Continuing on through the summary issued by the Central Statistics Office, look at the figure in relation to pigs&mdash;a decrease in 1959 in our pig population of approximately ten per cent. from that of the previous year.  I see two Deputies over there who know far more about pigs than I could hope to learn and I am sure they will not quarrel when I say that the 1958 figure was a great reduction on the 1957 figure, and on the figure that was there when we were in office.  It has suddenly occurred to me that that could be taken as offensive but I do not mean it to be the least bit offensive. As I say, I see two Deputies over there who know more about farming than I could pretend to do, and the thing which surprises me is that with their knowledge of farming they can support a Government in office that deals with agriculture as this Government has dealt with it.</P>
    <P>In those statistics there was an increase in cattle, a welcome increase, but the more one analyses it the more one sees that the increase was mostly in the older cattle.  I would suggest that the fact that that increase was in the older cattle on the enumeration date, the 1st June, arises from the circumstances of the harvesting weather of the preceding year, and that because of a shortage of hay they were not coming to hand as quickly as they should and, therefore, were not going out as quickly as they should.  It was that circumstance which, to some degree, explains the increase in exports in the latter end of last year compared with the earlier part of it.</P>
    <P>That is the situation as painted by <Col N="119" /> the bulletin issued by the Central Statistics Office in relation to agricultural production in 1959&mdash;corn crops down by nine per cent., root and grain crops down by almost three per cent., a total reduction in grain and root crops of 124,200 acres, pigs down by ten per cent., and cattle and sheep up. It is good to realise that, for example, in relation to the increase in industrial exports of wool, it came from the sheep that were brought back to Ireland as a result of the policy of the previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon.  That wool could not be there if it were not for the fact that under his régime in the Department of Agriculture there had been an astounding increase in the number of sheep.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned industrial exports in that connection, is it not right that one should bear in mind that the increase that there has been in industrial exports has stemmed virtually from the period when we, as a Government in 1956, for the first time changed the taxation code so as to provide additional incentives towards that necessary part of our economy? As far as I can recollect, and again I will speak subject to correction if the present incumbent of the Ministry for Finance, Deputy Dr. Ryan, tells me I am wrong, no taxation incentive other than the incentive towards savings provided in respect of insurance, had ever been introduced by any Government until we first introduced the taxation incentive in relation to mining, and subsequently introduced the taxation incentives in relation to exports.  I admit and welcome the fact that the present Minister for Finance, while not varying the mining taxation incentives to any very material extent, did increase further the incentives towards exports but I do not think he will quarrel with me when I say that all he did was travel a little bit further along the road that we had signposted out for him.</P>
    <P>When we look at our industrial exports and see any increase that there may be, we are entitled to say that those increases stemmed to a very large extent from the fact that incentives, for <Col N="120" /> the first time, were provided by us in 1956 for the purpose of making people more export minded and that they succeeded in that intention.</P>
    <P>We were told also in relation to industrial production that the welcome increase that had arisen in the second quarter of 1959 would be maintained in the third quarter of that year notwithstanding the fact that there always had been a fallback in the third quarter.  That was stated in this House by one of the Minister's colleagues. What are the facts?  The Economic Series that have been issued by the Central Statistics Office show that while industrial production in the third quarter of 1959 was up over industrial production in the third quarter of 1958 it was, nevertheless, 3.2 per cent. down when compared with the second quarter of 1959.</P>
    <P>We know also the situation in relation to employment.  Between 1956 and 1958 there was a reduction of 32,000 in the total number of those who were at work.  We have not yet got the 1959 figure in respect of all its constituent parts but we do know, again on the authority of the Central Statistics Office given in this House on the 10th February, that those who were employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing, in 1959, numbered 9,000 fewer than those who were similarly employed in the preceding year.</P>
    <P>We are told&mdash;if it were true we would welcome the fact&mdash;that there has been some increase in manufacturing industry.  We had a discussion here before Christmas in relation to the only method I know of judging this before the final figures are made available, that is to say, sales of insurance stamps.  The sales of insurance stamps, quarter by quarter, are issued in the Economic Series.  We have now got another quarter on which to judge.  In relation to that quarter I would say without fear of contradiction that any increase that there has been in the sale of insurance stamps, as a means of judging employment, arises from two things&mdash;first from the increase in the income level of those who are bound to have cards stamped and, secondly, in respect of the administrative arrangements that have been made by the Department of <Col N="121" /> Social Welfare to cut down the carry forward, to cut down the arrears that there might be at any given time in relation to the stamping of cards.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister for Finance to deny, when he is replying to the debate, that an order has gone out from the Minister for Social Welfare that efforts are to be made to speed up the collection of stamps, to speed up the returns in this respect.  If that is so, there is inevitably bound to be, in relation to the sales of stamps series in the Economic Series, an increase in the number of stamps sold.</P>

      <P>I am not asking the Minister for Finance to accept responsibility. I am asking him to enquire from his colleague and to inform the House, in his reply to this debate, whether such an order has been issued or not.</P>
      <P>Those of us who move through rural Ireland know the position as we see it.  We know what the situation is.  I challenge contradiction from the other side of the House when I say that in any shop in any town in Ireland, in any village in Ireland, you will hear the same story, that money is tighter than they ever knew it before. I have taken the opportunity in travelling around the country to enquire, in relation both to my political activities and my professional activities.  I am told the same thing everywhere, that shopkeepers are finding it more difficult than usual to collect accounts.  I am told by my colleagues in the solicitors' profession that, in their professional business, they are finding it more difficult than ever before to collect accounts for their clients.  Some of them tell me that they are getting more accounts to collect because their shopkeeper clients are not able to get in the money themselves.  Anywhere we go, fairs and markets are worse than they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No wonder money is tighter than it was before.  Many of the people in rural Ireland, unfortunately, have gone.  It does not matter to what area one goes&mdash;it used to be only the west&mdash;one finds the same story, that <Col N="122" /> people have emigrated.  In every area the same story is being told, that things are more and more difficult.</P>
    <P>It is in that pattern, that picture, that the Minister for Finance has so signally failed in his duty as to come into this House and ask for £4,750,000 more on current account even than last year.  He has come to this House to demand from the pockets of the taxpayer a staggering sum more than was ever asked for in the history of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody will agree that the increase in the figure on the Book of Estimates is substantial. Even in itself, the actual figure on the Book of Estimates is a formidable one but I want to confess at the start that I am not so frightened about the figure on the Book of Estimates or about the increase in the figure as compared with last year if I can satisfy myself, first, as to the manner in which the money is spent and, secondly&mdash;it does not arise in this debate&mdash;how the money is to be raised, in order to meet the most of this £123,000,000.</P>
      <P>The increase of £7,000,000 includes an increase on capital services of something like £4,000,000.  I do not think anybody could argue against increases provided for under the headings of eradication of bovine tuberculosis, housing grants, arterial drainage, forestry development, while some&mdash;not I&mdash;might doubt the wisdom in certain respects of expenditure of well over £1½ million on the Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports.  However, I would be with Deputy Sweetman when he asks the House whether we are getting value for money and in particular when he poses the question in regard to what he described as the tremendous sum we are spending on our health services. There is the sum of £3 million odd it is proposed to spend on non-capital services, but over and above all that, over and above what one thinks about the size of the figure in the Book of Estimates, we are forced to admit there are no radical changes made in the pattern of State expenditure nor have there been many changes made in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> In many cases the increases have been necessary by reason of the fact that costs and wages have gone up and none of us&mdash;least of all we in the Labour Party&mdash;has objected to increases granted to such people as State servants, whether those increases were big or small, so as to provide against the various increases in the cost of living. I should like, however, to pose the question which Deputy Norton raised in this House on the Vote on Account last year.  He asked&mdash;and I do not think it is out of place to ask the same question this year and to try to get an answer to it&mdash;what effect the expenditure of this sum of £123 million will have on the lives of the people of Ireland?  That is a question which must be answered by the Government through its spokesman, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>With a great fanfare of trumpets and much speechmaking in the autumn of 1958, the Government announced what they termed the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  Reading over it I took particular notice of the last paragraph which described the Programme in detail.  Paragraph 139 reads:</P>
    <P>The programme outlined in this White Paper is calculated to release a dynamic of progress in the Irish economy.  Making all allowances for imprecision in the available information, it is estimated that the implementation of the programme will result in an increase in real national income of some 2 per cent. per annum; this rate, which is twice that achieved in recent years, would double the national income in real terms in 35 years.  The programme will, therefore, make a significant contribution towards the advancement of national prosperity, but, in the last report, progress will depend on the determination of the people to prosper, on their capacity for hard work and on their willingness to cooperate in the fulfilment of a comprehensive national programme.</P>
    <P>Those are fine-sounding words, very colourful phrases.  There is talk about a dynamic of progress.  There is mention <Col N="124" /> of advancement of national prosperity and of the capacity for hard work.  The Minister did refer to the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and mentioned what State aid was being given in the coming financial year, but I do not think anybody can say, after the first year of this <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, that there has been anything like a dynamic of progress; nor have we seen much advancement of national prosperity.  There was talk of capacity for hard work but there are many people who cannot get any kind of work and who are not allowed to do work, whether it be hard or easy. Therefore in this debate we should take a look at the general situation. When we look at the general situation, without delving too deeply into statistics, I do not think we can say the first year of this programme of economic recovery has been a marked success.  The Government can do a certain amount.  The Government can lead and can inject a certain amount of money into the economy.  The Government can provide ways and means of injecting money other than State moneys into the economy as well.</P>
    <P>It was Deputy Lemass, I think, who, when he was on this side of the House, said that one must judge the general economic well-being of a country through its unemployment figures.  At present we have 71,000 unemployed. The Members of the benches opposite may say: &ldquo;That is 6,000 or 7,000 fewer than last year.&rdquo;  That is a fact but I do not think a reduction of 6,000 in the unemployment figures demonstrates that there has been a dynamic of progress over the last financial year and when one considers with this reduction of 6,000 or 7,000 in the employment figures the numbers who have emigrated over the past year it must be admitted that, so far from having advanced in the last financial year, we have gone back, maybe not back so far as we have in some other years&mdash;even in recent years I am prepared to admit&mdash;but everybody must admit we have not made the progress that this economic programme for national recovery envisaged we would.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into this too <Col N="125" /> deeply but I want to mention this fact because I firmly believe it.  The Government may say there is a reduction of 6,000 or 7,000 in the numbers of unemployed as compared with this time last year but I believe the Minister for Social Welfare had a hand in that.  The Minister for Social Welfare, with his Parliamentary Secretary, in cases where people were in receipt of, or applied for unemployment assistance, changed the means test to such an extent that he has cut down the number of unemployed by some hundreds and in that way he certainly affected the figures.  In regard to the yearly figures of employment, I think the Minister for Social Welfare had a hand in that as well.  It is true he did not do it through any Departmental or administrative act.  He came into the House and changed what is known as the employment period order which deprived people of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance and being ineligible for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, many of them did not sign on the register of unemployed.</P>
    <P>In regard to emigration, I do not think anybody can claim that there has been a vast improvement.  I am prepared to admit that there has been some improvement but that has been due to the fact that we have practically reached saturation point as far as emigration is concerned.  One wonders whether we have now arrived at the situation where the population we have is the population, or somewhat near the population, this country is able to maintain having regard to the economy of the country as designed by this Government.  As a matter of fact the Taoiseach when speaking last Saturday night to a Fianna Fáil Cumann admitted that there was this &ldquo;continuing emigration&rdquo;, to use-two words of his speech.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that I am in any way competent to talk about agriculture, but as a representative of the people of an agricultural county, I must ask certain questions and put forward certain viewpoints.  The first question I should like to ask is one that will not get a direct answer either to-night or when the Minister <Col N="126" /> replies.  Many people are under the impression that we spend an excessive amount on what are generally known as social welfare and social services.  Many people allege that this is non-productive money, that it is pampering people and that it is a colossal sum of money that in some way or other could be saved.  For that reason, sometimes these people who receive that money by way of health services, or by way of social welfare benefits, are criticised and criticised unduly, but we should always remind ourselves that into the agricultural industry in the next financial year will be injected a sum of £12,250,000.  The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and the Government should ask themselves whether or not this £12,250,000 is being given to the right people in the agricultural industry.  There are many who allege that the farmers are prosperous and there are many who hold the contrary viewpoint.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to determine whether or not the farmer's lot has improved in the post-war years.  It is true that some farmers have a high standard of living and there are many farmers with low living standards.  All these people in the agricultural community have been urged to produce more during the past 10 years.  Various Ministers for Agriculture have told the farmers that the solution of all their troubles is to get more production from the land, but what has been the position?  What has been the experience of farmers?  Where did farmers who did produce more find themselves?  They always had an innate fear that if they produced more, they would depress prices and that there would be a limited output. Unfortunately, in recent years, we have had evidence of that in respect of beet and in respect of wheat.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to argue whether or not the Government Party had a certain attitude about wheat in the past, or whether the main Opposition Party had another, or whether or not they traded their opinions.  What I am trying to convey to the House is that in respect of these two very important cash crops, the beet crop and the wheat crop, the experience of the <Col N="127" /> farmer was that when he produced more, it did not do him a substantial amount of good, but, in many cases, did him a tremendous amount of harm.  That was especially true of the small farmer who was not geared to change over from beet to some other crop, or from wheat to some other crop, or to change over to some other agricultural activity.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, therefore, that the small farmer has a special problem. First, he has not got enough land. That is obvious and I do not think anybody need argue about that. Various people have different views as to what an economic holding is. It varies from county to county and province to province.  In my opinion, the second problem of the small farmer is the more difficult and the more important.  It is that he cannot avail, to the same degree as the large farmer, of the grants&mdash;in many cases, the generous grants&mdash;given by the State because in many cases he has to put up a certain amount of money before he can get such a grant. He has to comply with certain conditions before he can avail of that grant. Until we can readjust the distribution of this £12,250,000 to give more to the small farmer, I do not believe we can bring a prosperous era to the farmers.</P>
    <P>Mind you, when one thinks about grants, State aids and agricultural grants, one immediately begins to think about something which this House has often debated, that is, a means test.  Many people see a justification for a means test in respect of an old age pension or a widow's pension. Many people seem to think that a means test is justified in the case of an applicant for unemployment assistance, but there is no means test &mdash;and I do not advocate it here and now&mdash;in respect of the hundreds of pounds, the thousands of pounds and the millions of pounds given out to every single person in the farming community.  I know it would be difficult to try to distribute that £12,250,000 on a equitable basis and having regard to the financial circumstances of the large farmer and the <Col N="128" /> small farmer, but it does seem to me, and I shall believe it until I get evidence to the contrary, that the beet farmers receive State aid out of all proportion to what they produce as against the small and the medium farmer.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the Government, the Minister for Finance, and in particular, the Minister for Agriculture, should, as soon as possible, have a review of the State aid given under the Agricultural Vote.  It is true, of course, to say that many farmers have brought on their own difficulties and it is particularly true to say in respect of the small or medium-sized farmer that in recent years he has put a tremendous burden about his neck by the amount of machinery he has bought.  I do not believe the purchase of that machinery in many cases was absolutely necessary.  Apart from the fact&mdash;from the Labour Party's point of view&mdash;that it displaced a tremendous number of workers, it is machinery which in many cases is used for only a relatively small portion of the year.  That is why the Labour Party have always advocated the co-operative method.  Many may say that the temperament of our farmers is not such that they would adopt the co-operative method, but when one sees so many small holdings around the country with tractors, combines and so on, lying idle for most of the year, one becomes more and more in favour of a method by which a small community of farmers could use the same machinery, whether in the spring or autumn.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty of the small farmer which no Government have solved for him is that he cannot get credit easily.  There may be arrangements for it and there may be intimations from the commercial banks that credit is available for this, that, and the other thing, but they want security and the small farmer has not got it.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation to whom we devote so much money here year after year, in my opinion, do not give a fair crack of the whip to the small farmer.  It is common talk around the country that you get money from the Agricultural <Col N="129" /> Credit Corporation only when you have money, when you do not need it. It is the small man who cannot get credit who needs the money to develop his farm.  He is the man who should get the credit easily from such organisations as the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>However, it seems that we must admit, reluctantly though we do, that the agricultural industry has not prospered in the past 25, 30 or 40 years. It certainly has not prospered, no matter what Government were in power.  The evidence of that lies in the fact that the agricultural industry in a big area, can afford to pay only a miserable £5 5s. per week to the farm labourer.  We could talk at length on whether or not the farmers could pay more, or should pay more, but that is the minimum wage laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board. Each farmer Deputy must readily admit that the industry which can afford only £5 5s. per week to a farm labourer certainly has not succeeded over the past 25, 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we are told the agricultural industry is the industry on which we mainly depend.  Unfortunately, it is not an industry from which we can get employment.  The evidence, in recent years, has been that employment in the agricultural industry has dropped, and dropped rapidly, since the war years.  As I said before, that it due, to a large extent, to the too rapid introduction of unnecessary, in many cases, agricultural machinery.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach tells us, and has told us on many previous occasions, that industry must provide not only increased production, and not only must it expand, but that it is to industry we look for the additional employment which is so badly needed to keep our people at home, and to take up the surplus of those who are not now required on the land.  Nobody will argue that if the country is to prosper, and the problem I have mentioned is to be resolved, there must be increased production in the agricultural industry.  I am quite amused when I hear people, especially professional people, economists and politicians, telling us we <Col N="130" /> must work harder.  Of course, the only person they mean is the man who works with his hands.</P>
    <P>Harder work will mean increased production, but, as I say, it is only the man in the factory, on the roads, or in the fields, the farmers and those engaged in the agricultural industry who are expected to work harder.  The evidence has been that the industrial worker will play his part in an endeavour to give increased production, but will he be allowed to do so?  Is he to work himself out of a job?  We have had too many examples of that in recent years.  If he works abnormally hard or unusually hard, he will work himself out of a job.  If any Deputy wants an example of workers working themselves out of a job, I can give it to him in private.</P>
    <P>The workers have only an eight-and-a-half hour or an eight-hour day within which to work.  I believe the Irish worker works as hard as anybody else, but we can get increased work only if the management of industry introduce improved methods and more efficient machinery.  There are some firms which cannot afford better machinery to increase their production and generally to improve their efficiency.  A peculiar thing which often strikes me is that whilst a newly established industry in certain parts of the country can get grants and loans to establish itself, and provide new machinery, the old established industries are left on their own.  There is no provision in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, and there is no Act of Parliament of which I am aware, that will come to the assistance of a firm which wants to instal new machinery, without attaching heavy conditions to any assistance which may be given by way of loan.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government should, by way of legislation or otherwise, or through the Industrial Credit Company, introduce some scheme whereby firms which are established for 100, 150 or 200 years, will be enabled to bring their machinery up-to-date, and so provide more efficient methods, and consequently increase production.  I mentioned this on many occasions in this House, but I want again to make <Col N="131" /> a plea for equal assistance for the establishment of industries in all parts of the country.  It is wrong that there should be special financial facilities for the establishment of an industry in a particular part of the country merely because it happens to be on a particular side of a river, or merely because people speak a certain language there, or are supposed to speak it.  I do not think they should be given assistance which is not given to all parts of the country.  The unfortunate thing is that Governments, particularly Fianna Fáil Governments, have endeavoured to establish industries in parts of the country where there is no tradition of running an industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I speak about administration, because it has occurred to me that in another piece of legislation, the Government, or one of the semi-State bodies have power, in certain cases, with certain qualifications, to give equal assistance for the establishment of industries in all parts of the country?  In my opinion, that has not been the practice since that legislation was introduced.  I merely ask now that the Government, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the administration of those Acts, should give equal assistance to all parts of the country where it is proposed to establish an industry.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said recently&mdash;and again, I think it was on Saturday night&mdash;that one of the conditions for success was that all sections would co-operate. On another occasion when he spoke in this House, he said that the success of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> depended on the goodwill of associations like the National Farmers' Association, chambers of commerce, the commercial Banks and other people, and on that occasion&mdash;we know it was not deliberate&mdash;he omitted to mention the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is pretty well-known now, through the statements of their spokesmen, that <Col N="132" /> the trade unions are willing to participate in any plan devised by the Government to increase production and provide additional employment.  As a matter of fact, long before the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was published&mdash;and it was published in November, 1958&mdash;the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation published a programme not dissimilar to the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> produced by the Government. Their programme was described as &ldquo;Planning for Full Employment&rdquo;. It was produced in 1956, I think, and it does not differ substantially from the Government's published programme. As a matter of fact, as soon as it was published, the Taoiseach, who was then Deputy Lemass, gave it his wholehearted approval and said he would back it, and help in its implementation, if, and when, he became a member of the Government again.  I merely say to the Taoiseach that he should read again that plan for full employment, and live up to his promise, or the declaration he made, on that occasion in 1956.</P>
    <P>That is an example of how the trade union movement of this country are prepared to co-operate, and an example of how hard they will work in an effort &mdash;I do not say everyone agrees with the proposal&mdash;to stimulate production in agriculture, and to improve generally industrial production, because they also appreciate the urgency of increased production in agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>It has long been my opinion, irrespective of what Government is in office, that there is far too little consultation between Governments and the trade union movement.  I do not say that the trade union movement should be the only section of the community to consult the Government. The National Farmers' Association, Chambers of Commerce and especially the commercial banks have conferred with the Government or have been invited to confer with the Government much more frequently than the trade union movement.  The trade union movement is willing to help.  The trade union movement is willing to confer with the Government.  It represents well over 500,000 persons in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> I often think it strange to hear Ministers, when introducing legislation to this House, say for example: &ldquo;We discussed with the solicitors&rdquo; or &ldquo;We discussed with the Incorporated Law Society and they have agreed.&rdquo;  Sometimes a Minister may say: &ldquo;We discussed this with the Creamery Milk Suppliers,&rdquo;&ldquo;We discussed this with the National Farmers' Association.&rdquo;&ldquo;We discussed this with the banks,&rdquo;&ldquo;We discussed this with the teachers&rdquo; or some other organisation.  Never do I hear in respect, say, of social welfare legislation or legislation in connection with wages or P.A.Y.E., and so on&mdash;except in respect of one matter in my time in this House, the Apprenticeship Bill&mdash;&ldquo;We have discussed the matter and got agreement with the trade union movement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whilst the main and primary duty of the trade union movement is to safeguard wages and conditions of employment of workers it is also concerned with the matters mentioned in their booklet <i>Planning for Full Employment,</i> with the general question of production, distribution and marketing of goods, and has shown evidence of that in the plan produced 3½ years ago.  I readily admit that whilst the Government can do a certain amount they are not the be-all and the end-all, even as far as employment is concerned.  I should think that employers generally can make a contribution towards the reduction of emigration.  We have much too much casual employment.  The attitude of employers who let off men for days and weeks, take them on again and let them off again is to be deplored. That sort of behaviour towards any worker in any country is to be deplored. Many an employer will say about a workman: &ldquo;He is being let off only for a week.&rdquo;  In that respect, public bodies err also and particularly county councils with regard to their road workers.  Let me give an example.</P>
    <P>On one occasion, I went to one of the district engineers and asked him to give a job to a particular person.  The reply I got was: &ldquo;Sure, he got ten months' work last year.&rdquo;  Ten months' work is supposed to be sufficient for a man.  The implication was that he got <Col N="134" /> much more than any of the other workers who had some casual work with the county council.  However, ten months' work is not good enough for anybody.  It is not good enough for the barrister, the shopkeeper, the teacher or for any of the professions.  What this country must aim at and what employers must co-operate in is an endeavour to give security of employment to our workers by keeping them on as long as possible trying to guarantee twelve months' work to them.  The man who is told he will be laid off for a month must, no matter what the size of his family, live on £3 1s. per week.  He can get across to England for £3 or to London for £4. Surely, a man in such circumstances would gladly gather the £4 and go to London or Birmingham and get a job there for twelve months in the year?</P>
    <P>We should be concerned about the loss of workers to this country.  I deplore the attitude of certain of the farming community who lay off their agricultural workers and who say: &ldquo;It is a bad time; it is a wet season; come back again when the weather is dry or when we are going to do this, that or the other.&rdquo;  If that sort of behaviour continues in this country there will come a time when agricultural workers can be had at only a very high premium.  They will not be available for 5 guineas, or 7 guineas or 10 guineas per week.  They will be so scarce that farmers will have to pay them quite a ridiculous amount of money in wages.</P>
    <P>It does not seem that the Government's policy on the establishment of industry has been very successful in the past three years.  I know there are many financial inducements; I have talked about them.  I know there is encouragement by way of financial hand-outs and loan facilities.  Nevertheless, we have not got extra factories to the extent that we have made any appreciable impression on the number of unemployed.  While private industry &mdash;established in this country, as it has been, for so long&mdash;has filled a big gap it does not seem to have availed of the opportunities that exist.  Therefore, on another occasion, I want to ask the Government seriously to consider entering certain branches of the field <Col N="135" /> of industry.  I have not in mind that the Government should enter into competition with the man in a small way in industry or in small things.</P>
    <P>Nobody saw any objection when the Government entered industry in the production of electricity or in the production of turf.  Nobody took exception when the Government went into the shipping business or when they got the monopoly in relation to sugar.  Nobody sees any objection to the fact that the Government are the main people engaged in the production of timber through their forests. Therefore, why should the Government not enter other fields of industry? Some people may point out that these are essential services or essential products.  However, there is a precedent for it.</P>
    <P>I would not be critical of the action of the Government in a town in Ireland about two years ago when they established a factory.  They provided the capital and appointed directors who took over the business and employed the necessary people. When I raised the matter with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and with the Minister for Finance, they said it is not State enterprise. There was so much fiddling&mdash;I do not use the word &ldquo;fiddling&rdquo; in its basest connotation&mdash;between the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Industrial Credit Company, the Department of Finance, and here and there that I suppose one could prove theoretically that it was not State-established. However, it was State-established inasmuch as the money to establish that factory was raised in the name of the Irish people.  Whether it was raised by way of National Loan or otherwise does not make any difference.  It was raised in the name of the Irish people to establish a successful industry within the past two years in one of our Irish towns.</P>
    <P>I do not say the Government should take over industry entirely&mdash;far from it.  However, a Government is surely justified in establishing industries where private enterprise will not do so in order to keep Irish men and women at home, working in their own country.  They are very well equipped, <Col N="136" /> through the Department of Industry and Commerce and through the Industrial Development Authority, to know the type of factory to be established. I think that with the facilities at their disposal and with the knowledge they have, they could at least alleviate acute unemployment in many pockets in provincial towns.  They need not run the factory; they can establish a factory.  They should have a fair idea whether it will be a success or not, having regard to the knowledge they have of the commodities that are imported or the commodities that could be exported.</P>
    <P>I often wonder why we do not carry out a serious &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. I remember very well many years ago when I was not even in my teens, a campaign that was conducted by President Cosgrave, as he was then described.  He did a tremendous amount of good, I thought, away back in the 1920s, campaigning the country and asking the people to buy Irish. Everybody who heard him on that occasion was impressed At least I was. Whether I was of an impressionable age or not does not make any difference.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that the Government, through their various Departments, could intensify a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign because I do not believe the people realise how very much we could improve our economy if we were all determined to buy Irish, if we were satisfied that the goods were goods which suited us.  Nobody now seems to care so long as it is in the country whether it is made in Ireland, Britain, Germany, Japan, America or any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>We can well campaign, and the Government members can well campaign, to get a President elected, a Government elected or people elected to local bodies.  That may happen only once in every four years.  A similar sort of campaign to tell the people why they should buy Irish and what advantage it would be to the country to buy Irish would, in my opinion, do a tremendous amount of good.</P>
    <P>I think it can well be said that it is the aim of all Parties as quickly as we <Col N="137" /> can to raise the standard of living and to employ all our people.  We are told that we have the resources in agriculture. We are told that our resources in agriculture are such that we can develop industry to an extent that will provide employment for many more of our people in the years to come.  We must see that that is done as quickly as possible but in the meantime people are going from the country.</P>
    <P>I think it is a stupid sort of thing to have said in the past three or four years that the only type of work the Government will give substantial sums of money for is productive work.  It was easy for them to say that because the establishment of productive work had to be planned over a period.  In the meantime, as I said, we had 58,000, two years ago, leaving the country.  Last year, we had something like 35,000 or 32,000 and this year, goodness knows how many more we shall have, but whether it be more or not, it will not make any difference because thousands will go.</P>
    <P>We should, therefore, ask ourselves if we have regard for these people who are now contemplating emigration. Should we not make an effort to keep them employed at home?  If we believe them should be kept at home, is it not worth spending money to provide jobs to keep them at home?  For that reason, one deplores the entire scrapping of the subhead of the Estimate which provided jobs for thousands of people&mdash;the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance another question.  I am sure he is concerned about this matter.  It must be about 12 months ago that the Taoiseach again used another one of his gimmicks in an endeavour to boost the morale of the workers&mdash;sending a letter signed by himself to every local authority requesting them to send as quickly as possibly what schemes they had for the employment of men.</P>
    <P>He sent it to Cork, Kerry, Wexford and Galway and to urban councils, town commissioners and county councils. I suppose if the costs of all the schemes were added up, it would be <Col N="138" /> a fantastic amount of millions of pounds of money.  What happened to it?  The Taoiseach invited every local authority to submit what schemes they could.  He said there was plenty of money there.  He did not say it in the letter but in this House.  He said they had plenty of money for any worthwhile scheme and he asked the people to send up worthwhile schemes. I ask the Government now: up to last week, was any one of them approved or sanctioned?  If there was, there was no announcement about it.  I know that the local bodies in my constituency sent up various schemes. Some of them were rejected and none of them was approved.  Have any of the schemes from Cork, Dublin, Athlone or Donegal been approved of?  Was this another gimmick used by the Taoiseach, when he knew the morale of the people was sagging, to boost it up again?</P>
    <P>I remember well in 1953, when we had a big unemployment problem, the acting Minister for Finance, the present Minister for External Affairs, came into this House and introduced a piece of legislation known as the National Development Fund Act, the purpose of which was to establish the national development fund.  The then acting Minister for Finance, told the House that every year there would be £5 million in that Fund, out of which money could be drawn to provide work for people who were unemployed. It was a simple as that.  I do not think any Fianna Fáil Deputy will contradict me in regard to the description I have given of the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>There was a sum of £5 million out of which money could be taken to put people to work.  It did not talk about productive employment.  It did not say that you must produce things. They could be paid on Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes, on road work or any sort of drainage and forestry.  That disappeared.  I am advocating tonight that in order to keep more families and their children at home in Ireland, that sort of money be provided again.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach asks us to have faith and confidence in our country.  How <Col N="139" /> long are we to have confidence?  If he is confident and if we are confident that we can establish factories in five years, would it not be worth while, within the five years until factories are established and until there is increased industrial employment, to spend not £10 million, £20 million or £25 million but even more to keep Irishmen and women at home?  It would not be productive employment and somebody might ask where the money is to come from.  The Taoiseach says that plenty of money can be raised. If money can be raised to establish industry, surely it is equally important to raise money to keep the people in Ireland and not have them emigrating to England to be lost for ever?</P>
    <P>I spoke about the possibility of the Government establishing factories and I saw a clear hope when I read nearly 18 months ago the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  I was attracted also by paragraph 68 of that booklet. It read like this in a reference to fish-processing factories: &ldquo;An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will build these factories if the private sector fails to do so, and will consider leasing them to private concerns.&rdquo;  There was a hope of the Government stepping in where private enterprise would not but there is no indication to-day that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has any intention of doing what was promised in paragraph 68 of the booklet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman has dealt fairly extensively with the problem of housing and has given information to refute some of the statements made here last Thursday by the Minister for Local Government when he told the House that there was much more building and many more men employed now than in the period when the inter-Party Government were in office.  Immediately he said that I put down a question asking him to state the number of men engaged in local authority house-building on the nearest available date and on similar dates in 1959, 1958, 1957 and 1956. The reply I got was that on the 31st January, 1960 the figure was 1,781; on the same date in 1959, it was 2,583; in 1958, 2,604; in 1957, 4,580 and in 1956 6,147.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> I do not want to make a song and dance about these figures; I merely quote them to refute the statement made by the Minister for Local Government. I think we have a housing problem on our hands apart from the fact that I do not believe that we know at the present time how many houses we really need.  I believe that the surveys carried out by various local authorities are not accurate and, even if they were, I think local bodies would have to change their attitude towards the building of houses for what were termed the working classes.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see&mdash;and I think most Deputies in the House with experience of local authorities and local authority conditions will agree&mdash;the big difficulty is that people cannot afford to pay the rents of local authority houses.  Where there is a big number of applicants for houses the difficulty of the local authority is to decide not who is in the greatest need of a house but who can pay for it. That is a serious situation because we find people having these houses allocated to them who, five, six or ten years ago, would not be housed while people who cannot afford to pay the rent&mdash;or even half the rent&mdash;are left without houses.  That is a problem for the Government at present and a problem that must be tackled vigorously. It is not true to say that the housing problem has been solved but it is true that there are many thousands of people at present deserving good houses but living in bad and insanitary conditions and in houses in respect of which demolition orders have been made.  The local authorities are not building houses to suit the pockets of such people.</P>
    <P>Even if the State provides a certain amount of assistance for local authorities towards house building at present, I think they will have to consider giving even greater grants or making some concession in regard to the rate of interest on money from the Local Loans Fund or make some other concession to enable local authorities to build houses for the people most in need of them.  I do not say that there has been illegal letting or that people who occupy local authority houses should not have got them: the Department of Local Government <Col N="141" /> is quite well able to look after that, but the fact remains that quite a number of people cannot avail of the houses built by local authorities at present.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us recently and continues to say that we must have confidence in the country's future. Nobody would take exception to that but one must also have confidence that there is a future for himself and his family in this country.  He remains doubtful unless he is shown otherwise. If there is insecurity in his employment, if he is only casually employed he cannot have much confidence.  If the father of a teenage family sees little immediate prospect for his children he cannot have confidence in the future.</P>
    <P>The problem with the family man at present, if he has a child leaving school having done the Intermediate or Leaving Certificate, is what to find for them to do.  The fear of every family is that as soon as the boys or girls finish their schooling they will go to England and fathers and mothers become nearly frantic at the thought of their doing so.  It does not happen in every case; some are brainy enough to get into the Civil Service, a bank, or some commercial employment but a big number seem to have no prospect of work at home.  The parents' fears may be unfounded in some cases but they do not seem to see much in prospect.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, the Government must give a lead in inspiring confidence. We should, here and now, agree to forget the past.  I do not mean the fighting past, so to speak, but the comparison between what one did five or ten years ago with what another did; what one thought of this or that and what another thought of it; how critical some people were of the grass policy; what they said in the House and what we said in the House.  Talking like that does not inspire confidence in our young people.  It is inevitable that these discussions and arguments crop up from time to time and I suppose it is very hard to forget the past, whether the warring past or the economic past, but the Government must inspire confidence in the <Col N="142" /> people, especially in the younger people.  One cannot do that by merely telling them that the prospects are bright.  They must be shown evidence of it and so far, in the lifetime of this Government, there has been little evidence of any advance.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Government must make their plans not so much with an eye on the next general election but with a determination to lead the country to an improvement of living standards.  If we merely make our plans and order our business to coincide with general elections I do not think we shall get progress.  Ministers and Governments are tempted to act like that but until we can, by our actions, show that we ourselves have confidence in the future of the country I do not believe that the people will have confidence that there is a future.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to usurp the functions of the Minister for Finance in replying to what Deputy Sweetman or the last speaker said nor do I pretend to be competent to do so but I should like to make one general reference to what Deputy Sweetman said in his lengthy speech on this Vote.  Perhaps, what he said was not nearly so important as what he did not say.</P>
      <P>The last speaker concluded by pointing out the importance of restoring confidence in the country by letting the people know whether or not we were moving in the right direction in regard to any branch of policy. I do not think we had a single suggestion from either of the two speakers.  They criticised the magnitude of the Estimates and tried to take credit for some of the increased expenditure under the heading of capital development by pointing out that they, in their time, gave the necessary impetus to policy which had now resulted in a demand for extra expenditure.  There is nothing constructive in that.  If we are to get any inspiration or if the confidence of the country is to be restored, we shall have to look elsewhere than to the speeches which have just been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be interested to hear what the Deputy has to say when his turn comes.  In making the statement I have just made, I do not think I was unduly critical.  I listened carefully to the last two speeches.  The last speaker was not so severe in his criticism nor did he attempt to take credit for what he believed would be popular, as the previous speaker did, and at the same time decry anything which might not be popular and point to the alleged failure to implement certain points of policy.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the type of Estimate before us rather than the detail.  I shall not venture to discuss in detail matters which will come up for detailed discussion on each individual Estimate.  I am surprised that none of the speakers referred to expenditure on such things as the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and the increased estimate for advanced agricultural education, possibly one of the most important features of the Estimates.  Reference to these matters was conspicuous by its absence.  Deputy Sweetman contented himself mainly with bringing out a few figures in relation to housing to try to show there was greater activity in that respect during his years in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be ample opportunity to discuss that in detail when the Estimate is before us. However, I am satisfied that the activity on private housing in the past year, both in the reconstruction and erection of new houses, was something we can rightly be proud of.  The last speaker tried to complicate the issue by mixing up local authority housing with private housing.  He referred to figures for employment on local authority housing on comparative dates over the last few years.  Everybody is well aware that local authority housing is now tapering off but that there is yet much to be done in the <Col N="144" /> matter of private housing.  It is on that type of housing we must lay emphasis now.  The number of application forms which a Deputy must carry in his pocket nowadays to hand out to the numerous people seeking the rather generous grants available is in itself an indication of the activity under that heading.  However, we still have a long way to go, but I am glad the necessary provision is being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving my own experience in regard to my constituents' requests.  Other Deputies may have a different experience.  One of my most active fields of operation is procuring the application forms necessary for persons desiring to avail of grants for houses, either in the reconstruction or erection of new houses.  I take that as a criterion of the activity throughout the year.  I would venture to say it was the most active we ever had, pending the publication of the figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall come to that in a moment.  We are very proud of our record there, too.  A good deal of play was made about unemployment and emigration but nobody ventured to go too deeply into either subject. The last speaker admitted that the unemployment figures today show a reduction of 7,000 compared with the same period last year.  He seemed <Col N="145" /> to think that was not sufficient.  Every Deputy would like to see a greater reduction in unemployment.  He also went as far as to admit that when the figures for emigration were published, as far as it is possible to ascertain them, they, too, would possibly show a reduction.  But he said we were not moving sufficiently fast in that direction either.  We would all like to see greater progress made in both these important matters.  But at least let us admit we are moving in the right direction.</P>
      <P>However disappointing it may be to the members of the Opposition who would prefer to see the figures the other way, let us be frank enough to admit we are all sufficiently interested in the welfare of the country that we have reached the stage where we will give credit for any good which has been done.  If the confidence referred to by the previous speaker is to be restored, then it is time we set about tackling our problems in that way.</P>
      <P>Employment is not something which grows up overnight.  I was particularly interested in the suggestion of the Leader of the Labour Party that more money should be made available for the relief of unemployment. That may require the carrying out of what are known as relief schemes.  A certain amount of that work is absolutely essential, particularly when related to works of utility, but I wonder will Deputies on the Opposite side argue that huge sums should be channelled into the promotion of relief works alone when so much money could be so usefully spent in financing more permanent employment of a productive type, the type which Deputy Corish admits does not happen overnight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After castigating the Government for their failure to implement more rapidly the proposals in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, in the next breath he admitted that the results of that programme, however good they were, could not be made evident in a short time.  In making that point he advocated the expenditure of more money for the temporary relief of unemployment.  I <Col N="146" /> was particularly interested in his agreeing that the proposals in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> were sound, though the results could not be immediately forthcoming, but I fail to see how the expenditure of extra money on the temporary relief of unemployment could have any important effect on emigration, even on that type of emigration which is brought about by sheer economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>We know there is the other type of emigration which, possibly, we always shall have where people will go to a better labour market, where better wages and higher salaries are available, but the type of emigration which everyone deplores is that brought about by sheer economic circumstances.  I do not think that a fortnight's work or a month's work at any time on a bog road or other scheme will stop that type of emigration, though I must say that these works are very important and I should be the last in the House to say otherwise.</P>
    <P>We make fairly generous provision for them but I believe they must be directly related to works of utility.  The amount of employment which we gain from them can hardly be expected to give other than a few weeks' work in the year to smallholders and persons of that type who may be temporarily unemployed in the winter months from November to March.  However, they do not make any appreciable impact on the figures of unemployment and, with the increase in wages and the inclination to make greater use of machinery, it is becoming increasingly difficult to provide sufficient money to give any worthwhile number of men any employment under that type of scheme.</P>
    <P>Coming down to employment in the industrial field, which the previous speaker referred to at considerable length, the figure which is required to give employment to one individual is so great in comparison with what it was, say 30 years ago, that one requires to have a tremendous impetus in industrialisation in any country to have any appreciable effect on the figures of employment.  On the other <Col N="147" /> side, in the agricultural field, the output in agriculture can be considerably increased.  The figures over the past few years show that to be the case, but there is no corresponding increase in the number of people employed in agriculture.  The opposite is actually the case and that does not apply more to this country than to any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>No Deputy who has spoken proffered, nor will any of those yet to speak, be likely to proffer, any panacea for that rather particular situation.  If we are to make a constructive approach to the problems which are confronting us, the man in the street will be more interested to hear what solutions those Deputies have to offer to these serious and important problems.  I do not think that any Deputy who seriously approaches this matter will contend that unemployment can be solved in any short period.</P>

      <P>I can visualise good work being done under the Local <Col N="150" /> Authorities (Works) Act in 25 years' time when the main channels will have been cleaned to give the flood waters a chance to empty into the sea, but it is sheer nonsense to suggest that it was a worthwhile scheme to start at the upper end of the job, to divert the water on to somebody else's land, to create problems that were insoluble, and to make no provision for maintenance.</P>
      <P>The programme of arterial drainage is expanding more rapidly than even the architects of the 1945 Act anticipated. That is largely due to the good summer of last year.  Drainage of a permanent type was carried out which will permit of further drainage to deal with smaller arteries and, finally, field drainage.  It is the type of work which was recommended by the Commission which thoroughly investigated the problem.  Its success is reflected in the clamour at the moment from places like Deputy McQuillan's constituency to have work carried out immediately. It is not physically or financially possible to have all schemes undertaken at the same time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout Ireland.  I think I should refer to one of the matters raised by Deputy Corish in regard to the question of Irish-manufactured goods and the necessity, as he put it, to promote a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign more vigorously than is being done at the present time.  I thought we had reached the stage when everybody, whether out of sentiment or patriotic duty or otherwise, was prepared to buy Irish goods, if available, in preference to anything else on the market because not merely have we reached the stage where we should buy Irish, for patriotic reasons, or for the purely material reason that the manufacture of such goods employs our own people, but we have gone so far in the industrial drive that we have convinced even the most sceptical and pessimistic, who opposed the industrial drive at the outset, that we are capable of producing goods not merely as well but better than anybody else.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish believes&mdash;and I do not think he was using it for propaganda purposes&mdash;that a good deal has yet to be done.  It is rather serious if that is the case.  When Deputy Corish advocates that the State should directly promote industry to a greater extent than at present, I would remind him that the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> explicitly states that in any case where private enterprise fails or refuses to do the job, the State is prepared to move in, as it has done in the case of Bord na Móna, the Electricity Supply Board aviation and various other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember, successful industry nowadays must be based on the best possible production techniques and the strictest possible management in order to compete on the markets of the world.  It is not always easy for State-sponsored <Col N="152" /> industry to compete with private enterprise, particularly on the export market.  I doubt if it could.  It is easy to understand that State-sponsored industry will succeed in a reserved home market.  That is quite a simple matter.  I doubt very much if State-sponsored industry will ever be able to compete with private enterprise on the export market because of the fact that in State-sponsored and semi-State-sponsored industries, the overheads are rather heavy.  I wonder if the Labour Party have made due allowance for that fact, or are they concerned only with goods which may be produced for a reserved home market?</P>
    <P>The export market and the home market are entirely different matters. I would say that the State should step in only when it is certain that private enterprise, with all the incentives available or which may be made available, has not succeeded.  In saying that, I do not think I am saying anything contrary to the spirit of what is set out in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, that in any case where private enterprise fails or does not undertake the promotion of industry, the State would be prepared to step in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish also made great play with the alleged statement of the Taoiseach that money was available for industry <i>ad lib</i>, so to speak.  If I remember rightly, the Taoiseach, whether as Minister for Industry and Commerce or since becoming Taoiseach, was always careful to point out that for worthwhile projects, there would be no shortage of the necessary capital.  That is somewhat different from saying that there is plenty of money available for employment, which the Labour Party obviously interpret as meaning that we are ready to spend money <i>ad lib</i> on schemes of any type, so long as they relieve unemployment for the time being.</P>
    <P>If all the money that has been canalised into temporary schemes for the immediate relief of unemployment in the past 30 years had been used for the promotion of a properly thought out scheme, such as outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, how much better off would the country be today?  I am not saying that that <Col N="153" /> money was all wasted.  As I have already said, a certain amount of money must have been spent annually on schemes directly related to public utility which, at the same time, provided a measure of relief of unemployment.</P>
    <P>
