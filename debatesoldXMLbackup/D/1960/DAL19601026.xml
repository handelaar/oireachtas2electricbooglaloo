      <P>There are two matters to which I should like to draw the attention of Deputies.  The first is that there are 108 Questions for oral answer on to-day's Order Paper. The second is that, in order to have tomorrow's Order Paper printed, it was necessary to deliver the Questions to the printers before 2 p.m. to-day. It will therefore be impossible to transfer to tomorrow's Order Paper unanswered Questions from to-day's Order Paper and in the circumstances I think it desirable that all Questions on to-day's Order Paper should be answered to-day.  May I therefore request Deputies to be economical in their use of Supplementary Questions?</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have yet decided that the time is opportune to embark on formal negotiations to associate this country with the six Common <Col N="2" /> Market Countries or with the European Free Trade Association; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Question is in the negative.</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to the European Economic Community and the European Free Trade Association has not undergone any such change in recent months as would warrant a change in the attitude we have hitherto adopted, as explained in reply to previous questions in the House and in the fuller statement I made on the subject on the 20th July last in the course of the debate on the Estimate for my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As was announced at the beginning of September, the Government decided to investigate the question of Ireland's accession to the G.A.T.T. and have sought discussions with the contracting parties to this end. The Government intimated at the same time that it would be their desire to obtain terms of accession which would permit of the maintenance of the trade relations between Ireland and Britain provided for in existing Trade Agreements.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have informed the Secretariat of our desire to enter into negotiations.  There is not a central body which decides whether a newcomer can get in or not.  It is a matter for negotiations with all the other countries in the organisation which are interested in our trade.  Preliminary talks have taken place and further talks are contemplated next month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should make himself familiar with the procedures involved.  The various countries which are members of G.A.T.T. are meeting now and will continue meeting for several months to conduct bilateral trade negotiations between themselves, the outcome of which will be generalised for all members. The question arises of our participation in these negotiations and that depends upon there being a willingness to conduct these negotiations with us on the terms stipulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Transport Act, 1958, empowers Córas Iompair Éireann to terminate any train service provided the Board is satisfied that its operation is uneconomic and that there is no prospect of its continued operation being economic within a reasonable period.  The Act also imposed on the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann the obligation to conduct the undertaking so as to eliminate losses within a five year period.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to meet a deputation regarding the proposed closure of the West Cork Railway system.  Any representations it is desired to have considered in this matter should be addressed to the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach further agree that a lot of public bodies in Cork have condemned the action of C.I.E., including members of the Taoiseach's Party on these bodies, and that they have requested the Taoiseach to receive a deputation to put forward their case against the closure of these railways?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach further agree that on the 8th May, 1958, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, during the passage of the Transport Bill of that year through this House, he gave an unqualified assurance to the House that deputations would be received from interested parties in areas where it was proposed to close railways? Is he now aware that not only has he himself refused to implement that definite assurance but that the Minister for Transport and Power has likewise refused to implement it and that members of the Board of C.I.E. have refused to implement it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the average retail price at (1) 1st March, 1957 and (2) the latest available date of (a) a loaf of bread, (b) a pound of butter, (c) a pound of tea, (d) a pound of sugar, (e) a hundredweight of coal, (f) a unit of electricity, (g) an ounce of tobacco, (h) twenty cigarettes, and (i) a stone of flour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information on retail prices available to the Central Statistics Office is that collected at the quarterly enquiries for the compilation of the Consumer Price Index.  The appropriate data for 1957 relate to 11th February, and the most recent particulars are those for 15th August, 1960.  I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to include in the Official Report, a statement giving the available national average retail prices, at these dates, for certain of the items requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The items included in the statement relate to those commodities for which it is reasonably certain that the specification of the items priced is uniform throughout the country.  In the case of cigarettes and tobacco, no attempt is made to price the same variety in different areas, though the variety priced is kept uniform at each reporting centre.  For this reason, meaningful national average prices cannot be given for these items.  In the case of electricity, since the average domestic price per unit to a consumer depends on the quantity consumed and on the nature of its use, the basic data for the price of electricity in the Consumer Price Index are derived from information supplied by the Electricity Supply Board.  For the year ended 31st March, 1957, the average price charged per unit of domestic supply of electricity was 2.34 pence.  For the year ended 31st <Col N="7" /> March, 1960, the corresponding figure was 2.40 pence per unit.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>NATIONAL average retail prices of certain commodities at mid-February, 1957 and mid-August, 1960.</P>

The latest information on the relevant retail prices, available to the Central Statistics Office, relates to 15th August, 1960, and the next corresponding inquiry will be made for 14th November, 1960.

      <P>The last date on which a permanent district medical officer was appointed to Arranmore dispensary district was the 1st April, 1957; this doctor resigned on the 31st January, 1958.</P>
      <P>Since 1953 the Local Appointments Commissioners have advertised the post on no fewer than six occasions but were only once successful in obtaining a doctor who would be prepared to accept the appointment to this remote district.  This officer relinquished the post after ten months.  The post was advertised in 1959, when double increments were offered on the normal salary scale for a district medical officer as an inducement to candidates but none was forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I have recently approved of a proposal by Donegal County Council to pay a special allowance of £300 per annum in addition to the normal salary scale for district medical officers in respect of the post on the island and the appointment has been referred to the Local Appointments Commissioners for filling on that basis.  I hope that this inducement will attract a doctor who will be prepared to live on Arranmore.  The Commissioners have been asked to proceed with the competition as soon as possible but I am not in a position to indicate, at this stage, when they will be in a position to recommend a candidate for appointment.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the word &ldquo;affiliated&rdquo; could have a variety of meanings.  The practice, which I believe is common, whereby students of any medical school receive credit for attendance at clinics in the hospital might be regarded as constituting &ldquo;affiliation&rdquo;.  If, however, the Deputy has in mind something which is much closer, the reply is that I have recently turned down a proposal from the hospital for an agreement with a particular medical school which would be inconsistent with the provisions of the St. Laurence's Hospital Act, 1943.</P>

      <P>Despite the fact that in recent years the number of places in the special residential schools and institutions for the mentally retarded has been increased by more than 150 per cent. to the present figure of 2,620, I am aware that the amount of accommodation for mentally handicapped children is still inadequate and that there is, therefore, delay in the admission of such children to suitable institutions.</P>
      <P>Work is now in progress on two schemes which will provide a further 200 beds and, apart from new building, the possibility of using premises, no longer required for their original hospitals purposes, is constantly under review.  These developments should help to relieve pressure as an interim measure, but, for the reasons set out in the White Paper published some little time ago, it is desirable that the whole problem should be examined comprehensively and, as announced, steps are in train to set up a Commission of Inquiry for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a similar question by him on 18th May last. As was then indicated, hearing aids are provided by health authorities under the Health Acts mainly for the use of children in institutions for the deaf and in other suitable cases where there is an assurance that the child will be under continuing supervision to ensure the attainment of full benefit from the use of the aid.</P>
      <P>I am unable to indicate when it may be possible to introduce a scheme applying generally to persons in the lower income group.  Qualified insured persons are, of course, entitled to receive financial assistance towards the cost of hearing aids under the Department of Social Welfare's scheme of treatment benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>

      <P>The holding of night dispensaries at the centres mentioned by the Deputy would be a <Col N="12" /> matter for the Dublin Health Authority in the first instance and I have received no proposal for the holding of such dispensary sessions from that body.</P>
      <P>Evening dispensary sessions were held in the North Crumlin Health Centre at Curlew Road from 1951 until the end of 1956.  They did not, however, prove a success and it was found that the numbers coming to them gradually dropped down to eight; it was also established that some of the patients attending in the evening could have attended the morning sessions.  In view of this, the Health Authority decided to discontinue the sessions as from the 31st December, 1956.</P>

I shall put it this way: is the Minister aware that a large number of people, who have blue cards but nevertheless are employed, do not go to the day clinic because they would lose half a day's work, and they do not go to the day clinic for medicines for the same reason&mdash;they would lose another half day's work?  If the Minister is requested by the health authorities to do so, will he consider those two points?  Has the Minister heard me?</P>

      <P>Normally in the case of the workers referred to in the Deputy's Question, unemployment benefit is paid by the employing firm subject to authorisation and recoupment by my Department.  In August last a question arose as to the entitlement of these workers to unemployment benefit for days in respect of which they were in receipt of holiday money from the firm and the determination of their cases therefore gave rise to detailed enquiries.</P>
      <P>Over 250 employees were involved and, owing to the closure of the firm for almost three weeks and the fact that the inquiries had to be made by post, over four weeks elapsed before the preliminary information sought was received in the Department. Having regard to these circumstances I am satisfied that the claims were disposed of with as little delay as possible and that no special steps are called for.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that, when he wrote to the Revenue Commissioners in June, there was difficulty in locating the case.  This difficulty was due in the main to the fact that the person who was interviewed was apparently under a wrong impression as to the name of the officer who saw him.  He called, however, at the Revenue Commissioners' Head Office at Dublin Castle around the time that the Deputy put down his Question and following discussion the correct name of the officer was discovered.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to profits arising to members of syndicates from sales of nominations. The provisions of the Income Tax Acts governing the taxation of such profits have not been altered since the enactment of Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1939.  Under that section the broad position is that, if a stallion is ordinarily kept on particular lands and serves mares on those lands, there is liability under Schedule D only where the person selling the nomination is not the occupier of the lands.</P>

      <P>The general position regarding local authority proposals was explained in my reply to a Parliamentary Question on 18th May last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then indicated that a large number of the specific proposals related to schemes such as roads, water supplies <Col N="18" /> and sanitary services which were of a social rather than an economic nature and would be considered by the Department of Local Government in the normal exercise of its functions.  As the Deputies will be aware, a decision to extend generally the scope of State grants and other financial facilities for water and sanitary schemes has been announced by the Minister for Local Government.  It is not considered necessary to keep a record of action in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Proposals in relation to tourism and the processing of fruit, vegetables and fish are being followed up.  In the case of tourism the issues raised are not confined to the local authority sphere and are being considered in the context of a general review by the official bodies concerned of possibilities of further development.  Various possibilities in relation to food processing are under active consideration; they lie mainly in the field of private and semi-State enterprise.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that hoteliers, traders and publicans in Tramore and other seaside resorts have suffered severe loss by reason of the repeal in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, of the provisions which permitted the district court to grant area exemptions orders for seaside resorts on Sundays during the holiday season; whether he has received representations in this regard; and whether amending legislation is contemplated in the near future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether complaints relating to Sunday opening hours and lack of special facilities for tourist resorts under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, have been brought to his notice; and whether the Government will introduce amending legislation (1) to rearrange Sunday opening hours in rural Ireland, and (2) to provide for area exemption orders at the discretion of the district courts.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will introduce legislation to amend the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, so as to extend the hours for facilities in obtaining intoxicating liquor in licensed premises on Sundays, and also to enable district justices to use their discretion in the <Col N="25" /> granting of area exemption orders on Sundays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>While I have received some representations for an extension of the licensing laws on Sundays in tourist resorts and in other places on the occasion of football matches and the like, I am far from satisfied that there is a public demand for additional facilities.  I have also received representations and information that the existing hours are adequate, and, indeed, I have received representations that they are excessive.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that publicans in holiday resorts have experienced any loss of trade on Sundays by reason of the changes made by the Liquor Act, 1960, in the hours during which drink may lawfully be sold.  Losses, if any, have been occasioned by the fact that there is now strict enforcement of the licensing laws and illicit trading is not now tolerated.</P>
      <P>So far as Sunday hours of opening in holiday resorts in the holiday season are concerned, the recent legislation gives effect to the unanimous recommendations of the Commission which my predecessor set up in 1956 to consider the operation of the licensing laws.  As I said, however, in the concluding debates on the Bill some months ago, I do not expect the Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1960 to be the last Act of the Oireachtas to deal with licensing hours: that Act has been in force, however, less than four months and if there is to be any question of its amendment, the Government will require to have evidence of a substantial kind as to the necessity-for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite apart from the publicans' interest in this matter, has the Minister not received representations from rural Ireland that the evening hours of opening on Sunday are not suitable and that, instead of the existing opening hours, it would be much more convenient for everybody <Col N="26" /> if the opening hours were from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., or something of that order?</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, surely the Minister must have received the strongest possible representations from small tourist resorts all around the south-west and west coast that the existing legislation is causing very serious, possibly irreparable, losses because of the diversion of the normal tourist traffic that used to come to these areas and the lack of adequate accommodation during the summer months?  Will the Minister take steps to make inquiries in these areas, if he has not so far heard anything himself, in order to inform himself of the kind of complaints which have reached, I believe, almost every Deputy in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is the Minister not aware that in Tramore public meetings, attended by all sections and every political group, addressed a protest to him because of the loss of trade caused by the introduction of the Liquor Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that the County Donegal Development Association, in conjunction with local Deputies, held a protest meeting in relation to the hours of closing on Sunday?  Would he take into account, and consider, the views expressed at that meeting not only by Opposition Deputies but by members of his own Party as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also aware that there is a very strong volume of opinion that the laws as passed less than 4 months ago should be adhered to.  I want the members of this House to take note of that fact.  I had a very difficult task here when I was defending the Sunday hours of 5 to 9 p.m. against representations being made to me by all the temperance organisations which represent hundreds of thousands of people in this country.  I have recently received representations from some of these temperance societies again asking me to ensure that there will be no yielding of further time for drinking on the Sabbath Day.  We must have some concern for the fact that the hours we <Col N="27" /> have at present from 12.30 to 2 p.m. and from 5 to 9 p.m. are sufficient to meet the needs of any reasonable individual who wants to consume a drink. We must give some period of time to have this matter tested.  I should be inclined to say that the period should be two years.  Some of my colleagues might favour a lesser period.  The least period we should have for the testing of this very important measure would in my opinion be twelve months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister has received representations from rural areas that the hours 5 to 9 p.m. do not suit?  I suggest 7 to 10 p.m. as having been represented to me to be very much more suitable hours and they would actually be less than the existing hours.  But, whether the Minister says 7 to 10.30 p.m. or 7 to 10 p.m., which are less than the existing hours, surely he realises that, however excellent his intentions, the hours 5 to 9 p.m. are not proving suitable for rural consumers?</P>

Deputy Ó Briain should know that, for people milking cows and doing other work on a Sunday evening, if they do not get into town for a drink before 9 p.m., they must do without it.  I suggest to the Minister that without directing any of these matters into a high degree of principle where there is no suggestion by anybody that the hours should further be extended we ought to try if possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that in rural Ireland, save on isolated occasions, Sunday is the only day of the week when men can meet, discuss matters of common interest and have a drink&mdash;and it is an ancient Irish custom and tradition? As indicated in the Question, there is a widespread demand in all parts of the country for an amendment of the Act in relation to Sunday trading hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refers to representations he has received from temperance organisations stating that the hours are adequate.  What do these gentlemen know about the drinking hours?  They neither partake of the facilities offered by the present hours nor did so during the hours which operated prior to this Act.  Surely representations from other organisations should get equal consideration from the Minister?  It is all very fine for these temperance organisations to tell other people what they should do.  If they confined themselves to their own sphere we should all be satisfied.</P>

      <P>I want to support Deputy Dillon.  The extension of the closing hour to 10 p.m. on Sunday would be more suitable.  We read in the newspapers recently that several gentlemen came out at 9 p.m. and, <Col N="29" /> having nowhere to go, bashed up a few dance hall attendants.  If the closing hour were 10 p.m. they would go home.  They had nowhere to go at 9 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is astonishing how quickly Deputies change their point of view.  I am not objecting to that.  We all have a right to change our point of view.  I leant heavily on Deputy Dillon during the course of the debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill because he stood solidly for uniformity and so did I.  However, he wanted the hours on Sunday to be reduced from 9 to 7 p.m. Had I accepted Deputy Dillon's amendment the hours now would not be from 5 to 9 p.m. but from 5 to 7 p.m. on Sunday.  Deputy O'Donnell put down an amendment to the Bill objecting to the abolition of area exemption orders but he did not move his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention whatever of amending the Act at this <Col N="30" /> stage nor is there any means by which exemptions in the form Deputy Wycherley has in mind could now be made.  The area exemption orders have been abolished.  The <i>bona fide</i> trade has been abolished.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> was this extension of hours to the whole of rural Ireland on Sundays. That was a very big advance.  The ecclesiastical societies, to which we must give some consideration, think we have gone very much too far.  The propaganda being used to have this Bill altered will be insignificant to what would take place if we attempted to interfere with the hours by extending them on the Sabbath Day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether in view of the widespread demand for increased trading hours on Sundays he will consider introducing legislation to amend the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, so as to grant additional hours of service on Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware, and I do not believe, that there is any foundation whatsoever for the suggestion that there is a widespread demand for increased trading hours on Sundays and my experience in promoting the recent Act leaves me in no doubt that there is a considerable body of opinion opposed to any such increase.</P>
      <P>In the reply to the preceding Questions (Nos. 32, 33 and 34) I dealt with the particular question of holiday resorts but, as far as the country generally is concerned, the information that I have received, both from trade interests and from others, goes to show that, while some areas might find different hours more suitable, there is no serious or representative demand for longer hours.  The Government's attitude to the question of introducing an amendment to the Act was stated in reply to the preceding Questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider an amendment on the lines I suggested in the previous Supplementary Questions?  I am afraid the Minister is not conversant with public opinion at the present time.  Let me reiterate that the demand is widespread <Col N="31" /> so far as Sunday is concerned.  The Minister would satisfy all interested sections if an amendment was made so far as Sunday trading is concerned.</P>

      <P>When I get representations of the kind which I have been receiving.  I have them investigated. I do not take them lightly or just put them away.  I have exhaustive enquiries made as a result of some of these representations throughout the country and through some of the vintners' organisations.  I was assured by these organisations that the hours are entirely suitable to the majority of licensed vintners but they admit that in a particular resort, such as seaside resorts, the hours may not be suitable.  Again, we have got to remember that we cannot in any circumstances have general agreement on hours.  This Bill was before the House for a period of almost nine months and every possible phase of opinion was heard and voiced.  The most suitable hours that we appeared to have been able to agree upon were the hours put forward by the Commission and accepted by the Government.</P>

Under the National Percentage Order made annually, millers are required to mill a stated percentage of their milling quotas in the form of native wheat. The current Order fixes the percentage at 75, but as there is some uncertainty about the quality of the wheat of this year's harvest this percentage is open to amendment.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been keeping this matter under review.  I appreciate that racehorse owners and trainers require good quality oats, but I believe that, normally, sufficient home grown oats of the right quality can be obtained, especially if suitable arrangements are made in advance by those who require a supply throughout the year.  For these reasons, it has been the policy for many years past to permit imports of feeding oats only when the home crop has been seriously deficient in yield and quality.  While the general quality of oats of this year's harvest may be below average, I am not at this stage quite convinced that the position is such that the bloodstock owners cannot obtain a fairly substanial proportion of their requirements from home sources.  In the circumstances, and having regard to the various problems associated with this year's harvest, I have not so far been able to agree to the import of feeding oats, but I shall continue to watch the situation carefully and with due regard to the needs of the bloodstock industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchase of turkeys during the Christmas season is very largely for export to Britain, and the prices paid to turkey producers here are, therefore, primarily influenced by the way in which the market develops in Britain. Official poultry statistics indicate that, as compared with last year, there has been an appreciable increase in turkey <Col N="36" /> production in Britain but that there has been a decrease in turkey production here.  In the absence of a reliable indication of the probable level of demand, however, it is not possible to forecast the likely course of prices.</P>

In so doing, the Board complied fully with the requirements of Section 18 of the Transport Act, 1958.  It is a matter for the Board to decide the means by which they should give effect to the statutory requirements and I have no reason to believe that they failed to consider any material factor or any prospect of additional traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions No. 54 and No. 55 together.  There is no statutory authority vested in me or in the Government by which direct control can be exercised over cross-Channel or any other shipping rates; it is in the nature of the trade that effective control of the rates cannot be unilaterally exercised by the Government here.</P>
      <P>The Tribunal of Inquiry into cross-Channel Freight Rates which reported in May, 1959, concluded that from the standpoint of trading results in preceding years the cross-Channel shipping companies were not making excessive profits.  I am aware that since then there have been increases in operating costs arising out of increases in wages and salaries and other expenditures on both sides of the Irish Sea.  This has been reflected in the recent recommendation by the Road Haulage Association in Great Britain to increase road freight rates by 10 per cent. Without detailed information as to the current receipts and expenditures of the shipping companies it is not possible to form any considered conclusion as to whether the further increases in freights can be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tribunal of Inquiry suggested that a Voluntary Committee representative of shippers as a whole should be formed under official auspices to consider problems of cross-Channel transport, particularly in connection with freight rates, to co-ordinate information on these problems and to discuss them with the Conference or with individual undertakings.  In pursuance of this recommendation the National Shippers Committee was established in May, 1960, with a widely representative membership.  The Federation of Irish Industries provide the secretariat, and <Col N="45" /> I understand that the Committee is actively pursuing the objectives suggested by the Tribunal.  The Committee in particular are in communication with the Irish and British Traffic Conference about the proposed freight increases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it mean in effect that both the Commission and this new Committee are completely ineffective and that until we gain some participation in cross-Channel services, we can do nothing about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Shippers Committee have not been a very long time in operation.  They have had to work out the nature of their own day-to-day investigations in regard to the freight rate position.  I am quite certain they will be able to give effective help to a number of industrial and other concerns seeking ways and means of getting more economical forms of transport through the methods by which they send their goods.  At the same time, the Committee will make representations to my Department if they feel there are obvious inconsistencies in regard to increases in rates.</P>
      <P>So far as participation is concerned, that matter is still under active consideration.  As I made clear in the House, when I spoke on the occasion of the Private Motion moved by the Deputy, the matter is of a very complex character, and it is very difficult to arrive at any firm conclusion in any direction.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall that the Taoiseach, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, stated in October, 1957, that discussions were going on with a view to <Col N="46" /> some form of participation in cross-Channel shipping services?  Has nothing been done in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that since that period there has been a very radical change in the character of traffic across the Irish Sea.  The container ban has been in operation, but it had been hoped by everybody concerned that the ban would have been lifted by now.  If it had been, there would again be a very definite change in the pattern of transport. A number of changes have taken place, all of which would require to be studied.  At the same time the Deputy will be aware that an independent container service has been started and that there has been a gradual change in the pattern of traffic.  Container services are being operated in increasing measure from Waterford and Rosslare.  Because of the changing character of the traffic, it is taking a considerable time to arrive at a point where decisions can be made.  However, I think I can tell the Deputy that there will not be avoidable delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 85 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>I am of opinion that accidents arising at night out of collisions with parked vehicles are due more to failure to observe the existing law than to defects in the law itself.  The law at present requires that every motor vehicle, except a motor cycle, which is on a road at night must, whether moving or stationary, be equipped with two white front lights and one red rear light.  All the lights must be duly lit and in such efficient condition that they are visible from a reasonable distance.  Furthermore, it is an offence to leave a vehicle stationary on any road at any point less than 100 ft. from a curve or gradient which might have the effect of concealing the vehicle from other road users, or to park it otherwise than on the left hand side of the road during lighting-up hours. The enforcement of these provisions is a matter for the Garda Síochána, and in this connection I understand that the Commissioner has recently circularised all Garda stations as to the need for stringent enforcement of the lighting regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to impress on the public how serious it is to leave a vehicle on a road at night where it may cause an accident, it is proposed to create <Col N="65" /> in the Road Traffic Bill a further offence of parking unlit at night-time in such a way as to cause danger to the public and to provide a stiff penalty for such an offence.</P>
    <P>While, as I have said, the existing lighting regulations, if observed, would reduce considerably accidents of the type mentioned by the Deputies, I am satisfied that the present regulations need to be reviewed in the light of developments in traffic and vehicle construction.  This review is in hands in my Department as part of a general review of vehicle regulations.  Account is being taken of the studies at present conducted by a number of international organisations on the problems involved.  My hope is that, shortly after the Road Traffic Bill becomes law, the new regulations will be ready.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, and for the information of the House, I understand that the drafting of this new Bill is well advanced and it is hoped it will be possible to have it ready for circulation before we adjourn at Christmas, or at latest, during the Christmas Recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the ever-growing number of fatal accidents which are caused by parked vehicles, would the Minister not think it desirable, pending new legislation, to get in touch with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, and see if steps can be taken, with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, or whoever is responsible for the administration of the law, to ensure that severe jail sentences will be imposed for such offences?  It is a very serious matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that it is a most serious matter and I think it a scandal that roads which are used for getting to and from given points should be used otherwise, as is the case in these instances.  In so far as getting stiff sentences imposed, that is <Col N="66" /> not something which is at the discretion of the Garda, and indeed it may not be within the discretion of the courts under the law in such cases.  As I said in my reply in regard to the particular item complained of here, the Commissioner of the Garda has been in touch with every Garda station, drawing attention to this matter and asking them stringently to enforce the law.</P>

      <P>In the new Road Traffic Bill, would the Minister consider ensuring that rear lights should be provided for motor cyclists in addition to rear lights and reflectors for any other vehicle which may be used on the road?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of these breakdowns in large lorries are due to trouble with the battery.  Usually it is not possible to keep a light on the vehicle during the night or until the necessary mechanical assistance can be provided to get the vehicle going again.  In addition, some of the rear lights are fairly high up on these vehicles and if one is driving against traffic, with dimmed lights, one cannot pick up the rear reflector on the vehicles.  Would the Minister see if he has power to require these people at least to use luminous paint low down on the vehicle not as a defence for parking without lights but in order to give other people driving cars a chance to escape death?  Until such time as we tighten up the law, something should be done as an interim measure.  Anybody travelling the main road south, as I frequently do at night time, will admit that it is quite a hazard with lorries parked on the roadside with no lights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is not suggesting that all these vehicles are so parked because they have broken down?  Nine out of 10 offenders park indiscriminately, with no regard <Col N="67" /> whatever for the other users of the road.  The question of a break-down does not arise in more than a few cases and surely it is in the interest of the owner to take precautions to keep within the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, with your permission to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>A special overseas allowance of 7/6d. a day is payable, with effect from the date of their departure, to the Irish troops serving with the United Nations Force in the Republic of the Congo.  They are also currently being paid an allowance of approximately 9/- a day directly by the United Nations Authorities.  Thus the total allowance for service in the Congo is 16/6d. a day or £5 15s. 6d. per week.  In addition the troops are, of course, entitled to their normal service pay and allowances.</P>
      <P>There is no justification for statements that there is widespread discontent among the troops over the amount of the allowance, but the question of its adequacy is being kept constantly under review.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to make an authoritative statement on the allowances being paid by other Governments to their troops in the Congo. Such information as I have indicates that these allowances vary very considerably and that some are greater and some are less than the allowance we pay.</P>
      <P>As regards the conditions generally under which our troops are serving in the Congo, I would like to make it clear that this is the province of the United Nations.  At the same time, my Department, with the co-operation of other Departments in a position to help, such as An Roinn Poist agus Telegrafa, has done all in its power to make conditions as comfortable as possible.  Our two battalions on their departure were extremely well equipped not only with the requisite military equipment but also with welfare supplies of considerable variety and quantity.  There is some reason to think that ours was amongst the best equipped of the national contingents, if not indeed the best equipped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the despatch of the contingent everything humanly possible has been <Col N="69" /> done by my Department to maintain morale at a high level and to supplement whenever possible the efforts of the United Nations towards their welfare. I am sure Deputies will appreciate the magnitude of the task which confronted the United Nations in arranging for the care of some 20,000 troops of many nationalities which had to be hurriedly transported and deployed in the Congo amid conditions of great political, military and racial confusion in that country. I am glad to be able to say that welfare conditions are continually improving.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can assure Deputies that our troops have suffered no real privations and while they are working under tension and in difficult conditions their morale is extremely high.  The health of the troops is excellent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether he has received recent representations from officers and men serving in the Congo as to the inadequacy of the allowance of 16/6d. per day? Would it not be true to say that the Irish forces are the worst paid forces serving there at the moment?</P>

The matter is constantly under review and, as Deputies know, the original overseas allowance, which was fixed in advance of the troops going out and without knowing the conditions that obtained there, was 4/- a day.

One hundred and seventy-two completed application forms were received in the case of an tArm and four in the case of an tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh within the prescribed time limit.  The results of the competitions are not yet available.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the Question, the rates of pay and conditions of service of Na Buan Óglaigh are reviewed from time to time but it will be appreciated that the numbers of youths seeking to embark on an army or naval career are affected by various factors apart from those mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> The pay of officers of Óglaigh na hÉireann has been adjusted from time to time to meet increases in the cost of living, and in this respect the same rules have been applied to them as were applied to civil servants.  I may mention that proposals for increases in Army pay are under consideration at present but no indication can be given at this stage as to what the outcome may be.</P>

      <P>The purchase of a site for a vocational school at Charlestown has been authorised, but sanction for the actual building of the school has been deferred because of the fact that a wide range of post-primary educational facilities is already within reach of the areas which would be served by the proposed school, and also because the requirements of Charlestown as a vocational school centre can be accurately assessed only when the committee's building programme for other areas of east Mayo has been completed.</P>

      <P>I had cause to have this matter fully examined recently and I am not satisfied that the extent to which objects of art are being exported from this country is such as to call for legislation of the type which appears to be envisaged by the Deputy. Apart from this I feel that such legislation could merely result in any person who wanted to export an object of art quoting a price for it to one of our science and art institutions which would be out of all keeping with its real value.  In such circumstances, the institution concerned would be held to ransom in relation to either paying an exorbitant price or allowing the object to be exported.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he has seen reports of a school strike at Milverton national school, Skerries; if so, if he will make a statement in connection with the condition of the school buildings, indicating the date on which this school was erected, the number of pupils attending the school, the nature of the sanitary arrangements, and whether plans for improvements are under consideration; and if he will give details of the proposed improvements, including the estimated cost, and the likely date on which the improvement works are expected to commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been seen the Press reports about the withdrawal of pupils from Milvertaon national school, Skerries, Co. Dublin.  This school, which was erected about 58 years ago, has two classrooms accommodating 64 pupils.  The average attendance is 55. The premises are structurally sound but one of the classrooms is too small. The sanitary accommodation consists of dry closets and is unsatisfactory.  A plan has been prepared for the extension of the schoolhouse and site and for the carrying out of general works of improvement including the provision of water flushed sanitation, cloakrooms, new widows, floors and ceilings, concrete paths, playspaces and playshelters.</P>
      <P>My Departments has sanctioned a grant towards the cost of the proposed scheme.  The estimated cost of the scheme is £3,670.</P>

Since the Deputy asked the Question in the context of a strike, I should like to point out that there is a very large school building programme in hands.  The best results will be achieved by an orderly working out of that programme. Strikes are, for the most part, an attempt to jump the queue and result only in the holding up of the main programme.</P>

    <Title>National Loan, 1960. - Statement by Minister for Finance.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that a new National Loan to be known as Exchequer Stock will open for subscription on Monday next, 31st October. The Loan will be for £15 million but £3 million of the stock is being allotted to certain life assurance offices and Departmental funds so that the amount available for public subscription will the £12 million which will be underwritten jointly by the Banks and the Government.  The rate of interest will be 6 per cent. per annum and the price £99 for each £100 of stock purchased.  The Stock will be redeemed at par not later than 1985 and may be redeemed at any time from December, 1980.  As the issue is being made at a discount, there will be a capital gain of £1 per cent. on redemption and this will be tax-free to the ordinary investor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usual provision is made in the Prospectus whereby only 10 per cent. of the purchase price need be paid on application, the remainder being paid in three further instalments spread over the period until early January. This should facilitate investors in taking up stock.  On the other hand, those who wish to pay the full amount on application next week, or to complete their subscription on allotment later in November, will be entitled to discount equivalent to an interest rate <Col N="108" /> of 6 per cent. on the advance payments.</P>
    <P>The tax privileges attached to recent National Loans are again included.  Interest will be paid without deduction of income tax at source, but, of course, will be assessable to tax in the hands of recipients ordinarily resident in the State.  Stock of the issue will be accepted at its nominal value as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of death duties on properties of which it formed a part.  The stock and the interest on it will be exempt from all Irish taxation, present and future, if owned by a person neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>The issue is being made under the authority of the Appropriation Act, 1960, and other statutes.  Both principal and interest will be a charge on the Central Fund.  The attractive interest rate it carries, its status as a trustee security, the concession whereby it will be accepted in payment of death duties and the substantial sinking fund allocations should ensure that the stock will always have a high market value. The Government stockbroker will at all times be prepared to buy and sell reasonable amounts of the stock, and this will help to maintain an active market in it.</P>
    <P>The 5½ per cent.  National Loan, 1966, which was issued in October, 1956, carried a right of conversion into any public issue made by the Government within five years.  I am giving effect to this right in the present issue.  Stock of the new loan issued under this conversion arrangement will be additional to the £15 million of stock offered for cash subscription.</P>
    <P>The Loan is required to finance State capital outlay on agriculture and industry; on housing, sanitary services and schools; on afforestation and fuel resources; and on other development schemes in pursuance of the Programme for Economic Expansion outlined in the Government White Paper published in November, 1958</P>
    <P>As Deputies are well aware, it is <Col N="109" /> primarily to our own people we must look to provide the funds needed for national development.  It is only by applying the maximum amount of resources to productive purposes at home that we can increase employment and raise living standards.  I should like, therefore, to stress once again the continuing need for a large volume of savings.  The amount saved in 1959 showed a gratifying increase on the previous year but it is necessary to maintain the improvement if we are to continue, without setback, the development of our economy.  The new loan gives an excellent opportunity for the investment of savings and subscribers to it will be doing their part to promote national development while at the same time securing for themselves a safe investment and a very attractive return on their capital.</P>
    <P>The Prospectus of the issue, with the application form for cash subscriptions attached, will be available tomorrow from any bank, stockbroker or Post Office.  The lists will close not later than Friday, 4th November.</P>
    <P>I confidently ask for the full and active support of every Deputy in the House for the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of a national loan is a national and not a Party matter and accordingly, without any reservation whatever, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I support the appeal made by the Minister for Finance.  The terms on which he has announced the issuing of this loan are generous terms for the investor.  It is, I think, the highest rate of interest ever offered for a national loan at a capital discount price.  It is being offered at a time when there is a suggestion in certain quarters that the English bank rate may, perhaps, go down a little.  Everything, therefore, points to the issue of six per cent. stock at £99 per £100 as being one most generous to the investor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope sincerely that the Minister will be able to announce not merely that the Loan has been filled but that it has been over-subscribed.  No matter what Government may be in <Col N="110" /> office, it is essential, if we are to progress, that we should have as high a rate of productive investment as our people are prepared to support.  I was glad to hear the Minister state that the proceeds of this Loan will be used for productive investment as well as for some social investment, such as housing, etc.  It is only by investment that we can go forward.  For that reason, we, on these benches, wish the Minister well in this new Loan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I should like to join with the Minister in inviting the public here, and our kith and kin overseas, to take up shares in this new Loan.  In an under-developed country, such as ours unfortunately is, capital is essential for our continued development. In the world in which we live the only alternative to continued development and expansion is a corroding stagnation.  New capital is, therefore, essential to promote national wellbeing and finance schemes of development and expansion in many fields.  It is only through expansion and development that we shall achieve the standard of living to which the nation as a whole aspires.</P>
      <P>Capital represents savings and moneys which in the course of business activity must be invested for one reason or another.  One looks at the terms offered and one finds that the rate of interest, the rate of discount, and the period of repayment afford substantial attractions.  I, therefore, commend the Loan to all those who find it necessary to invest money as part of their business activity and to all those who, having money to invest, would like to invest it at an attractive rate of interest.  The terms are good. Large investors, such as the insurance companies, and others in that category, will, I hope, subscribe generously and benefit by the correspondingly larger interest.  I trust also that all kinds of organisations, and even individual citizens, will recognise in the Loan an attractive offer, which may well be the last on these terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to financial wiseacres in the financial columns, there are indications that the bank rate may fall in the near future.  If that is so, this Loan <Col N="111" /> will immediately appreciate in value, apart altogether from the fact that it is now being offered under par.  I have no doubt that our people, in their ingenuity, will focus their attention on that possibility.  The rates are attractive. There is no other satisfactory method of financing development except by the savings of our people. There are no financial shortcuts and no financial manoeuvres which will get us within sight of the goals at which we aim and we must, therefore, rely on the savings of our people.  It must be accepted that future development depends on the thrift and character of our people.  For that reason, I associate the Labour Party in endorsing this Loan and recommending it to the people.</P>

It is a decision of the Dáil.  I accept that the original intention with regard to the provision <Col N="113" /> of time for Private Members' Business is not fully effective.

      <P>I do not want to move a motion in the House this evening, as may be necessary, if this is not resolved.  Under Standing Order 21, we read that a Private Member is entitled on Wednesday to move that the House sit until 2 a.m., 4 a.m., or 6 a.m.  I am concerned to see that all the motions on the Order Paper are heard.  I do not want to have to take the decision every Wednesday to move that the Dáil sit until 12 p.m. If agreement is reached before next Wednesday that sufficient time will be made available for one motion per week, I feel sure that will meet the <Col N="114" /> requirements of Deputies who have put down motions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to rectify the existing unsatisfactory position in relation to the exercise by the Veterinary Council of Ireland of its disciplinary powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> The existing provisions relating to the council's disciplinary powers are contained in the Veterinary Surgeons Acts, 1931 and 1952.  Section 34 of the Act of 1931 provides that the council may erase from the Register of Veterinary Surgeons persons convicted of crimes.  Section 36 of the same Act provides that the council may, where it finds after due inquiry or investigation that a person has been guilty of professional misconduct, erase the name of such person from the register. Section 7 of the Act of 1952 provides for suspension of registration on account of professional misconduct.</P>
    <P>The validity of these provisions has, since the Supreme Court's ruling on the Solicitors Act, 1954, been open to doubt and as a consequence the Veterinary Council has found itself obliged to refrain from exercising in any case these powers of erasure or suspension of registration.  The council has expressed to me its deep concern at the present unsatisfactory position and its anxiety to have the position rectified in the interest of the veterinary profession.  The Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons is equally anxious that this should be done so that the reciprocal arrangements in the matter of disciplinary proceedings, as provided for under the veterinary agreement with the British Government, should again effectively apply.</P>
    <P>The present Bill embodies the proposals for dealing with the situation. These proposals involve the modification of Sections 34 and 36 of the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1931, and of Section 7 of the Act of 1952 to provide that erasures, or suspensions of registration, on account of conviction for crimes or of professional misconduct could be effected by the council only on direction of the High Court.  The council would as heretofore be enabled, after due inquiry, investigation, or consideration of the case as may be required, to decide that appropriate disciplinary action (that is, erasure or suspension of registration) should be taken.  It would be open to the person concerned to apply within 14 days to the High Court for cancellation <Col N="119" /> of the council's decision and the High Court, on hearing the application, would either cancel the decision, or confirm the decision and direct the council to take the appropriate disciplinary action, that is, erasure or suspensions of registration.  Where the person concerned did not within 14 days apply accordingly to the High Court, or where he delayed unduly in proceeding with an application, the council would be enabled to apply to the High Court for confirmation of the decision and the High Court would, unless it saw good reason to the contrary, confirm the decision and direct the council to take the appropriate disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the purposes and general provisions of the Bill.  Its construction is simple: it substitutes for Sections 34 and 36 of the Act of 1931 two new sections providing for the proposed procedure I have already explained.  The new Section 36 deals both with erasures and suspensions of registrations on account of professional misconduct; section 7 of the Act of 1952 containing the existing provisions relating to suspensions is being repealed.  The other repeals provided for are also consequential ones.</P>
    <P>The Veterinary Council of Ireland has, of course, been fully consulted. The council welcomes the Bill and has expressed complete agreement with its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in favour of a Bill to give the veterinary surgeons' professional authority adequate power to maintain the standard of ethics appropriate to the profession.  Therefore, we are in full sympathy with the purpose of this Bill, but I should like to have a reassurance from the Minister for Agriculture that the terms of this Bill do not conflict with the Constitution. I fully appreciate that all the Minister can say to me in that context is that the matter has been referred to the law officers of the Government and they have so certified to him.  I should be glad to have that reassurance with special reference <Col N="120" /> to the provisions of the First Schedule of the Bill, Part I, subsection (5), which declares that the decision of the High Court on an application under this section shall be final.</P>
      <P>When considering that proviso, one must look back to the conditions under which a person's name can be erased from the register.  It states:</P>
      <P>Where a person registered in the register is convicted in the State of treason or of a felony or a misdemeanour or is convicted outside the State of a crime or offence which would be a felony or a misdemeanour if committed in the State, the Council may decide that the name of such person should be erased from the register.</P>
      <P>A veterinary surgeon may appeal to the High Court to have that decision cancelled and his name restored to the register.  I do not understand how this Oireachtas can, under the Constitution, declare that the decision of the High Court on an application under this section shall be final.  I do not profess to be a lawyer or a constitutional authority, but I understand that there is a precedent for the proposition that on a matter of undiluted fact, you can prescribe the High Court shall be the final authority but that where there is a question of mixed fact and law or a question of law involved, every citizen in the State has the constitutional right to appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court to have that question definitively determined.</P>
      <P>We have run into difficulties exactly similar to those which I now envisage in regard to the first Solicitors Act passed by this House.  Under the old procedure of maintaining the disciplinary regulations of the Solicitors' profession, disciplinary matters were the province of the Chief Justice. Under the new Act we sought to refer these matters to the President of the High Court.  As I understand it, in the new Solicitors Bill which we shall be considering immediately after this Bill, there is a provision that the decisions of the High Court on an application under this section shall be final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> I think there is good reason to believe that if that is submitted to the Supreme Court for determination as to whether it is in conformity with the Constitution, the Supreme Court will decide that it is not.  I cannot myself see, although I am quite prepared to hear argument to the contrary, what is the purpose of subsection (5).  Why can we not leave it open to an aggrieved party, who believes that there is some question of law to be resolved in connection with his case, to go to the Supreme Court if he wants to go?  The power under this will rarely be used.  There is no question of a vast volume of vexatious litigation taking place.  Why, then, are we concerned to insert subsection (5) at all?</P>
    <P>I can imagine a case arising, where a person is alleged to have been convicted of treason or a felony or a misdemeanour, of that person who is to be struck off the roll of veterinary surgeons imagining himself to have the right to argue that what he was found guilty of doing did not come within the statutory definition of treason, felony, or misdemeanour and that, therefore, the act of striking him off the roll was wrong.  If the High Court disagreed with him, he would feel he had a good case involving fact and law or involving only pure law upon which he should have the right to go to the Supreme Court.  I am at a loss to know why he should not be left that right to exercise, more especially in that if we seek to take it from him, it is not at all impossible that the whole of the statute would be declared unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Subject to that qualification, we have no objection to the Bill but.  I think the Minister would be well advised&mdash;if he is advised by the law officers&mdash;to stand on the terms of the Bill as submitted.  Then, if the Bill passes into law, I think he would be well advised to take the appropriate steps to have it referred to the Supreme Court for a specific decision in regard to the matter I now raise.  If that is done and it subsequently transpires that inadvertently we have transgressed the Constitution, the matter can be <Col N="122" /> put to rights.  If, on the other hand, we do not take that precaution, at some later date when the Council of the Veterinary Profession seeks to enforce an order against a defaulting veterinary surgeon, and the first time the veterinary surgeon goes to the Supreme Court, the whole Act is declared unconstitutional, we shall find ourselves in a very awkward position. Also, bearing in mind that we have close reciprocal arrangements with the Veterinary Council in Great Britain, we might be involved in not a little embarrassment because it should be borne in mind that in Great Britain there is no written Constitution and their professional authorities do not readily understand an Act of Parliament being declared null and void for transgressing the Constitution as such a thing is not possible there.  Subject to these remarks, we do not propose to oppose this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>However knowledgeable the law officers may be, they can be subject to error but, having regard to the way in which the need for amendment of the law arose in this case, they would not require any warning from any person as to the desirability of being tremendously careful that they did not again provide something that might result in the same sort of situation as arose and made it necessary for me to come in here with these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can express a personal opinion as to the advisability of not only providing for an appeal to the High Court against a recommendation of the council but also of allowing it to go still further to the Supreme Court, but, after all, the procedure that will be followed is this: the council in some way or other will be made aware of a transgression by a member of the profession. They will then proceed to examine all the evidence on which they are able to lay their hands and, having examined that evidence closely, they will arrive at a decision.  I suppose it is not really a decision, in the sense that it is subject to appeal, but anyhow, they then notify their conclusions to the person whose case they have been investigating, and within 14 <Col N="123" /> days, that individual has the right of appeal to the High Court.  One may take it that if he exercises that right he will naturally supply all the evidence he can in order to establish that the decision or recommendation made by the council is not based upon fact.</P>
    <P>In such a case as that, the council of the man's profession may recommend that his name should be erased from its rolls, that he should be suspended, but surely a body like that could not be regarded as a body that would act with haste or hostility to him and, even after that, he has the right of appeal to the High Court.  I am not competent to express an opinion as to whether that conforms with the Constitution, but to me it looks fair and reasonable, and I am sure the Attorney-General and the law officers have met the challenge which this gave them to provide an instrument that would fill the gap and enable the council to deal with the members of its profession and, at the same time, provide the necessary coverage, so far as constitutional requirements are concerned.  That was the net point they had to meet, not only in this Bill but in the Bill that is to follow, and, as I say, I have the assurance that this Bill makes that provision.  That is as far as I can go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill is in substitution for the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1958, which was withdrawn in February last.  As Deputies will note, the present Bill is a much more comprehensive one.  Like the 1958 Bill, it proposes to provide for striking the name of a solicitor off the roll or suspending him from practice or censuring him in any case where he has been found guilty of misconduct. <Col N="124" /> In addition, the present Bill proposes to place the Compensation Fund, which was established under the Solicitors Act, 1954, on a sound financial footing.  Finally, it contains certain important miscellaneous provisions in regard to solicitors.  I shall now deal in some detail with the proposals in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill is designed to cover the situation which has arisen consequent on the Supreme Court decision in March, 1958, that the powers purported to have been conferred on the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society by Part III of the 1954 Act are unconstitutional. That Act attempted, unsuccessfully as it transpired, to vest in the Law Society disciplinary control over solicitors and was designed to grant the profession self-government.  In so far as this self-government meant that the profession could expel those members whose conduct, or rather misconduct, made them no longer fit to practise as solicitors, it has been held to be unconstitutional because it involved the exercise of a judicial power which the Constitution reserves to the judiciary.  The 1958 Bill and Part II of the present Bill were prepared in an effort to meet this situation and to do something about the consequent unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>
      <P>Before I go on to speak of the provisions contained in Part II, I think I ought to stress that misconduct by solicitors is confined to a very small number in a profession that has maintained over the years the very highest standards of service to the public and of honesty in the conduct of its members.  Unfortunately, the activities of a few can do untold harm to the reputation of a profession as a whole, and this is true not alone of the solicitors' profession but of other professions as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main problems that arises in connection with solicitors is that, in the nature of their calling, they have from time to time in their hands moneys belonging to their clients.  It is this fact that leads to trouble and causes innocent people to lose their money either through <Col N="125" /> deliberate dishonesty or through dishonesty which begins as carelessness or negligence and ends as fraud. Circumstances very often become such that a solicitor who originally had no dishonest purpose lands himself in a mire out of which he cannot extricate himself.  I shall return to this aspect later.</P>
    <P>I mention the dishonesty case at this juncture in order to make the point that it is the exception in an upright and high-minded profession. Indeed, the amount of money lost to clients through the misconduct of the few is a very small percentage of the total passing through the hands of solicitors.  Nevertheless, the public and the profession must be protected against the dishonest solicitor.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides for the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society.  This Committee will replace that set up under the 1954 Act.  That Act purported to give to the Disciplinary Committee power to strike off the roll or suspend from practice, with a right of appeal to the Chief Justice.  The Supreme Court, in the decision to which I have referred earlier, held that this right of appeal was not sufficient to bring a procedure, otherwise unconstitutional, within the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Section 7 will confer on the new Committee powers of inquiry into the conduct of a solicitor on the ground of alleged misconduct.  An application for an inquiry may be made by any person or by the Law Society.  If the Disciplinary Committee are satisfied that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for an inquiry, they must proceed to hold one and embody their finding in the form of a report to the High Court.  If misconduct is found, the Society are to bring the report before the High Court.  The report of the Committee will contain their opinion as to the fitness or otherwise of the solicitor to be a member of the profession.</P>
    <P>Certain objection was taken to this proposal when the 1958 Bill was being debated in the House and the matter was reconsidered in consultation with the Society.  We are satisfied that the Committee should be <Col N="126" /> allowed to express an opinion in any report they make.  The members of the Committee will be outstanding members of the profession willing to undertake what is an onerous and responsible duty.  Allowing leading members of a profession to say whether or not they think a person is fit to be a member of that profession is nothing new.</P>
    <P>For instance, under Section 29 (4) of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1927, it was provided that, on the hearing of an appeal to the High Court by a person whose name is erased from the Medical Register for infamous conduct in a professional respect, the Court (I am quoting from the subsection) &ldquo;may, if it thinks proper so to do, admit and have regard to evidence of persons of standing in the medical profession as to the nature of conduct which is infamous in a professional respect.&rdquo;  There is a similar provision in regard to veterinary surgeons in Section 39 (3) of the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1931.  Under the present Bill, there is no obligation on the High Court to accept the opinion of the Disciplinary Committee.</P>
    <P>The proceedings before the High Court are dealt with in Section 8.  The Court, having considered the report of the Disciplinary Committee, may strike the name of the solicitor off the roll, suspend him from practice, censure him or censure him and require him to pay a money penalty.  The High Court may also direct the solicitor to make restitution or may freeze his bank account.  On special grounds, the Court may send the case back to the Disciplinary Committee to take further evidence for submission to it and to make a supplementary report.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the removal at his own request of the name of a solicitor from the roll and Section 10 for the restoration of the name of a solicitor to the roll.  The Disciplinary Committee may, if they think fit, remove a solicitor's name from the roll at his own request.  Otherwise, the matter must be referred to the High Court.  Restoration to the roll will be exclusively a matter for the High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> Section 11 will cover cases where the former Disciplinary Committee have purported to strike the name of a solicitor off the roll under the unconstitutional provisions of the 1954 Act. In these cases the Society may apply by notice of motion to the High Court to have the solicitors concerned properly struck off and the section provides for the procedure to be followed.</P>
    <P>Under Section 12 the orders of the High Court are to be final and not appealable, but an appeal will lie to the Supreme Court on a specified question of law.  We have considered this matter carefully in consultation with the Law Society and we are satisfied that the provision is a fair and reasonable one.  The High Court will be deciding on matters of fact in most cases, but if a question of law is involved the rights of the solicitor are being adequately protected by allowing an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The disciplinary jurisdiction vested in the High Court will, by reason of Section 13, be exercised by the President of the High Court or by an ordinary judge of the High Court to be nominated by the President.  In line with this policy is the proposal in Section 25 to transfer from the Chief Justice to the President of the High Court certain more or less administrative functions now performed by the Chief Justice under the 1954 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill will clothe with absolute privilege disciplinary proceedings under the 1954 Act and under the proposed Act.  The section will give statutory form to what is the existing law as interpreted by judicial decision.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections in Part II of the Bill do not call for any detailed comment from me on this Stage. They are consequential and re-enact, with appropriate amendments, certain sections of the 1954 Act that are being repealed.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill will set out in a more convenient way the provisions of the 1954 Act concerning the power of the Law Society to deal with the documents of certain solicitors and also the provisions concerning <Col N="128" /> the control of banking accounts of solicitors.  In addition, it is proposed in Sections 21 and 22 to make, as the draftsmen say, further and better provision for the Compensation Fund.  This Fund, which will be continued in existence, was set up under the 1954 Act to compensate clients who suffer losses due to the dishonesty of solicitors.  As respects losses occurring in the first five years, the making of grants and the amounts thereof were in the absolute discretion of the Society.  In respect of losses occurring after the 6th of January last, compensation must in general be in full.  The annual contribution payable at present by each solicitor is five pounds, but solicitors in their first three years of practice pay half that amount.  For the 1961 practice year or any practice year thereafter, the contribution may be increased from five pounds up to a maximum of ten pounds.</P>
    <P>The idea in 1954 was that after five years the Fund would be able to compensate clients in full and that provision for an additional contribution of up to five pounds would be sufficient to keep the Fund solvent. This hope has not been fulfilled and the Fund is now unable to meet its liabilities.  The losses have been much higher than was anticipated and no payments have been made to claimants for some time.  I have had a number of discussions with representatives of the Council of the Society on this matter; and the scheme as proposed in Sections 21 and 22 was finally agreed on between us and subsequently approved by the Government.  The contribution is being raised to twenty pounds and will remain at that figure until a reserve of £25,000 has been built up to meet exceptional claims.  Thereafter, the contribution will be fixed by the Society at an amount sufficient to maintain the reserve at £25,000 and at the same time to satisfy claims as they arise.</P>
    <P>The existing liabilities of the Fund under the 1954 Act will be paid off as soon as possible.  Experience since 1954 leads us to expect that the necessary reserve will have been built up in <Col N="129" /> a short period of time.  Then it should be possible to reduce the contribution. We realise, of course, that the proposed contribution is double what the Society would have had to impose at the end of this year.  It is, however, less than eight shillings a week, which is small when compared with a solicitor's other expenses in running his office and also when the fall in the value of money since before the war is taken into account.</P>
    <P>I may say that other schemes for compensating clients have been examined, but they were discarded in favour of what is in fact a compulsory insurance scheme with an adequate annual contribution.  Members of the public who are defrauded by those solicitors who form a minority of the profession are very often helpless victims and must in the opinion of the Government be adequately protected. It is true that this in effect means that the honest solicitors are being compelled to underwrite their dishonest colleagues. However, we are satisfied that no other method will work satisfactorily. After all, the careful motorist must underwrite the negligent motorist.  The scheme of the 1954 Act was a good scheme except for the fact that the contribution was not sufficiently high to meet the liabilities which arose.  This problem will, we trust, be solved under the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill contains the miscellaneous provisions.  I should like to discuss three of the sections concerned because they propose important changes in the law.  These are Sections 26, 31 and 32.</P>
    <P>Section 26 proposes to add two new paragraphs to Section 49 (1) of the 1954 Act.  That section provides for the refusal of a practising certificate in certain specified cases listed in subsection (1).  It is proposed to add the case of a solicitor who has failed to comply with an order of the High Court and also the case of a solicitor who has failed to comply with the solicitors' accounts regulations or with regulations as respects professional practice, conduct and discipline.  This proposal is no more than reasonable. If a solicitor does not conform with <Col N="130" /> the regulations dealing with accounts or with the other regulations I have mentioned, he should not be entitled automatically to the issue of a practising certificate.</P>
    <P>Where, under section 49 of the 1954 Act, the Society direct the registrar to refuse to issue a practising certificate, the certificate must nevertheless be issued if the applicant satisfies the Society that he has appealed to the Chief Justice.  The President of the High Court is being substituted for the Chief Justice in Section 25 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, while it is proposed to add two paragraphs to Section 49 (1) of the 1954 Act, two existing paragraphs are listed for repeal in the Schedule to the Bill. These are paragraphs (b) and (c). Paragraph (b) is concerned with the case of a solicitor who has been suspended from practice, the period of the suspension having expired. Paragraph (c) specifies the case of a solicitor whose name has been struck off the roll and then restored.  In both these cases the Society may direct the refusal of a practising certificate.</P>
    <P>Whatever justification there may have been for paragraphs (b) and (c) under the scheme of the 1954 Act, which purported to allow the Disciplinary Committee to suspend from practice and to strike off and restore to the roll, there is, in our view, no justification now.  Once the period of suspension imposed on a solicitor by the High Court has expired or once the High Court has restored to the roll the name of a solicitor which has been struck off, the solicitor concerned has served his punishment and should not be liable to further punishment.</P>
    <P>I now come to what we regard as a vital section in the Bill.  Section 31 makes detailed provision for the production each year by every solicitor (to whom the solicitors' accounts regulations apply) of an accountant's certificate stating that the solicitor is keeping the accounts regulations.  The regulations, which apply to every solicitor practising on his own or in partnership and receiving clients' moneys, oblige the solicitor to keep <Col N="131" /> a separate client bank account or accounts.  Failure to deliver the annual accountant's certificate will be misconduct for the purpose of the disciplinary provisions contained in Part II of the Bill and, moreover, the registrar is being empowered to withhold the issue of a practising certificate until the solicitor delivers the accountant's certificate.</P>
    <P>Section 66 of the 1954 Act, which made accounts regulations mandatory, provides that the regulations shall make provision for, <i>inter alia</i>, enforcing compliance with them and ascertaining whether they have been complied with.  Under the Solicitors Accounts Regulations, 1955, the Council of the Law Society may require a solicitor at any time to have his books, bank statements and other appropriate documents produced for examination by an accountant approved or appointed by the council.</P>
    <P>The powers of the council would not normally be exercised until a complaint in regard to the solicitor is made or the council become aware themselves of some suspected irregularity. By that time, the solicitor will in many cases have already landed himself in trouble.  The object of section 31 of the Bill is to keep him out of trouble. The annual accountant's certificate will protect the public and it will also protect the solicitor himself.  Furthermore, it will help to protect the compensation fund so that the profession in general will have a safeguard against those members likely to impose on the fund substantial liability for their dishonesty.  In this respect, the section is a corollary to a fund contributions to which are obligatory for all solicitors though the vast majority of them are honest and careful in the handling of clients' moneys.</P>
    <P>Accounts regulations are of little practical value if they are not strictly enforced and the only way to see that they are enforced is by a regular examination. A solicitor must be both a professional adviser and a business man.  As a business man he should, if he is prudent, keep proper books and have them regularly examined <Col N="132" /> and audited.  All this goes without saying.  The council have stressed to us that if appropriate steps are taken before great damage is done, the public and the practitioner will be protected from worse harm.  Admittedly, the accountant's certificate will not be an absolute protection against a solicitor who is deliberately dishonest, but it should save from himself that solicitor who, through carelessness or negligence not amounting, in the beginning at least, to fraudulent intent, would otherwise gradually and inevitably get himself deeper and deeper into trouble.</P>
    <P>The person who meddles with other people's funds to get himself out of what he fondly imagines is a temporary difficulty is suffering from the delusion that so often leads to disaster. In the interests of such a person and also in the public interest, any system of control requires the element of prevention at an early stage as well as the element of ultimate punishment. As a philosopher once put it in another context, you do not allow a palpable madman to throw himself over a precipice, you restrain him, you who are wise.</P>
    <P>The need for an annual accountant's certificate has been demonstrated in England and Scotland.  In England, the obligation was imposed in an enactment of 1941 and rules were made to give effect to that enactment in 1946.  A corresponding enactment for Scotland was passed in 1958. In the Six Counties, proposals for an annual certificate are contained in a Private Member's Bill sponsored by the Northern Law Society.  Deputies will notice that Section 31 of our Bill will, by reason of Section 2, come into operation on a day to be fixed by order of the Minister for Justice made on the request of the Society, which means the Council of the Society. The Government have agreed that the section should not be brought into operation immediately so as to allow time for the making of the necessary regulations and to acclimatise the profession to the fact that an annual accountant's certificate will eventually be required from every solicitor.</P>
    <P>I desire to make it perfectly clear <Col N="133" /> that it is not the intention to have the section enacted and then to forget about the matter.  This section is regarded by the Government as one of prime importance which must be brought into operation in a reasonable time.  If it is not, the question of fresh legislation will need to be considered. We realise only too well that it is not possible to make particular solicitors, or anybody else for that matter, honest by Act of the Oireachtas, but we feel that we can do something to prevent people from being dishonest and to avoid a line of conduct which must eventually lead to dishonesty.</P>
    <P>I might mention that in England one of the rules made in 1946 provides that the accountant shall make a comparison, as at not fewer than two dates selected by him at random, between the liabilities of the solicitor to his clients and the balances standing to the credit of the client account. This is, of course, a very valuable rule and was obviously intended to see to it that a solicitor is not allowed to evade his obligations simply by having his house in order at the time the accountant makes the examination. The idea is that the solicitor keep his house in order throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with Section 31 because, as I have indicated, we regard it as a very important section.  I may say that it has received the most careful consideration in consultation with the Council of the Law Society.  To some it may appear as if the proposal means unnecessary control in the conduct of their profession by solicitors.  This is far from being the case.  As Deputies are aware, there has, and naturally so, been an amount of public disquiet at certain cases involving dishonesty by solicitors that have from time to time come to light.  The Council of the Society are very concerned about these cases and are anxious to do all they can in the matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from the duty to protect the public there is also the public's duty to protect itself.  People who have to consult solicitors should be careful to avoid the disreputable practitioner.  If a client is negligent and loses his money, the compensation fund will <Col N="134" /> not automatically indemnify him as payments from the fund in cases of negligence are in the discretion of the Society and will continue to be so. After all, reputable solicitors are in the majority, and a client who exposes himself to fraud with his eyes open has often only himself to blame.  This, of course, is not to say that innocent clients do not lose their money through the misconduct of solicitors. They do Still, loss might, in many instances, be avoided if more thought were given to the reputation of the solicitor to whom one entrusts one's affairs.</P>
    <P>The last section of the Bill that calls for discussion is Section 32.  This is a rather technical section which proposes to apply the ordinary bankruptcy rule in respect of the administration of the client account or accounts of a bankrupt solicitor or of a solicitor who dies insolvent.  The funds in a client account are treated as trust funds and, as such, do not form part of the estate for the purposes of bankruptcy or insolvency on death.  They are applied in accordance with what is known as the rule in Clayton's Case, which lays down that debts must be discharged in order of date or, as is said, &lsquo;first in, first out&rsquo;.  The Council of the Law Society have suggested that this rule should be excluded and that the law should be amended in the same way as has been done in the Scottish Solicitors Act, 1958.  Having examined the matter thoroughly, we were satisfied that the wishes of the Council should be met.  Accordingly, Section 32 of the Bill proposes that the sum or sums at the credit of the client account or accounts of a bankrupt or deceased insolvent solicitor shall be divisible proportionately amongst the clients of the solicitor according to the respective sums received by the solicitor on their account and remaining due by him to them.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House. In doing so I should like, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and on behalf of the Government, to express thanks to the Council of the Incorporated Law Society for their assistance and co-operation.  I have personally been <Col N="135" /> very closely associated with the preparation of this Bill and I had lengthy consultations with the representatives of the Council at various times.  It would be remiss of me if I did not pay a special tribute to the President of the Society and to the other representatives of the Council with whom I examined the proposals for this Bill. The President and his colleagues were generous and unstinting in devoting their time and energy to the Bill.  I was particularly impressed by their anxiety to have a Bill which would be of enduring benefit, not alone to the public but to the profession that they so honourably represent.  I trust that this Bill, which has been agreed with the Council of the Incorporated Law Society will achieve its objects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the understanding expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary that this Bill represents substantial agreement between the Government and the Incorporated Law Society, we are prepared to support the Bill subject to one or two matters which in our judgment require closer examination.  We are all familiar with the difficulties that arose in connection with previous legislation relating to this matter, and so we look at Section 12 of this Bill with some anxiety.</P>
      <P>Section 12 of this Bill provides:</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to subsection (2) of this section, an order of the High Court under section 8 of this Act, under that section as applied by section 11 of this Act or under section 9 or section 10 of this Act shall be final and not appealable.</P>
      <P>(2)  By leave of the High Court, an appeal, by the Society or the solicitor concerned, from an order of the High Court under sections 8 of this Act, under that section as applied by section 11 of this Act or under section 9 or section 10 of this Act shall lie to the Supreme Court on a specified question of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not satisfied that the provisions of that section will meet the requirements of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court and <Col N="136" /> we feel it is a question which ought to be resolved before the legislation is finally passed into law by the President's signature, preferably by reference by the President of the Bill, as it then will be, to the Supreme Court for determination as to whether it conforms to the requirements of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting coincidence today in Dáil Éireann.  We have just had a Veterinary Surgeons Bill before us and there is a similar provision in that Bill.  However, on that Bill the Minister for Agriculture assures me that the Attorney General has assured him that there is no necessity to put into the Veterinary Surgeons Bill an appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law.  Ten minutes after he gives me that assurance the Parliamentary Secretary marches into the Dáil and says he has been advised that subsection (2) of Section 12 takes the harm out of Section 12 which would otherwise be there.  I suppose the correct description of that would be an ambivalent mind but it seems to me we might charge the law officers of the Government with having an ambidextrous mind for they can advise one Minister that subsection (2) of this Bill is necessary and another Minister that subsection (2) of this Bill is not necessary in an exactly similar provision relating to the veterinary profession.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that a sufficient liaison between himself and the Minister for Agriculture might be established to find out which of the law officers advised whom and what, because they cannot advise in that diametrically opposed sense unless there is some very serious flaw in their mental processes.</P>
    <P>Our view is that where you have a written Constitution and are introducing disciplinary measures of this kind it is very much preferable to have these matters resolved by a preliminary detached proceeding rather than to have any possible flaw in the legislation brought to light by a litigant against whom the disciplinary regulations are set in motion and who appeals to the Supreme Court to have them set aside, thus thrusting upon <Col N="137" /> the Oireachtas the necessity of going over its own legislation and trying to legislate to meet the Constitutional problem which has arisen as a result of an attempt to enforce an Act passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In the course of his statement the Parliamentary Secretary says on Page 4:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There is a similar provision in regard to veterinary surgeons in Sections 39 (3) of the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>He is apparently unaware of the fact that we have before us a Bill at the present time designed to repeal subsection (3) of Section 39 of the Veterinary Surgeons Act.  We are actually in the process of repealing that subsection.  I refer the Minister to the Second Schedule of the Veterinary Surgeons Bill under the heading &ldquo;Extent of Repeal&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1) of section 39, the words &ldquo;or on account of professional misconduct; or&rdquo; and paragraph (d); subsection (3) of section 39.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious lack of liaison if the precedent of subsection (3) of Section 39 of the Veterinary Surgeons Bill is quoted to us as a precedent in this Bill when, five minutes ago, we passed the Second Stage of a Bill for the purpose of repealing the very subsection which is offered as a valuable precedent.</P>
    <P>I invite the Parliamentary Secretary to discuss with the Minister for Agriculture these two matters I have raised, because there ought to be available to him and to the Minister for Agriculture advice from the same law officer.  If the subsection (2) of Section 12 is required in this Solicitors Bill it certainly should be required in the Veterinary Surgeons Bill.  If it is not wanted in the Veterinary Surgeons Bill it is unnecessary here.</P>
    <P>Lastly I wish to say that the Bill is acceptable to us in the light of the Parliamentary Secretary's assurance that it is an agreed measure with the Incorporated Law Society and subject to the reservation that we are not <Col N="138" /> satisfied that Section 12 meets the demands of the Constitution, and that in our opinion that matter would be best disposed of by getting the President to refer it to the Supreme Court for decision before it is finally enacted into law.  We fully appreciate the burden that the solicitors' profession are undertaking in connection with the Compensation Fund and we express our admiration and appreciation of the profession's undertaking that not inconsiderable burden.  It is a very welcome development and a great protection to simple people up and down the country who, in the past, may have been called upon to bear very heavy losses as a result of the default of those whom I entirely agree with the Parliamentary Secretary in describing as the rare exception to the general high standard of the profession. With those observations we commend the Bill to the House but we should be glad to have the Parliamentary Secretary's reassurance on the specific points to which I have directed his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Dillon I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will keep the Minister for Agriculture out of a Bill dealing with the solicitors' profession. He might reconcile his differences with him but do not let him interfere with the Solicitors' Bill.  I think it is right, and I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary refer to it in generous terms when introducing the Bill, that people should recognise that this Bill &mdash;and indeed the previous legislation passed by this House&mdash;not only had the support, but to a great extent, was introduced at the behest, of the Incorporated Law Society, the body which controls or should control the solicitors' profession in this country, and when this or other Governments introduce a Bill of this sort it is not being done, in a manner, by the Government, or received in a manner by the profession, as though something were being done to cow the profession in any way.  As I say, it is done with the support and at the behest of the Incorporated Law Society and it is right that the public should know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> The Leader of Fine Gael has indicated our support for this proposal, with a question mark regarding Section 12 of the Bill.  My own view with regard to Section 12 is that the Bill should allow a solicitor to appeal to the Supreme Court if an order is made by the High Court against him.  Neither I nor anyone else in the legal profession, or on these Benches, is going to make a plea for a defaulting or a dishonest solicitor, but it is necessary to recognise that a solicitor who is struck off the solicitors' roll is losing his entire livelihood.  If he feels that he is being unjustly treated, or that his case has not been fully appreciated by the High Court, it is ordinary justice, which should apply to a solicitor as well as to anyone else, that he should have a chance of appealing that decision to the Supreme Court.  I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to have another look at that section in conjunction with the Incorporated Law Society.  It is not going to do any harm, it is not going to weaken the control of the Law Society, it is not going to weaken the control of the High Court in any way to allow a provision for an appeal to the Supreme Court on the facts, quite apart from any specific question of law which may be settled by the High Court.</P>
    <P>There are some other small points which I raise simply with a view to getting clarification from the Parliamentary Secretary.  In Section 7, subsection (3) (b)&mdash;this is where an inquiry has been made by the Disciplinary Committee established under the Act&mdash;it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>on completion of the inquiry, the Disciplinary Committee shall embody their findings in a report to the High Court...</P>
    <P>I should have assumed from that, and from that simple wording, that that report would go to the High Court, but if you read on to subsection (c) it seems that it is only in a case of a finding of misconduct that it is mandatory on the Society <Col N="140" /> to bring the report to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I am not objecting to this provision but it does seem to me that there is a somewhat&mdash;I do not want to be offensive in any way&mdash;sloppy wording in subsection (b).  If it is not intended that the report should go automatically to the High Court it should not be worded as it is&mdash;&ldquo;on completion of the inquiry, the Disciplinary Committee shall embody their findings in a report to the High Court.&rdquo;  It should be stated &ldquo;in a report which may, in accordance with subsection (c), be submitted to the High Court.&rdquo;  I would just ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that, purely from the point of view of clarification.</P>
    <P>Again, Section 9 of the Bill&mdash;there may be very good reason for this but I do not understand it&mdash;deals with the removal at his own request of the name of a solicitor from the roll.  I cannot for the life of me understand why a request from a solicitor who wishes to give up practice, who wishes to retire, should be a matter for an inquiry from the Disciplinary Committee. I should imagine that a solicitor who feels he has reached the age of retirement, or is going into some other business or profession and does not want to continue on the solicitors' roll, should be allowed to have his name removed by arrangement with the Society or the secretary of the Society rather than have to make an application to the Disciplinary Committee.  That is not a very important matter but one into which I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to look.</P>
    <P>There is a point I want to mention in connection with Section 19 which I regard as being somewhat more important.  It deals with the power of the Society to deal with documents of certain solicitors.  This envisages a case where the Society are of the opinion that a solicitor, or someone in his employment, has been dishonest and it authorises the Society in certain circumstances to nominate someone to take possession of the documents of that solicitor.  The word &ldquo;documents&rdquo; is defined in the definition section of <Col N="141" /> the Bill and I am not satisfied that it would include such things as moneys or securities which a solicitor may have in his possession, as distinct from keeping a bank account.  It does seem to me that in certain circumstances, it would be necessary, if the Law Society were putting this machinery into operation against a solicitor, or someone in a solicitor's office, that they should have the power to take into their custody and control moneys and securities as well as other documents or papers.  I do not know whether that omission was deliberate or not; it certainly does not seem to be covered by the powers which enabled the freezing of a solicitor's bank account.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I want to say on this Bill.  It is only right that I should welcome the manner in which it was introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary and the generous words in which he spoke of the Incorporated Law Society and the council of that body.  I also think that the public should appreciate what Deputy Dillon said, that the solicitors' profession voluntarily&mdash; I should not say voluntarily&mdash;in pressing for this legislation or accepting this legislation, are accepting fairly considerable burdens, first, to set up the compensation fund and, secondly, with regard to the Solicitors Act regulations, because it does entail, one might say, every solicitor, big or small, even the person who has only started and is in his first year in practice, employing an accountant to put his accounts in proper order, and supplying an accountant's certificate.  I feel, as Deputy Dillon said, that is something that should be known and appreciated by the public.</P>

      <P>I rise to question the validity of an argument used by the Parliamentary Secretary in which he endeavoured to draw a comparison between the compensation fund of the Law Society and the fact that the careful motorist must underwrite the negligent motorist.  Of course, that is not a true or fair comparison: it would be a fair comparison if the compensation fund were being asked <Col N="142" /> to underwrite negligence of solicitors, but it is not.  Any prudent solicitor will insure himself against negligence but that is a cost which has to be borne by prudent solicitors, who are in most cases the honest ones, in addition to the penalty of £20 which this Bill seeks to impose upon the profession in respect of sins committed by a small minority of the profession at a time when the Law Society did not have the powers, or some of the powers, conferred on them by this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not because I think the solicitors' profession objects to the payment of the £20 for the purpose of compensating people but because of the principle involved in this levy that I wish to record my objection to Section 22 which, if it is passed, will probably become law about December of this year or January of next year. Within a few days of its becoming law, solicitors throughout the length and breadth of the country will get a notice stating that they will not be permitted to operate as solicitors next year, unless they fork out £20 in addition to the other annual levies imposed on them.  That is the kind of thing that may put some solicitors into financial difficulties, particularly young solicitors, and they may start raiding clients' moneys in order to meet this atrocious penalty of £20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I think is particularly objectionable is that it is a form of retrospective legislation.  You are compelling those who are for the time being solicitors to pay in respect of mistakes that occurred some years ago before the Law Society had the disciplinary powers conferred on them by this Bill and by the earlier Act.  I think it is true to say that although the Law Society had certain powers under the 1954 Act, they hesitated to employ these powers in recent years, particularly since the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Farrell and O'Gorman.  The Law Society was afraid to move because they felt that any action of theirs might involve them in further trouble and litigation. We now have the sorry situation that the solicitors' profession in general is asked to pay this £20 because this <Col N="143" /> House six years ago passed a Bill which turned out to be unconstitutional and which the Law Society were afraid to put into operation because of that.</P>
    <P>We ought to approach this in the same manner as the 1954 Act was approached.  We should regret that any people should have suffered because of the dishonesty of a small minority of solicitors in the past and we ought to start off afresh and see to it that any compensation fund is built up gradually over the next few years, rather than slap this £20 on the profession as a penalty or fine before a solicitor can begin, or continue, to operate as a solicitor for the next 12 months.  It is true, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, it is a relatively small figure compared with the other outlay of a solicitor's office, but the tragedy is that solicitors have to pay such an atrociously high amount of outlay, much of which is due to the deliberate and indefinite delay on the part of the Department of Justice and other legal institutions in the city in carrying out some of the necessary modernisation.</P>
    <P>The average solicitor spends from £200 to £500 a year in using business methods which were as modern as they could be in the 17th or 18th century, but which are not the kind of thing which should operate in the 20th century.  If the Department of Justice and the court officials were to modernise the whole legal system as it operates in Dublin, I feel sure that the profession would be well able to afford not only £20 but a couple of hundred pounds per head per annum.</P>
    <P>Much of the difficulty of the legal profession at present arises from the fact that their overheads are extraordinarily high and that they have to bear many of them out of their own pockets.  Unfortunately, many of them make use of clients' funds for the purpose of paying these unnecessary overheads. The modernisation I have mentioned would be a practical way of avoiding some of the considerable difficulties that face the legal profession. I am glad, however, that the <Col N="144" /> Parliamentary Secretary did emphasise that it is a very small minority of solicitors who have been guilty of misconduct in the past and that is the very reason why an honourable profession and one that is very hard-pressed, despite the music-hall idea to the contrary, should not be asked to bear this cost of £20 right away in respect of dishonesty that has already occurred.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in this Bill which will ensure that an accountant's certificate is furnished to the Law Society to establish that particular solicitors comply with the Solicitors Act regulations, but, from my reading of the Bill, there is nothing in it to protect the public against the dishonest solicitor and the dishonest accountant working in collusion, except perhaps in the section which provides that the Law Society may specify the qualifications of the accountant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there are many dishonest accountants.  Many accountants make their money by codding the income tax authorities. This attitude of mind which influences them in not disclosing to the tax people the full state of affairs in relation to their clients' income may influence them when it comes to furnishing certificates to the Law Society.</P>
      <P>I should prefer to see machinery whereby the Law Society could send inspectors into solicitors' offices, without any prior notice, with authority to inspect the accounts in offices at any time.  I appreciate that under the 1955 regulations, the Law Society may call upon a solicitor to produce his books, his bank statements and other financial records, to a particular accountant nominated by the Law Society.  One of the weaknesses of that arrangement is that a solicitor, with the aid of a friendly accountant doing a little bit of overwork, can set his books in order before producing them to the accountant from the Law Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> If the Law Society had the power of sending an accountant into a solicitor's office without notice to inspect the books and accounts before any emendation could be done on them, a dishonest member of the solicitors' profession would be very slow to risk running his accounts improperly. As things stand at present, he can run that risk without any serious consequences.  I do not think the mere furnishing of a certificate by the accountant will protect the public against that kind of thing in future.</P>
    <P>As the purpose of this Bill is to prevent dishonesty, we should try to be as blunt as we possibly can.  If we provide a system of inspection without notice, we shall be taking a step in the right direction.  As a member of the profession, I appreciate that it would be inconvenient to have accountants coming in and inspecting the books without notice, but I think an honest solicitor who has nothing to hide will not hesitate to support such a proposal.  It might, in the long run, be far better than the rather milk and water proposal we have in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it might not be convenient to introduce it in this Bill, but I think dishonesty on the part of a solicitor in relation to a client's funds should be a statutory offence, carrying a minimum mandatory penalty of seven years' penal servitude without any option of a fine. If that were on the statute books, the very small minority who are inclined to disregard their obligations to their clients might think twice before doing so.</P>
    <P>These are some of the things which could be done and which, if tightened up, would prevent no small amount of dishonesty in future.  That is necessary, first of all, because the public should not be allowed to suffer on account of the dishonesty of any man, and secondly, in order that members of the profession should not be burdened with this undue levy of £20 a year to compensate for the dishonesty of others.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Parliamentary Secretary's invalid comparison to <Col N="146" /> which I referred at the outset, I should like to point out that a more apt comparison would be if society were asked to compensate people who suffer at the hands of thieves and robbers.  Society are not asked to compensate people who suffer at the hands of thieves or robbers.  If that were the situation, it would then be right to compel honest solicitors to pay for dishonest solicitors.  That situation does not, of course, exist.  The malicious injury code which allows compensation to be paid by society to people who have suffered malicious injury may, of course, be quoted, but that affects only a very small proportion, and anyway that code does not compensate for theft.  That might be a valid comparison, but the comparison made by the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to the negligent motorist being indemnified by society is not true in relation to the compensation fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow one statement made by Deputy Ryan to go uncontradicted, and I do not think he really meant it.  He said that many accountants are dishonest.  I think in relation to accountancy, certainly amongst those people who are properly entitled to call themselves accountants, there is a very small percentage who do not adhere to the high standards the remainder practice. There is, of course, unfortunately, a great number of people who call themselves accountants but who belong to no organised body and are not, in fact, accountants at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to consult with recognised bodies like the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Society of Public Accountants, and so forth, whether it would be possible to have legislation which would ensure that a person would not have the right to call himself an auditor or accountant without adhering to some standard such as that to which solicitors, doctors, veterinary surgeons, and so forth, have to adhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this Bill, all of us realise that the £20 per annum that will have to be paid now by every solicitor will be a substantial burden and, for some one with an office <Col N="147" /> where there are a great number of solicitors, the amount involved will be pretty substantial.  Personally, I feel without question it is an obligation we must undertake if the reputation of the solicitors' profession is to be kept in a proper manner before the public. I suggest that once the Incorporated Law Society and the solicitors' profession as a whole have undertaken this liability, there is an obligation on the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the other administrative costs are brought down.</P>
    <P>It would be unreal, unrealistic and unfair for the Department of Justice to insist that the Incorporated Law Society would, as of right&mdash;except in the case where a man contributed to his own misfortune&mdash;have to compensate in full as a statutory obligation, unless at the same time Departments of State&mdash;I do not speak of the Department of Justice alone&mdash;did everything they possibly could to obviate this as being an increase in solicitors' overheads, if the overhead could be cut otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is, of course, aware of the memorandum that has been sent to him by the Incorporated Law Society indicating the various ways in which administrative costs could be reduced by Government action.  He has agreed&mdash;and I pay tribute to his ready agreement&mdash;to try to examine the suggested scheme with a view to ensuring that such short cuts in administrative costs as are possible will be put through as soon as may be.  I hope that not merely will he examine them from a Department of Justice angle, but that he will urge on his colleagues in the Government that they should do their part in the same way.  The Minister for Finance, in particular, and the Revenue Commissioners, should try to ensure that they will modernise, and assist in the modernisation of, the practice in relation to the stamping of documents, whether for ordinary stamp duty or fee stamps for court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Unless that is done, we must face the situation that administrative costs will rise, and rise substantially.  If <Col N="148" /> they rise substantially, the cost to the public will be increased and the margin of profit for the solicitor will be decreased, with unpleasant consequences. I think the Parliamentary Secretary will be the first to admit that the Incorporated Law Society have met him in this matter of compensation in both an ample and a willing fashion.  I suggest to him that there is an obligation on him, and on his colleagues in the Government, to meet the Law Society then in the other respects I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>At some stage there will be an obligation on solicitors to produce accounting certificates.  That is a further step that must be accepted, though I realise fully it will not be one that will be very popular with some solicitors.  They will not like the idea of anybody looking at their accounts.  But it has to come and, until such time as it does come, there should be something more than a mere signed statement that the solicitor is obeying the regulations.  I think there should be a most formal statutory declaration.  Whether a statutory declaration before a Peace Commissioner is adequate, I have my doubts.</P>
    <P>I think that in certain cases some of the older solicitors did not exactly realise what the position was in relation to the changes in solicitors' accounts and the accounts regulations. They were inclined to sign a certificate that they were obeying the regulations, believing that what they were doing was obeying the regulations as they were long ago and not realising at all that accounts regulations in modern times are something quite different.  Until such time, therefore, as the accountant's certificate comes in there must be the most formal possible declaration by a solicitor that he is obeying the accounts regulations.</P>
    <P>Let no one fail to realise that the solicitor's accounts regulations involve considerable additional administrative expense for the solicitor's office.  There is the position, for example, in which one pays out £100 or £200 stamp duty for a client in one week and one does <Col N="149" /> not get back that stamp duty from the client until the next week; that means double the work administratively in one's office.  I have to pay the money out today out of my own office account; I get in next week from my client a sum which includes that stamp duty and also includes money that belongs to the client.  That means that I have to lodge the money to my client's account&mdash;must properly lodge it&mdash;and then draw off my client's account to recoup my office account the amount I paid out last week.  That transaction can be multiplied.  Even in the case of one client it can mean a great number of additional entries in and transfers from one account to another.  The effect of all that must be to add to the administrative cost. I accept, without question, that it is an administrative cost we must, as a profession, undertake in order to ensure that our client's moneys are properly protected.  But we must undertake it with our eyes open; it is an additional administrative cost and, being an additional administrative cost, it is something we must try to offset in another way.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I come back again to the obligation on the Parliamentary Secretary to try at once to put into operation as many as possible of the recommendations for administrative efficiency which have been put before him by the Incorporated Law Society. If he waits until he can cope with all the administrative changes it is desirable to introduce in order to make the machine perfect, not merely will he not be there but he and I will both be gone to another reward.  If he waits, it will take far too long.  It is a matter in relation to which one can take certain things that are reasonably simple and can be done reasonably. The changed administration is one that must be tackled piecemeal.  As it becomes possible, that should be done. At least there is that much deadweight cut out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to say that I welcome the attitude taken by the Opposition to this Bill.  In dealing with the points raised, I think it is fitting that I should <Col N="150" /> mention first the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon.  He took me to task in relation to my reference to the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1931.  I merely used that Act as an argument to show that there was nothing new in the idea of professional men, giving their opinion to a court as to the fitness, or otherwise, of a colleague to be a member of the profession.  I, of course, realise that we have before us at the moment a Veterinary Surgeons Bill.  But the old Act is still there and, when I said the position was such and such, I was, in fact, quite right because, even though there is a Bill designed to amend the Act, the Act is still there.  Purely as a debating point, my argument is correct.  In any event, it was used by me merely to prove the point that there was nothing new in the principle.  It had no other significance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the criticism made by Deputy Costello of the 1958 Bill.  I think Deputy McGilligan had the same criticism to offer.  Deputy Costello intimated that what he was worried about was the idea of the Disciplinary Committee including in its report an opinion as to whether the particular solicitor was a fit person to be a member of the profession. In order to deal with the argument advanced then I mentioned that there was nothing new in that proposal.  I pointed out what was <Col N="151" /> already in existence with relation to doctors and veterinary surgeons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, while not wishing to discuss the Parliamentary Secretary's argument, does it not seem proper, in a matter of this sort, in which two professions are concerned with the same point that, whichever advises the Government on the legal attitude, should at least adopt an agreed line?  It is misleading in the sense of dealing with one profession in one way and with another profession in another way on the same point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that in a moment.  When I come to the constitutional point, Deputy Dillon is, I think, on even weaker grounds than Deputy Cosgrave.  This Bill proposes that the appeal to the Supreme Court should be only on a point of law.  I should be the last person to attempt to argue the constitutionality of any provision but Section 12 seems to me to be constitutional.</P>

It would be utterly disastrous to this Bill if Section 12 were declared unconstitutional after being put into operation.  It would upset the whole thing.  We should have the 1954 situation all over again.  We should be clear and certain before the <Col N="152" /> solicitors' profession is asked to undertake this obligation.  I prefer it if it is constitutional.  Some of my colleagues do not.  However, I want to be certain it is right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither am I.  The position seems quite clear in the light of Article 34 (4) (iii) of the Constitution which says:</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court shall, with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as may be prescribed by law, have appellate jurisdiction from all decisions of the High Court, and shall also have appellate jurisdiction from such decisions of other courts as may be prescribed by law.</P>
      <P>I do not quote that to get involved in a constitutional argument.  The suggestion that myself and the Minister for Agriculture have been differently advised legally has no foundation. Admittedly we are doing different things with the different professions but there is no question of the legal advice being different.</P>
      <P>Under the Veterinary Surgeons Bill, as the Minister for Agriculture explained, there is to be no appeal to the Supreme Court.  In accordance with what I understand to be the law there is an appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court in every case, except where otherwise prescribed by statute.  I am dealing now with ordinary issues and not with constitutional issues on which there must be an appeal.  A different procedure is being adopted in the Veterinary Surgeon's Bill from that being adopted in this Bill.  There is no question of different advices.</P>

      <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, whose attitude I welcome, raised a point on Section 7.  The first reference to the report to the High Court is concerned with the form of the report.  Where there is no misconduct the Law Society will prepare a report but it does not have to go to the High Court.  Only in the case of misconduct so found will the report go to the High Court.  The form of working is not for me to decide.  The form of wording used is that which was deemed appropriate by the draftsman.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We considered the point with regard to a solicitor having his name removed from the roll.  We have to visualise a situation where a solicitor, knowing he is heading for trouble, might like to get out of his obligations as a solicitor <Col N="154" /> by having his name removed from the roll.  Therefore, we think it better to have the provision as we have it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that it is treating the solicitors' profession generally in too suspicious a manner.  If an application is made to the secretary and he feels there are reasonable grounds for suspicion, I would agree that there should be some provision that he should direct the enquiry to the disciplinary committee. However, in the case of a solicitor retiring and going into another business it seems suspicious that his application should initially be directed to the Disciplinary Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall consider that.  I do not want in any circumstances to convey an impression of being unduly suspicious of the profession. However, I hope I have explained why we have inserted the provision as it is in the Bill.</P>
      <P>To allow the Society to take over money securities and assets of that nature would not, I think, be desirable. I do not imagine that the Law Society would want to undertake that responsibility.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I must, as deferentially as I can, accuse Deputy Ryan of not reading the Bill very carefully.  He argued against the £20 subscription, by alleging that a young solicitor starting off in practice would have to pay that sum.  Further reference to the Bill will show him that we have made a concession to a young solicitor starting off in practice.  He has to pay only £5 for the first three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Three years is not much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that next year a young solicitor starting off will be faced with the burden of £20.  As Deputy Sweetman pointed out, the amount of the annual contribution is a very important matter. The argument has been put forward by the Council of the Society that they are not going to commit, as they put it, an act of professional bankruptcy. The fund has been set up.  It is agreed there should be a fund.  If there is to be a fund the solicitors' <Col N="155" /> profession are determined it should be solvent and sufficient to meet its liabilities.  At the moment the fund is not capable of doing that.</P>
      <P>It was obvious that as on and from January next in any event, solicitors would be paying £10 instead of the present £5.  The fact is that £10 is inadequate.  We must face up to this. The solicitors are, I know, prepared to face up to it and are agreeable to have a contribution that will allow the fund to meet all its obligations and build up the reserve that we have specified in the Bill.  Then, when the reserve is built up, the annual subscription can be brought down to whatever figure is appropriate.</P>
      <P>I make Deputy Ryan a present of the argument about insurance on motor cars and the analogy with the Compensation Fund.  I think it is a perfectly good and valid comparison. If it offends Deputy Ryan, I withdraw it without hesitation.  I do not think it affects the issue very much one way or the other.  The point is that the profession are agreed to have a solvent Compensation Fund and whatever analogy is used to justify its existence does not really affect the basic idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly disagree completely with Deputy Ryan on his proposal for inspectors and for a number of reasons.  First of all, I think it would be pushing control of professional men too far to have this type of inspector that Deputy Ryan envisages going in at any time, no matter what the inconvenience, to a solicitor's office to inspect the solicitor's books.  Apart from that, it is undesirable to treat professional men in that way.  I think the inspectorial system he visualised would be much less effective than the annual accountant's certificate.  Unless you have an enormous number of inspectors their visits will only be sporadic.  When the accountant's certificate regulations are made, there will be a regular inspection.  Every solicitor each year will have to produce an accountant's certificate. On all grounds, I suggest that the system which will ultimately be operated under the Bill's proposals is <Col N="156" /> much more preferable than what the Deputy recommends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, I was thinking of both systems operating at the one time.  I appreciate the argument about inconvenience. I was not suggesting it in substitution for the certificate.</P>

      <P>I did not realise that. Even still, I say it would not be a desirable thing to do.  After all, we are dealing with an honourable and reputable profession.  This is their own private business to a great extent. There should be a limit to the obligations and supervision which we impose upon them.  I am sure that the profession generally would quite rightly resent a form of almost police supervision by inspectors.</P>
      <P>I must say I am very impressed with Deputy Sweetman's contribution and I should like to indicate personally that I would be very glad to accept the obligations which he says I should accept.  I realise that we are placing a burden on solicitors.  It is a substantial one and if we could do anything to reduce solicitors' administration costs by a more efficient service in Government Departments, the courts or elsewhere, we should certainly do it.  I must, however, sound a note of warning. It is certainly not possible to give a firm assurance in this regard but, in so far as anything can be done, I think that we in the Department of Justice will certainly be prepared to examine the situation and see what we can do to help.  I can assure Deputy Sweetman that the memorandum which the Law Society have submitted to the Department will get the most careful examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked that something should be done in the interim between the passing of the Bill and the introduction of the accountant's certificate regulations.  I can quite see that he has a point there and, indeed, I share his anxiety in respect of that period.  However, I hope that the accountant's certificate regulations would be operative fairly soon.  In the interim period it would be better to leave the matter to be <Col N="157" /> dealt with as far as may be under the Accounts Regulations.  The Council of the Law Society have certain powers at the moment and I personally am willing to leave the interim period to their good judgment. I know they are anxious to have accountants' certificate regulations as soon as possible; and they are also anxious about the situation generally as to clients' funds.</P>
    <P>I am very much impressed and gratified to note the reception that Section 31 received in the House from the members of the House who are themselves solicitors.  It augurs very well for the future administration of the proposed legislation and for the things we are trying to do that the members here who are solicitors should show such enthusiasm for the annual accountant's certificate.</P>
    <P>I do not think there was any other point raised by any speaker that I need deal with at this stage.  If there is anything further, I will certainly deal with it on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  For the moment, I think I have more or less replied to all the points which members made.  In conclusion, I should like to repeat my appreciation for the attitude of the Opposition and to express my gratitude for the helpful manner in which they received the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on the last occasion, I was referring to the ethical argument against fluoridation of water and to the report of the consultative council.  I must say that from the wording of the report, I understood that when two members had signed it, with a note in brackets after their names, &ldquo;subject to deletion of Article 37,&rdquo; it meant those members did not agree with the wording of Article 37 of the report which article, I thought, very lightly dismissed the ethical argument.  The Minister intervened to say:</P>
      <P>It did not arise on the question as to whether there was or was not any ethical principle involved but on quite another aspect, as to whether it was necessary for the council to make that inquiry.</P>
      <P>Naturally, I must accept the Minister's word that that is the position, but I think I am entitled to say that it is by no means clearly shown from the report and to that extent, quite inadvertently, I am sure, the report is definitely misleading.</P>
      <P>This Bill was introduced by the Minister after some considerable delay and, I feel quite sure, some very considerable thought on his part. However, it is so long since we discussed it last, I think I might be permitted, without being accused of repetition, to summarise the arguments which I made in relation to it, and which were generally made from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who spoke from these Benches made it quite clear to the Minister that we were not prepared <Col N="159" /> to accept the Bill, or support it in its present form.  We felt that the report of the Fluorine Consultative Council had recommended to the Minister that he should introduce enabling legislation, that he should introduce permissive legislation, rather than a mandatory Bill, and it was indicated to him that, if he were prepared to alter the Bill so as to make it a permissive one, enabling local authorities to introduce fluorine into piped water supplies or not as they choose, we would not oppose the Bill.  But, instead of doing that, the Minister has introduced a Bill which will be mandatory when it becomes law and the regulations he makes will make it mandatory on every local authority in control of a piped water supply to introduce fluorine into that water supply.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the relevant articles in the report of the consultative council are Articles 39 and 41.  Article 41 states:</P>
    <P>The Council is in doubt as to whether local authorities have the necessary statutory authority to add fluoride to public water supplies.  It recommends the introduction of any legislation which may be necessary to enable local authorities to discharge this function.</P>
    <P>Article 39 of the report states:</P>
    <P>Before any public water supply is fluoridated the Council considers that steps should be taken to assess the incidents of dental caries in children resident in the area served by that water supply.  The Council also considers that subsequent to fluoridation adequate steps should be taken to permit a proper evaluation of the results.</P>
    <P>I want to say I believe the deliberate use of the word &ldquo;before&rdquo; at the commencement of Article 39 of the report, taken in conjunction with Article 41, clearly shows that the consultative council intended legislation of a permissive character to be introduced and that by the use of the particular phraseology in Article 39, or paragraph 39, they felt this was a matter which would require a certain amount <Col N="160" /> of research by local authorities before any of them decided to take this step. That being so, I was rather astounded to see that in the second last paragraph of the White Paper issued with this Bill, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>It is particularly with a view to implementing the recommendation in paragraph 39 (cited above) of the Consultative Council's Report that provision is being made by Section 6 of the Bill for surveys of dental caries.</P>
    <P>Remember, in paragraph 39 of the report, the consultative council had suggested that these surveys should be carried out before any water supply was fluoridated by any council or local authority in the country.  The Minister continues in the second last paragraph of the White Paper:</P>
    <P>These surveys will be carried out by health authorities, as and when required by the Minister for Health, and should be of considerable value in enabling statistical material on the benefits of flouridation to be prepared.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the wording of the White Paper that the Minister intends surveys to be carried out under Section 6 of the Bill after the mandatory Bill has become law, after the local authorities have introduced fluorine into their water supplies, and that is very far from implementing the recommendation of the council as contained in paragraph 39 of their report.  The council recommended that surveys should be carried out before anything was done, but the Minister makes it quite clear, in the White Paper, that he regards the surveys to be carried out as leading to the compilation of statistics which will show the beneficial results of the fluoridation of water.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which this was discussed, the Minister made an able case for carrying out the recommendations of the consultative council, except that he proposed doing it in a mandatory manner as set out in the Bill.  I believe he made the best case he could but I am not convinced that his, or the Government's, decision <Col N="161" /> to make this mandatory is a wise one.</P>
    <P>It is true, whether we like it or not, whether we believe in the idea of the fluoridation of water or not, that this is a subject which has aroused widespread controversy throughout the world&mdash;certainly in America and elsewhere. It is true also that it is a subject, a procedure, a treatment&mdash;whatever you like to call it&mdash;which is still in the experimental stage, and it is true the claim made on behalf of those who support the idea of fluoridation of water &mdash;I have no doubt it is a just claim&mdash; extends, as I understand it, only to the fact that it delays the onset of dental caries in children for a year or two, or for some period, and not to any argument as to its being a remedy or a cure for dental caries.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in regard to the idea of fluoridation, it is a case of experts differing.  There would seem to be very impressive medical arguments; a very impressive volume of medical opinion, against the idea of introducing fluorine into water supplies.  There are medical views that the stepping up of the intake of fluorine by individuals may prove harmful, that it may have a harmful effect on certain types of trouble&mdash;kidney trouble and rheumatic conditions were examples given on the last occasion the Bill was discussed. That argument is there, and it is advanced seriously by serious and responsible medical people.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the position is that the entire question is still only in its experimental stage.  Nothing has been settled one way or another.  In some of the communities in America where the idea had been accepted five or ten years ago, it has since been rejected; and some communities have never accepted the idea.  Therefore, it is quite wrong to regard this as settled practice in any country in the world.  Nothing constructive has been shown.  I am prepared to accept, on the Minister's authority and on the authority of the Consultative Council, that it does have beneficial effects as far as dental caries in children are concerned, but as far as I know&mdash;I should like the Minister <Col N="162" /> to give me the benefit of his knowledge on this&mdash;no serious survey has been carried out to show what effect, adverse or advantageous, the increased intake of fluorine might have on people in advanced age groups.  It may be that the result is anything but advantageous.  Has there been any experimentation in that way and, if so, what are the results?</P>
    <P>I have devoted a certain amount of study to the subject and I do not know of any such survey being made. I do know on the other hand, that there are people who genuinely entertain fears on medical grounds that if they are forced against their will, whether they like it or not, to take an increased supply of fluorine through the local authority water supply, it is going to have a harmful effect on them and on their health. In that situation, where there are undoubtedly two points of view, where there are medical arguments for and against, where there are genuine fears entertained by a great number of people, where there is widespread controversy practically throughout the world on the question, it does seem to me to be all wrong that the Minister should take a positive stand in favour of a mandatory Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister at all for deciding that the responsibility and onus lie on him to come to a decision on the report of the consultative council.  I think the Minister has measured up to his responsibilities in that matter.  I think he was right to do so, but where I disagree with him is on the result of that.  I think the Minister could and should have introduced a Bill which would enable local authorities individually, and having real experience of the needs of their own particular areas, to introduce a scheme or not, as they thought fit.  But in face of the doubt and the arguments which exist, in face of the controversy, which is undoubted, the Minister is coming into this House and saying to local authorities: &ldquo;Whether you like it or not, whether you think I am right or wrong, whether the parents of the children in your particular locality like it or not, you are going to accept a scheme of compulsory medication <Col N="163" /> through your water supplies.&rdquo;  That is what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, there are only three local bodies in this country who have given their views on this subject. Possibly there are more, but I know only of three&mdash;Tipperary Urban District Council, Dublin County Council and Leitrim County Council.  All three considered this question and all passed resolutions against the Minister introducing this mandatory Bill. The Minister should take some heed of that.  The members of local authorities are, possibly, very much closer in touch with the people they represent than the Minister is.  You have these three local authorities expressing the view to the Minister that this Bill should not be passed.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking the last day I referred to the ethical arguments.  I do not propose talking at any great length today on that other than to point out that, quite apart from any doubts there may be as to the wisdom of this move from a medical point of view, quite apart from the fears which are genuinely entertained by a number of people that this measure would be harmful to them or to others, there is another argument, the ethical argument, which I believe to be of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is right that any Minister or any Dáil should have the right to say that people must take medicine whether they want it or not, and that they must take it through the piped water supply.  I believe that there is an obligation on the local authorities who are in charge of giving a water supply to a community to give a pure water supply.  That water supply is now to be used by the Minister for health purposes.  Surely that is not right?  Surely it is not right, even if the recipient of it is in need of the medicine, that he should be forced to take it against his will?  That is what the Minister is doing, but he is going a lot further than that.  He is saying to the people who do not need the medicine: &ldquo;You are going to get it as well,&rdquo; because you cannot drink a sup of water, when this Bill goes <Col N="164" /> through and the Minister makes his regulations, without imbibing fluorine with it.  The Minister has not, I hope, too firmly pinned his colours to the masthead of a mandatory Bill.  I think he would be far wiser to recognise that there are genuine fears and arguments against this measure.  If he wants to legislate so as to permit fluorine to be introduced into the water supply, he should do that by a permissive rather than a mandatory Bill.</P>
    <P>I know there are other Deputies who want to give their views on this matter and, as I had an opportunity of speaking at some length previously, I shall not hold them up.  I would appeal to the Minister between now and the Committee Stage to reconsider the matter.  I should like to assure him that I have discussed the Bill with a number of people.  I have been made aware of the reactions of quite a large number of people to the idea.  Some people have written me with their views on it, and I do not believe that these people are cranks.  I believe they have a genuine case to make.  I believe that the Minister, or anyone in the Minister's position, should have regard to the fears and arguments that undoubtedly exist in regard to this Bill, at any rate, in regard to the Bill in mandatory form.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be inclined to say: &ldquo;If I do make the Bill a permissive Bill, what guarantee have I that it will be operated by any local authority?&rdquo;  I do not believe the Minister will have any guarantee that it would be operated by local authorities and the fact that no such guarantee exists or could exist is one of the most telling arguments against a Bill of this nature.  However, if the Minister does make it permissive, individual local authorities will be able to ascertain more easily than the Minister can the views of those people in their own areas who will be affected.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister, a local authority or this House has any right to enforce this medication of the community through the means of the piped water supply.  If it is left to the various local authorities as a permissive measure, they can ascertain <Col N="165" /> whether or not their own communities want the scheme to be introduced.  The Minister has no way of knowing that because he is not, and cannot be, closely enough in touch with the local communities.  I would appeal to him to reconsider his attitude and to change the pattern of this Bill from mandatory Bill to permissive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Any proposal dealing with health matters which may offer a solution to problems affecting children or adults must be regarded by this House as of great importance and I am sure every Deputy will approach these problems in the manner that would be expected of him.</P>
      <P>In connection with the proposal before us, it is pertinent to draw the Minister's attention to some points so that we may have a clearer understanding as to whether the proposal is all that the Minister, on the advice of the consultative council and experts in far-away places, tells us it is or whether the doubts that exist in some people's minds are justified.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage, the Minister informed us that dental caries in children was more noticeable in countries with a high standard of living. Attention was drawn to the fact that this country was on a high plane in respect of the intake of food and the calorie value of food, that we were ahead of all countries in Western Europe and close to the American nation.</P>
      <P>If it is correct that it is in countries that enjoy a high standard of living that dental caries is more noticeable in children, it is important that we should know whether that problem will be solved by the addition of fluorine to water.  The consultative council considered that problem and the Minister has quoted experts of high standing from as far away as New Zealand, but it is important that we should try to get down to bedrock and discover definitely whether or not lack of fluorine in water is the cause of the disease or whether it is the excess use of certain foods in those countries with a high standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time, according to history, <Col N="166" /> when this country was not in such a happy position as regards diet. We do not have to go back as far as black '47.  We have reason to believe that thousands of our people died of starvation but I do not think history will show even one instance of a death from thirst in this country.  It seems that down through the years the water supply in this country has been plentiful. It is only lately that we have discovered that we are in the higher category, close to American standards, in respect of intake of calories per day and it is only since that discovery has been made that it is realised that the danger to children's teeth lies in the use of water which does not contain sufficient fluorine.</P>
    <P>That begs the question.  Did the consultative council and the other foreign experts consider the effect of lack of fluorine in the water supply and did they consider the results of the excessive use of foods which can be far more detrimental to children's health and to children's teeth than many people are prepared to admit?</P>
    <P>The people should be informed as to the extent that piped water supplies and the consumption of water by children have been the cause of the existing problem of dental caries and the extent to which dental caries is the result of excessive use of certain foods.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us of a number of thests carried out in cities, towns and a few villages.  That will not help us in solving the problem.  The results may have been sufficiently clear to those who want to implement the proposal in the Bill to justify their claims, but what of the very large areas throughout rural Ireland where there is no piped water supply and where the community depend on pumps or spring wells?  If the Minister insists on the use of compulsory powers to force local authorities to fluoridate piped water supplies, what will happen to the hundreds of thousands who still must depend on the local pumps or spring well?</P>
    <P>If this measure were of such importance to children up to the age of 14, surely the Minister would be prepared to tackle these problems or to <Col N="167" /> send the report back to the consultative council asking them to reconsider the position.  Why should it be that one section of the community, those who have piped water supplies, will benefit to the extent the Minister believes they will benefit, while no provision is made for those who have no piped water supply?  That may pose a problem for the advocates of fluoridation of water and it may be an argument for those who are against it.  I am not trying to base an argument to condemn the proposal but I cannot see how I could support such a proposal when the information I have suggested is required has not been given, either by the Minister or by anyone else concerned.</P>
    <P>The problem, as we have been told, is one in regard to school-going children. I shall not condemn the Minister by saying he is just rushing through this measure but did he ever give thought to what is the line of approach at lunch time of school-going children in the rural areas?  During the last few months because of all the discussion on this proposal I thought it my duty to re-examine it.  In many national schools in village areas I could see young boys some of whom carried a bottle of milk and bread and butter to school, many of them not bothering with milk but certainly none at all bothering with a drink of water.  The significant fact is that in over 90 per cent. of the cases I could see in the rural areas, where we are supposed to worry over the problem of dental caries, it was a question of the baker's loaf, the white loaf.  Again I have seen many children in the village areas who, having had their lunch and being lucky enough to have a few coppers in their pocket, would rush to the local sweet shop.  That is the pattern; the banker's loaf and then some form of lollipop or other sweets. That, of course, has not been happening in the rural areas where the school is not convenient to the sweet shop.  Surely the Health Council should inform the House through the Minister whether or not the lack of fluorine is the cause of dental decay or whether that is only one small <Col N="168" /> problem interconnected with other problems which may be far greater?</P>
    <P>We are being asked here to record our votes if necessary in favour of compelling local authorities to provide their share of the finances for the introduction of this measure, a measure which, in my opinion, has not been shown as the answer to dental caries.  I do not intend to go over all the ground covered previously.  Every Member knows the position in other countries.  We must be different, apparently, according to the Minister. It was not made compulsory in America.  In England they did try to get a few local Councils to act as volunteers or guinea pigs.  It is only here that compulsory powers are being taken even though we do not yet know whether these steps are even part of the answer to the problem.</P>
    <P>There is another problem to which I should like to draw attention.  If this measure goes through both Houses of the Oireachtas it will be mandatory on local authorities to add fluorine to piped water supplies. In some areas adjacent to some of our villages, for instance, in South Cork, where there are piped water supplies many farmers have availed of the opportunity of getting piped water for their cattle.  I do not wish to be an alarmist but we do not know one way or the other what will be the reaction in such instances.  I do not know whether it will have any effect but I know that the Minister did not say that the addition of fluorine would improve the teeth of cattle.  However, it must be admitted that a herd of cattle, to which a piped water supply is being made available by the local authority, will consume a great deal more of this new type of drinking water than the children of the whole parish would in perhaps four or five times as long a period.  From those points of view alone we should have much more information before being asked to support a measure of compulsion on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins mentioned the question of compulsion on the individual to use this type of water in future.  I agree with the views expressed <Col N="169" /> by Deputy O'Higgins in that respect.  The Minister may say that if the people of Ballyfermot, in Dublin, or of Spangle Hill in Cork, object to using such water&mdash;of course they cannot object to paying for it; they must pay their share of the water rate&mdash;they can get a few jugs and put them out under the down-pipe. That is hardly a suggestion that should be made in connection with any serious proposal in this House.</P>
    <P>Neither the Minister nor the Health Council has offered any alternative to this proposal.  What, for instance, is the possibility, where necessary, of providing tablets?  I suppose it would be rather strange to see the mother of a young family arriving at the office of some health authority in Cork or Dublin and asking an official for a packet of such tablets containing this important element for the benefit of children. Naturally the official would have to ask if she had a note from the doctor recommending the use of such tablets for her children.  However, in this proposal before us the doctor is not being consulted.  There is no such thing as a prescription making it available in suitable cases.  It is the very reverse.  It is a case of &ldquo;You drink the water containing flourine or do without it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely we are going a little too far. Surely if we believe in democracy, we should at least be more considerate as to whether or not we insist on the people adopting what we believe is for their good.  Who is to decide what is for their good?  After all, the medical profession are divided on this issue. The Minister cannot come in and say that the medical profession as a whole are for it, because some are against it. Is it for us as lay people to say: &ldquo;Oh, the Health Council recommended this to us and we are going to adopt it&rdquo;? This originated in America.  Many a good thing originated there and many a queer thing too.</P>
    <P>I remember when Parliamentary Questions were asked of Ministers and Governments if a certain element which was introduced into the bakers' <Col N="170" /> loaf for the purpose of colouring was good or bad in its effect on the people's health, but because it was being used in other countries, we had to use it. I am not condemning the Fianna Fáil Government because I remember the inter-Party Government saying the same thing: &ldquo;Everything is fine; it is a great help to the loaf and to the health and teeth of the children and to the health of the adults&rdquo;.  However, if it is discovered abroad that some such addition is wrong and if they scrap it eventually, we may come with the next rising tide and say that we are going to change.  Surely we should be more considerate in a matter which affects the health of the aged and the children.  Neither the Minister nor those advising him can claim to be infallible on this point and because of that, this matter should be reconsidered rather than forced on the members of the health authority to support the claims of Parliament if it goes through.</P>
    <P>At the start, I posed a question and I shall finish on the same note.  Have we any idea of the amount of water consumed by those whom we are supposed to be anxious to help?  Take the future.  If this proposal goes through in its present form and if the water supply here in Dublin must carry fluorine, does the Minister consider what amount of that water will be used for the purpose for which he believes he is introducing the Bill&mdash; the benefit of children?</P>
    <P>Take the ordinary family home.  I suppose if the man of the house is lucky enough to have a car and if he has time off to give it a wash, he will use water carrying fluorine and perhaps he will be proud of the fact that there is a better gloss on the car because of the addition of this wonderful element; or if he is lucky enough to have the old push bike, he will be able to wash the mud off the mudguards with fluorinated water.  Perhaps the Minister and I will smile in the mornings when we can clean our own dentures with water carrying fluorine. While spraying a plentiful supply of water on vegetables and gardens, the people will be happy to know that although they and the local authority <Col N="171" /> are paying a little more, they now have the wonderful advantage of fluorine in their gardens.</P>
    <P>Take the farmer who is living in a rural area where a piped water supply is available.  I am sure it will be a wonderful consolation to him, when spraying the potato crop with blue-stone or some other composition, to know that the water contains fluorine. In the towns or villages, if a man goes into a garage to have his car washed the garage man can proudly tell him that he is now in a position to give the car a better wash but that it will be a little more expensive because of the addition of fluorine to the water. Many of these problems can present themselves.  The man in the orchard need worry no more about decay, even though it may not be decay in fruit, because the Minister for Health is now going to supply him with water which will help to prevent decay in teeth.</P>
    <P>While all that is going on, have we even an approximate idea of the percentage of the total amount of water being used in Dublin, Cork or elsewhere which is being used by children, for whose benefit this Bill is intended, according to the Minister, the Health Council and all others who believe in this?  Surely there is no greater extravagance than to ask us to support a measure which could mean the squandering of money in all directions. We have not got the foggiest idea of what the intake of water per child will be.  At the same time, thousands of children going to the national schools in places where people must depend for their water supply on springs are not to get the advantage which the Minister is giving.</P>
    <P>I believe that while the wishes of those who object&mdash;and I say they are right in objecting to compulsory powers&mdash;must carry great weight. more important is the problem which confronts us in that we are asked to provide money from the people either through taxation or through rates&mdash;it is immaterial which&mdash;to give the children something which may be to their benefit, provided they use a sufficient <Col N="172" /> amount between the ages of four or five and 14.  We are told that after the age of 14, it will not have the desired effect.  That is the problem which I believe has not been answered by the Minister, the Health Council or by any body in America, England or New Zealand who favour such a measure.</P>
    <P>I consider it more important to have all these questions answered in a clear manner before I support the Minister with my vote and before it goes on record that I shall be prepared to compel the people to use this fluoridated water.  I could not be satisfied otherwise, and up to the present the Minister, in his attacks on those who oppose the measure, made no attempt whatever to prove his own argument.  He seemed more anxious to attack than to defend.  I am not asking him to defend himself but to make a clear statement in fairness to the House and to people outside this House who will have no say in this and who will have to accept the decision recorded here as to whether in the future they will be compelled to use a type of water that we do not really know is the answer to the problem of dental decay in children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall ask what are we dealing with in this Bill?  Two very simple but diametrically opposed things&mdash;the one, pure water and the other, a deadly poison.  Sodium fluoride is the main constituent of rat poison.  Go into any chemist's or hardware shop in this country or any other and buy any rat poison sold over the counter and you will find, if it contains an analysis, that one of the main constituents is in most cases sodium fluoride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is endeavouring in this Bill to introduce this poison listed as deadly in every pharmacopoeia that has ever been published into the pure water supply which we would think was the right of any person living in a modern democracy.  Dealing with the point of Deputy Desmond who queried whether or not dental caries was caused by the water people drink, of course it is not.  It is not a disease that is carried by water; it is not a <Col N="173" /> disease carried by anything.  It is not a communicable disease and for that reason, nobody has any right&mdash;no authority has any right and no State has any right&mdash;to impose compulsory medication on any person in respect of a disease which he cannot communicate to another.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that the integrity, the inviolability of the human body was something that was so well established that no Minister would ever dare to invade it but this Bill has no other purpose than that of deliberately and definitely, without any hope of avoiding it, invading the human body.</P>
    <P>The fact that the human body is supposed to be inviolable is recognised by the Minister in Section 6 in which, rather ironically, he says that nothing in the section relating to inspection shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any person to submit himself, or any person for whom he is responsible, to examination.  Under this Bill, the Minister preserves the integrity of the individual to the extent that he may not be compelled to submit to a casual examination, an examination not even of his whole body but merely of his mouth, of his teeth, for statistical purposes.  Any adult or any adult on behalf of a child who is in his control may object to that because the Minister feels the person has a right to object to medical inspection.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that was a lesser right than the right a person has not to have his body interfered with because some Minister or local authority or somebody else thought he ought to be given poison because some people think it might be good for his teeth.  Deputy Desmond illustrated his views with considerable accuracy, displaying intimate knowledge of the country and the ways of children.  He indicated how children so frequently purchase sweets, candy and goods that contain sugar and he queried whether that was one of the causes of the prevalence of dental caries.  Of course it is one of the causes of dental caries, but it is not because people drink pure water that people have dental caries. The two things are completely separate, <Col N="174" /> but what this Bill tries to say is that you may eat sweets and candy and sugar but we shall try to prevent any harm these may do by the fluoridation of the water supply, by compulsory medication.</P>
    <P>Would there not be an outcry, would not there be a march on the Custom House by women and children, if the Minister brought in a Bill making it an offence for children to eat sweets and candy because these would cause dental caries?  Would there not be an outcry if he sought to punish parents because they permitted children to eat sweets or sugar or candy?  Of course there would be, but this Bill has the same sense of compulsion, the same smell of dictatorship about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Read the Minister's own speech, his introductory statement, in which he says no person has a right to say that the public authority has no right to invade his person with poison.  He says a person has not such a right and that the public authority, be it the State or the local authority, alone has that right of telling a person what is good for him.  That, to my mind, is something which is highly objectionable and, as I said within the past 12 months in relation to another Bill before this House, even though the Minister with his majority may push the Bill through this House and the other House, there is another place in which the rights of the humblest individual in this land can be protected, and thank God for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should give the Minister one fact that he might like to use on his side of the argument&mdash;the fact that in the capital of the United States, Washington D.C., they have fluoridated the public water supply&mdash;but to set off <Col N="175" /> that fact which the Minister might like to quote, there is also the fact that in New York City, the second largest city in the world, and in Ottawa in Canada, the public authorities have refused to put sodium fluoride in the water supply.  I want to return to Washington, to the first citizen of that great city, the first citizen of the sovereign Republic of the United States, President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He is under medical orders not to drink the fluoridated water supply and he is provided with one gallon of pure water from a spring well every day because his medical advisers&mdash;the best medical advisers in the U.S.&mdash;believe that it would do harm to the first citizen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Chlorine is not a <Col N="176" /> poison in the way in which fluorine is.  Chlorine will not do harm to the system, and if any housewife or any individual wants to get rid of chlorine out of the public water supply, all he or she needs to do is to put on some water to boil, and the chlorine will boil off.  Fluorine cannot be boiled off.  It goes into the system and before I finish, I hope to indicate that there is a grave danger of its remaining in dangerous quantities in the systems of many people.</P>
      <P>I believe the life and health of the humblest citizen of the land is just as important as the life and health of the President of the United States of America.  We have a duty, which we must discharge, to see that we do not do any possible harm to any individual in this country, no matter what his or her wealth or status may be.</P>
      <P>While talking about the United States of America, perhaps I may refer to a leading article in the <i>Richmond News Leader</i>, the principal paper in Richmond city.  That paper referred some time ago&mdash;on Monday, 27th October, 1958, to be precise&mdash;to a recent court case in America in which a customer entered a dime store and barely had he stepped inside before a clerk sprayed him vigorously with an eau de cologne the store was promoting.  The customer got so mad he had the manager arrested, evidently on a charge of assault, and the case came on for trial.</P>
      <P>The store manager defended himself by saying this was not cheap perfume; it was high-class stuff.  Further, the cologne was bound to make the customer smell better, and even if he didn't like it, the customer would not be harmed by it.  The judge replied that in a free country, nobody has a right to spray anything on anybody without his consent, and he fined the manager.  Costs were awarded against him.</P>
      <P>This reputable newspaper went on to say this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...argument impresses us as sound, that the incident offers an <Col N="177" /> excellent analogy with the fluoridation of public water supplies.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Public Utilities adds a little eau de fluoride to the city's water supply, it is engaging in the same sort of infringement upon individual rights. The argument of the public health people is that this fluoride probably will make the children's teeth better, and anyhow, it can't hurt them. ...American judges seem not yet to have passed on the question of whether the practice deprives a citizen of his liberty without due process of law.</P>
    <P>This year the Supreme Court of the State of Missouri has decided that the fluoridation of public water supplies is contrary to the Constitution of Missouri and the Constitution of the United States of America.  We cannot lightly gloss over this aspect of the rights of the individual not to have medical treatment which he does not want forced upon him, particularly in respect of a disease which is not communicable. Any one of us could have every tooth in our head infected by dental caries and we could not communicate that disease to or inflict it on anyone else.  A person with dental caries does no harm to anyone else.</P>
    <P>If you introduce fluorine into the human body, you are, of course, doing it with a purpose and I acknowledge the Minister's purpose.  It is to prevent dental caries.  Statistical evidence has established that all fluoridated water supplies have succeeded in doing is postponing the onset of dental caries.  The available statistics, after 15 years, on the use of fluoridated water supplies&mdash;and I think it is pertinent to remember that this idea of the fluoridation of water supplies has been in operation for 15 years only&mdash;point to the fact that water supplies which have had fluorine put into them merely postpone the onset of dental caries, and it is also proved by statistics that fluorine in the system encourages the spread of dental caries, once it starts.</P>
    <P>For instance, in the city of St. David in Arizona, it has been shown that with fluorine in the water, the incidence of caries in children under 16 years is below the world average, but over 20 <Col N="178" /> years, it is abnormally high.  In the age group 20 to 41&mdash;and this is the city of St. David&mdash;50 per cent. have had all their teeth extracted because of dental caries.</P>
    <P>That is a statistic that could be repeated if I had at my disposal the means of collecting information the Minister ought to have at his disposal, and it is the kind of fact that ought to worry us with regard to whether or not we are doing right in this matter.  There is a clear indication that fluorine may postpone dental caries where children are concerned, but once it has set in, its degree is worse than we would otherwise have.  I do not know what the statistics of dental caries are in this country for the age group 20 to 41 years, but somehow I doubt very much if it is as high as 50 per cent., the percentage in cities where fluorine has been introduced into the water.</P>
    <P>The purpose of putting fluorine into the water supply is to provide the children with stronger teeth.  It is a chemical which helps to make teeth stronger.  It provides stronger enamel; it makes the outer covering of the teeth stronger; but it is a fact that has been clinically established&mdash;and certainly not clinically disestablished&mdash;that once a tooth that has been subjected to a water supply containing sodium fluoride goes, you cannot save it.  There is practically no such thing as filling teeth which have developed with a water supply containing fluorine. For people who have a dread of getting their teeth filled, there might be something to be said for flouride in the water supply, but I think it is better to have your natural teeth, even though they may be filled.  With flouride in the water supply, the situation is that once your tooth goes bad at all, it collapses because it cannot be filled. One of the effects of sodium flouride is to make teeth brittle, so brittle that they cannot be filled.  The outer covering of teeth produced by the intake of sodium flouride is analogous to the Maginot Line.  It was stated by experts that France was safe for all time because it had an outer shell, or skin, which could not be penetrated.  Sodium flouride helps to provide a strong skin up to the age of 16 or 18, but dental <Col N="179" /> caries have other ways of getting in and, once in, the teeth collapse as the Maginot Line collapsed with disastrous consequences for humanity.</P>
    <P>All these things have been clinically established.  They have not received from the Minister, from his Department, or from the council the consideration they should have received, remembering the very eminent men who have proved the facts conclusively.  Deputy Desmond said to-night he was not an alarmist.  I want to be an alarmist.  I think it is my duty to do what the Minister and the council have not done.  I think it is my duty to warn the people of the possible consequences of flouridation of their water supplies.</P>
    <P>It has been clinically established that there is a relationship between the intake of sodium fluoride and cancer. It has been clinically established, of course, that there is a relationship between the consumption of nicotine and various other drugs and cancer.  I do not say that sodium fluoride is the sole cause of cancer.  It has not definitely been stated that other things are definitely the cause of cancer, but we all hope that there will be a break through in the barrier of ignorance which surrounds this dreadful disease. Would it not be pathetic, to say the least of it, if we were to embark upon schemes of compulsory medication which might increase the incidence of cancer?</P>
    <P>It has been clinically established and, so far as I know, not contradicted, that the intake of sodium fluoride encourages rheumatism, arthritis, and other bone diseases.  One of the peculiar characteristics of fluorine is that it attaches itself to bones, making them stiff and brittle.  If a person consumes fluoridated water over 50 years, or more, that will affect his general bone structure.  I am not a doctor, but I think it is too much to expect anyone to believe that you can take sodium fluoride for the good of your teeth and that it will not have any adverse effects on other organs. Of course, it will.  One of the disadvantages of sodium fluoride is that it drives out calcium, which is one of the <Col N="180" /> main constituents of bone structure. Yet, the Minister now wants the Irish people to take fluorine day after day, despite the fact that not the strongest supporters of the fluoridation of water can yet say what the effect of the intake of this dreadful poison will be after 15 years, 15 years being the term of experience that people have in relation to the fluoridation of water.</P>
    <P>It has been clinically established that sodium fluoride lodges in the breasts of pregnant women.  It has been clinically established that natural milk contains very little fluorine at all and, if it does contain fluorine, it is because it has been introduced into the milk from some outside source. Has sufficient consideration been given to the effect of the fluoridation of water upon pregnant women and unborn children?  I feel sufficient consideration has not been given to this aspect.  It is an appalling thought that the fluoridation of public water supplies may have an adverse effect upon generations yet unborn.</P>
    <P>It has been established that there is a direct relationship between some kidney and liver diseases and sodium fluoride.  It is also known that there is a higher incidence of mental disease in communities consuming water supplies which have been fluoridated.  All these things have been published in reputable publications.  These facts have been brought to the notice of those in authority in other countries. We have a fear that the case for the fluoridation of our water supplies is not being put over from purely unselfish motives.  On the other hand, those who have been voicing justifiable fears find their voices drowned in the great clamour that has arisen in certain quarters for the fluoridation of water supplies.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of introducing repeated doses of sodium fluoride into the human system is to build up an ever-increasing amount of this poison in the human system.  Children up to the middle teens have a greater capacity for getting rid of poisons than have older people.  I think the Minister will agree with me that it is accepted by the medical profession generally that whatever amounts of <Col N="181" /> sodium fluoride are not needed by the teeth will be passed out of the system in the ordinary way by young children. Older people have not the same capacity.  Their ability to rid their systems of poison depends upon many things.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to be worried about the children.  I am afraid we are worried about them only until they reach their middle teens.  We are giving no serious consideration to what their plight will be 50, 60 or 70 years hence, after they have spent a lifetime imbibing sodium fluoride. Nature has its own way of getting rid of poisons.  As people grow older, the ability diminishes.  If we violate nature and artificially introduce poison into the human system, we will compel the organs which normally rid the system of poison to work overtime. The danger is then that senile decay will set in much earlier.  The overworked organs, when a person reaches middle age, will not be able to get rid of the poisonous substance in the system.  It is known, too, that there is a direct relationship between sodium fluoride and clinical diseases.  To a great extent, we have in recent centuries conquered many diseases, but there are some chronic diseases and the most the medical profession have been able to do so far is to relieve the pain.</P>
    <P>We are now asked by the Minister deliberately to introduce a substance which it is feared by those who know best will have a damaging effect upon people suffering from chronic diseases.  I do not make these statements lightly.  These are facts I have gleaned from material written and put on record by some of the most eminent medical man in the world.  I said I feared that those in favour of the fluoridation of water supplies have a selfish reason.  It is not a conclusion one likes to reach lightly. It is pertinent to point out that one of the leading propagandists for the fluoridation of water supplies is a member of a family who are the largest producers in the world of the equipment and material.  I venture to suggest that whatever motives or approach I might have in relation to the matter, there is a chance I might <Col N="182" /> be a little more objective than the person who has made millions out of the fluoridation of water supplies.</P>
    <P>Who has benefited from the fluoridation of water supplies?  Children and children alone will benefit.  We are glad mankind thinks there is some way of relieving children of dental caries, but it has not been proved that it is of any ultimate benefit, because the incidence of dental caries is just as heavy in the 20's and 30's as it was in communities before the water supply was fluoridated.</P>
    <P>Apart from the point of principle, on which I took my first stand and on which I shall stand to the end, I believe the danger of creating any of the diseases I have mentioned in any person is such as not to justify the short-term beneficial effect the fluoridation of water supplies may have on children.  It is short-term, because the most those who support the scheme can prove&mdash;it is one thing to suggest but another thing to prove &mdash;is a delay in the onset of dental caries.  I do not think that matters very much.  The only people who, on balance, can benefit by the fluoridation of water supplies are those who die between the ages of one and 15 years and who die without getting dental caries.  If they live long enough, and most of us do, they will get dental caries.  Therefore, it is hardly worth all this expense, worry, invasion of human rights and risk in relation to these dreadful diseases.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by propagandists for the fluoridation of water supplies that the incidence of any of these possible diseases and afflictions I have mentioned would not be any greater than one in 10,000.  One may feel we are justified in the fluoridation of water supplies if the risk is as small as one in 10,000.  I would refer the House to the case against fluoridation by Dr. Robert Newton, Director of the Alberta Research Council and President of the University of Alberta.  In dealing with this argument, he points out that it may be useful to remember in this connection that the average morbidity rate for poliomyelitis is under one in 10,000 and that mortality is under one in 100,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> We are spending any amount of effort, any amount of money and displaying any amount of publicity calling on people to have their children treated against the dreadful disease of poliomyelitis which strikes only one in 10,000.  We are being asked, at the same time, to spend public money and effort to lend our names to this Bill which deliberately is introducing a poisonous substance into the human system which certainly has the chance of inflicting one person in 10,000 with the dreadful diseases I have mentioned. That happens to represent 300 persons in Ireland.  I do not think it is a justifiable risk.</P>
    <P>I do not think it justifiable to undertake the risk of subjecting 300 people to cancer, rheumatism, arthritis, kidney and liver disorders, mental diseases and unduly early senile decay.  I am sorry these matters have not been brought to the attention of the Irish people.  Before the Minister asks any local authority to fluoridate water supplies, he has a duty to see to it that public opinion in Ireland is informed on these very vital facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke of a mother going to some local authority and asking for fluorine tablets.  It is not such a strange idea.  The Waterworks Department and the Health Department of New York City have rejected the fluoridation of the water supply. They also point out that the cost of providing sodium fluorine in tablet form to the people who might benefit by it&mdash;children from one to 16 years of age&mdash;would be one-fifth of the cost of fluoridating the water supply of New York City.</P>
    <P>I do not know if any costing examination has been carried out in this country.  Whatever the cost, it would be better to supply fluorine in tablet form for children who would benefit from it than to compel all Irish people, no matter what their age, to risk danger to their health by taking fluorine in their water supplies.  It may be argued that there would be no way of controlling parents and children, that you might supply them with the tablets but that they might not take them.  There are other supplies which <Col N="184" /> we provide for the good of children but we have to respect parental rights and human dignity in relation to them. We must do the same here.</P>
    <P>It might be said it would be dangerous to provide fluorine in tablet form lest children should take too much at any one time.  People who can speak with more authority than I assert it is possible to make up these tablets with some other substance so that if children take more than one at a time they will vomit up the poison.  It would seem far wiser to do that.  There would not be much risk involved and it would cost a great deal less, according to the costings for New York City. It would not cost as much as or any more than the cost of fluoridating our different water supplies, which the Minister suggests.</P>
    <P>It might be said that consideration should be given to the provision of fluorine in sweets.  However, objections will be raised that it is difficult to control the intake of fluorine if we put it into sweets or attach it to any material substance.</P>
    <P>I support the arguments put forward by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Desmond.  They pointed out that there was no such thing as the average intake of water.  It would be unwise to suggest that the average intake of this poisonous substance will only be a certain figure which will not be damaging. There will be people above that average who will run great risks. There will be ladies who will drink pints of water for the good of their complexions.  There will be labourers who do manual work in the open air who will drink water by the gallon or, if they do not drink water, will drink beer which has been made from fluoridated water supplies.</P>
    <P>These are things which even the Minister cannot overlook.  There is no way of controlling the amount which any particular individual will drink.  I always understood, in relation to medical prescriptions, that the important thing was to go to a doctor who prescribed the precise amount of any poisonous substance or toxic ingredient which was good for the particular individual he examined.  Here we shall not have examined the people before we compel them to take a <Col N="185" /> certain amount of sodium fluoride.  We do not know in advance whether it will have a bad effect on one and not on another.  We shall not know until it is too late.</P>
    <P>The Minister provides only for a visual examination of people's mouths to see whether or not so many of the 32 teeth are affected by dental caries. There is no provision for any examination beforehand at public expense to decide what would be the maximum amount of fluoridated water supplies a person could safely take.  We have other schemes of public medicine.  We have our public X-ray unit.  We have our blood donation unit and we have other medical schemes where we assist people until we know what is good for them or what is good, bad or indifferent for them.  The Minister proposes to make them consume it.  That is a very bad thing.</P>
    <P>Another point which, I think, should be mentioned is that if we fluoridate water supplies we do not end there. It has been clinically established that if you boil a head of cabbage, a cauliflower, carrots; any fruit, or even meat, in water, fluoride, because of its nature &mdash;I mentioned this previously&mdash;will attach itself to the vegetables, fruit or meat.  It will be taken out of the water and put into the fruit.  Where do we stand then in relation to people who eat a lot of vegetables or fruit or drink a lot of water?  We have heard of the person who consumes these things only in small quantities but there is no way of measuring it or being definite about it.  On that account I think it is national suicide to compel the Irish people to take sodium fluoride when mankind in all other countries in the world do not yet know what the reaction of human beings in certain cases will be to this poison.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted New Zealand and Sweden as examples of countries which had accepted fluoridated water supplies.  In the United States of America, where this idea first developed and where it was first put into practice, 60 million citizens, free, independent, proud citizens of that great land of liberty, voted against the <Col N="186" /> fluoridation of water supplies.  Sixty million people, when given the chance, said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Forty-two million in the United States have fluoridated water supplies and only six per cent. of those were given the opportunity of a referendum to decide whether or not they would have fluoridated water supplies. There were more millions in the United States&mdash;I think 48 million was the maximum at any one time who had fluoridated water supplies&mdash;who either threw it out by referendum&mdash; and here let our local councillors be warned&mdash;or got rid of the local authority, the councillors, the mayors and their chairmen.</P>
    <P>I state bluntly that if an issue were made of this thing the Irish people would welcome the opportunity of a referendum and I am certain that they would throw it out with a mighty &ldquo;No&rdquo; because 94 per cent. of the people in all the countries in the world, who had an opportunity of voting on this issue, have voted against the fluoridation of water supplies.  The people have a right in connection with this matter but the Minister is trying to take that right away by forcing a Bill of this nature through the Dáil and the other House, although there are many members of his own Party who do not wish this Bill to be enacted.  Many of the others do not know anything about it and more is the shame on them in relation to a matter of such very grave importance.</P>
    <P>We shall swing now to Sweden to which the Minister also referred.  In December, 1958, this issue was debated in the Swedish Parliament and the Swedish Parliament decided not to go ahead with the proposal to permit general fluoridation of water supplies. In New Zealand to which the Minister also refers, in November, 1959, just 12 months ago, the people in eight out of eight referenda voted against the fluoridation of water supplies.  The Minister could have invited the people at the local elections last June to decide this matter but he failed to discharge the simple obligation of allowing the people to decide whether or not they wanted a particular medical treatment or otherwise.  It is the height of audacity for him to come to this <Col N="187" /> House and hope in the ignorance of the House and the people of Ireland to push through this Bill&mdash;a Bill, which if carried into law, would create havoc in some quarters and would be grossly unfair to some people.</P>
    <P>The beneficial effects of sodium flouride have been mentioned.  I do not doubt them in relation to teen-age children.  What has not been mentioned is another direct and known consequence of the fluoridation of water supplies and that is the mottling of teeth, the discolouration of teeth, the appearance of spots on the teeth and the ultimate decay of the teeth.  I think our women and our men, too, like to have decent sets of teeth in their head.  One of the most definite effects of the fluoridation of water supplies is to create mottled teeth in from ten to 20 per cent. of the population.  Here we are postponing one dental disease for a period of a couple of years at most, perhaps, from 16 to 18 years of age.  That is all we can hope to do with the fluoridation of water supplies, but as sure as we stand here so long as mankind continues to eat sweets and substances of a sugary content, you are going to have dental caries until mankind finds some other cure besides the fluoridation of water supplies.  If you put sodium fluoride in water you will get from ten to 20 per cent. of our people suffering from mottled teeth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in view of the present serious unemployment position and the certainty that unemployment will increase still further during the winter months, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should make money immediately available to local authorities for the relief of unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the figures supplies to us by the Government there are at present 40,018 persons registered as unemployed. At the beginning, I should <Col N="188" /> say that this represents a reduction in the registered unemployed compared with a similar period last year or the year before that.  However, I do not think that because there has been a slight reduction compared with those two years, the Government should be complacent about the question of unemployment. As a matter of fact, I think they should be concerned about the increase that is even now taking place from week to week.  This increase is demonstrated by the fact that in two short weeks there has been a rise in the number of unemployed to the extent of 1,000 persons and, if the figures are to follow the usual trend, this increase of 1,000 per week will continue until some time in the Spring.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of the position as far as unemployment is concerned is further demonstrated by the fact that the number of registered unemployed represents six per cent. of the insured persons in the country.  Six per cent. is a pretty high percentage and represents four or five times the number of persons who are unemployed in Great Britain.  I should say that I do not intend to refer at any length&mdash; maybe not at all&mdash;to the position in, Great Britain <i>vis-á-vis</i> Ireland, as far as unemployment and employment is concerned, but I do want to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary that, while we have 40,000 odd unemployed at present, the position will become worse and worse as we go on into winter until, as I said before, we come to the early spring.</P>
    <P>Of course, we shall be told this is a seasonal increase, and this has come to be accepted by members of the House as a normal thing.  The plain fact remains, however, that there will be an increase in the number of people who cannot find employment, and I should like to demonstrate what this seasonal increase means.  I want to refer to the figures for unemployment in August, 1959, and in January, 1960.  In August, 1959, there were 45,300 persons registered as unemployed, who were fit for work, who were willing to work, who were available for work and who could not get <Col N="189" /> employment.  In January, 1960, that figure had risen to 74,300 persons, representing an increase of 29,000 people.  Now, I appreciate that there is a seasonal change in the unemployment figures, but I do not see why we should accept it as being the normal thing, that we should have so many people unemployed, a relatively small number in a particular month of the year and an increase in that number of 20,000, 25,000 or 30,000 five or six months later.</P>
    <P>Employment, as all of us would want it to be, is employment for 12 months of the year, and I believe we have far too much of what is described as seasonal employment. Some people are satisfied when they know that a certain number of workers have obtained six, nine or ten months' employment during the year, but the people who find themselves unemployed for one, two, and in some cases six months of the year, must find it pretty hard to live, and I do not think we should be satisfied with the explanation, or retort, that this is seasonal, that we must accept it because it has been accepted down through the years as being seasonal, and that there is nothing abnormal about it.</P>
    <P>There has been a note of complacency in the speeches of the Taoiseach during the last few years in regard to the question of employment, and I know that the Parliamentary Secretary, when he speaks in this debate, will tell me there were so many unemployed in 1957, 1956, 1955 and 1954.  That may be all right to secure a political point but I am concerned with what the Government are willing to do and can do in order to alleviate the position of tens of thousands of people who will find themselves unemployed in the coming winter months.  Certainly I, for one, cannot understand a recent statement of the Taoiseach who said that we now only need 50,000 new jobs.  Before he was elected a member of this Government he said that 100,000 jobs were needed, but two or three years afterwards that figure has been cut to 50,000, and where 50,000 people got employment in this country in the meantime I fail to see.  From the figures <Col N="190" /> published by the Government themselves, and from my own experience of the country in general, it does not seem to be the case that 50,000 new jobs have been provided.</P>
    <P>Again, let me say that while there has been some improvement in the employment position as indicated by the figures, at the same time it seems to me that the number of registered unemployed has been cut by certain devices deliberately employed by the Government and, in that reduction, the Minister for Social Welfare has played a very prominent part.  Deputies must admit that in their own constituencies and localities they know well there is a stringent and sometimes unfair application of the regulations by the Minister for Social Welfare to those persons who, in normal circumstances, would qualify for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The reply from the Minister for Social Welfare or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is: &ldquo;That is all right.  Even though they are not eligible to receive unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, they may register as being unemployed.&rdquo;  But he knows, as I and every Deputy know, that the majority of those who do not receive unemployment benefit or assistance do not register as being unemployed and hope to find employment through the employment exchanges.  The plain fact is that, apart from relief workers, there are very few who get employment through the labour exchanges.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figures were again cut down by the action of the Minister for Social Welfare in extending the Employment Period Order, thereby depriving many men, particularly those in rural areas, of being eligible for unemployment benefit or assistance during particular months of the year.  Again, the majority of those did not bother to register as being unemployed.</P>
    <P>The third and most important cause for what seems to be a reduction in the number of registered unemployed is emigration.  I see from to-day's <i>Cork Examiner</i> that the Taoiseach, speaking at the Dublin Chamber of <Col N="191" /> Commerce last night, referred at length to the problem of emigration.  I shall not say it is the first time he expressed concern about it because that would be an injustice.  I notice that in part of his speech he said:</P>
    <P>Our concern ought express itself in a more effective way than a futile deploring of the situation and in resolutions calling for somebody else to do something about it, which seems to be the most usual kind of public reference to it.</P>
    <P>In other portions of his speech he admits, contrary to what is said by other spokesmen of the Fianna Fáil Party, that emigration is still going on at the same pace as it has been for the past five, ten or fifteen years.  The figures published by the Taoiseach's Department indicate that such is the case.</P>
    <P>The passenger movement figures, in regard to sea transport only, indicate that net emigration for the year ended June, 1960, was over 40,000.  The Taoiseach says that figures are not accurate and that we can only judge the extent of emigration when we have the final figures of the Census of Population which is to be taken some time next year.  However, on very many occasions he has quoted figures for emigration on the basis of passenger movement between this country and Great Britain and other countries.  The fact is that 40,000 people emigrated in the twelve months ended June, 1960.  I do not say all these people were adults or were people who wanted employment, but I do say that the vast majority of them were people who for various reasons, mainly economic, had to leave this country to seek a better living abroad.</P>
    <P>The natural increase in the population here is usually reckoned at about 25,000 persons per annum.  I do not know whether that has declined or not.  However, when one has regard to these two figures, they indicate that the population is declining and declining rapidly.  That figure of 40,000 emigrants during the twelve months ended June, 1960, indicates that the number of registered unemployed has been <Col N="192" /> decreased, not by the provision of more jobs by the Government but by the fact that 40,000 of our people had to emigrate to Great Britain or elsewhere. It is admitted that population is the touch-stone of success for any economic policy pursued by this or any other Government.  Many reasons are given as to why people emigrate&mdash; economic reasons, lack of employment, insecurity.  Many people will tell you that the vast majority of those who emigrate need not do so at all.  I do not believe that.</P>
    <P>There are no statistics to show why people leave this country but we all know from our own experience as public representatives why people leave Donegal, Wexford, Cork, Dublin and, in particular, the western counties. We hear stories about so-and so who left a good job.  I know one man who emigrated to Great Britain about two months ago.  He had a reasonably good job&mdash;he was a vanman&mdash;but you could not say he took home a big wage packet every week.  His problem was this.  He was a man of about 45 years of age.  He had six children who were coming to the stage where they had to obtain employment in order that the family might have a decent standard of living.  He was required to emigrate because he could not start his children in their first jobs and he had to seek refuge in England to find for his children the opportunities he could not find in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another reason people emigrate is because of the insecurity of many jobs here.  The road worker who obtains nine months' employment during the year cannot be said to have a permanent job.  He may be able to provide for himself and his family for nine months of the year but it is no consolation for him to be told that for the other three months he can draw unemployment benefit.  The rate of unemployment benefit he would obtain, no matter how large a family he had, would not be sufficient to allow him enjoy the standard of living he would have if he had a job for twelve months. In this country we are too prone to think that men should be satisfied when they get some employment during the <Col N="193" /> year.  There is a lack of employment for many of those who have been forced to emigrate and who, in turn, have cut down the number of registered unemployed.</P>
    <P>I heard the Taoiseach, in speeches before the adjournment of the Dáil for the Summer recess, try to prove that there are more people in employment at the present time than there were a year or two or three or four years ago. As far as we can judge, again from statistics produced by the Taoiseach's Department, there are approximately 50,000 fewer people employed in this country than there were four years ago. It is true that the number employed in transportable goods industries in June last was 3,000 higher than the number so employed in June, 1959.  In June, 1959, the number was 155,774; in June, 1960, it was 158,926.  There was an improvement of 3,000.  The Taoiseach and the Government can take their due meed of credit for that improvement in that sector.</P>
    <P>One might say&mdash;although not from any statistics recently published&mdash; that there has been an increase in the number of building workers compared with last year.  I do not think that there has been an increase as compared with four, five or six years ago, but compared with last year, I suppose there has been an increase although I have no figures to substantiate that statement.  I think there has been an increase in the number of building workers due to the fact that reasonably generous grants have been given and people have been facilitated, especially in the reconstruction of houses and various improvements to hotels and other buildings.</P>
    <P>But if we give credit to the Government for the provision of 3,000 extra jobs in that sector we must refer to the grave decline in employment in other sectors, especially agriculture.  Again there is no point in saying that this is a transitional stage, that people all over Europe and the world are leaving the land, that according as machinery is introduced there is less work for men.  That is not a solution to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="194" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact.  If I become bald, it is a tragedy while it may be a fact.  It is no solution to say to people who are leaving Dún Laoghaire or Rosslare <i>en route</i> to Birmingham, London or Fishguard that it is a fact that fewer people are needed on the land.  They are Irishmen and it is the Government's duty to provide opportunities for employment, to create conditions for employment for them.  We cannot afford to lose many more of them.</P>
      <P>There has been a grave decline in the number employed in the agricultural industry, not this year or last year, but continued over the last six decades.  The Government must have regard to the fact that men have become disemployed even though in the transportable goods sector there has been an increase of 3,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>The Government pledged themselves to provide employment.  When they announced that they would get husbands back to work they did not say, &ldquo;We do not mean agricultural workers.&rdquo;  Their slogans which were plastered on walls throughout the country did not imply that.  They meant everybody.</P>
      <P>We must not disregard the fact that in Coras Iompair Éireann at the present time there are 1,000 fewer employees than there were this time last year.  Those who were disemployed got compensation.  Some people said that it was generous compensation in respect of some of them.  It was not the compensation that fulfilled their need, especially in the case of family men.  The compensation these men needed was employment at a similar rate of pay to that which they had been receiving in Coras Iompair Éireann.  The increase of 3,000 jobs in the transportable goods sector is immediately reduced by the 1,000 disemployed in C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Electricity Supply Board's rural electrification scheme there has been a decline in employment.  I do not blame the Government for that. The programme is coming to an end and we cannot increase the lighting of the country <i>ad infinitum.</i>  However, if the Parliamentary Secretary wants <Col N="195" /> facts, the fact is that there has been a grave decline in employment in Córas Iompair Éireann and the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>There is another matter.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach was well intentioned or not or whether he was trying to pull a trick or not.  There were references to it to-day at Question time.  There was a graver situation, let me admit, in the matter of unemployment about 18 months or two years ago and the Taoiseach was concerned about it&mdash;at least he said he was and proposed to do something about it.  In an effort to reduce the number of registered unemployed he thought he would enlist the aid of the local authorities. He sent a circular to each local authority. The circular was sent to borough corporations, corporations, county councils, urban councils and town commissioners, asking them to submit schemes which they believed to be worthwhile and for the public good, stating that the Government would consider those schemes and that any that they regarded as worthwhile they would finance in an effort to provide employment.  What happened?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance know of any one that was sanctioned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of them related to Schemes that had already been undertaken and for which very generous grants were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Fán nóimeat.  The county councils went to some expense. They held special meetings to consider what might be done in response to the Taoiseach's circular.  They had to consider proposals received from their officials.  Their engineers were sent around the functional area of the local authority.  County councillors were asked to suggest schemes.  Schemes were submitted in dozens from each county and they have been there for the last 18 months.  I am referring to new schemes for which the Taoiseach asked.  I do not know in what Department they are lying&mdash;the Taoiseach's Department, the Department of Finance or the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> Again, it was only a trick, so much whitewash.  It was an effort by the Taoiseach to convince people that something would be done but nothing was done.  I heard the Minister for Finance saying that the schemes were not of an economic nature.  Does anybody know of many schemes that could be submitted by a local authority that would be of an economic nature&mdash;amenity schemes such as the building of houses, roads and all that sort of thing?</P>

      <P>Therefore can more money not be made available to provide employment for the people who are now registered as unemployed and to cope with the increase that will undoubtedly take place in the next five or six months?  I would urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary in turn to urge his colleagues in the other Departments to speed up the Departmental machinery and the procedure for the approval of many of the schemes sent up in response to the Taoiseach's circular but which have been lying in the Department for years and years.  I may be too late in this as far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned.  I did not see the actual circular, but the Minister for Local Government referred today to the one he sent to the local authorities and which in effect gives them permission to go ahead with the building of houses without the same sort of strict approval and searching inquiry on which he insisted up to about a month ago.  In holding up a circular like that the Minister for Local Government has been responsible for some emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be too local on this motion, but the Parliamentary Secretary and other Deputies did hear me imploring the Minister for Local Government to sanction the building of a scheme of houses in my own constituency.  He protested that they did not want the houses; he tried to get them to change the method of building the houses and to change the designs.  He asked all sorts of questions in an effort to hold up the building <Col N="198" /> of these houses to such an extent that he was responsible for the emigration of a certain number of tradesmen and quite a number of builders' labourers.  Now he seems to have had second thoughts and recently he sent out a circular which said in effect to the local authority: &ldquo;Do what you like as far as the building of houses is concerned.&rdquo;  It is a little too late, not alone from the point of view of employment, but from the point of view of the provision of houses.  There are areas where houses are required, but the building operatives are not there to build them because the Minister for Local Government held up sanction so long that the tradesmen could not wait.  They had to provide for themselves, for their wives and their children and they had to seek employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I believe expenditure to keep Irishmen at home is worthwhile.  Many people have sneered in this House from time to time at what they like to call the provision of relief work.  If it keeps Irishmen at home it is worth while.  We hear a lot of talk about the efforts to establish industry around Shannon Airport.  I do not know what success has attended their efforts but the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce appear to be confident that we are undergoing an industrial revival, if not an industrial revolution, and one would get the impression that factories, if not going up now, will be erected very shortly. If that is the case, if the Taoiseach and members of the Government, and especially the Minister for Industry and Commerce, have confidence in this revolution, if they are confident that we will have the factories, whether of German, Japanese or any other origin; they should try to ensure the workers will be here to man the factories.</P>
    <P>Emphasis in recent years has been on the expenditure of State moneys for works of a productive nature.  I do not disagree with making grants to the agricultural industry towards greater production.  I know that will have a two or three-fold result.  Employment of men on making a road or on other <Col N="199" /> such work may not have many results. It may have only the one result, that of giving employment.  However, it may also have the result of keeping men in this country.</P>
    <P>Even though this Government have been in office for twenty-two or twenty-three years I do not hold them entirely responsible for emigration but the Government should try to ensure that we will not lose many more people.  For that reason they should make more money available to keep these people employed for twelve months of the year.  They may say they are bound by certain regulations as to the amount of money they may give to local authorities for winter relief schemes.  It has been reduced all over the country this year because the figure for the register of unemployed shows a reduction.  Even though that is the type of employment which has been given for the past 20 or 30 years, it does not do a lot of good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if it keeps many at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not keep many at home but if the Government provided employment for these men for twelve months of the year they would be kept at home.  It is no consolation for a man to get employment for six weeks.  It is like throwing a crust to a hungry dog to keep the pain out of his belly for six weeks.  He will get it for the other 46 weeks.  Whatever economists or the members of the Government may say, if we are to display confidence in our ability to improve industry and agriculture we should be prepared to provide money to keep men in employment all the year around and thus keep them at home.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this motion because, even though I have no confidence that if this motion was implemented it would make much difference, it gives us an opportunity to warn the Government <Col N="200" /> once more of the desperate position that obtains in rural Ireland to-day. While I was listening to Deputy Corish I could hardly believe the callous approach of the Parliamentary Secretary. It was almost unbelievable that he would be so ill-equipped with facts and figures as to what was taking place in rural Ireland, in view of the vast machinery at his disposal, as a member of the Government, to obtain those facts.  I do not know why the Parliamentary Secretary was selected to take this motion; presumably, it is because he is acting on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  That being the case&mdash;I presume it is&mdash;I feel that the motion, without any disrespect to the Parliamentary Secretary, should have the attention of the Minister for Finance himself.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that good news is on the way, that a number of schemes sent forward by local authorities and other interested groups are being examined and will receive sanction at some unknown date in the future.  To a great extent, we know what lists of proposals were submitted and it is no use fooling ourselves that these proposals, even if they are sanctioned, will make any real impact on the unemployment and emigration situation.  Undoubtedly such proposals as that for the development, the growing and processing of fruit and vegetables, are ones which there should be no delay implementing, but I have been listening for the past 18 months to news items and I have heard various public people telling us that this processing of fruit and vegetables was about to be started.  So far, in the west, at any rate, which is the area where that business should be concentrated, we have seen little signs of progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To meet the situation obtaining in rural Ireland today, we need a lot more than this motion implies.  We need a planned organisation of all the rural areas.  We want to see development taking place on an organised basis, so that the small farmer and the worker will not be subject to the ups and downs of a market as they are at the moment, and the produce of the small holdings will be paid for at a reasonable <Col N="201" /> price and on a stable basis.  At the same time, we want to see a situation in which the worker will get continuous employment and not, as at the moment, three or six months' work in the year and is then thrown on the labour market for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>It is not difficult to understand why a great deal of emigration takes place. The best elements in rural areas are not prepared to hang around week after week in the hope of getting a fortnight's or three weeks' work.  The main thing required amongst the people of rural Ireland today, and indeed elsewhere, is security, with a good living wage.  Both are absent, except in so far as the organised groups of the community are concerned.  It all boils down to the fact that no real effort has been made in the past 40 years to develop our natural resources and build our industries on what we have here, namely, our own raw materials which are in the ground.</P>
    <P>We appear to have an inferiority complex with regard to the raw materials available in our own country.  We appear to have a slave mentality in that gentlemen from Germany, Japan, France, America and elsewhere receive more attention and greater respect than the Irishman who is prepared to help.  We are more willing to spend Irish money on helping some foreigner to come in and set up an industry than to pour that Irish money into a State concern, which would organise the particular industry right from the raw material stage until the finished product was available for the market.  The producer is exploited to the limit, so far as prices are concerned.  We know that these people with control of the market can manipulate to their hearts' content and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I feel that the Deputy is getting away from the motion, which deals specifically with the question of financial assistance to local authorities.  It does not open up a complete debate on the whole question of industrial progress in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that. <Col N="202" /> I feel that since the motion was put down, the situation has become so serious that it would be impossible to deal with it within the terms of the motion.  However, I propose to stay within the limits of the motion. The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the erection of swimming pools had been proposed by local authorities and that there are grants available.  That is desirable, but I also feel that other proposals of a more important nature were made by several local authorities and that so far these proposals have been given a deaf ear.</P>
      <P>For instance, I will point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that Roscommon County Council and other councils have requested and urged the Government to restore the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That was enacted to allow local authorities to undertake very important minor drainage schemes in order to relieve flooded lands and make those lands fit for production.  It is heartbreaking at the moment, in my constituency, at any rate, to see excellent land covered with water.  That has been the case through the summer up to the present. It is little consolation to the small farmers, who were put to the pin of their collars, even with that land in good shape, to make a living from it, to know that the Government are prepared to make a lot of money available for the setting up of industries based on raw materials from abroad and for the construction of swimming pools in small towns.</P>
      <P>Our sense of priorities is slightly mixed, I fear, when it comes to deciding what is of first importance in the rural areas.  There is no use in telling a small farmer that you want him to produce more if you do not make the money available to him to put his land in suitable condition so that greater production can be obtained. When I hear on the wireless the nauseating appeals of this Taoiseach and of the gentleman now &ldquo;wired in&rdquo; above in the Park&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall restrain myself.  When I listen to the appeals made by these gentlemen over the years for more production from the agricultural community, I find that, if more is produced, no attempt whatever is made by the people making the appeals to see that there is a market and to prevent exploitation of the producers.</P>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell us whether the Government at this stage are prepared to restore the Local Authorities (Works) Act?  It cannot be denied that first-class work was done in most counties.  He knows that his political group have joined with other members of the local authority in Roscommon to urge the restoration of this Act.  I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary that the position is such that if the present rate of emigration from Roscommon and Leitrim continues for another 10 years there is no hope of retrieving it.  The last 18 months are frightening so far as emigration is concerned.</P>
      <P>I shall put it this way: the true picture is not disclosed in the unemployment figures.  Everything one says in this House can be produced against one but I want to go on record as saying that when the census returns are available, possibly next September or October, we shall all get a real fright so far as the emigration position is concerned in the west of Ireland.  Entire families&mdash;not just girls and boys or the fathers&mdash;are moving out; first-class houses are locked up.  I wonder does the Parliamentary Secretary realise the impact of that on a county when it reaches the stage such as it has reached, for instance, in the townland of Frenchpark, County Roscommon, where 30 years ago 35 families lived? Three weeks ago that figure was reduced to 12.  Last Tuesday two more families left for England and on Saturday a third family is leaving the area.  That means there are nine families left after 35 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That picture is the same in every western county.  It is shocking when we hear the Government tell us that there are 99 new factories set up and that the employment figures are satisfactory when the very foundation stock <Col N="204" /> of the country are getting out of it. When they go we cannot do much about it; Ireland will be like a man lying in bed with his life blood pouring from him.  He cannot lift himself up and recover.  If we lose the foundation stock of our country we shall go down.  We shall have others to come in, of course, but I do not want to see the situation in which what is left of the population will be the least virile, the least fit for initiative and least fit to keep the country as it should be. What we shall have left will be what I can only describe as Firbolgs.</P>
    <P>Let me put this to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I must stay within the terms of the motion and I find that difficult. For instance, drainage in County Roscommon and County Leitrim would have a number of good effects.  It would give employment, even though only temporarily, and the limited amount of land available to smallholders would be extended.  What do we find instead?  In the west of Ireland we find that the Government have found it very economic to direct local authorities to use the greatest possible amount of machinery for road making. We have no money available for land reclamation so far as the Local Authorities (Works) Act is concerned but we have plenty for making roads. This is the alternative&mdash;the Government are taking credit for the fact that they have increased the amount of money for rural improvement schemes. Where is that money going?  In the west of Ireland, or at least in Roscommon, in the last 12 months, the number employed is down by 30 to 35 per cent. on the previous year as regards road works due to the technical advice given regarding the making of roads.</P>
    <P>Take a small farmer with a valuation of from £5 to £10 who budgets each year for about three months' work with the local authority to enable him to buy necessities over and above what he can earn on his small-holding. We now find that where six such smallholders had three months' work each year, a machine is doing the work of the six.  One man, perhaps, is making £5 to £7 a day for machinery but the six families are out <Col N="205" /> of work.  The man with the machinery, who may be from some other part of the country, is not spending money among the small shopkeepers; this money is not spent in the small towns. We find that the machinery he uses is imported, as are also the tyres and the fuel he uses to run the machine.</P>
    <P>The reaction that sets in all over a county as a result of this new approach means that the workers suffer, their families suffer and the shopkeepers who supply them suffer; the drapers, the shoemakers and even the local church suffers in the long run.  I wonder is this a new approach to the problem of rural Ireland?  Is it a deliberate attempt to get rid of the small farmers in the west of Ireland?</P>

      <P>Over the years, we have been told that every possible effort would be made to give them continuity of employment through the winter months and that the Land Commission, where possible, would relieve congestion to their limited ability.  I shall not enter into the question of land division because I hold different views on it from the majority of the members of the House. The Government must have decided, at last, that rural Ireland, and in particular the west of Ireland, was too much of a burden for the new industrial group to carry.</P>

      <P>It would appear that the decision arrived at was: &ldquo;Let us get them off our backs; let us send them to the emigrant ship and let them go over to England; and let us as an alternative or a sop for those who remain, bring in the Messieurs or the Herren&rdquo;&mdash;I do not know what they are called in Japan&mdash;&ldquo;on the basis that we have a cheap pool of labour in Ireland.&rdquo;  The whole countryside around us is to be denuded of its foundation stock.  That is why the motion is necessary.  It is desirable to try to impress on the Government the necessity for making more money available to local authorities.  It is <Col N="206" /> only tinkering with the problem and we must have an opportunity at the earliest possible stage to have a full-scale discussion here on this haemorrhage from rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>I should like to give the Parliamentary Secretary an example of what was brought to my attention a week ago. In the town of Burrin, four families of what are often uncharitably described as the tinker group, comprising 25 people, sold their caravans, their horses, their equipment, went down to the local second-hand shop and left in their shawls and other local costumery, togged themselves out and departed to Halifax for permanent work.  When we see that happening, and when we find those groups going, it is quite clear that there is a pinch in rural Ireland.  I know for a fact that a number of the people concerned have never been out of the west and would be the last to leave Ireland.  Some of them have never been as far as Dublin, and were petrified with fear at the thought of what faced them when they got to Dublin, and what it would be like in England.  Yet things were so bad in that area of north Roscommon that, in spite of their fears of an unknown land, they were prepared to set sail because they could not get enough to keep them going in that locality.</P>
      <P>As I say, the best we can expect from this motion is that the Government will make plenty of money available to the local authorities for productive work, and do everything possible at this stage to hold the existing population until alternative plans are made and a properly organised system made available to rural Ireland which will help the producers, control the exploiters and secure stable markets abroad for our products.  That will not be done overnight and I do not expect it to be done overnight.  We want to see the plans of this Government&mdash;not blue papers or blueprints but actual concrete plans&mdash;which should now be available after the time they have been in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why the people have so much patience.  I do not know the real reason they do not rise up and <Col N="207" /> tear asunder the members of a political Party that can look so callously on their situation.  It is incredible to me that people will go to the polling booths and cast their votes for members of this House who seem to have no influence whatever on the city mentality group they are part and parcel of.  It would appear that rural Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party at the moment carry no more weight than a feather in the matter of impressing on the Taoiseach and members of the Cabinet the seriousness of the position. Members of this House from the West of Ireland, no matter to what Party they belong, are fully aware of the seriousness of the position, and surely they speak in the Party councils.  If they do, it shows how little influence they carry because there is no attempt to hold the people on the land in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As I said, I support this motion. What we need is a state of emergency declared at this stage to grapple with the frightening problem of emigration. I urge on the Government that as much money as possible should be poured into rural Ireland, because this is an emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We set down this motion to bring home to the Government the problem of employment in many parts of the country and particularly in the more remote and isolated parts.  It is indeed peculiar that we should, in the fourth year of the reign of the Government, be debating such a motion this evening. Anyone who listened to the statements made by the leading members of the Government Party, and by lesser members as well, during the election campaign that brought them into office in 1957, would believe that in the latter part of the year 1960, our unemployment problem would be completely solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say at this stage that our intention in putting down this motion was not to seize an opportunity of criticising the Government but, as I mentioned at the outset, to bring home to them the position of many of our people who cannot obtain a livelihood in this country and, as pointed <Col N="208" /> out by the previous speaker, have to go abroad to earn a livelihood.  I think it is incumbent upon us, and particularly upon the Government, to take every measure possible to ensure that employment of a productive nature is made available to them here.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House unduly by quoting statements made during the last general election by members of the Government Party and statements made here in the House during the period in office of the inter-Party Government from 1954 to 1957.  These statements have been quoted here on previous occasions, particularly the famous&mdash;I suppose we can now legitimately term it &ldquo;infamous&rdquo;&mdash;statement by the Taoiseach in O'Connell Street, Dublin, that if he were returned to office, he would provide work for all and sundry.  Indeed, he said he could provide work for more people than were actually seeking work; 100,000 extra jobs would be provided if Fianna Fáil were returned to power.</P>
    <P>It serves no useful purpose to reiterate these statements now, but we all know now that they were not factual statements.  It is unfortunate that the leader of the Government should use&mdash;and I must use the term, though I dislike it&mdash;deceitful methods in order to get Fianna Fáil back into power.  We all know now that these 100,000 jobs have not been provided. I venture to assert that not even 1,000 jobs have been provided since the change of Government in 1957.</P>

      <P>Deputy Galvin will have an opportunity of addressing the House on this motion, if he has anything to say on it.  There are useful schemes which would be very suitable in the rural areas, which would provide employment in areas in which it is badly needed and add to the general economy of the country.  Again and again, we have addressed ourselves here to the urgency of drainage works, the desirability of doing these works in order to improve land which <Col N="209" /> is now subject to flooding, and providing people with productive employment.</P>
      <P>It must be admitted by the Parliamentary Secretary, and I suppose it must be admitted, too, by my colleague from Cork, Deputy Galvin, that the Government who replaced Fianna Fáil, when Fianna Fáil were out of office, set themselves in no uncertain manner to the task of providing useful schemes in districts where such schemes were needed.  The most useful of all was the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  For the information of Deputy Galvin, I understand that practically all local authorities have unanimously made representations to the Fianna Fáil Government to make money available under that Act to do the work for which that Act was designed.  Surely county councils controlled by the Parliamentary Secretary's Party would not make such representations without having good grounds for them.  Everybody knows there are good grounds for them.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that neither the Taoiseach, nor any of his Ministers stated during the election campaign in 1957 that if they were returned to office, one of their first actions would be to withdraw the moneys made available under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and, as a result, create unemployment in many parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another scheme which was of great benefit in remote parts was the rural improvements scheme.  It was utilised very fully in the constituency I represent. Subsequent to the return of Fianna Fáil to office, applicants for these schemes were informed that the local contributions were to be increased substantially.  The average increase is in or around 100 per cent. The result is the farmers are not able to avail of these schemes today.  In view of the hardships the increased contribution has imposed, together with the likelihood of farmers not being able to proceed with their applications because of the increased contribution, I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary now to review the matter and reduce the local contribution to the figure at which it stood prior to Fianna <Col N="210" /> Fáil returning to office.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be well aware of the advantages of these schemes&mdash; making roadways, providing minor drainage works, and providing, too, a good deal of employment, and some of that employment for small farmers anxious to supplement the incomes from their small holdings.</P>
    <P>In the year 1958-59, since the increased contributions came into operation, I understand a sum of in or around £90,000 has not been expended. It has not been expended because the local people are not able to meet the excessive contributions demanded by the Fianna Fáil Government.  We have at present representations&mdash;most members, I am sure, have similar representations&mdash;from people seeking employment.  I believe the obligation is on the Government to help these people to get employment as they are entitled to obtain it.</P>
    <P>To implement this motion would not cost a great deal of money, having regard to the total expenditure of the State.  I feel sure that if the Parliamentary Secretary made available, say, £500,000 for these useful and beneficial schemes, it would go a long way towards meeting the present position, particularly for the winter months.  The Parliamentary Secretary smiles.  As Deputy McQuillan said a while ago, if people came in from outside and sought £500,000, more facilities would be granted to them than are being granted at present to the many workers and the many uneconomic holders throughout a fair portion of this country who cannot make a reasonable livelihood.</P>
    <P>As the debate on this motion has a three hours' limit, I do not want to stand in the way of other speakers who intend to contribute, but before concluding, I want to refer to minor employment schemes&mdash;schemes which are operated without any local contribution. As the Parliamentary Secretary must be aware, it is almost impossible to get approval for one of these schemes at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this motion was set down, we had a circular from the Minister for Local Government to local authorities asking them to submit suitable schemes. This matter was the subject of a Question on to-day's Order Paper.  It was clearly elicited from the Minister that of the numerous schemes submitted by the authorities throughout the length and breadth of this country, he could not point to one scheme approved.  What is the use of labouring that point?  We disposed of that question to-day when the Minister for Finance had to admit that of all the schemes submitted by the local authorities, not a single solitary one has been approved.  The Parliamentary Secretary will not deny that as it was made clear in the course of Supplementary Questions.</P>
      <P>The purpose of sending out this circular to local authorities was to secure time for the Government or to give the people the impression that they were about to do something.  It is not unusual for the Government Party to speak of prosperity around the corner. Fianna Fáil always tell us of plans they have for the future and the same applies when they are out of office. These Fianna Fáil plans always seem to stay around the corner.  The Labour Party, by way of this motion, want the Government to make some supplementary funds available to local authorities or to the Special Employment Schemes Office for the carrying out of schemes of a useful nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the motion was set down, it has been made quite clear that now that powers in respect of drainage work are being withdrawn from the local authorities, they are vested in the Office of Public Works.  It is almost 12 months since the Minister for Local Government and the Parliamentary Secretary made that statement but not a single scheme of any kind has been implemented since that announcement was made by the Office of Public Works or at least I have not heard of <Col N="212" /> it.  The only move is another of a stalling nature.  They sent along a few inspectors with maps and books who walked up and down some rivers and who were supposed to make a survey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The most useful system of assistance to local authorities for the relief of unemployment would be assistance by way of giving them back the powers to carry out these drainage works.  I do not want to repeat that because all the Ministers state they do not propose to do so. Then this question arises: are they prepared to make available to local authorities increased sums for road improvement works?  Local authorities and in particular the local authority of which I am a member, the Cork County Council, have again and again during the past few years made requests to the Government for an additional sum of money from the Road Fund, on the basis that the number of vehicles now using the roads has substantially increased and that even if it does not go into the Road Fund, the Government has benefited to a very substantial extent from the petrol duty.  That being the case, it would not be inappropriate for the Government to give more substantial grants to local authorities for road improvement works and thereby not only help to provide a better road system, particularly in relation to the smaller roads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Does the Parliamentary Secretary not know very well that the bigger amount is the amount which comes by way of duty from petrol taxation on those using the roads?  Will he inform the House of the actual income from that source during the past 12 months?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary not also aware that because of the increase in the number of vehicles on the roads, the grants should be increased correspondingly in order to provide a better road system?  Naturally the roads will deteriorate more with more vehicles using them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>On today's Order Paper I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the increases in bread and flour prices, he will constitute a Prices Advisory Committee under the Prices Act, 1958, to enquire into and report to him as to whether such increases are warranted.  In answer to that, I got the extraordinary reply from the Minister who said that he did not propose to constitute a Prices Advisory Committee to inquire into and report on the recent increases. He went on to say he considered that in present circumstances it was better to continue to rely on the prices of the flour and bread being settled by competition rather than by official regulation.  He added that he was keeping the situation under close observation and that if the circumstances should seem to arise which would justify such a course, he would implement the Prices Act of 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very difficult to understand the Minister's approach to this very serious problem.  He is aware, of course, that bread forms the major portion of the basic diet of the majority of the population in this country and that any increase in the price of that basic commodity has a greater impact on the less well-off sections of our community.  Any increase in the price of bread hits the lower income group.  People who <Col N="215" /> consume more bread than those who are better off are hit more strongly and forcibly than any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Minister would avail himself of the powers he has under the 1958 Act or any other Act to ensure that, when the millers and the bakers proceeded to increase the price of bread, he would at least give an opportunity to all other interested parties to state their case.  I can remember well, reflecting on the Prices Act, 1958, the political climate under which that Bill was enacted in this House.</P>
    <P>We had a general election in 1957 and the present Government Party went to the country and invited the electorate to return them to power on several scores&mdash;not the least of them being the question of prices.  Amongst other things, they referred to the unemployment situation and the building industry but I can well remember in my own constituency in the City of Cork, which is the Minister's constituency as well, that prices were brought to the fore and the implication was that the Government at that time had failed to live up to their responsibility in curtailing prices.</P>
    <P>We know that the people fell for that line of argument at the time but the Government's record since in that respect is a pretty dismal one.  They were not hot in office when they did away with the food subsidies and since that date I think I am not incorrect in saying&mdash;I think we got this information arising out of a Parliamentary Question&mdash;that something like 140 to 150 consumer prices have increased.</P>
    <P>That Government came into office with the Prices Advisory Body there. The machinery was there and it was set up by Deputy Norton who was then the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The machinery in question was the Prices Advisory Body before which anybody who wanted any increase in any prices would be compelled to appear and prove beyond yea or nay that the increase in the price of whatever commodity under discussion was warranted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> The Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, decided he would scrap that.  He said it was healthier economically to let prices find their own level but he also said, as a kind of face-saver at the time, that he would introduce the Prices Bill which would give him or any of his successors power at any time, if they thought the situation warranted it, to set up a Prices Advisory Committee to inquire into the retail price of any commodity.  It is not without significance, a Cheann Comhairle, that not on one single occasion since the passing of that Act have the powers which are vested in the Minister being utilised.</P>
    <P>I remember well when the Bill was passed through this House some Deputies forecast that that would be the situation; that there was complete abandonment of price control and that, whatever the particular Prices Act of 1958 said the Minister had no intention at all of utilising it.  He threw up his hands in horror at any such suggestion.  He insisted that the Act was there and that it would be taken down out of the pigeon hole at any time he felt that the conditions warranted it and that it would be used to the full.</P>
    <P>Accepting his statement at its face value, I am now suggesting to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that I can conceive of no more appropriate occasion when the powers he has under that Act might be utilised. I have already referred to the impact that any increase in the price of bread has on the vast majority of our people. I would have thought that would appeal to the Minister as well and that if there is a case for an increase&mdash;I do not know whether there is or not&mdash;that everybody else concerned outside the millers and the bakers, the consumers and every person concerned, would have ample opportunity of going before a public tribunal and putting their case.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the increase in the price of bread is warranted or not.  My question was designed to impress on the Minister the desirability of having this public tribunal to inquire into the price of bread and the price of flour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> It seems futile to me that this House should go to the trouble of enacting a statute, the Prices Act of 1958, if we never intend to apply it.  The Minister says he considers that in present circumstances it is better not to use that Act and I should like to know what present circumstances appeal to him in making that decision.  There are more people concerned with the price of bread and flour than the millers and bakers.  If the operatives in the baking and flour milling industry decide next week, or the week after, that they require an increase of 5/- or 10/- a week in their wages, the machinery established by law would be brought into play.  The bakers' trade union, and any other union involved, would have to appear before the Labour Court and there produce facts and figures on which their case would stand or fall and the employers would have an opportunity of making their case against them.  I am sure that procedure commends itself to the Minister and, if that is so, why should there not be the same procedure in respect of price increases in the baking and milling industry?</P>
    <P>This question of the price of bread should appeal particularly to the Minister for Industry and Commerce because I can reflect back to the General Election of 1957 when, in our common constituency in the City of Cork he, then Deputy Lynch, had quite a lot to say about the price of bread.  He even went to the trouble of getting a loaf of bread and attaching it to a stick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time, to which I am referring, the price of the 2-lb loaf was 9d.  It is now 1/3d.  My question today was designed to invite the Minister to use the powers he has under the 1958 Act to carry out an inquiry as to whether the increase is warranted or not.  I do not know if it is warranted or not, but I would have thought the Minister would have availed himself of all the powers that are available to him to inquire into the matter so that a tribunal would report back to him.  He would then be in a position, which he was not in today, to say if the increase was warranted or not.  Even at this late <Col N="220" /> stage, I invite him to carry out an investigation into this matter.</P>

      <P>I have been appealed to as a judge and I certainly never remember the Minister going around with a loaf of bread on a stick, but I do endorse everything else Deputy Casey said, and I think there is a fair case for the Minister to invoke the Act.  However, I certainly never remember the Minister going around like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true the Minister never went around with a loaf of bread on a stick, except by implication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am called upon to reply to Deputy Casey's unfounded allegation, one which he should know is not true about me or any member of my Party, that we were going around Cork with loaves of bread on sticks.  That never arose and I cannot help expressing my supreme surprise at Deputy Casey making such an unfounded allegation here.</P>
      <P>If he is not too young.  Deputy Casey may remember when there were small premises on the quays of Cork to which flour was imported from Birkenhead in the 1930s.  I do not think he is too young to remember that, or that in the interests of the national economy the Government introduced a policy of growing wheat at home for the purpose of manufacturing bread for our own people.  That policy has stood the test of time.  It has withstood the advent of several successive Governments, two of which were not Fianna Fáil Governments, and, therefore, we can take it that the growing of wheat for milling into flour is national policy of the best kind. However, we have to accept the fact that the cost of Irish grown wheat is higher than the cost of imported wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that if we decided to import all our wheat, rather than grow it here at home, we could put bread on the tables of our consumers at a much lower price, but it is equally true that we would then lose to the national <Col N="221" /> economy several million pounds a year which the farmers get for growing wheat.  The figure runs into £6 million, £7 million, or perhaps more a year and, as a consequence of importing all the wheat we need, that money would not be available to be channelled into our economy where it is available for the purchase of other consumer goods that bread consumers themselves contribute to make.  I do not think Deputy Casey would deny the soundness of that national policy.</P>
    <P>It is also true that, together with the growing of wheat at home, we have to import a certain amount because imported wheat has certain qualities which, mixed with home grown wheat, make bread more palatable.  At the present time the national policy is that we grow enough wheat to produce 300,000 tons a year.  This is intended to represent at least 75 per cent. of the gross amount of wheat to be used for milling into flour in this country.  The 25 per cent. extra is imported, admittedly at a lower cost, particularly from the North American continent where they have vast tracts of wheat and where, as a consequence, it can be grown much cheaper than here.</P>
    <P>If we accept it is good national policy to grow a certain quantity of wheat here, as much as is possible to make our bread palatable to the Irish consumer, then we have to accept the fact that we have to pay a higher price for that wheat and, consequently, for our flour and bread.  In the year 1958, it was necessary, by reason of a bad harvest year and a consequent decrease in the amount of wheat sent to the mills for conversion into flour, to import an unduly high quantity of wheat from abroad.  That resulted in lower milling costs.  That was passed on ultimately to the consumer, but a certain portion was held to compensate the farmers who suffered badly in that 1958 harvest year.</P>
    <P>In the following year when the harvest improved and more of our home wheat had to be put into the grist, the prices of bread and flour reverted to what they had been prior to the 1958 harvest.  That was one of the increases imposed after the abolition of the subsidies in 1957.  Another increase came <Col N="222" /> following the increase in pay to bakery operatives.  If Deputy Casey suggests that that increase was subject to some price review or review by an authority like the Labour Court, that is not the position.  The increase was given by the bakers and, consequently, they increased the price of bread by, I think, a farthing per 2-lb loaf.  The bakers alleged that that was not even sufficient to compensate them for the increase in wages.  There was at that time no inquiry and no question of an inquiry into the increase in the price of flour.</P>
    <P>Last year 260,000 tons of native wheat were used in the production of flour here.  That fell short of the amount expected to be brought to the mills from home sources.  But this year, and in conformity with the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, it was decided that the mills would take 300,000 tons of wheat for milling into flour.  It was on that basis the mills decided that the proportion of Irish wheat in the grist would have to be increased from 70 per cent., on the basis of 260,000 tons, to 80 per cent., on the basis of 300,000 tons.  That caused an increase of 5/9d. per sack for bakers' flour and 7/9d. per sack for retail flour.  Since the bakers had to pay an increased price, their costs of production went up and, as a result, they increased the price of bread by a half-penny per 21b. loaf.  That is the position and these are the circumstances of the current increase in flour and bread prices.</P>
    <P>There are two courses open to us whereby we could reduce the price of bread.  There is, first of all, the reintroduction of subsidisation, or a depressing of the price paid for Irish farmers' wheat, or, perhaps a depressing of the acreage to be grown. What course Deputy Casey would suggest, I do not know, but he will remember that during the period of the subsidies, allegations were widely made that subsidised bread was being fed to greyhounds or used by people who did not need subsidisation of any kind. As the Committee set up in 1956 found, it was impossible to divert the subsidy to one particular section only, that is, to the benefit of the poorer <Col N="223" /> sections of the community.  Therefore, they decided it would have to be an overall subsidy, except to the extent that they tried to enforce a differential in the case of hotels and other catering establishments.  But they found that that, too, would not work. If there is to be subsidisation, it will have to be universal.</P>
    <P>In any event, subsidisation was only a temporary measure to deal with a sudden uprise in prices in 1947.  Even the Labour Party realised at the time, and so expressed themselves in the Dáil, that it would be a temporary measure only.  It was never intended it would continue when stabilisation of prices was reached.  I should like to suggest to Deputy Casey that stabilisation of prices has been achieved, in the main, over the past one and a half or two years.  It is true that the prices of bread and butter have increased by reason of the withdrawal of the subsidies, but, apart from that, there has been relative price stability over that period.</P>
    <P>The Prices Act, 1958, was introduced for the purpose of giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to control prices but that control was to be used in times of shortage of a particular commodity, or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister at the time said it would be invoked in times of shortage or when it was manifest there were restrictive practices either in management or labour which had the effect of increasing prices.  Neither, I think, operates at present.  The then Minister said the best price control was free competition.  He also said&mdash; and I think this is a fact generally accepted&mdash;that experience shows that maximum prices tend to become minimum prices.  As soon as a maximum price is imposed, everybody charges that irrespective of what the commodity can be produced for or marketed at, with the result that there is only one price and there is no room for competition or, rather that there is room for competition but it is not availed of.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting that there is room for competition at present.  When the last increase, brought about by the raising of the amount of Irish wheat going into the grist, took place, I made some enquiries in Dublin following a suggestion in the House that there was no competition and that there was no price differential in the case of retail bread.  I discovered that the price at the time for a 2-lb. loaf varied from one and a penny farthing to one and twopence half-penny. I think that that price differential still operates, allowing for the increase which has taken place in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that that competition must operate on the milling side, because here, in common with other countries, when the standard of living has increased, the consumption of bread has fallen. Before the war, 2.8 million sacks were being milled here each year.  Since then, that amount has dropped to 2.25 million sacks.  Therefore, it is in the interests of the millers themselves that they put their flour on the market at <Col N="225" /> the cheapest possible price in order to conserve the saleability of flour.  I am satisfied that they are doing this. Their methods of production are as good as any that operate in the world and I know from comparisons I have made that they are, in fact, much better and cheaper.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the consumption of bread falls as the standard of living increases.  I think the F.A.O.  Reports verify that that is not peculiar to this country but is common to every country in Europe where there has been an increase in the standards of living.  Therefore, I am suggesting that because of the increased use of <Col N="226" /> Irish wheat in the grist, brought about by the increased acreage, there are reasonable grounds for an increase in the price of flour and that there is reasonable competition at the millers' level by reason of their desire to maintain consumption of flour. Further, by reason of the differential in price for the 2-lb. batch loaf, I am satisfied that there is reasonable competition at the bakers' level as well.</P>

For technical reasons it is not feasible to link the group index numbers of the Cost-of-Living Index (Essential Items) base August 1947 = 100, to the group index numbers for the consumer price index, base August, 1953 = 100.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will indicate generally, in convenient groups or ranges, the average rents of local authority houses in each county, which entered into the compilation of the consumer price index of August, 1960, and the number of houses in each group, range or sample.</P>

      <P>The rental data for local authority dwellings included in the consumer price index relate to the figures for total weekly rent (including rates) of all occupied rented dwellings.  The relevant material is compiled once a year in respect of the month of November.  The particulars are not obtained in a form, which would make it possible to classify the dwellings in each county into different groups based on the level of rents paid.  The following statement shows for each county, county borough and for Dún Laoghaire Borough the number of occupied rented local authority dwellings, together with the average weekly rent (including rates), for which data were included in the consumer price index for November, 1959, the latest date for which the information is available.</P>
      <P>NUMBER of occupied rented dwellings owned by local authorities in each County, County Borough and Dún Laoghaire Borough, together with the average weekly rent (including rates) of such dwellings in each area as used in the compilation of the Consumer Price Index at mid-November, 1959.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare what are the conditions necessary and the procedure to be adopted so that an applicant can be awarded an old age pension of £2 per week or less plus a dependant's allowance; what constitutes a dependant for the purposes of the Act; whether any means test exists; whether an applicant can continue in whole-time or part-time employment while drawing the pension; and whether and appeal may be made by an aggrieved person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of old age (contributory) pensions introduced by the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960, will come into operation on 6th January, 1961.  To qualify for a pension of £2 per week a person must have attained the age of 70 years and must satisfy the following three conditions on his insurance under the Social Welfare Acts:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that he entered insurance before attaining the age of sixty years,</P>
      <P>(b)  that not less than 156 employment contributions have been paid in respect of him, and</P>
      <P>(c)  that the average per contribution year of contributions paid in respect of or credited to him is not less than 48 for the period from the beginning of the contribution year in which he entered insurance to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached the age of 70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment contributions paid in <Col N="95" /> respect of a period during which a person was insured only for the purposes of widow's (contributory) pension and orphan's (contributory) allowance will not count towards satisfying these conditions.</P>
    <P>Power is provided for the making of regulations prescribing the manner in which contributions already paid or credited under the Social Welfare Acts or under the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1952, will be taken into account for the purpose of satisfying the contribution conditions.  These regulations may also modify any of those contribution conditions in the case of persons who were insurred under the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1952.</P>
    <P>In addition, regulations may be made to enable an old age (contributory) pension to be paid at a rate less than £2 per week where the contribution condition which requires a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is not fully satisfied.</P>
    <P>An increase of old age (contributory) pension amounting to 28/6d. a week will be payable in respect of an adult dependant who is not in receipt of a pension in his own right.  An adult dependant for the purposes of the scheme is, in the case of a married man, his wife if she is living with or is wholly or mainly maintained by him, and, in the case of a married woman, her husband if he is incapable of self-support by reason of some physical or mental infirmity and is wholly or mainly maintained by her.</P>
    <P>Old age (contributory) pension is not subject to any means test and entitlement will not be affected by a pensioner continuing employment after the pension has been awarded to him.</P>
    <P>Claim forms for pension are available at all Post Offices.  The procedure for claiming a pension is to complete a claim form in accordance with the instructions printed on it and to forward it when completed and certified to the Department of Social Welfare with any other documents required. The claim will be decided by a Deciding Officer.</P>
    <P>Old age (contributory) pension is a benefit under the Social Welfare Act, <Col N="96" /> 1952, and is therefore governed by the provisions of Section 44 of that Act which relates to the right of appeal. Accordingly if, any person is dissatisfied with the decision given by a deciding officer in relation to his claim for pension the question will, on notice of appeal being given to the Minister within the prescribed time, be referred to an appeals officer.  The prescribed time is normally any time up to the expiration of 21 days from the date of notification of the decision.</P>
