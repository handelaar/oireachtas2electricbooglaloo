      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his Department have carried out any inquiries into the effect upon fish of the pumping of 10,000 curies of radio-active material monthly into the Irish Sea by British atomic industries; and, if so, if he will state the result of such enquiries; and, if not, if he will take steps to have the situation kept under constant observation.</P>

      <P>The possible dangers of the contamination of foodstuffs to a dangerous degree by radioactivity is under continual review at present by a group of professional and technical officers from my Department and the other Departments concerned.  As part of this review, the group has been considering the effect on fish of the deposit of radio-active waste in the Irish Sea, and has reached certain tentative conclusions in the matter. While tests have not so far been carried out on fish caught in the Irish Sea, it is hoped that the group will be able to arrange such tests as part of their future programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, however, the House can be assured that, from reports of the British authorities, it is evident that they exercise stringent controls on the discharge of radio-active waste into the Irish Sea and comply with the requirements of the <Col N="742" /> International Commission on Radiological Protection.  I am advised that tests undertaken in Britain for radioactivity in fish caught in the Irish Sea have shown satisfactory results.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the suggestion in the Deputy's question as to the valuation of certain premises in Cork County borough is incorrect.  In any event, I have no power to direct a revaluation of any premises or of any area.</P>
      <P>The initiative in applying for a general revaluation under the Valuation Acts of rateable hereditaments in a county borough area rests with the county borough council.  I am informed by the Commissioner of Valuation that no such application has been received from Cork Corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that in past general and local elections persons attending to cast their votes have suffered delay and detailed investigation because other persons had earlier and illegally voted in their names; whether such personation effectively deprives of the vote persons entitled to vote ; and whether the most stringent precautions will be taken to prevent personation at the forthcoming local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The law provides that if a person representing himself to be a particular elector applies for a ballot paper after another person has voted as such elector, he shall be entitled to mark a ballot paper in the same manner as any other elector, if he answers satisfactorily the questions and takes the oath or affirmation provided by statute.  The ballot paper, which is known as a tendered ballot paper, is kept separate from the other ballot papers and is counted only in the event of an election petition.</P>
      <P>Penalties are provided for persons convicted of personation.  Offenders may be arrested by members of the Garda Síochána either at their own discretion or on the direction of the returning officer or presiding officer. These officers are assisted by personation agents who may be appointed by candidates at each polling station to assist in the detection of personation. Election officials generally are aware of the necessity to take the utmost precautions to prevent personation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particulars of the numbers of tendered votes at local elections are not compiled, but the numbers of such votes in the case of recent general elections have been insignificant.  I have, however, long recognised that the present position is open to the criticism that such votes are generally ineffective and the matter is one of a <Col N="746" /> number which I intend to bring to the notice of the Joint Committee on Electoral Law.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If a member of the Garda Síochána on duty realises that a person is voting under a wrong name, is he entitled, or required, as part of his duty to intervene and take the necessary steps in that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in relation to the Garda Síochána and not to the officials.  If he knows that a person is impersonating some elector, the Garda may, at his own discretion, take action or he may be directed by the returning officer or the presiding officer to do so.</P>

      <P>Go ndeonófar suim nach mó ná £306,090 chun slánaithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an t-aonú lá is tríocha de Mhárta, 1961, le haghaidh Tuarastal agus Costas Oifig an Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus Seirbhísí áirithe atá faoi riaradh na hOifige sin (Uimh. 16 de 1924), lena n-áirítear Deontas-i-gCabhair.</P>
      <P>Le cead an Cheann Comhairle agus de réir an chleachtais a bhí ann sna blianta roimhe seo tá fúm an Meastachán le haghaidh Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus an Meastachán le haghaidh Comhair Idirnáisiúnta a thógáil le chéile.</P>
      <P>I gcás an Mheastacháin le haghaidh Gnóthaí Eachtracha £459,130, is méadú glan de £28,380 é ar mheastachán na bliana anuraidh.  Is é an phríomh-chúis atá leis an méadú seo sa mheastachán an soláthar breise le haghaidh (1) tuarastal, pá agus liúntas (£24,250); (2) teileagram, teileafón agus postais (£1,400); (3) comhar cultúir le tíortha eile (£2,000); agus (4) aíochta oifigiúla (£1,500).  Mar pháirtchúiteamh éigin sna méaduithe seo tá laghdú £2,800 sa soláthar le haghaidh costais taistil dár n-ionadaithe ar an gcoigrích.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is iad na méaduithe ar luach saothair do Státseirbhísigh, a deonaíodh le gairid, is cúis le suim £13,830, as <Col N="754" /> an soláthar breise £24,250, le haghaidh tuarastal, pá agus liúntas.  Gnáthbhreisithe tuarastail, agus poist nua áirithe a bunaíodh, go mormhór san Ambasáid i Londain mar ar méadaíodh de bheagán líon na sóisear ar an bhfoireann eacnamaíochta, agus sa ChonsalachtGhinearálta i Nua Eabhrac áit a bhfuil líon na n-oifigeach consalachta le méadú go dtí an líon a bhí ann ó thús na dtríochadaí go dtí le deireanas.</P>
    <P>Is deacair meastachán cruinn a thabhairt ar chostas teileagram, teileafón agus postais toisc nach féidir bheith cinnte cad é an méid úsáide is gá a bhaint as na seirbhísí sin.  Tá an Meastachán seo bunaithe ar ráta reatha an chaiteachais, agus is é an t-ardú ar chostas an phostais coigríche is bun le cuid den mhéadú.</P>
    <P>Tá an deontas-i-gcabhair, £9,000, do chaidreamh cúltúir le tíortha eile £2,000 níos airde ná an tsuim a soláthraíodh anuraidh.  Cé go bhfuil sé £1,000 níos ísle ná an tsuim a soláthraíodh gach bliain ó 1948/49 go dtí 1956/57, tá áthas orm gurbh fhéidir an tsuim mhéadaithe seo a sholáthar don bhliain seo chugainn, agus ba chóir go gcuirfeadh sé ar ár gcumas níos mó a dhéanamh i gcúrsaí cultúir.  Ní féidir airgead a chaitheamh as an deontas-i-gcabhair ach ar mholadh an Choiste um Chomhar Cultúrtha.  Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl athuair go bhfuil an t-ardmheas agam ar an saothar atá á dhéanamh ag an gCoiste chun an t-iomalartú cultúir idir Éire agus tíortha eile a chur chun cinn.  Is comhlacht saorálach, ar ndóigh, an Coiste agus i gcónaí riamh chaith comhaltaí an Choiste am agus dúthracht, go fonnmhar agus go fial, leis an gcomhthuiscint idir pobail tíortha a mhéadú an oiread agus is féidir ar an mbealach fóinteach tairbheach seo.</P>
    <P>Is é is mó is cúis leis an méadú ar an soláthar le haghaidh aíocht oifigiúil go bhfuil breis ag dul i gcónaí ar an méid comhdhálacha agus comhthionól idirnáisiúnta a dtoghtar an tír seo mar láthair dóibh.  Níorbh fhéidir aíocht mar is cuí a thabhairt leis an méid airgid a bhíodh sa Mheastachán roimhe seo agus, go deimhin, b'éigin <Col N="755" /> tuilleadh a chaitheamh i mblianta áirithe.</P>
    <P>I gcomparáid leis an mbliain roimhe seo, tá £2,800 níos lú á sholáthar le haghaidh costais taistil ionadaithe ar an gcoigrích mar gheall ar laghdú measta ar líon na n-oifigeach a bheidh á n-aistriú, nó á n-athsholáthar, agus ar na turais saoire abhaile.</P>
    <P>Is gnách leis an Roinn Consail Oinigh a cheapadh i gcathracha inar chóir sin a dhéanamh ar mhaithe le leasa na hÉireann agus dá réir sin ceapadh triúr Consal Oinigh i rith na bliana sna cathracha seo&mdash;Tokyo, Johannesburg agus Barcelona.  Tá ceithre dhuine dhéag mar Chonsail Oinigh againn anois ar an gcoigrích.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Meastachán um Chomhar Idirnáisiúnta £95,470, tá glan- laghdú £500 ar fhigiúr na bliana roimhe seo mar gheall ar laghdú £7,350 ar roinnt fo-mhírcheann, lúide £6,850 d'ardú i bhfo-mhírchinn eile.</P>
    <P>Sa ranníoca i leith caiteachais Chomhairle na hEorpa tá £1,450 d'ardú ar an mbliain roimhe seo. Méadú i gCáinaisnéis na Comhairle, a fhaigheann ranníoc céatadánach ó gach Tír-Chomhalta, is bun leis an ardú sin.  Mar a déantar i gcás Chomhairle na hEorpa, íocann an tír seo céatadán áirithe de chaiteachais an Eagrais um Chomhar Eacnamaíochta san Eoraip.  Níl Cáinaisnéisí an Eagrais don bhliain 1960 ar fáil fós.  Is gá, mar sin, ár ranníoc do 1960/61 a mheas de réir an ranníoca iomláin do 1959/60 agus liúntas beag a áireamh i leith mionardú is tuigthe dúinn a theacht ar mhíreanna éagsúla. Thárla, áfach, £3,150 de laghdú sna figiúirí i leith caiteachais taistil agus fochaiteachais faoin mír seo.  Tá an laghdú seo bunaithe ar an gclaonadh atá ann i gcúrsaí caiteachais maidir le freastal Airí agus oifigeach ar chruinnithe an Eagrais um Chomhar Eacnamáíochta san Eoraip.</P>
    <P>Maidir le fo-mhírchinn na Náisiún Aontaithe, is ionann beagnach is anuraidh an soláthar le haghaidh an ranníoca.  Tá £1,300 níos mó san fho-mhírcheann taistil mar nár leor an soláthar a rinneadh don bhliain seo caite.  Tá £1,500 níos lú sa ranníoc do Chiste Leanaí na Náisiún Aontaithe. <Col N="756" /> Os a choinne sin, áfach, tá a chomhmhéid d'ardú sa ranníoc do Ghníomhaireacht Fóirthinte agus Oibreacha. Tá £2,000 de laghdú sa ranníoc do Fhórsa Práinne na Náisiún Aontaithe toisc gur chinn Stáit áirithe íocaíochtaí saorálacha a thabhairt in éineacht le na gcuid ranníoc.  Sa chaoi sin ní bheidh an t-ualach comh trom céanna ar thíortha eile.</P>
    <P>Sa Vóta le haghaidh Gnóthaí Eachtracha is ea a dhéantaí roimhe seo an £500 a sholáthar le haghaidh síntiúis do dhá Dhlí-Chomlacht Idir-rialtais. Meastar gurb oiriúnaí an caiteachas seo a mhuirearú ar an Chomhar Idirnáisiúnta.</P>

      <P>Tá an aistriú ag teacht.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, at the last Session of the General Assembly our delegation was particularly involved in the introduction of two Resolutions both of which were ultimately adopted. The first was the Resolution submitted by the Federation of Malaya and Ireland on the question of Tibet.  That Resolution was adopted on 21st October last by a vote of 45 to 9 with 26 abstentions.  The second was the Resolution, of which we were the sole sponsor, on Prevention of the Wider Dissemination of Nuclear Weapons.  That Resolution was adopted by a vote of 68 to nil with 12 abstentions on 20th November last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are only a few points that I need make here in relation to these two Resolutions as the course of the proceedings regarding them was very fully reported in the Press here.  The booklet &ldquo;Ireland and the United Nations 1959&rdquo; which has just been published by Messrs.  Browne &amp; Nolan and is available in the Dáil Library, carries the full text of both Resolutions <Col N="757" /> and also the full text of all statements made by me in relation to them.</P>
    <P>First, as regards Tibet, I think all of us here, sharing the same feelings of resentment at what has been done to that small people by their powerful neighbour, will regret that the United Nations was not able to take more effective action in relation to Tibet than to pass the Resolution sponsored by Malaya and ourselves.  There were however formidable difficulties barring the way to any more effective action. One difficulty was of course that the United Nations can only take action&mdash; as distinct from making recommendations&mdash;through the Security Council, not the Assembly, and that in the Security Council the Soviet Union would certainly veto any proposals to which the Peking Government objected.</P>
    <P>The second difficulty was that many countries&mdash;perhaps the majority in the United Nations&mdash;regard Tibet as legally a part of China.  That, as Deputies are aware, is the position, not only of the Peking Government but also of the Government of Formosa which represents China at the United Nations. For many countries which are in diplomatic relations with one or other of these Governments the situation presented itself, therefore, as a Chinese internal problem and this point of view was brought out by many speakers in the debate.  Several leading countries, take a conservative attitude on Article 2.7. of the United Nations Charter&mdash; the article that forbids the United Nations to intervene on matters &ldquo;essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of a member nation.&rdquo;  These countries took a correspondingly reserved attitude on the question of Tibet. A third difficulty was of course that a number of important Asian countries held that the Peking Government, not being represented in the United Nations, was not answerable for her actions to the Assembly.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, not only was it impossible to secure any substantive international measures in relation to Tibet, but it was a matter of some difficulty to place the question on the Agenda at all and, having done so, to secure the necessary degree of support for the Resolution.  However, <Col N="758" /> the Resolution was eventually carried with only 9 votes against it&mdash;the votes of the nine Warsaw Pact countries led by the Soviet Union.  This result was by no means a foregone conclusion; and at one stage it seemed probable that, in view of the Chinese representation situation, a number of Asian votes would be cast against any such Resolution.</P>
    <P>Great efforts were in fact made to secure Asian votes in opposition to the Resolution.  That these efforts failed was due in great part to the devoted efforts of our friends in the Delegation of Malaya as well as to the unofficial Tibetan delegation headed by the Dalai Lama's brother, Mr. Gyalo Thondup.  The final result was regarded as very satisfactory by most members of the United Nations, in that it showed that China's acts of oppression in Tibet found no support outside the Communist world.  This in the view of many delegates&mdash;including several from Asian countries which had abstained on the actual voting&mdash; was of considerable importance as demonstrating that aggressive actions against weaker neighbours have wide and unfavourable repercussions in world public opinion.</P>
    <P>The Resolution which we sponsored for the Prevention of Wider Dissemination of Nuclear Weapons is now before the Ten Power Disarmament Committee.  The dangers of a wide diffusion of nuclear weapons are so serious that great Power agreement to prevent the further spread of these weapons and the acquiescence of other Powers in such an agreement constitute a great common interest of humanity.</P>
    <P>The object of our Resolution was primarily to focus attention on the dangers which exist and secondarily to suggest a possible set of measures for dealing with it.  We believe that the large vote in favour of our Resolution at the last Assembly, as compared with the reserve it encountered in the previous year, is some index of a growing international consciousness of the need to restrict the specific dangers involved in the spread of nuclear weapons, as distinct from the ever present danger involved in the existence <Col N="759" /> of such weapons at all.  We all must hope that the Ten Power Disarmament Committee will be able to achieve a sufficient measure of agreement, in the face of danger common to all humanity, to stop the present progress towards indefinite, dissemination of these weapons.  At present the fact must be faced that the outlook in that respect is uncertain.  All that a small country can do is to keep trying and hope for the best.</P>
    <P>The present voluntary and indefinite suspension of above-ground tests by the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain is welcome but of its nature precarious, and progress towards agreement on cessation of tests, accompanied by inspection, has been slow though not entirely insignificant. Agreement on cessation of production still seems far off.  Agreement on destruction of existing nuclear stocks seems almost impossible to achieve in the absence of international confidence or of some scientific discovery making effective inspection possible in this field.  It is, however, precisely because we feel that progress in disarmament is likely to be painfully and dangerously slow that we decided to concentrate upon the most dangerous aspect of the arms race and to do what we could to prevent a further deterioration in an already dangerous situation; in other words, our approach was that, if the situation cannot be cured, let us at least stop it becoming worse.</P>
    <P>We also took part in the debates on many other important problems coming before the Assembly.</P>
    <P>As regards the French nuclear tests in the Sahara, we appealed to the Government of France to test its nuclear device, if at all, underground in conditions which would not add to the radiation in the Sahara and in the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>We abstained on a draft Resolution on the Algerian question which called for negotiations leading to self-determination because it seemed to us that its passage might have unfavourable repercussions on the hopeful prospects opened up by General de Gaulle's statement of 16th September 1959. While subsequent events have again <Col N="760" /> demonstrated the difficulties in the way of a settlement, it is our earnest hope that a spirit of understanding and accommodation on both sides will bring about a solution to this very difficult problem on the basis of self-determination for the people of Algeria as proclaimed by General de Gaulle last September.</P>
    <P>Our delegation again supported the Indian proposal for a discussion on the issue of Chinese representation in the United Nations.  Our grounds for doing so were the same as in previous years and have already been discussed by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We also supported the view that the United Nations is entitled to express an opinion on the racial policies of the Union of South Africa.  Since our admission to the United Nations we have held in common with the very great majority of member nations, that the Government of South Africa is embarked on a policy which is disastrous for the South African people and for the world.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to say that we are not actuated by any hostility towards that country and that we have always tried to express our views on this problem with moderation and due regard to the difficulty of securing a peaceful change which will safeguard the rights of all sections of the South African people.  As the House is aware the Government of South Africa, following the tragic events at Sharpe-ville, which shocked the conscience of the world, has agreed to discuss the situation with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.  We must all hope and pray that these discussions, which will take place this summer will be fruitful of good and will avert further tragedies in that country.  In view of these pending discussions, the House will understand that it is not desirable for me, as Minister in a member Government of the United Nations, to comment further on the state of affairs in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The Assembly again considered the long-standing, complex and grave problem of the million Arab refugees, living in camps around the borders of Israel.  We voted for a Resolution which asked the Palestine Conciliation <Col N="761" /> Commission, consisting of the United States, France and Turkey, to endeavour to secure the implementation of that part of a previous Assembly Resolution which provided that those refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so and that those, who did not wish to do so, should be compensated by Israel.  I very much fear that unless some honourable compromise can be found, the Arab refugee problem will continue to poison the situation in the Middle East and dangerously affect international relations.  In the meantime the United Nations' teams in the Middle East continue to perform a very useful function.  I may add that officers of our Defence Force have been rendering with distinction a valuable international service in the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation which observes the implementation of the Palestine Armistice Agreements.</P>
    <P>Refugee problems generally&mdash;in Central Europe, in the Far East and in North Africa as well as in the Palestine area&mdash;have become more familiar to the Irish people as a result of the World Refugee Year.  The response to the Irish Red Cross appeal has been and continues to be a generous one.  Up to the present a sum of approximately £60,000 has been realised.  The Irish Red Cross are to be heartily congratulated on the result of the appeal, and I trust that the individuals and firms who have not yet subscribed will do so without delay.</P>
    <P>The success of the World Refugee Year could probably eliminate the refugee problem altogether in certain areas of the world and would greatly diminish it in most.  Even in the case of the most intractable refugee problem&mdash;that of the Palestine Arabs&mdash; the success of the appeal can considerably improve the prospects of solution, especially by making rehabilitation programmes possible.  At present the sum available to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the maintenance and rehabilitation of these refugees works out at little more than 8d. per head per day.  It is clear that such a budget leaves hardly any margin <Col N="762" /> for educational or rehabilitative work; it is indeed remarkable that the Organisation, with such limited means, can provide for the subsistence and health of the refugees.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland have recently been given a valuable insight into refugee problems by Father Pire, the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1958.  I feel that our thanks are due to the new and thriving United Nations Association for its initiative in inviting him to visit us.  Father Pire was an eloquent spokesman for the hapless victims whose cause he so nobly espoused.</P>
    <P>In surveying our United Nations activities I have only touched on some of the problems coming before the main Political Committee, but, of course, much of the most important, and fortunately less contentious, work of the organisation relates to other fields and is discussed in the Committees which deal with economic, legal, social, humanitarian and cultural affairs.  Our very effective representation on these Committees has contributed significantly to the building up of the influence of the Delegation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Our Delegation is small and is heavily taxed by the requirements of analysis and consultation posed by the many delicate and controversial issues arising in all seven main Committees. Little time is left for the considerable effort required to secure inscription on the Agenda and to pilot the passage of resolutions such as the two on which our Delegation took a leading role in the last Assembly.  While it is hardly likely that such circumstances will recur, it is certain that the demands on our small team will continue to be heavy.  Among all the Delegations attending the Assembly ours is, by far, the smallest of those that play an active rôle in the proceedings.  I feel it right to say this because in the past there have been suggestions that our Delegation may be excessive in size.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government have put forward the name of Ambassador Boland, our Permanent Representative to the United Nations, as a candidate for the Presidency of the General Assembly. <Col N="763" /> A number of countries were kind enough to urge us to nominate Ireland's representative for the Presidency, and promised their support. The position of President of the General Assembly of the United Nations is a heavy responsibility as well as a high honour.  It is because we feel that our Permanent Representative has in abundant measure the qualities required for such a responsible office and that, under his Presidency, the Assembly would conduct its business efficiently and fruitfully, that we hope for the success of his candidature.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that almost exactly a year ago the Council of Europe celebrated the tenth anniversary of its founding.  I think the House will agree with me that the developments of the past year, so crucial a one for Europe, have demonstrated the importance of an organisation which brings together in a common forum the parliamentary opinion, not of six or of seven, but of fifteen European nations.</P>
    <P>The same cohesive spirit is now more than ever a vital element also in the work of the Council's technical Committees, which have again this year a record of considerable achievement to show.  The European Social Charter is reaching its final stages after exhaustive consideration both by ILO and the Assembly; the Conference of Posts and Telecommunications Administrations convened with the approval of the Council is now established and functioning as a permanent body; the Council's Cultural Fund, created in May 1959 and financed by voluntary subscription from the Government and other sources, has settled down under its Administrative Board to implement a wide and varied programme of encouragement and subsidisation; in the domain of Human Rights the establishment of the European Court has brought the entire machinery provided for in the Convention into force; the Committee for the Simplification of Frontier Formalities continues to report concrete progress with which we in this country are steadily keeping pace.</P>
    <P>In many other fields, of practical <Col N="764" /> interest to us all.  Conventions are under consideration covering such matters as consular regulations, arbitration in private law, treatment of legal persons, foreign money liabilities, liability of hotel-keepers, the exchange of television programmes and the prevention of crime and treatment of offenders. From all these painstaking and devoted efforts towards harmonisation and co-operation a stronger sense of European solidarity continues to emerge, unspectacularly perhaps, but steadily and surely.  It is, I know, a source of satisfaction to the Dáil, as it is to me, that Irish representatives have carried their full share of these activities.</P>
    <P>During the years 1957/58 and 1958/59 the grant-in-aid for cultural relations was reduced from its earlier figure of £10,000 to £2,100.  Consequently the number of cultural activities assisted by my Department, with the advice and co-operation of the Cultural Relations Committee, had to be reduced to a bare minimum and the majority of Irish cultural activities abroad had to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>During 1959/60 the grant-in-aid was increased to £7,000, thus permitting the reconstitution of the Cultural Relations Committee, and a renewal of the Department's efforts to spread a knowledge of Irish culture in foreign countries.  For the current financial year the figure has been increased by a further £2,000 to £9,000.  There is no doubt that, considering the very limited funds available, the work of the Cultural Relations Committee in increasing a knowledge and appreciation of Irish culture abroad has been most valuable.</P>
    <P>Projects for the coming year include the publication of further booklets in the &ldquo;Irish Life and Culture&rdquo; series, the distribution of films and other material and assistance to a wide variety of bodies concerned with the promotion of a knowledge of our national heritage abroad.</P>
    <P>The provision for Information Material is the same as last year's&mdash; £8,000.  The amount now being provided for will finance the operations of the Information Section of the Department.  Included among these <Col N="765" /> is the publication of a weekly Information Bulletin which, with an overseas circulation of over 8,000, is a valuable medium for the dissemination of topical information on current significant events in this country and Government policy generally.</P>
    <P>We have had many letters from readers abroad expressing their appreciation of the Bulletin in general and their interest in particular items carried in it.  The Bulletin represents a great single item of expenditure under this Subhead.  The Information Section also has the function of ensuring that the Department's Offices abroad have adequate stocks of such information media as books on Ireland; gramophone records of Irish music; photographic prints; and such suitable films as can be made available within our limited budget.</P>
    <P>These items are in constant demand from foreign cultural and educational bodies, journalists, lecturers, and authors&mdash;to name but some of the classes of interested individuals and groups.  It is clearly important that provision be made for the supply of information material of this nature. I should like here to express the hope that in future years we shall be able to make available the resources, both in staff and material, for a more extended effort in this very important field.</P>
    <P>With regard to the OEEC, the Taoiseach referred in the course of the Adjournment Debate on 26th April to the Report of the Group of Four charged with making a study of the reorganisation of the OEEC in the light of changes which have occurred in the European economic situation since the OEEC was originally established and so as to enable the U.S.A. and Canada to become full members of the reorganised body.</P>
    <P>The Report and the draft of a Convention for the reorganised body are being considered by the Government. A meeting of senior officials of the twenty Governments concerned, i.e. the eighteen full members of the OEEC and the two associate members &mdash;U.S.A. and Canada&mdash;was held in Paris at the end of last month and <Col N="766" /> arrangements were made for a detailed examination of the draft Convention.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that the establishment of the two trading groups&mdash; the European Economic Community and the European Free Trade Association &mdash; in Europe raises certain problems for this country.  I do not propose to enter into the substance of these problems which have been fully explained in various statements by the Taoiseach.  I should mention, however, that we are represented on the Committee on Trade Problems which met in Paris from 29th-30th March last to discuss future trade relations between the EEC and EFTA and between these groups and other countries, with particular reference to the situation which will arise when tariff reductions are made by both groups.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the meeting of the Committee in March it was decided that information should be collected and analysed as to the effect of the various proposals for tariff reductions.  I, myself, have since had discussions in Paris with the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Luns, the Netherlands Foreign Minister, on the position of Ireland in relation to these matters.  The Committee is to meet again this week.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Trade Agreement with Britain, we have concluded trade agreements during the past year with France, Finland and Germany, fixing the amounts of the quotas for the import of non-liberalised goods of Irish origin.  I should state here that, as far as industrial goods are concerned, the need for securing such quotas is diminishing rapidly owing to the increased liberalisation of these goods. Difficulties are, however, still being encountered in securing adequate quotas for our agricultural products.</P>
    <P>As the House knows there was recently held, under the aegis of the United Nations, an important conference on the Law of the Sea.  This was the second such Conference organised by the United Nations.  That of 1958, while it achieved substantial agreement in respect of all other aspects of this great subject of international law, failed to reach agreement on the breadth of the territorial sea and exclusive fishery limits.  The recent conference <Col N="767" /> was called in the hope that it would succeed where the first conference&mdash;and indeed the Hague Conference of 1930&mdash;had failed.  Unfortunately these hopes were not realised, but the conference failed by the narrowest of margins.</P>
    <P>Of a total of eighty-eight States represented fifty-four, including Ireland, voted for the joint United States/Canada proposal, twenty-eight voting against and five abstaining.  Had even one of those voting against the proposal abstained the necessary two-thirds majority would have been obtained. The joint proposal which failed so narrowly would have permitted States to have a six mile, or narrower, territorial sea measured from the applicable baseline with exclusive fishing jurisdiction up to twelve miles subject only to the right of those States, which could prove historic rights, to fish in the outer six miles; and even these rights would disappear at the end of a period of ten years.</P>
    <P>As was stated in Geneva by the leader of the Irish delegation, the Attorney General, we believe that this proposal should have satisfied those States which sought increased fishery jurisdiction over their coastal waters while at the same time providing for a period of readjustment for the fishery States.</P>
    <P>Although a two-thirds majority was not reached in Geneva for any proposal, it is questionable if the conference can properly be described as a failure.  The problem facing the conference is a very old one; and it is one of such complexity, because of the extraordinary diversity of interests of the States concerned, that it must be regarded as a major achievement that fifty-four States could find common ground in a single short proposal.  This very fact gives hope for the future.  Age-old questions of such intricacy may not be resolved at the first or second attempt; but in view of the remarkable progress that has been made, we should not despair of finding a reasonable and generally acceptable solution.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions have already <Col N="768" /> been made for a further effort to secure agreement, such as another conference and the conclusion of an agreement between those countries who voted for the U.S./Canadian proposal. As I have stated more than once in this House our preference in the matter of extended fishery limits is to get agreement with other States rather than to take unilateral action. Accordingly the Government are watching anxiously all suggestions for a solution in this important field because they believe that international agreement is desirable not alone in our own interests but for the development of the rule of law.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>It will be noted by most observers on the foreign affairs of this country that the Minister, and the Government of which he is a Member, have maintained what can only be described as an equivocal silence on the principles which guide the foreign policy of the present Government, and in the speech which he has just read to the House the Minister has maintained that silence.  For those who do not follow in great detail the speeches of the Minister and the activities of his Department there will be some value in the remarks he has made to the House in that they afford a brief résumé of what the Department, and the Minister as head of the Department, have been doing over the last 12 months or so but, for those on this side of the House and outside it who feel the country is entitled to know what are the principles of foreign policy which this Government are following, there was nothing in the Minister's speech to indicate what that policy is, or to give us and the country what we are entitled to know, namely, the principles guiding him in his activities in the United Nations and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of this equivocal silence it has been our task to try to interpret the Minister's speeches and votes in the United Nations and to ascertain from these speeches and votes what principles are guiding the present <Col N="769" /> Government, what principles are informing and moulding the actions and votes which they take and give in the United Nations Assembly.  For the purpose of trying to ascertain the views of the Government on this important matter we, on this side of the House, have asked the Minister whether he agrees with the principles which we suggested should guide our actions in the United Nations.  We asked this question on more than one occasion and I make no apology to the House for asking it again because, if it is wearisome to the House to have repeated what we say should be the principles guiding this country in the United Nations, the blame must lie on the Minister and the Government who have not answered the question.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that we have asked the Minister on more than one occasion whether he accepts the three principles of action which our Minister for External Affairs laid down in, 1956, and that the Minister has refused to answer the question.  I hope note will be taken by those who concern themselves with these matters if the Minister, in the course of his reply to this debate, again refuses to answer the question.  I want to recall to the House that in 1956 the Minister for External Affairs of the then inter-Party Government made a speech in which he laid down the three principles of action which would guide his Government in the United Nations.  He said, first of all, that it would be our task in the United Nations to secure the observance of the Charter of the United Nations Organisation; secondly, it would be our task to maintain a position of independence, judging each question on which we have to vote on its merits; and, thirdly that we should do what we can to preserve the Christian civilisation of which we are a part and, with that end in view, support whenever possible those Powers principally responsible for the defence of the free world in its resistance to the spread of Communist power and influence.</P>
    <P>The question which I would have thought would have been a simple one to answer is whether the Minister and the Government accept those three <Col N="770" /> principles?  If he does, then the debate on this Estimate may take a very different turn, though we may be forced to criticise the Minister and the Government for errors of judgment in the application of these principles, but if he does not accept them, then there is a wide divergence of opinion between the two sides of this House on the foreign policy the country should adopt.  As I say, because of the absence of any clear statement of principle from the Minister or any of his colleagues, it is our task to try to interpret what has been said and done, and to try to gauge from what actions have been taken in the United Nations Assembly and elsewhere what are the fundamental principles of action directing the Government's policy.  That task has not been an easy one for us, one reason being that the Minister's own colleagues have interpreted in rather different ways the actions taken by him over the last three years.</P>
    <P>Deputies no doubt will recall that the Tánaiste referred to the present Minister as a non-committed statesman, and he criticised his predecessor for what he called stringing along uncritically and unthinkingly behind the Western bloc.  Apparently the Tánaiste thought there was a considerable difference between the Minister for External Affairs in the present Government and the Minister for External Affairs in the previous Government. He felt our Government was stringing along uncritically and unthinkingly behind the Western bloc whereas his Government did no such thing but, quite recently, a member of Fianna Fáil spoke at a debate in Kilkenny and his view was that there was no great difference between the foreign policy put forward by this Government and that of the previous Government. Deputy Booth's view was that the foreign policy of this country had not altered except in degree and what he described as political emphasis.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues have spoken little on foreign affairs. The Minister has spoken not infrequently in the United Nations but, on foreign policy as such, little has been said by him or any of his colleagues <Col N="771" /> either in the House or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister departed somewhat from the practice which he had heretofore adopted.  Up to last year he had treated the House in a most perfunctory manner.  He had given a brief introductory speech in Irish which an accountant from his Department could as well have done and in replying to the debates in this House, up to last year, he spoke very briefly and did not deal with many of the matters on which this House and the country were entitled to get his views.  But, last year he did depart from that practice and he spoke at some length, as he did this afternoon, giving an outline of what he had done and said in the United Nations for the previous twelve months but, as for principles, it was very difficult to discover any concrete statement other than a few observations which can only be described as of a most platitudinous nature.</P>
    <P>Last year, when introducing his Estimate, the Minister said&mdash;he was dealing with world problems then&mdash; that our part in regard to such world problems was to make the best contribution we could to the consideration of the issues involved as they arise at the United Nations.  We were to do the best we could.  I hardly think that such a statement can be regarded as an important statement on foreign policy.</P>
    <P>In his reply to the debate the only statement that could be regarded as anywhere approaching a declaration of principle was when he said that the rôle of the Irish delegation in the United Nations&mdash;and I am sure at this point many Deputies were interested to know what the rôle of the Irish delegation was&mdash;was not to exhaust our energies in denouncing injustice and war, much as we detest them, but to make constructive contributions to the search for true peace.  The first statement was that we were to do the best we could and the second statement was that we were to work for true peace.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody in this House would disagree with those views, nor <Col N="772" /> anybody in the world for that matter. If the Minister were to wish that all men would be good or if he were to wish that he would have fine weather on his holidays, we would all support such views also but, for statements of foreign policy, we find little or nothing there and nothing in to-day's speech to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one matter to which I should refer <i>en passant.</i> During the course of his reply last year to the debate on the Estimate the Minister criticised some of the speeches made in the course of the debate.  He criticised in particular Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon and described them as &ldquo;loud mouths&rdquo; and bellicose participants in the cald war.  He clearly indicated that such types of speeches were not the types of speeches that should be made in the United Nations General Assembly.  It is a curious thing that within a few months after that the Minister himself and bellicose participants in the cold war, and I think quite correctly, in the motion he put down dealing with the matters that arose so tragically in Tibet.</P>
    <P>The Minister having criticised us on this side of the House for what he called this loud-mouthed and bellicose participation in the cold war, did himself in quite a significant degree participate in the cold war and was criticised in the United Nations for so doing, for having dispelled the rather weak ectoplasm of the spirit of Camp David, for threatening to break down the mood of <i>détente</i> that was then thought to be in existence, and the very criticisms which were levelled against us by him last year were levelled against him in the United Nations Assembly a short time subsequently.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, as I say, we must search around to try to discover what the Minister's attitude is towards world affairs and, in particular, our rôle in the United Nations.  I want to say unequivocally that I do not regard our country as being an uncommitted country and I do not regard it as our rôle to be such a country as the uncommitted groups in the United Nations, such as Yugoslavia, Egypt or part of the Afro-Asian group.  We <Col N="773" /> I repeat, are not an uncommitted country and if it is the view of this Government that we are, if it is the view of this Government that we should take up a more neutralist position than that of its predecessors, then I think, as I said earlier, there is wide divergence of views between the two sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The reasons which make us believe that the Government are taking up a different attitude from that of their predecessors are the type of speeches which the Government, through this Minister, have made in the United Nations and the way they voted on a number of crucial issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister made very brief reference to the vote of the Irish delegation on the question of the representation of China.  I want to refer to it at some greater length because I think it is of considerable importance.  To my mind, there are two possible attitudes to be taken to what is, after all, one of the great world problems of the present time, namely, the problem of Communist China.</P>
    <P>It is possible, first, to take the attitude that it would be desirable and in the interests of peace that Red China, the Peking régime, should be represented in the United Nations; or, it is possible to take the other view, namely, that it would be dangerous for that Organisation, that it would increase considerably the Communist influence in the Far East, that it would disrupt the admittedly tenuous links that are there in the Far East at the present time keeping the peace and that, for these reasons, at the present time it is undesirable that Red China should become a member of that Organisation.</P>
    <P>As I say, there are people, honourable people, who hold these two separate views, divergent and different. I myself believe that the arguments are overwhelmingly against, at the present time, the recognition of Red China by membership of the United Nations.  Neither of these is the Government's view.  The Government try to take up a middle position which I believe to be an intellectually dishonest one and a nationally damaging <Col N="774" /> one to this country.  The Government say that they have not yet made up their mind whether Red China should be or should not be in the United Nations.  The Taoiseach last year came into the House and said the Government had not yet made up their mind as to whether Red China should be in the United Nations or not. It was repeated by the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    <P>What facts are lacking, what information do the Government want that they have not got in order to make up their mind as to whether it is desirable or not that Red China should be in the United Nations, and when will they make up their mind?  Supposing the Minister is successful in the Assembly next Autumn and supposing he gets his discussion on Red China and supposing there is a vote to be taken on the issue of whether the Peking regime or the Formosa régime is to have the China seat in the United Nations, what is the Minister going to do?  Will he telegraph home to his colleagues to ask them then to make up their mind?  Surely it is an intellectually dishonest position to say that the Government have not yet made up their mind?  The facts are there. The facts can be weighed up one way or the other.  To say that the Government, after three years of experience of this matter, are not able to know which way they will vote, seems to me to be a most extraordinary statement.</P>
    <P>The Minister's position was, however, that not having made up his mind on the matter as to the representation of Red China, he was in favour of a discussion of the subject.  Let me recall to the House the words which the Minister used addressing the Assembly last year when he said that he was in favour of discussion on this matter.  He said he was in favour of a discussion, not a formal and inconclusive confrontation of rigidly opposed views but a careful deliberation leading to a generally-acceptable, constructive solution.  This must have caused some amusement even to the most hard-boiled and experienced delegate in Turtle Bay.  Rarely, I would suggest, could delegates to the United <Col N="775" /> Nations Assembly who are accustomed to meaningless phrases and platitudinous aspirations have heard them both so deftly combined in a statement such as that given by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There was to be a discussion which was to lead to &ldquo;a generally-acceptable, constructive solution.&rdquo;  I presume that many of the Deputies who are interested in these matters will have read the debates in the United Nations Assembly on this matter.  The Minister was present and had been present for two hours previously.  He said he was not in favour of a formal and inconclusive confrontation of rigidly opposed views, but the facts of the situation, as known to anybody who reads the debates and as they must have been known to the Minister, were such that it would have been impossible to have a debate of that sort on a subject of that nature and the pages of the United Nations Assembly's debates practically burn with the denunciations of the Americans and of those who supported the United States on this matter by the Communist group.</P>
    <P>It may be desirable, it may be a nice idea to have a gentlemanly, fair and reasonable discussion on it but to think you are going to get such a discussion in the circumstances of the present time is, I suggest, illusory and dishonest because it must be known that such a type of discussion could not be held.  If there was no prospect of such a discussion; if in fact all the scars of the cold war were to be exacerbated again, if in fact the type of discussions held in previous years in which there was this confrontation of bitterly opposed views&mdash;if that was the type of discussion to be held surely it was our duty, even if in favour of such a discussion, to vote against it under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think I cannot put it any better than the Greek delegate who spoke in the United Nations Assembly on this aspect of this statement of the Minister on the matter.  The Greek delegate said that the settlement was the goal and not the discussion and <Col N="776" /> if, in fact, the discussion which the Minister favoured was to make more difficult the settlement which we all desire, I think it was our duty, even with this equivocal attitude of not making up our minds on the matter, to vote against the motion then before the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no reference in his remarks to the proposals made by him for several years concerning disengagement in Europe.  In fact, the Minister's proposals in this regard amount to suggestions for the neutralisation of Germany.  His proposals, with regard to disengagement, are directly contrary to the declared foreign policy of the West German Government and the Government of the U.S.  I can see no reason for the Minister's suggestion in this matter; it is wrong for him to suggest&mdash;as he did in the reply to the debate last year &mdash;that there were certain professional military men who do not like his proposals.  It is wrong to infer that it is only professional men who are against such proposals as his for disengagement in Europe.</P>
    <P>A book published quite recently deals with this problem of disengagement. I think there have been over 100 different types of proposals put forward under the generic term of &ldquo;disengagement.&rdquo;  I certainly am not going to deal with them all or with the Minister's own particular brand but, to suggest that disengagement in Europe has been opposed only by a few military men, is not the truth. Disengagement in Europe has been espoused by the British Labour Party; it has been supported by some elements in the Social Democrat Party in Western Germany; there are no other political groups that I know in Europe that have supported any of the existing proposals for disengagement.</P>
    <P>The idea of a <i>détente</i> in Europe is, of course, one with which every person would agree.  The attitude of the Christian Democratic Party as expressed in the Council of Europe, the attitude of the Liberal Parties and of the Socialist Parties, with the exception of the British Labour Party, and some of the German Socialist groups, <Col N="777" /> has been that any proposals dealing with disengagement would be to the disadvantage of the West and to the advantage of the Communist bloc. Then the Minister goes out to the United Nations and makes proposals for the neutralisation of Germany and disengagement in Europe which are directly contrary to the expressed foreign policy of Powers friendly to this country and directly contrary to the views of influential people in Europe and elsewhere, people to whose views we should have particular regard.</P>
    <P>As I am dealing with this proposal of disengagement and the attitude of the British Labour Party on it, may I say that it might not be a bad thing if the Minister were to give up his subscription to the <i>New Statesman and Nation</i>?  I find myself in considerable sympathy with a number of views of the British Labour Party but I am not in sympathy with any views expressed by certain wings of that Party on foreign affairs.  It does, indeed, happen all too frequently that the funeral baked meats of the <i>New Statesman and Nation</i> are coldly furnished forth in the United Nations by the Minister.  It is a curious, almost ironical development, that the Minister, who believes in the restoration of the Irish language, who thinks that because we speak English we shall be under the dominance of Great Britain or an alien culture, should be so influenced by British Labour Party thinking on this problem. To think that the views of the British Labour Party on foreign affairs are the views of all progressive, Liberal and Socialist people is wrong and is not the fact as the Minister would find if he took the trouble to discover what the position is among the Socialist Parties of Europe.  He would find that the British Labour Party is very frequently opposed by the Socialist groups on the Continent, particularly by the French Socialists, by the Austrian Socialists and by the Socialists of the Benelux countries.</P>
    <P>We said that it would be an elementary principle for any Government to seek to avoid by their actions and by their speeches unnecessary offence to friends of this country abroad.  We have been accused by various parties, <Col N="778" /> sometimes of boot-licking, and sometimes of stringing along behind the Western bloc because we were of the view that it was an elementary principle that one should have regard to the views of one's friends and not give unnecessary offence to them.</P>
    <P>The Government, and the Minister in particular, have endeavoured to pose as seagreen incorruptibles; they have endeavoured to signify that they will not play politics and that they will have regard to every measure that comes before the United Nations strictly without regard to the views of anybody else. It has been, I think, worthy of note that, in fact, the Minister has had particular regard to the views of some countries that are traditionally friends of this country.  I refer particularly to France.  The Minister's attitude, generally speaking, with regard to the French has been correct but I desire to point out what, in fact, his attitude has been.</P>
    <P>About 18 months ago at the United Nations General Assembly the Minister made proposals against the wider dissemination of nuclear weapons and he suggested that they should be kept by the existing nuclear Powers and that they should not be disseminated further.  Who were the existing nuclear Powers?  They were the United States, Britain and Russia.  It was not until the earlier part of this year that France became a nuclear Power.  But France was included in the Minister's resolution of 18 months ago and it was suggested then by the Minister that the four nuclear Powers should maintain their nuclear weapons and not distribute them any further. France was not then a nuclear Power and France was not a nuclear Power this spring when again these proposals were brought before the assembly.</P>
    <P>That may have been good tactics. France may have been included in order to get votes for the Resolution but that was not the attitude of the Minister.  In addition there was the extraordinary position that arose when it came to the Sahara test vote when, in order to become a nuclear Power, France had to set off her own bomb. The Minister apparently accepted that but he gave no support to the French <Col N="779" /> view that they were entitled to set off their own bomb.  He indicated that perhaps, after all, the French should not let off the bomb that would make them a nuclear Power.</P>
    <P>Having gone a bit far on the Sahara resolution, he felt he should not support the Pakistan resolution in favour of self-determination for Algeria although the previous year the Minister had voted for a resolution of a similar character.  The Minister may have been right on the vote for the Pakistan resolution and he may have been right in including France as a nuclear Power, when everybody knew she was not, but to suggest that we are stringing along behind our friends and have no views of our own and that the Government have declined to do so and will not play politics does violence to the truth.  The fact is that that principle is an elementary one of politics, national and international. Our criticism of the Government is not that they have not adopted that principle but that they did not have proper regard to it when a number of important matters came before the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the work in the General Assembly to which I wish to refer.  The newspaper reports on the matter of Ireland's vote for the non-permanent member of the Security Council have been rather scanty and the Minister made no reference to it in his speech this afternoon.  The reports which I have been able to get appear to indicate that the Government voted for the Communist bloc nominee against the nominee put forward by the Western bloc.  Deputies will recall that there was, last year, in the Assembly a considerable trial of strength between the Eastern and the Western blocs on the question of the non-permanent seat.  The Communist bloc put forward Poland and the Western bloc, and particularly the United States, put forward Turkey.  As I understand from the newspaper reports, we voted for Poland as against Turkey.  If that is correct I would be glad if the Minister would explain how he feels that the best interests of this, country are served by such a vote.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a very brief <Col N="780" /> reference to affairs in Europe in the course of his remarks here today.  I want to charge him and the Government with indifference and neglect of European problems.  It may not be generally realised that the Minister has not spoken once since he became a Minister in the General Assembly in the Council of Europe.  Deputies know that that Assembly is a Parliamentary assembly and that representatives from the Council of Ministers come there from time to time to speak to that Assembly.  It is not of little significance in European affairs and it has been ignored by the present Minister who has not spoken once to that Assembly.</P>
    <P>I understand also that he did not attend at the recent meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe.  I feel that we should realise in this country the importance of the Council of Europe, not only for Europe generally, but also for this country.  I feel it wrong for an Irish Government to ignore it and that it is in our national interests to strengthen it as best we can.  The Minister is not serving this country by failing to attend at these meetings, and failing to express our views there and failing to contribute what he can to the aims and objects of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>The reality of the situation in Europe at the present time very substantially reflects on this country.  It is known that there are differences between the Community of the Six and the Association of the Seven but it is not generally appreciated that they are very real and appear to be very deep. If there is no real coming together between these two blocs it will have very serious repercussions on our future.  This country is a European power and it should play the part of a European power even though it is a small one.  To ignore the Council of Europe, the one vehicle we have for expressing our views and for influencing developments, is very wrong.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the future of the O.E.E.C.  The unexpected and sudden demise of the O.E.E.C. is to be regretted but there is little that we can do about it.  I have no great hopes for the future of the new <Col N="781" /> organisation that it is proposed to build on the ruins of the O.E.E.C. Certainly on the basis of existing information it does appear that the new organisation will be an even less powerful body than the one whose place it is taking.  I would have welcomed the views of the Government on the developments that are taking place there.  It would be of considerable assistance if, instead of telling us that committees are meeting and that delegates are being sent to these meetings, the Government would inform us of their views and of their attitude to these developments so that we can have a full debate on them here.</P>
    <P>It should be our task to see that the divisions in Europe are healed as quickly as possible and that the new Organisation which is coming into being will not in effect perpetuate those divisions.  The Minister very correctly paid a tribute to the work of our Ambassador at the United Nations, Mr. Boland.  We are most fortunate in having a person of Mr. Boland's great integrity and experience, knowledge and intelligence.  We on this side of the House sincerely hope his candidature will be successful.</P>
    <P>By way of conclusion might I reiterate very briefly the principal point I wish to make in this debate.  If in fact we in this country could have a bi-partisan foreign policy, I should like to think as President de Valera, the then Leader of the Party of which the Minister is a member, said here in 1956, that there are not any wide, deep differences between the two sides of the House.  That is why we are entitled to know what are the principles of action guiding the Government. If the Government believe that we are an uncommitted State, if they believe that it is not our duty to support whenever we can the Western democracies in their struggle against Communist countries, then there is indeed a deep cleavage between us. We believe that our views on this matter, and not the Government's, reflect the traditions of the Irish people, that they represent the true principles which should guide our conduct in world affairs and would serve our <Col N="782" /> interests and the interests of the Christian civilisation which we and our friends in the Western democracies are endeavouring to support and defend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to intervene in relation to the last of the three principles that Deputy Costello mentioned on which he challenged the Minister, that the policy of any Irish Government ought to be to support the actions of those countries in the world standing for Christian civilisation and to be prepared to support those Governments and those Powers acting in defence of that civilisation or the Power upon which the defence of that civilisation against the Communist forces depended.</P>
      <P>We have a very long tradition in this matter.  When Deputy Costello speaks about Ireland being a Power, the Power of which we think is not a Power in the sense expressed in our National Anthem: &ldquo;Soldiers Are We.&rdquo; Unfortunately the circumstances that gave us our National Anthem, whose strains are now carried out to the world on official occasions, were circumstances which disturbed the atmosphere for the composing of a National Anthem.</P>
      <P>In looking at the situation to-day we must bear in mind the roots of our strength and the roots of our civilisation.  I do not want to go exhaustively into this matter now, but it deserves to be referred to in this discussion.  When the Minister and his colleagues, in common with ourselves, were originally being drawn into the work of politics in Ireland and into the consideration of world affairs in general, Europe was a very different place from what it is to-day. The France, the Italy, the Germany and the Britain that we knew, seemed to us in our youthful days to be monuments of strength and of common sense.  We certainly saw no signs on the horizon to indicate that the Italy, the Germany, the Spain and the Austria we knew would tear themselves to pieces as Europe has torn itself and has been torn to pieces in the two great Wars that have since intervened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were quietly expecting that in the general operation of our political <Col N="783" /> life in Ireland, we were coming to a point in which an Irish Parliament would be set up with, if you like, limited powers, but that through the instrumentality of this institution, in which there was fair representation for all, the differences and the antagonisms that developed from political consequences would be exorcised.</P>
    <P>Going back to that time we see an extraordinary resemblance and similarity in the heart cries that were issuing then and the heart cries that are bursting through the statements and public pronouncements to-day.  I remember in 1910 reading a work of Monsignor Bougaud, Bishop of Orleans, writing in 1880 and describing the circumstances of that particular time.  Parallel with and in juxtaposition to some of the writings to-day, we see an extraordinary resemblance as between the two epochs, on the one hand, and the much greater power of catastrophe to-day on the other.</P>
    <P>The Bishop of Orleans, writing at that time, with a pen which, he said, was knocked out of his hand by the guns of Reichoffen and only put back into his hands in the middle of the Commune, described what appeared to him to be then the extraordinary and unprecedented developments taking place in the century which was drawing to a close.  Eloquent voices had stirred thought, releasing liberty throughout the world, and aspirations of hope and contentment for people.  The Alps had been pierced and the Pyrenees crossed. Communications were passing with the speed of light from one end of the world to the other.  The science of geology had come into its own.  Sciences generally were opening up new knowledge on the material aspects of the world in a way hitherto unprecedented and unthought of; that which was thought impossible to-day was shown tomorrow to be within the compass of mankind.  The advances made then are regarded as kindergarten developments and discoveries compared with modern advances.</P>
    <P>Stress was laid on the fact that side by side with these developments greater possibilities of disaster and destruction were facing mankind generally.  And <Col N="784" /> the cry went forth that nothing would save the people except religion.  At that time the Bishop of Orleans did not of course foresee the disasters which would be brought about by the First World War and the Second World War.  To-day, science has astonished itself.  Developments have occurred that were beyond the imagination even of anybody writing towards the close of the last century.  Writers to-day, who write thoughtfully and observantly, are telling us much the same tale.  Professor John U. Nef of Chicago University says that science has armed itself to-day with weapons which would be safe only in the hands of God, and nothing can save the people of the world except religion. It is the same cry as that which was heard at the end of the last century.</P>
    <P>We find philosophers like Guardini and de Chardin, men steeped in philosophy and science, as well as being distinguished priests of the Catholic Church, writing from a purely scientific point of view in relation to the world situation, asserting that it is not economics, and it is not materialism, but emotions, that will dictate how the world will move tomorrow. There are men like Guardini saying that political, economic, and other affairs, in the modern world will be in the hands of massed men; that men have lost their traditional roots; that the traditions which moulded civilisations are going, if not completely gone, and forecasting that in a world of that kind, those who stand for religion, for the essential element of what connotes western civilisation, will have a greater martyrdom to face, and greater labours, than were ever faced, or even conceived, in any past age.</P>
    <P>It is because voices and forces are being raised on the political and scientific side in this particular way that we, as a small nation, are challenged by our traditions.  We are faced with the question then, holding on to those traditions, as to what extent we are preparing our intelligences and our intellects for the work that has to be done.  To what extent are we trying to bring about a common understanding which will strengthen our minds <Col N="785" /> and unify our feelings in order to arm us to face the future?</P>
    <P>The third point Deputy D. Costello made this evening is one of vital importance.  I suggest it is, perhaps, the most vital element in our approach to foreign affairs.  It is not just a question of a plan.  Principles are involved. So are unity of feeling and approach. Deputy D. Costello talks of a bipartisan approach to foreign policy.  I do not see where the &ldquo;bi&rdquo; comes in.  A certain job requires to be done.  There is a certain element in our people's strength, in our people's nature, and in our people's thought.  Certain matters were referred to along certain lines by Government speakers here during the debate on proportional representation. It was alleged that Ireland's political work, and all that flows from it, should be done through the medium of two massed Parties in opposition in our Parliamentary institution.</P>
    <P>It would, I think, be wrong to face foreign policy on a purely pro and con basis.  That could not supply the answer if we understand and properly evaluate the traditions of our people in the field of international co-operation which various Christian communities are endeavouring to bring about to-day.  It is not a question of a bipartisan or a tri-partisan approach.  It is a matter of enabling those who constitute our Irish Parliament to appreciate our traditions and the manner in which we should express ourselves to-day in the light of those traditions in relation to issues of vital importance at international foreign affairs level. These are matters which have a vital influence on western civilisation and are deeply bound up with religion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello has dealt as fully as possible with the statement made by the Minister, and I wish to reinforce his representation that, as far as Government policy on foreign affairs is concerned, the Minister has not done much to enlighten us.  I think it behoves him to answer the question addressed to him by Deputy Costello as to the foundation on which the foreign policy of the country at present lies.  I want to renew to the <Col N="786" /> House the representation I have made before, and that is that the vital, the essential test of foreign policy is whether it serves the vital interests of Ireland.  I think any other approach to foreign policy is illusory and pregnant with great danger both to ourselves and to our friends.</P>
      <P>It is right to defend principle; it is right to champion the right against the wrong; but all these things must be consistent with the vital interests of our country.  I consider that one of the most vital interests of a small country, in the tempestuous world in which we all now live, is to multiply the number of its friends.  I sometimes detect in the attitude of the present Minister for External Affairs a desire rather to cause alarm, uncertainty and confusion in the minds of those on whom we traditionally look as our friends rather than that sense of confidence and regard, which, I think, could be of very vital interest to Ireland as a whole.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise again what I have repeatedly submitted to this House.  There is no need for this country to adopt a subservient policy or dependent attitude in our external relations.  Nobody expects it of us, and fortunately our natural friends are not the kind of friends who demand that from us.  It is true that if we were in the position of the satellites of the Communist countries we would be obliged to submit to that kind of dictation from Moscow and Peking. But I imagine all sides of this House would agree that our friends are to be found among the democracies and those who support freedom and individual liberty in the world.  In my experience certainly, such countries never expected from their friends subservience or the submission of their judgment to the judgment of their friends.  But they have expected, and they have a right to expect, where their vital interests are concerned, where they are the traditional friends of Ireland, that, if Ireland's vital interests are not in conflict, then Ireland will support her friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, they readily recognise and expect even where their vital interests are concerned, where <Col N="787" /> Ireland believes her vital interests legitimately conflict with theirs, that Ireland will defend her vital interests even at the expense of theirs.  But they do expect what we ourselves would expect, what we ourselves would have a right to expect, and that is, that if a friend has to part company with us, he should have at least the consideration to tell us why and he should allow our ways to part with the least possible injury to the legitimate feelings of either of us.  In short, if we are to be the good friends of those whom we wish to have as good friends, we should act like good friends.  It should be our desire to avoid on every possible occasion confounding our friends to the satisfaction of our enemies.</P>
    <P>I think one of the greatest mistakes the present Minister for External Affairs makes is that he believes it is an adequate substitute for friendship to acquire a reputation in bodies like the United Nations of being so unpredictable that everybody must deal with him on the basis of <i>minima fides</i> rather than <i>maxima fides</i> because you will never know what he will do and say next.  I quite agree that if you manage to establish that reputation in an international gathering such as the United Nations, you may acquire the description of being bouncy, interesting and unpredictable, and that may acquire for you a good deal of limelight and publicity.  But those of us who have such long experience of public life as the Minister and myself ought to realise how ephemeral is the value of limelight and publicity when considering the long-term policies of a small nation in a very disturbed world.</P>
    <P>I should much prefer the respectful friendship of influential friends than the intrigued admiration of columnists and sensation-mongers who consider that only that which makes people gasp is news.  We can always make people gasp by letting down our friends at difficult moments.  We can always get a little publicity by double crossing at unexpected moments those who trust us.  We can always acquire a certain amount of temporary influence by acquiring a reputation for being unpredictable <Col N="788" /> and prepared to do the unexpected, but, in the long run, I believe we do it at the expense of the vital interests of Ireland, and in so far as we do that, I think that this Government and this Minister have on more than one occasion been gravely mistaken.</P>
    <P>There is a good barometer by which to judge whether the foreign policy of our Government is serving the vital interests of Ireland, and that is to ask ourselves how far our foreign policy is helping our foreign trade.  I certainly cannot see that in that respect our activities in the United Nations or elsewhere have been paying very large dividends.  I am by no means one of those prepared to take the popular line of denigrating our foreign representatives in the various capitals in which our Government are represented or where their trade attaches are doing a valuable service or where there are consular officials doing useful work as well.  However, I believe it is not at all improbable that if the general foreign policy of our Government were more clear and more predictable, these officials could produce very much more substantial results in trade benefits which would serve the interests of our people.</P>
    <P>There is one matter on which I should like to have the Minister's comment when he is replying.  He referred at some length to World Refugee Year, which is now coming to a close, and very properly congratulated the Irish Red Cross on their efforts to raise money as a contribution to the general fund.  I think the Minister was right in referring to the extreme complexity of this whole refugee problem.  Whether it is a problem capable of solution by voluntary effort is, I think, a matter open to doubt.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would probably agree that expert inquiry into the details of the Palestine refugee problem revealed that there are complexities there which are not capable of solution by direct measures of relief. It has been suggested to me that at this moment one could inaugurate a scheme designed to evacuate all the <Col N="789" /> refugees in all the camps in Palestine but that over a period of 10 years the influx of additional refugees would be such as to leave the problem at the end of that period almost as great as it is today.  How actually one is to reach the end of the problem of the added refugees is a very difficult question, and it does occur to me that, with the best intentions in the world, to attempt to deal with the problem piecemeal may operate no more than to perpetuate the problem.  If the problem is to be dealt with effectively there must be a massive effort forthwith by a commission of Governments who would take all the existing inmates of all the camps and provide for them at one stroke and close up the camps altogether.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, as the Minister has rightly said, this standing menace to the peace of the Middle East may continue to wax and wane but never cease, and well-intentioned efforts to reduce the net refugee problem in that area may, in fact, instead of reducing it, extend and perpetuate it.  These are extremely difficult questions and the Minister himself, or our delegation, is not in a position to make recommendations in regard to them because we have not got the resources to make any very large contributions.  It is the Great Powers, who have the resources, who must ultimately resolve this business. Perhaps the Minister would give consideration to the aspect that ameliorative measures may do more harm than good, that what is wanted is inter-Governmental action which would bring permanent remedial action to the whole problem as it is at present constituted in the camps to which he has referred.</P>
    <P>Unhappily, the question is not one exclusively of the Arab refugees.  There are now, in every country, refugees from Middle Europe.  I understand we have here in this country a certain number of refugees, some from Hungary, some from elsewhere, who have been settled in one way or another in employment but who are in the unhappy position of being Stateless persons who are working out the <Col N="790" /> protracted period of residence necessary to qualify for naturalisation.</P>
    <P>I wonder could we not consider as a special gesture in this World Refugee Year the cases of those refugees we have settled here and who apparently intend to make their homes amongst us.  I think it would be a gesture well worthy of consideration&mdash;that, in order to mark this international effort to help the refugees, we should shorten the period of residence necessary to qualify for naturalisation for any persons who are here as refugees and whom we intend to allow to remain permanently resident in Ireland.  It certainly will not make any formidable contribution to the world refugee problem&mdash;it is not within our power, with our resources, to do that&mdash;but it would be a gesture and might set a headline for other countries where a corresponding gesture might do great good.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain, when he is concluding&mdash;if there is an explanation&mdash;how he thought it was in our interests to vote for the Communist nominee from Poland instead of the Western bloc nominee from Turkey for the temporary post on the Security Council?  These are the kind of gestures which I think do an infinity of harm.  I do not suppose anyone could maintain that it was in the vital interests of Ireland that we should have a Pole rather than a Turk on the Council of the United Nations, but it was manifestly a matter of very deep interest and prestige to our friends that the Turk should be appointed rather than the Pole, and it is in circumstances such as these that, it seems to me, we ought to support our friends rather than our natural enemy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to add a word to what Deputy Declan Costello stated on the subject of our attitude in regard to the discourse as to the admission of Red China to the United Nations, but I do want to say that I agree most emphatically with him that it is highly to be deplored that we should be flapping about the world, proclaiming that we have not made up our minds on that issue, and that we shall not be able to make up our minds on it until it has been discussed at the United Nations.  I think that is part <Col N="791" /> of the folly of our Minister for External Affairs and the Government he represents in desiring to create sensations rather than take a long-term view of the vital interests of our country.  I would urge on the Government that, pleasant as they and the Minister for External Affairs may find the limelight of the United Nations, there are more important matters to be considered than temporary notoriety.</P>
    <P>I endorse what the Minister has said in regard to our permanent delegate to the United Nations and I recall with satisfaction that the Government of which I was a member, and of which Deputy Cosgrave was Minister for External Affairs, sent him where he now is.  I have no doubt that if he is chosen for the responsible position of President of the General Assembly he will reflect well not only upon Ireland but upon the United Nations itself, and he will certainly have the best wishes of all sides of this House in the responsibilities he will be called upon to shoulder.  If he is not chosen, that is as may be but I think it is probably right now to state that, if he should be chosen for that position, he will have the confident support of all sections of this House, in the firm belief that he is eminently equipped to discharge the responsibilities of such a heavy office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to enter on the plane of international politics; neither do I intend to descend to the level of the parish pump, but I think the Minister has left one matter open by not referring to it and that is the question of Partition.  It was one of the promises which Fianna Fáil held out when they were trying to secure office that they had a solution for Partition.  Unfortunately that solution has gathered a lot of dust and seems to be forgotten.  Maybe the Government and the Minister were too occupied with Tibet, China, and other countries to descend to the level of the political platform again but the people do not forget this.  I merely raise the question as one of the election promises, one that was fair game, especially for the Minister when seeking <Col N="792" /> power.  So much for Partition; there has been very little about it to-day.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what method his Department has adopted in making selections for international exchange scholarships?  It has been very hard to get any information on this matter from the Department, and I think he should make that information readily available.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I have already mentioned on the Vote for the Department of Justice and I think it concerns the Department of External Affairs as well.  That is the question of the advisability of introducing visas for children leaving this country.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that Irish children of very tender years have been found wandering around London.  I would suggest that children under 19 years of age should not be allowed to leave the country without visas, or without permission from their parents.  It is a question that is causing a great deal of concern to parents and it is very strange that these children can board a boat at Dún Laoghaire or the North Wall just as easily as they can board a bus.  That is all I intend to say about it but I should like the Minister to take some action because it is something which could lead to a lot of abuse if not attended to officially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up where Deputy Coogan left off in relation to the question of our young people emigrating to Britain.  There is no doubt whatever that the Minister and his Department have a responsibility to Irish parents to look to the moral and material welfare of our young people, who all too frequently fall by the wayside when in foreign countries.  This is a very serious problem in Great Britain where there are at present 1,000,000 people of Irish birth.  Most of them have emigrated since the end of the war and in all there are 4,000,000 people of Irish origin there.  Most surely it is the function of our Ambassadors abroad to help our people when they get into trouble, to give them a leg up over the stile when they fall.  Let us face up to <Col N="793" /> the facts; some of our people let themselves and their country down.  That is most unfortunate and we cannot pretend that the problem does not exist by choosing to ignore it.</P>
      <P>I think it is not unfair to say that over quite a considerable period the policy of the Department of External Affairs has been to ignore this problem. Probably it was felt that it was undesirable to take any step which would serve to encourage emigration to Great Britain but that, I think, is a very shortsighted, unrealistic and futile policy.  I know that the matter has been frequently considered in the Department and I believe it to be true that at one time it was thought in the Department that the question of seeing to the welfare of our young people in England was a matter which primarily was best left to voluntary organisations, mostly religious organisations, and there is no doubt that the zeal which inspires such organisations is the proper mainspring upon which the Government very rightly should rely. Over the past three years there has grown up, primarily I think at the behest of the Irish Hierarchy, a splendidly inspired movement of voluntary workers who cater for the welfare of our people who fall into trouble in Britain, and a movement also designed to stop them from falling into trouble.  That, after all, is the sensible approach to it.</P>
      <P>What is the problem?  The problem is a very grave one.  It takes many forms.  At its worst it is a moral problem, the problem of the unmarried mother, the problem of drunkenness, disorderliness and the problem of those who jeopardise their souls.  At its best it is a problem of the country boy or country girl in a strange environment, unable to face up to the rigours of a society where Christian standards have largely lapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main purpose in referring to this matter is to point out to the Minister that this splendidly inspired voluntary movement has developed in recent years and, secondly, to point out to him that that voluntary movement is tremendously handicapped by lack of funds.  I do not want anyone to think that Deputy Paddy Byrne has a bee <Col N="794" /> in his bonnet about this matter and is expressing purely a personal opinion. If I may, Sir, I should like to quote from a most authoritative source, the January, 1960, issue of the journal, <i>Christus Rex,</i> published under the imprimatur of the Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, from Saint Patrick's College, Maynooth.</P>
    <P>At page 59, under the editorial notes, the following is said:</P>
    <P>And it is the considered opinion of all those who are dealing with the problem that the number of Irish boys and girls&mdash;many of them really children &mdash; arriving penniless and jobless into English cities is something of a national scandal.</P>
    <P>For that reason no praise can be too great for the brave souls who have undertaken the work of providing Irish centres for our emigrants. To our shame it must be said that successive Irish governments have refused to help and have washed their hands of responsibility for Irish citizens.  But it would be dishonest if we did not point out that the response from the Irish people as a whole has been thoroughly disheartening, and the Irish centres have been forced to depend in large measure for their foundation and their continued functioning on that mammon of iniquity, the football pool, and other similar methods of collecting funds.</P>
    <P>You have there very strong denunciation of official policy in relation to our emigrants in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>One most serious aspect of this problem is the prevalence of drunkenness amongst our people and on that point it is important to quote from another very worthy publication, the journal <i>Blackfriars,</i> published by the Dominican Fathers, English Province. In a recent issue, March, 1960, they have this to say:</P>
    <P>Thus in some centres where there are a large number of Irishmen, something like fifty per cent. of the &lsquo;drunk and disorderly&rsquo; cases on Saturday and Monday morning will be young Irishmen, sometimes mere youths of sixteen and seventeen.  In fact, the marvel is that many more <Col N="795" /> do not get into trouble, for their lodgings are unattractive, and in many cases they are not allowed to stay in after their evening meal, and so must roam the streets or go to public-houses.</P>
    <P>We must all have tremendous sympathy for the young men of sixteen to eighteen years of age in a strange environment, living in squalid &ldquo;digs&rdquo; at a high rent which they can ill-afford. Small blame to them if they resort to public-houses.  They have nowhere else to go to meet their countrymen and to have a bit of pleasant society. I am afraid it is only too true that young fellows who never touched a drink while they were in this country start drinking, some of them far too heavily, when they find themselves at sea in Britain.  They seek some solace for the pangs of loneliness in the public-house.</P>
    <P>There has been an effort to establish Irish centres for these young people. The Columban Fathers are doing tremendous work in Britain but they themselves would be the first to agree that their efforts are on a very trifling scale.  If they had the money they could do tremendous work.</P>
    <P>The voluntary effort about which I have spoken is deterred from doing even finer work than it is doing purely by lack of funds.  In particular, the work being done by the Legion of Mary is most praiseworthy indeed. There is not an Irish mail train arriving at Euston station which is not met by representatives of the Legion of Mary and we in this country are under a tremendous debt of gratitude to these people who are doing this fine work on our behalf.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister that he should accept in principle that Government funds should be made available where needed.  I am happy to say that in a recent issue of the journal <i>Hibernia</i> the suggestion of forming an emigrants council was adverted to.  If the Minister would accept that obligation in principle, much would be achieved.</P>
    <P>Again I want to quote, this time from the report of the Commission on <Col N="796" /> Emigration and other Population Problems&mdash;page 139:</P>
    <P>We learned in evidence that there is much support for the view that some type of social bureau should be established in Great Britain to look after the welfare of our emigrants there.</P>
    <P>At the end of that paragraph the report says:</P>
    <P>If it were then considered necessary that there should be an initial grant of reasonable amount to help to establish a bureau we think it should be provided out of State funds.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister's predecessor, shortly before he left office, was contemplating the appointment of a welfare officer in the Embassy in London.  I do not think that that is going nearly far enough.  Indeed, I feel, as I think the Minister's advisers felt, that the voluntary impulse behind this movement must be preserved at all costs and, for my part, I would be satisfied if the social welfare organisations catering for this problem in Britain were given the green light and if funds were made available to them so that they would no longer be dependent on the penny pool and the sixpenny raffle.  Certainly, it would ease the minds of many worried parents in this country if the Minister were to accept in principle that obligation.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I am not advocating that we should encourage our people in Britain&mdash;there are so many of them&mdash;to set themselves up as a class apart from their neighbours. I recall Bernard Shaw's advice to his fellow-countrymen in Britain shortly before his death when he was invited to become a patron of the Irish Club. He declined, and said that the best advice he could give to his fellow-countrymen was not to see too much of one another and to integrate themselves with their &ldquo;fellow-Britishers&rdquo;, as he termed it, as quickly as possible. Perhaps he expressed it in a manner which some here would consider offensive&mdash;I do not know.  Certainly, it was good advice.</P>
    <P>The people to whom I refer are a very small minority.  We can be very <Col N="797" /> proud of the fact that the vast majority of our people in Britain are splendid citizens of that country and of this country also.  That the vast majority of them succeed in fitting themselves in so well is a tribute primarily to their own individual worth, character and integrity and also, I think, a tribute to British tolerance and goodwill for our people who are certainly made most welcome there.  We need never worry on that score.  Our people, by and large, are certainly not regarded as foreigners no matter how much some Deputies would choose to regard the English people as foreigners here. If anything, our people are regarded, perhaps, as wayward children and are held in great affection.</P>
    <P>So many of our people are working in Britain and sending money home that it constitutes another reason why the Minister should face up to this obligation.  Surely the vast amount we are receiving in emigrants' remittances imposes on us a reciprocal obligation to return some of these amounts to those who need them, but, in relation to the vast number of our people who are there and who obtain employment there, which they cannot find at home, it is appropriate that we in this Parliament should acknowledge the friendship that has been extended to them.  For my part, I thank God for the fact that the privileges of British citizenship are so freely extended to our people: we would be in a poor plight if they were not.  Let us face up to this: we now choose to regard ourselves as foreigners in Britain, but there are up to 100,000 Italians at present in a long queue clamouring to enter Britain and they will not be admitted because they are not entitled to the privileges of British citizenship and are debarred from taking up employment in that country.</P>
    <P>I have very little more to say on that aspect of the problem except to implore the Minister to face up to the problem and to drop the pretence that it does not exist.  It is futile to ignore it any longer because it is too serious a matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan queried the Minister about Partition.  I suppose some other Deputies will have something to <Col N="798" /> say about it before the debate ends. I do not wish to say very much about it except to record how much I welcome the change in the emphasis of public policy which has developed here recently.  We are now extending the hand of friendship and co-operation to our fellow-country men in the North.  Thank goodness for that; it was not always so.  I recall in my childhood, twenty-five years ago, when the Lord Mayor of Dublin at that time went up to Belfast to attend the opening of a water-works there, the furore there was from the Minister's Party.  It is well we should remember that, and I welcome the development and evolution of Fianna Fáil policy.  I welcome the fact that Fianna Fáil are now prepared to extend the hand of friendship to our fellow-country men.</P>
    <P>I am about to express an unpopular opinion, one which will probably be unpopular with all my listeners.  I shall probably be misquoted but the fact that it is unpopular or that I may be misquoted will not stop me from expressing it.  I think there is some merit in the viewpoint put up occasionally by the Ulster Unionists when they say that, as far as Partition is concerned, it is we in the Twenty-Six Counties who are partitioning ourselves from our kinsfolk, our fellow Celts, perhaps, in Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland.  May I say frankly that I greatly regret that Ireland is no longer a member of the British Commonwealth? I believe that common sense demands some form of recognition of our common interests with the people of Britain and with our fellow Celts in Scotland and Wales.</P>
    <P>I have a very simple analysis of the Irish struggle for freedom in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries; I think it was primarily a struggle for social freedom, a struggle for reform, primarily a class struggle.  A similar class struggle was also taking place in every other European country.  The common people of Ireland and of Britain, both having come into their heritage of freedom, both having taken control of their own destinies, should in my opinion combine where possible for the <Col N="799" /> advancement of their mutual interests, to serve humanity and Christianity. These are evil times in which we are living and we cannot afford to perpetuate dissension among those of us who strive for the same goal.</P>
    <P>I remember a Labour journal that was at one time published in this city. I forget the exact name of it, but blazoned across the front page of every issue in banner headlines was: &ldquo;Workers of the World, Unite.&rdquo;  That, I suppose, was the clarion call of international Socialism but there is a lot of sense in it.  We are all workers nowadays.  Essentially, I deplore the fact that we are no longer members of the Commonwealth because we have a particular flair for leadership and we have contributed very considerably to the advancement of Christianity and to the development of civilisation throughout the English-speaking world and the place where our contribution has been most significant is the British Commonwealth countries. There is more Irish blood in the Commonwealth than in any other part of the world.  We could do tremendous good for humanity if we were still participating in that effort. Nations, like individuals, get more when they give to others than when they make egotism and chauvinistic nationalism the overriding goal of their ambitions.</P>
    <P>We share with the Scots a flair for leadership of the unimaginative English people.  We should not lose this talent but should use it for the good of humanity and the British Commonwealth provides the best scope for the use of that talent.  We should strengthen our ties with Australia and with Canada too.  What a tragedy it is that we, who contributed so much to the constitutional development of the Commonwealth and who made it possible for Republics to be members of the Commonwealth, were absent from the recent Commonwealth conference and were unable to participate in extending the hand of friendship to the African and Asian countries there present?  I recall that Michael Collins anticipated that the Commonwealth would develop into a league of free <Col N="800" /> States.  That situation has now come about but we were absent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I, first of all, want to call attention to the statement of Deputy Declan Costello, that we voted against Algerian self-determination. That is not so.  We voted for resolutions calling for self-determination for Algeria many times.  In the United Nations last year a resolution was put forward which contained a clause calling for self-determination for the Algerian people.  Paragraph 5 of that resolution which was concerned with the stoppage of hostilities in Algeria said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Recognising the right of the Algerian people to self-determination&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We voted for that clause.  We abstained on the total resolution because we held that it should have contained a clause recognising that General de Gaulle had offered self-determination to the Algerian people in September, 1958.  It was completely wrong for Deputy Costello to say that we had changed our policy in regard to self-determination.  We did not.</P>
      <P>I do not think that it is any sort of valuable exercise to debate general principles stated in general terms.  It is much better to test the general policy of the Minister by examining in detail the actions which he took.  I am prepared to be judged and the Government are prepared to be judged by our acts or lack of action in any international matters in which we should appropriately have acted.  We are not bound to comment on every incident in international affairs.  We have the freedom to remain silent as well as the freedom to speak and sometimes it is valuable to keep silent just as on other occasions one must be prepared to speak one's mind and to represent clearly and definitely where one's country stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which arose, and which has not been discussed before, was this question of refugees.  Deputy Dillon suggested that we should stand for mass international Government action to get rid of the refugee problem in the Middle East.  I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Dillon's <Col N="801" /> approach to that question.  Indeed, three years ago we suggested in the United Nations that a mass general effort should be made to settle the Arab refugee problem.  It is not merely a matter of finance but I said on that occasion that it would pay us all, even if it cost us $1,000 a head, to settle the million Arab refugees once and for all.  It would pay us all to contribute our proportionate share of that amount.  One or two hydrogen bombs would cost more than it would cost to deal in a wholesale way with the Arab refugee problem.  But, of course, that effort could not be contemplated unless there was some better agreement between the Israelis and the Arabs.</P>
    <P>The Arab refugees are very insistent that they will be content with nothing less than resettlement on the lands from which they were driven.  One can sympathise with their attitude. Certainly a great number of them were driven out by force and others went in sympathy without direct pressure upon them but it is difficult to get the Israelis on the one hand and the Arabs on the other to accept a settlement which would permit a reasonable number of the Arab refugees to return and which would permit the remainder to be settled where they could in Arab countries.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that if the wholesale approach of mass international co-operation to raise the funds necessary to deal with the problem were possible it would be the correct way to do it.  As far as we can give support to that idea and to the preliminary steps necessary to make it possible, we shall do it.</P>
    <P>Another question raised and which has not been raised before was that of under-age children going to Great Britain, and the care that should be taken of them across the water.  Deputy Byrne and Deputy Coogan referred to the problem and Deputy Coogan suggested that we should issue visas to these young people and not allow any of them to leave the country without a visa.  A visa is a paper issued by the recipient country and not by the country which a person is leaving. However, I know what Deputy Coogan has in mind, that we should have <Col N="802" /> some system of permits which would be presented at the boat, train, plane, or wherever necessary, and that young people who appear to be under 18 or 19 years of age would not be allowed to leave without such a paper.</P>
    <P>We had such a system during the war when travel permits were necessary, but that system was workable only by the co-operation of the British.  They had an interest in seeing that people who were not fully authorised should be kept out of Britain.  To-day there are no travel permits between Ireland and Great Britain and there is no way of stopping any young person who has a little bit of intelligence finally reaching Great Britain by slipping across the unfortunately-created land frontier.  I do not think what the Deputy suggests is a solution.  However, I do not reject it out of hand.  I am certainly prepared to examine it in conjunction with the Department of Justice to see whether there is anything we could do in that regard.</P>
    <P>Some of the reports quoted by Deputy Byrne as to drunkenness and disorderliness by some of our people in Great Britain are largely exaggerated. Young people sometimes are boisterous without being drunk, and I do not think there is any more drunkenness&mdash;in fact, I would say there is a great deal less&mdash;than among other elements who live in England.  It would be absolutely impossible for us to take responsibility for the large number of Irish people and people of Irish extraction in Britain.  They are a large enough community and in sufficiently affluent circumstances to take care of themselves or of the strays from the Irish community in the various cities.  In fact, the Irish community in various cities have come together and put up the money for the founding of various hostels and amusement places to which young Irish people are invited to go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I grant they are restricted for funds, but the effort will have to be on a voluntary basis, first of all, in Britain and, secondly, here. <Col N="803" /> I have discussed this with a number of people from Great Britain and with representatives of these charitable organisations to which Deputy Byrne refers and for which I have great admiration.  I pointed out to them that when a Government spend money they have to do so by rule.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General and all the red tape attached to Government accounts enter into it, whereas money that is collected on a voluntary basis can be spent more freely and the people issuing it can decide, having interviewed, say, two persons with the same story to tell, which is the more deserving case.</P>
      <P>Recently we have had a number of highly successful drives to raise funds for charitable purposes.  The Red Cross Society have on a number of occasions raised funds for disasters abroad.  This year they are raising money for European refugees; they have raised over £60,000 already and the year is not yet closed.  I certainly would be very sympathetic to some drive like that being made here by organisations of a charitable nature. If they came together for that purpose I do not think the Irish people would refuse provided they were certain that the recipients of the money on the far side were well organised and could be relied upon to administer the funds in a fair, reasonable and honest way.</P>

      <P>I know, but it would have to be organised and I for one would be prepared to co-operate in any such suggestion.  Those were the three matters of some note that were raised.  I do not think I need follow Deputy Costello or Deputy Dillon into matters that were discussed here before in great detail.  We voted for the discussion of the representation of China on a couple of occasions and it was discussed here.  Anybody who wishes to see what my opinions are on that can read it in the Dáil Official Report or they can read it in the collected speeches in the United Nations.  It is not necessary to deal with them now because I have nothing to add and I do not like repeating myself or quoting <Col N="804" /> myself from these various statements.</P>
      <P>On the question of trade which Deputy Dillon suggested we were jeopardising by our activities and our stand at the United Nations, I do not think that the results bear out that contention.  In fact our external trade is growing.  We are exporting more industrial goods than ever we did before and this year we have had improved opportunities of export to France, West Germany and other countries; indeed in some cases where we have opportunities to export we are not able to fill the quotas which would be allowed to us.  Our delegation has given a very good account of itself and I am grateful for the way in which the members of the Opposition received our proposition for nominating Ambassador Boland for the position of President of the United Nations.  If elected, I feel sure he will act in a manner of which the country can be proud.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,431,670 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1961, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power including certain Services administered by that Office and for payment of a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>Provision was made for the services now administered by my Department in the 1959/60 Estimates for Votes Nos. 50, 51, 52 and 68.  In the current year's Estimates these services have been brought within the ambit of one Vote No. 48&mdash;Transport and Power. For convenience of comparison with the 1959/60 Estimates a statement has been added at page 247 of the Book of Estimates showing the subheads for 1960/61 with the corresponding Votes and Subheads for 1959/60.</P>
      <P>The Estimate of £3,646,670 for Transport and Power for the year 1960/61 compares with a total of £3,242,177 granted in 1959/60, including a Supplementary Estimate for £140,000&mdash;subhead 1.4.  The provision for this year, therefore, shows a net increase of £404,493 compared with the provision for last year, 1959/60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal increases in a gross increase of £1,026,565 are in the provisions for Salaries, Wages and Allowances, £106,896 (subhead A), constructional works at Dublin Airport, £255,000 (subhead H.3), Cork Airport, £275,000 (subhead H.4), Technical Assistance £36,500 (subhead M) and Rural Electrification £143,900 (subhead O).  Other increases amount to £51,575 and bring the total to £868,871.  To this must be added a decrease of £157,694 in receipts (subhead Q&mdash;appropriations in Aid) mainly on Landing Fees £90,000 (Q. 11) catering Sales Service £110,000 (Q. 18) offset by an increase in receipts from Grant Counterpart Funds £35,000 (Q.4) and Lettings of Offices etc. £8,200 (Q. 12). This decrease is equivalent to an increase <Col N="806" /> in the net Estimate, making a total increase of £1,026,565.</P>
    <P>The principal decreases are in the provisions for Redundancy Compensation&mdash;C.I.E. £149,000 (subhead F.2), Grants for Harbours, £99,352 (subhead G), Constructional Works at Shannon Airport £115,000 (subhead H.2), International Organisations, £35,140 (subhead L) and Fuel Subsidy £200,000 (no provision in 1960/61).  Other decreases amount to £23,580 making a total decrease of £622,072 which when offset against the total increase of £1,026,565 gives a net increase of £404,493 in 1960/61 compared with 1959/60.</P>
    <P>The increase of £106,896 in the provision for salaries, wages and allowances is mainly due to increases in remuneration, as from December, 1959, (£36,000) and to an increase of 65 posts in the Engineering, Architectural, Aeronautical and Air Traffic Control Services (£54,000).  There is also a provision of £15,000 to cover the cost of additional staff, not yet recruited, for such services as Radio Communications etc.</P>
    <P>These staff increases arise solely from increases in the various services provided by the Department and are not attributable to the creation of a separate Department for Transport and Power.  The total number of posts provided is 936 an increase of 65 compared with 1959/60.  The additional posts in Headquarters of Minister, Secretary and Deputy Assistant Secretary have been offset by the suppression of a post of Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Secretary in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The last occasion on which Deputies had an opportunity to consider in detail the affairs of Irish Shipping Limited in the House was in February, 1959, when the Irish Shipping Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1959, was being debated.  This Act provided for an increase in the Company's authorised capital from £5,000,000 to £12,000,000 and an increase in borrowings guaranteed by the Minister for Finance from £2,000,000 to £5,000,000.  On that occasion the House was informed of the success achieved by the Company and of the need for increased capital <Col N="807" /> to keep the Company's fleet in first-class condition by timely replacements and to provide for additional tonnage. Deputies may recall that attention was also drawn to the very lean times through which the shipping industry all over the world was passing then.</P>
    <P>Since that time the Company have taken delivery of another large tanker so that their fleet now consists of 18 vessels, 15 of them being dry cargo vessels totalling 101,300 tons deadweight and 3 being tankers comprising a coastal tanker of 3,350 tons and 2 deep sea tankers of 18,000 tons deadweight each.  Over the same period 2 vessels totalling 17,600 tons deadweight, which were uneconomic and due for replacement, have been sold while an order for a vessel of 14,700 tons has been placed in Britain, where the necessary berth was booked in 1957.  A contract for a similar vessel has been negotiated with Veroime Cork Dockyard Limited.  In addition 2 vessels due for replacement have been converted to diesel propulsion in lieu of replacement and are back in service.  All the Company's vessels are at present employed.</P>
    <P>When the new vessels have been delivered the dry cargo tonnage of Irish Shipping Limited will amount to 130,700 tons deadweight, leaving a balance of 59,300 tons towards the target of 200,000, which is estimated to be the size of dry cargo fleet required to import national requirements in time of emergency.  The cost of the fleet, including the two conversions but not the replacement vessels on order, was £13.6 million which was met as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The Company's borrowing was arranged with their Bankers towards the purchase of the two deep-sea tankers and is being repaid by subscriptions of share capital in the Company by the Minister for Finance as provided for in the Capital Budget. <Col N="808" /> The borrowing was reduced from £1.8 million to £1.1 million approximately by a payment of £687,000 from the Capital Budget for 1959/60.</P>
    <P>The shipping slump continues with but little improvement.  The tramp freight index of the British Chamber of Shipping was at its lowest of 62.7 in April, 1958.  There is a seasonal tendency for freight to rise during the winter months and to drop again in the Spring.  However, there has been a gain of some 13 points over the last two years from 62.7 at the 1st April, 1958, to 76.1 on the 1st April, 1960.  It will be easily understood that since these figures relate to a base of 100 at 1952 and since costs have risen considerably since then, the rise has been relatively insignificant.  Only the most efficient and economic ships can hope to trade profitably at current rates.  The outlook is for a slow improvement in freight levels.  Leading shipping authorities do not expect any spectacular rise and are so far unwilling to commit themselves to an estimate of the period which may be required to reach generally profitable levels once more.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficult freight rate situation the Company expect to make a trading profit of £216,000 over the whole year 1959/60 before providing for depreciation.  This is considerably better than what might have been expected and, I think, we can fairly claim that Irish Shipping Limited are riding out the storm reasonably well.</P>
    <P>The importance of Irish Shipping Limited in the economy continues to increase.  The activities of Irish Shipping Limited in the last 12 months have ranged over the globe including Canada, the United States, India, Japan, Australia, South Africa, South America and the Near East.  The Company commenced trading into the Great Lakes through the New Seaway and two of their ships&mdash;the &ldquo;Pine&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Oak&rdquo;&mdash;have been specially adapted for this trade.  The total tonnage carried by the Company in 1958/59 was 1,194,000 as compared with 944,000 in 1957/58 and 835,000 in 1956/57.  Over these three years an average of 76% of the total tonnage carried was carried foreign-to-foreign <Col N="809" /> and this proportion tends to increase with the growth of the fleet.  This, of course, represents foreign currency earnings and is a valuable contribution to our Balance of Payments.  Employment given by the Company amounts to about 750 men ashore and afloat. The repair and overhaul of vessels is carried out in Irish Shipyards to the greatest extent practicable.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions from time to time that Irish Shipping Ltd. vessels should be used to a greater extent in the carriage of goods to and from Irish ports.  From discussions I have had with the Company I am satisfied that they never miss an opportunity of profitable trade with home ports.  The number of voyages to these ports is, however, very small, and is not likely to grow.  Indeed I envisage that the proportion of the Company's business done between foreign ports will continue to increase.  This follows from the fact that the Company are engaged in what is perhaps the world's most fiercely competitive industry and cannot afford to trade to any particular port except where remunerative cargoes are available to them, both on the inward and outward journeys.  Official measures to channel trade to our own ships would run counter to our policy of allowing Irish Shipping Ltd. to pursue in peace time the aggressive commercial policy which is necessary if they are to compete successfully in the international shipping market; they would also involve a breach of the international principles to which we adhered when we joined the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation.</P>
    <P>The provision of £120,638 for grants for harbour improvement works is for improvement works in progress at some half-dozen ports, and includes a contingency sum for other works for which grants have been authorised or are under consideration.  Major improvement schemes which have been financed with the aid of State grants are nearing completion at Waterford and Wicklow.  The State is meeting half the cost of the new passenger liner tender for Cork Harbour Commissioners, for which an order was recently placed with Liffey Dockyard <Col N="810" /> Ltd. and a grant to provide half the cost of a second tender has been approved, but the latter expenditure will not fall due to be met in 1960/61. Applications for grants for improvement schemes at Drogheda and New Ross are under examination; applications for further State assistance for additional works have also been received recently from a number of other provincial harbours.</P>
    <P>The application of the Galway Harbour Commissioners for permission to invite tenders a third time for the carrying out of the Galway Harbour Improvement Scheme is still under consideration.  I have recently discussed the whole question with the Harbour Commissioners and hope to be able to convey an early decision to the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The provision in 1959/60 was for a total expenditure on harbours of £220,010, but expenditure in the period reached only £76,276, because certain works did not commence as soon as expected, and a number of major schemes approached completion during the time.</P>
    <P>I should say that, in addition to the grants for harbour improvement works which are made from the Vote for Transport and Power, there is also provision in the estimates for non-voted capital services comprising a total of £100,400, for works at Dublin, Cork and Limerick for which grants from the National Development Fund were approved.</P>
    <P>It is evident from Parliamentary Questions and from correspondence in the Press that there is a widespread interest in the economics of the Irish airports.  Some persons, however, appear to confuse capital expenditure with ordinary expenditure.  It is scarcely necessary for me to point out that it is not correct to debit capital expenditure against the operations of the airports in the year or years in which the money is expended.  In accordance with normal procedure, the proper debit in any year is the interest on the capital and the amount of depreciation. In order that Deputies may have a clear picture of the cost of the airports, I am giving details of expenditure <Col N="811" /> under various heads.  The total capital expenditure on Shannon and Dublin Airports has been £14,586,807 from the beginning up to 31st March, 1960.  The total expenditure on salaries has been £5,377,810.  Total revenue has been £6,948,067.</P>
    <P>In the earlier stages, the operating losses were considerable but as the number of landings increased, the position became more satisfactory.  In the last financial year, 1958/59, for which accounts are fully available, the following was the position:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The financial advantages accruing directly and indirectly to the State and the community under the headings of taxation, balance of payments, employment, tourism and insurance and many other forms of economic activity and national development are considerable. All facilities for air traffic are now available and this country can play a full part in an air-minded world. Apart from their value as facilities for transport, airports give direct and indirect employment and create business activity in their neighbourhood.  An airport is a large employer and a large consumer.  Over 2,000 persons are employed at Shannon Airport and the annual wage bill is estimated at over £1,000,000.  These figures include only those persons actually employed at the airport.  They do not include the considerable additional employment created by aviation activities outside the airport, such as ticket reservation offices, the employment created by activities providing products and services to air travellers and the employment created by construction of works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> I thoroughly dislike continuing transport subsidies of any kind whatever because there is an amplitude of transport facilities.  Whereas I believe that all transport subsidies, indirect or direct, should be discontinued as soon as possible, I am not able to eliminate the deficits at the airports because an increase in our landing charges would materially affect the air fare structure which is subject to international agreement. I shall continue to insist on maximum efficiency in the hope that within the next few years it will be generally realised that in a fully developed transport system, the taxpayer in general should not pay for air travellers.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is possible that with the growth of air traffic the deficits will continue to decline and that landing charges and other revenue will cover depreciation costs.  The figure for last year's operations at Shannon show practically a break-even figure.</P>
    <P>From time to time studies have been conducted by my Department into the comparative costs of operating Irish and foreign airports.  One such review was undertaken in recent months in which the operating costs at Dublin and Shannon Airports were compared with those of major European airports, and found to be generally lower per unit cost indicating that Dublin and Shannon Airports are operated at least as economically as their foreign counterparts.</P>
    <P>To provide for the full economic use of the Aer Lingus Viscount 808 aircraft and to permit of the limited jet operations which Aer Lingus will carry out between Shannon and Dublin, it is necessary to extend the main runway at Dublin Airport from its present length of 5,288 to 7,000 feet and to extend a subsidiary runway (4,800 feet) to 6,000 feet.  The apron accommodation is also being extended.</P>
    <P>A new hangar for jet aircraft, which is being constructed by the Irish Air Companies, is due for completion by the end of the year, when the first Boeing jets are expected by Aerlinte.</P>
    <P>The picture at Dublin Airport is one of intense activity.  During the year 1959 almost 12,300 aircraft <Col N="813" /> landed at the airport, an increase of 6% on the corresponding figure for 1958.  The number of passengers handled in 1959 was over 647,000, representing an increase of almost 15% on the 1958 figure.  The amount of freight handled at the airport was 10,000 tons, representing an increase of over 20% on the 1958 figure.  In addition to Aer Lingus, one Dutch and four British airlines operated scheduled services to and from Dublin Airport in 1959.</P>
    <P>A number of airlines other than Aer Lingus operate air services to and from Dublin Airport under bilateral agreements.  British European Airways operates services from Birmingham, London and Manchester to Dublin in pool with Aer Lingus.  A number of British independent Companies also operate services: Silver City Airways Ltd. from Blackpool in pool with Aer Lingus, B.K.S. Air Transport Ltd. from Leeds in pool with Aer Lingus and singly from Newcastle, and Derby Aviation Ltd. a recently-introduced service from Luton and Derby.  K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines operates in pool with Aer Lingus on the route Dublin/Manchester/Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport is managed by Aer Rianta on my behalf.  The year just closed was a busy one and the surplus on operation&mdash;before allowing for depreciation and interest on capital&mdash; is expected to be satisfactory.  Further expansion will take place this year in line with the growth in air line operation.</P>
    <P>A careful study is being made of the major replanning and development that will be needed if the airport is to cope with the traffic through it.  It is expected that in the next 5-10 years traffic at the airport will grow at a rate at least as fast as has been experienced during the last decade.</P>
    <P>The completion date for the new jet runway at Shannon Airport was for early August.  As, however, I felt it essential that the runway should be completed earlier so that advantage could be taken of the summer season, I have made special arrangements by which the runway will be ready for <Col N="814" /> daylight operation early in July. Although there will be very much increased overflying of Shannon by Transatlantic jet aircraft, I am satisfied that a considerable number of jet planes will continue to use Shannon Airport and the earlier completion of the runway will, I hope, assist in attracting a number of planes which would otherwise by-pass Shannon.  We are beginning to reconstruct the existing apron so that jet planes can be brought close to the terminal building and to provide covered approaches to the building for passengers alighting and embarking.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress on a scheme of extensions and improvements to the terminal building for early completion. The improved accommodation for passengers and public will, it is expected, be adequate for any demands which may be made on the building in the foreseeable future.  A new maintenance hangar has been completed and this has been leased to Seaboard and Western Airlines who propose to transfer their European maintenance activities to Shannon.</P>
    <P>In 1959, while over 9,000 aircraft landed at Shannon Airport, there was a decrease of 20% on the 1958 figure and 12% on 1957 while the number of passengers handled at the airport in 1959, though exceeding 400,000 represented a decrease of 18% on the 1958 figure and 8% on 1957.</P>
    <P>The number of terminal passengers (50,730 embarked, 44,001 disembarked) was down by 2% compared with 1958 and up by 9% compared with 1957.  On the other hand, freight traffic handled at the airport in 1959 showed a very encouraging upward trend.  There was an increase of 21% over the 1958 figure and 46% over the 1957 figure.</P>
    <P>In the first three months of 1960, while there was a reduction of 7% in freight handled, compared with the first three months of 1959, there was an increase of 25% compared with the first quarter of 1958.  Freight in transit increased by 22% over the first quarter of 1959.  It is hoped that industries coming to Shannon will use this airport as a warehousing centre. <Col N="815" /> Modern freight facilities are being provided and it is expected to place a contract shortly for the construction of a new freight building and to complete the project early next year.</P>
    <P>The reduced passenger activity at the airport in 1959 as compared with the 1958 figure is attributable to the introduction of jet aircraft on the North Atlantic route.  As I have already mentioned, I am confident that the turn over to jet transport will not have the very adverse effects which were first anticipated.  Traffic in recent months has shown an encouraging upward trend in passenger movements as well as a continuing increase in overall freight traffic.</P>
    <P>The completion of the new jet runway and the development of industrial activity at the airport will be accompanied by an increasing promotion campaign to ensure that Shannon will preserve its status as a major international airport.</P>
    <P>As a result of the reduction in passenger traffic at the airport in 1959, there was a reduction in revenue and profits in the sales and catering service. Turnover in the half-year to 31st January, 1960, the latest period for which accounts are available, amounted to £694,144, which represented a decrease of about 12% on the turnover in the corresponding period of the previous year.  Viewed in the light of a 15% drop in passenger traffic, the reduction in revenue of 12% was, however, less than might have been expected and revenue in recent months has continued buoyant.  The initiation of a mail-order business from the Shannon Sales Centre has proved successful&mdash;the orders for the 12 months ended 31st January, 1960, totalling £93,000.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Authority was established in the second half of 1957.  The Authority was to take such steps as were necessary to encourage the use of Shannon Airport to the maximum extent and to provide additional employment at the airport, apart from employment related directly to the servicing of aircraft. The Authority was an administrative <Col N="816" /> body with no separate legal existence and financed from funds made available from the Catering Account.</P>
    <P>The Authority was superseded by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited in January, 1959. The Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Act, 1959 authorises:</P>
    <P>(i)  the Minister for Finance to subscribe for shares in the Company up to an aggregate limit of £1,500,000, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the provision by way of grant-in-aid voted annually of sums which in the aggregate shall not exceed £500,000 over the whole period of the Company's activities.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid is intended to meet the running expenses of the Company as well as the cost of financial incentives given to new industries to establish in the free airport area.  Up to 31st March, 1960, payments by way of grants-in-aid amounted to £190,000 and capital issues to the Company amounted to £393,000.</P>
    <P>The peculiar advantages to industrialists who establish industries at Shannon are&mdash;firstly, a location in the immediate vicinity of a large international airport with the ease and convenience of air transport for passengers and freight; secondly, the special facilities of a customs free zone; thirdly, tax remission for a period if 25 years; fourthly, the availability of modern factory buildings at reasonable rents, and fifthly, the availability of grants towards the cost of buildings, machinery and equipment and training of workers.</P>
    <P>From the expenditure point of view the most important item is the outlay on the construction of the industrial estate.  In the case of eight industrial projects for location in the estate, production has already commenced, or arrangements to commence production have reached an advanced stage.  Negotiations are in progress with seventeen other promoters for the leasing of factory premises.  At a recent date there were six British, five American, one French, one German and one Dutch firms negotiating <Col N="817" /> for factory bays.  Only three Irish firms have, so far, shown interest and this I find regrettable.</P>
    <P>If the estimates of the promoters prove realistic&mdash;and there is no reason to believe that they are not&mdash;it is not unreasonable to expect that within a short period, employment for between 1,000 and 2,000 industrial workers should be afforded in the estate.  The construction of factory buildings, costing nearly £1 million, in a period of eighteen months from a standing start is an almost unique record of Irish building activity.</P>
    <P>The provision of adequate housing, both for executives and workers either in or near the estate, is a particularly important problem and is receiving the urgent attention of the Company.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Company go beyond the creation of an industrial estate and include the promotion of all types of business activities at the airport.  To increase traffic at the airport the Company maintains close contacts with the leading airlines, travel agencies and Bord Fáilte Éireann, and sponsors or operates advertising campaigns, tour-sales programmes, window displays, etc., in the United States.  The Company is also actively engaged in association with other bodies and organisations in promoting the sale of package tours and specialised tours of this country &mdash;such as golf and fishing tours.</P>
    <P>The new housing at Shannon is being planned after the most exhaustive research by our own and foreign experts into how the employees in the factories are likely to choose their dwelling places, and after making allowances for the number likely to come from the neighbouring area and to go to reside in the towns and villages nearby.</P>
    <P>I am determined that the new community centre should be distinctive and attractive.  I hope that the employers and workers at Shannon will from the first, wish to join together in establishing a relationship which embodies the most modern concepts. For this purpose the Shannon Development Company have been consulting <Col N="818" /> our own Productivity Committee and through it have secured the advice of international experts attached to the European Productivity Agency.</P>
    <P>May I stress again the advantages of the Shannon industrial area purely from the standpoint of freight convenience? We know that firms in New York fly materials as much as 3,000 miles for partial assembly and fly back the semi-finished product.  Examples of the products which we believe will be particularly suitable for manufacture at Shannon are scientific instruments, office machinery, jewellery, plastic goods, toys, musical instruments, light engineering equipment, and in a very appropriate sense aircraft parts.</P>
    <P>Construction of the new airport at Ballygarvan near the city of Cork, commenced some months ago.  Preliminary drainage and fencing work has already been completed and work is at present in progress on construction of runways, taxiways and apron.  Work on erection of the buildings will commence this summer.  The airport will be fully equipped with up-to-date lighting, landing and navigational aids, including an instrument landing system on the main runway.</P>
    <P>The airport, costing a million pounds, is scheduled for completion in July, 1961, which will be in time for the main summer season travel.  I am doing everything possible to see that this target is achieved.  Every contractor has been made aware that every day saved adds to the value of the first year's aircraft movements, but inclement weather is an unpredictable factor.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus will operate scheduled services at Cork.  A number of British companies are also interested in operating scheduled services at the airport.  I believe that the new airport will generate substantial new air traffic and that it will be a notable tourist attraction, drawing in visitors direct to fish and see the incomparable beauty spots in the province of Munster.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1959, Aer Lingus had a balance to credit of £48,943 after discharging private <Col N="819" /> loan obligations and superannuation costs, the gross operating surplus was £204,000.  In the six months ended 30th September, 1959, the operating surplus was £420,000.  This operating surplus is exactly the same as the surplus for the corresponding half of 1958/59.  When the final accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1960, are available, however, it may be found that the surplus on the operating account for the full year will be lower than that made in 1958/59 due to a number of factors including wage increases and increased costs and the effect of the two industrial disputes which reduced the Company's operation during the year.</P>
    <P>In the financial year 1958/59, Aer Lingus planes flew five million miles and carried a half-million passengers. The number of passenger miles flown was 121,000,000.  The average distance per passenger flight was 234 miles and the average fare paid was £6.09.  In 1959/60 Aer Lingus carried over 550,000 passengers, 7,800,000 kilos of cargo and 1,570,000 kilos of mail.  These represent significant increases over the figures for the preceding year particularly in view of the effect of the industrial disputes to which I have referred.  Tremendous efforts will be required to develop what must be mainly a short-haul service even although continental travel increases.</P>
    <P>Three new routes have been opened this year viz. Dublin/Leeds, Dublin/ Cherbourg, and Shannon/London. Fares have been reduced and frequencies increased on certain existing routes.  The greater carrying capacity, combined with an intensive sales drive by the Company, is expected to increase business this year.  In this connection it is of interest to note that from April to October, a total of approximately 550,000 seats will be available on scheduled Aer Lingus services.  This represents a 12.5% increase on the figure for the same period last year.  It is most satisfactory to note in relation to the question of capacity that Aer Lingus achieved last year a load factor, or in simple terms the average amount of seat <Col N="820" /> capacity sold, of 67.2%&mdash;the highest in Europe.  I think we should congratulate the Company on this fine achievement.</P>
    <P>The present operating aircraft flect consists of 7 Viscount 808 aircraft, 7 Friendship F.27 aircraft and 5 D.C.3 aircraft.</P>
    <P>I should at this point make two important comments on the future of Aer Lingus.  I believe that all transport companies should pay their way. Aer Lingus has shown increasing financial stability since 1950 but has not yet begun to pay the taxpayer for the investment of his capital in this growing enterprise.  With the growth of the fleet and the use of the more economically operated aircraft, I hope that in the near future the Company will, without restricting its services, begin to remunerate the State capital invested in the enterprise so that the enterprise will be independent of State assistance.  Further, to become a reality, the costs must be kept down and the present high standards of efficiency improved.  Secondly, I must make a brief comment on the circumstances attending the recent strike.</P>
    <P>I hope that relations within the Company between the staff and management will be friendly.  I wish, however, to make it clear beyond all doubt that since I have responsibility for the general well-being of the Company, I have informed the directors that I am aware that a very exacting standard of discipline is maintained by the Company, for which I wish to give full credit to the air pilots and staff of the Company.  I have, however, urged on the directors the need for the maintenance, and, if possible, the improvement of this high standard and I uphold the decision of the directors and management that the standards should be more exacting even than those of other air lines.</P>
    <P>This unvarying tradition will contribute to the fine record held by the Company for many years, albeit granted that Providence equally plays a part in the affairs of man and planes. I feel quite sure that this high standard will attract to the corps of air pilots the kind of men who have up to now <Col N="821" /> shown such zeal in the performance of their duties.</P>
    <P>Aerlinte continued its transatlantic service from Shannon to New York and Boston throughout the year.  In the eight months of operation in 1958, the Company carried something over 13,000 transatlantic passengers.  In 1959 the Company carried 23,000 transatlantic passengers, over 37 per cent. of these terminating or commencing their journeys in this country.  This conforms with the estimate made in 1957 of 22,680 revenue passengers.  The Company will continue to operate the service with piston-engined aircraft leased from Seaboard and Western. Airlines until next December when it will introduce into service the latest Boeing jet aircraft to replace the super Constellations at present in service. During the coming Summer all except a few operators on the North Atlantic route will operate jet aircraft.  This presents Aerlinte with a major challenge during the current year.  The introduction of jet services has produced everywhere the inevitable unanticipated cost increases some of which are no doubt temporary.  I have no doubt that Aerlinte will find the going somewhat rough in the early stages. To meet this challenge the Company using new sales offices in America have launched an intensive selling campaign which it expects will lead to increased traffic in both passengers and cargo.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the prospects for Aerlinte look better this year than last year.  The number of passengers carried for the first four months of this year shows an increase of 33? per cent. over the number for the corresponding period of 1959.  The past few months have shown a substantial increase of 45 per cent. in bookings over the same period last year.  The present position is buoyant both in numbers of forward bookings and in revenue taken for these forward bookings.  Until the Company obtains its jet aircraft it will be at some disadvantage with lines which operate jets.  However, as an offset to the speed of the jets there is a reduction in fares for piston engine aircraft and this reduction compensates in some measure for the attraction of the more speedy aircraft.  Meanwhile, <Col N="822" /> Aer Lingus continues to expand its European operations and the combined network of Aer Lingus and Aerlínte covers a total mileage of 11,000 miles, extending from Copenhagen and Rome to Boston and New York.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1959, the excess of expenditure over revenue was approximately £790,000.  Certified figures for the year ended 31st March, 1960, are not yet available, but the loss on that year's operations is estimated at £525,000.  The estimate of losses originally made for the two years fell short of these combined figures by 10 per cent., not an excessive figure.  The first of the three Boeing 720 jet aircraft on order will be delivered in November, 1960. Preparations are well advanced for its introduction into commercial service on 15th December, 1960.  The remaining two will be delivered in February and March, 1961.  The Company is confident that the introduction into service of these, the most up-to-date now being produced and the fastest across the Atlantic, will put them in the strongest possible position and they are optimistic in regard to future prospects on this route.  As my predecessor indicated last year, however, everything depends on the general growth of tourist traffic from the U.S.A. and this in turn is to a great extent dependent upon the number of additional bedrooms with baths provided by the hotel industry.</P>
    <P>Last year, when the Vote for Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services was being introduced, it was explained that in order to meet the future financial requirements of the Air Companies, the Government had decided to introduce legislation to increase substantially the authorised share capital of Aer Rianta.  In August, 1959, the Air Navigation and Transport (No. 2) Act was passed authorising an increase of capital of the Company to £10,000,000 and increasing the limit of the borrowing power of the Company to £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>The additional capital for which provision was made in the Act was required by Aer Rianta to finance the purchase by Aerlinte of jet aircraft at an estimated cost of £6,000,000 and to <Col N="823" /> provide for repayments of £655,500 to British European Airways and £798,500 to Aerlinte as well as providing additional share capital for Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Under Capital Services, Subhead E of the Vote includes a provision of £15,000 for the purchase of Facsimile Transmitting Equipment for the Meteorological Service.  It is intended to establish a Central Analysis and Forecasting Office in Dublin city.  It is also hoped that the establishment of an independent unit primarily concerned with general forecasting and its location in the major population centre will result in a better and more accessible service to the man in the street while making some savings possible.</P>
    <P>The provision for C.I.E. in this year's Estimates consists of the statutory grant-in-aid of £1,175,000 and a sum of £175,000 in respect of the recoupment to C.I.E. of the cost of redundancy compensation payable by them in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The year ended 31st March, 1960, was the first year of the five year reorganisation period by the end of which C.I.E. are required by the Transport Act, 1958, to be self-supporting. The task confronting the Board of C.I.E. is a formidable one but the enthusiasm and vigour with which they are applying themselves to it is most heartening.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. are pursuing an aggressive sales campaign in their drive to secure more business.  The removal, under the Transport Act, 1958, of the outmoded restrictions on the commercial adaptability of C.I.E. has enabled the Board to enter into package deals with various firms to carry their traffic on an annual contract basis.  The amount of the additional freight business already obtained by C.I.E. through package deals amounts to over £250,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The economy measures adopted by C.I.E. are designed to ensure that the Board's operations are carried out with a maximum efficiency without impairing the quality of services provided for the public.  With regard to the closing of branch railway lines, C.I.E. are empowered by the Transport <Col N="824" /> Act, 1958, to terminate any particular train service where they are satisfied that its operation is uneconomic and that there is no prospect of its continued operation being economic within a reasonable period.  Before a decision is taken by C.I.E. to close a branch line all relevant factors are carefully considered.  A decision to terminate a train service is taken only when the Board are fully satisfied that there is no prospect of the particular railway line being economic within a reasonable period.  This means in practice that so large a proportion of travellers find that the railway stations do not convenience them as to make a bus service more modern, more up to date and acceptable.  Where train services have been terminated C.I.E. have provided satisfactory substitute passenger and goods services.  The closing of branch railway lines which have been found to be uneconomic is in no way peculiar to this country.  Many branch lines are being closed in various other countries for example Britain and the Netherlands where the volume and density of rail traffic are far greater than in this country.  In the Netherlands 67 per cent. of the passenger stations have been closed.  There are certain almost irrevocable trends in the pattern of transport.</P>
    <P>First, in a matter of years the majority of people in the advanced economies will have motor cars or motor bicycles with which the railway will have to compete.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in every country the roads will be widened and improved over several decades to cope with this increased traffic regardless of the railways' future.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, in a country of scattered homesteads lacking huge mineral resources and with a low density of population which could rise by 50 per cent. without affecting the general analysis of the position, the substitution of bus and lorry traffic where the railway is uneconomic in operation will not materially increase the cost of the road system.  Assistance can be provided where required by once and for all supplementary improvement grants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> The taxpayer should not be asked to subsidise the running costs of any form of public transport because there is great amplitude of transport facilities.</P>
    <P>The Transport Act, 1958, was approved unanimously by all the major Parties.  Only one section was challenged seriously, that making it possible for C.I.E. to close lines without providing substitute services.  In fact C.I.E. are not likely to take advantage of this privilege.  This unanimity has made the work of C.I.E. much easier in that there is a general agreement that C.I.E. must pay and pay its way it must.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Board to complete the main examination of uneconomic lines without delay so that the particular stretches of railroad whose retention is likely may be delineated and so that the total mileage of track whose future is questionable, may be reduced as much as possible, within the earliest practicable period.</P>
    <P>The financial results of C.I.E. operations for the year ended 31st March, 1960 which was the first year of the 5 year reorganisation programme, are encouraging. C.I.E. have reduced by over £1 million to £700,000 the annual loss of the Company compared with the previous year; the most important improvement was on the railways where the Company reduced the loss from £1.2 million to £500,000 by a combination of increased revenue and decreased expenditure, a most remarkable result and with possibly no parallel in railway history.</P>
    <P>About 80% of C.I.E. train services are now operated with diesel traction and conversion of the remainder of the system&mdash;principally the part of the G.N.R. taken over by C.I.E.&mdash;will be completed within the next few years. Considerable economies in operating costs have been achieved by the change over to diesel traction.</P>
    <P>I have confidence that the policy which the Board of C.I.E. are pursuing will lead to realisation of the objective of the Transport Act, 1958&mdash;a self-supporting public transport system free from the demoralising effects of subsidisation by the State.  The <Col N="826" /> burden on the Exchequer will only be partly eliminated by the ending of the subsidy.  The present annual cost is about £3½ million.  Losses and capital adjustments totalled £23 million approximately in 10 years, and will take years to be finally amortised.  The fact that the reorganisation measures foreshadowed for the British Transport Commission are similar in many respects to those adopted here for C.I.E. tends to confirm the wisdom of the policy for the reorganisation of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>The sole factor in determining the future pattern of public transport is that of providing the most modern, economic and convenient form of transport.</P>
    <P>If ever we needed an example of how desperately this country requires modern, searching, unsentimental, 20th-century dynamic thinking and action through the application of modern, fast moving techniques, C.I.E. can be that supreme example.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Estimate of £175,000 for redundancy compensation is in accordance with the Transport Act, 1958, which provides for the payment of grants to C.I.E. out of voted money in respect of redundancy compensation payable under that Act and the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958.  The fact that the State provides for compensation on a generous scale for redundant C.I.E. workers enables C.I.E. reorganisation measures to be carried through smoothly without causing hardship to workers dismissed as a consequence.</P>
    <P>Included in the provision of £38,000 for Technical Assistance in the Estimates is a provision for a grant of £35,000 towards the cost of establishing a development and research unit by C.I.E.  This grant will be recouped from the Grant Counterpart Reserve Fund.  The C.I.E. research unit will concentrate on special technical problems, in particular the use of containers, flats and pallets in connection with the co-ordination of road and rail services.</P>
    <P>The electrifying process of examining costs, reducing waste, stepping up output, so well demonstrated by C.I.E., is required in almost every part of our <Col N="827" /> national economy.  C.I.E. is deserving of this Counterpart Fund contribution.</P>
    <P>With the withdrawal shortly of the remaining C.I.E. barges from the Grand Canal the use of this canal for commercial purposes will come to an end.  This raises the question of the future of that canal.  Under the existing statutory provisions C.I.E. are precluded from closing the canal to navigation unless it has not been used for public navigation for at least three years.  It has been represented by certain interests that the preservation of the Grand Canal as a waterway is essential for the maintenance of a link between the east coast and the Shannon.  On the other hand, it has been represented from other quarters that the preservation of the canal solely for pleasure boating could not be justified on economic grounds; that boats can be conveyed more quickly and more conveniently by road from Dublin to the Shannon and that the canal itself has no particular attraction as a waterway for pleasure boating.</P>
    <P>I am reasonably certain that the answer lies in the development of boat hire services on the Shannon and other waterways for which much preparation will be required.  I do not expect any worthwhile growth in the use of canals for pleasure boating.  Parts of the canal system will have to be maintained for water conservation purposes thus satisfying in part the ambition of local angling development associations for most of whom, in any event, there is a huge choice of lakes and rivers.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the Road Transport Act, 1959, through the Oireachtas, I undertook to consider specially any genuine cases in which the statutory increase of 7 cwts. would appear to be inadequate.  All cases of this kind which came up for consideration have now been dealt with and Deputies will be glad to know that none of the hauliers affected has had his position worsened.  The hauliers concerned have been warned, however, that the additional weight allowed for attachments can be used for that purpose only and that it may not be used <Col N="828" /> to acquire larger lorries with greater basic carrying capacity.</P>
    <P>The educational tours for school children and the all-in holiday rail tickets are evidence of initiative and imagination in C.I.E.'s drive for increased passenger business.  In the case of the educational tours, bookings to date for this year exceed 80,000.</P>
    <P>The popularity of C.I.E. coach tours continues to grow.  The numbers carried have increased from 5,721 in 1957 to 6,623 in 1958, and 7,801 in 1959.  The total of 7,801 passengers carried in 1959 came from 43 different countries: no less than 2,979 came from the United States.</P>
    <P>In 1958 extern tours were admitted on an experimental basis.  In that year 10 extern operators operated 10 tours and brought in some 3,000 passengers.  For the 1960 season, 19 tours have been licensed and it is expected that the number of passengers will show an increase on the 6,000 figure for 1959.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that in 1959 the extern tours provided additional revenue of the order of £100,000 from tourists and benefited 28 hotels.</P>
    <P>The need for increased investment at home in productive enterprises has been repeatedly stressed.  In this connection it is not out of place for me to refer to the position as regards investment in vehicles required for the transport of merchandise.  C.I.E. have adequate facilities for the transport of goods by rail and road and have complete freedom to negotiate package deals with individual firms for the handling of their transport requirements. The fact that such package deals have already been successfully negotiated with a large number of firms proves that C.I.E. are in a position to quote competitive rates.  Expenditure by business and other concerns on the acquisition of vehicles for the carriage of their own merchandise tends to increase still further the country's surplus transport capacity.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, appealing strongly to those contemplating the purchase of vehicles for the transport of their goods to examine critically the costings and not to embark on any such expenditure <Col N="829" /> unless they are satisfied that C.I.E. and the other licensed carriers could not do the work more cheaply and as efficiently.</P>
    <P>Two aspects of the cross-Channel trade which have been engaging my particular attention are improvements in the facilities for the importation of passenger-accompanied motor cars and an improvement generally in travelling conditions particularly at Dún Laoghaire Pier.</P>
    <P>On the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire route a pilot scheme which was introduced on 1st July, 1959, for the carriage of a limited number of cars on the mail boats proved successful.  Some 900 cars were carried between July-October, 1959, and capacity has been increased this year.  Plans have now been drawn up for the installation in 1961 of cranes which will speed-up operations and will allow a much larger number of cars to be carried.</P>
    <P>To improve passenger facilities at Dún Laoghaire further works were carried out for the 1959 tourist season consisting of a high-level enclosure on the west side of the Pier connected by a foot-bridge to the existing high-level enclosure on the east side.  The benefits of this additional accommodation were manifest during the peak traffic period when it enabled both sides of the Pier to be used for departures; furthermore, it enables advantage to be taken of the large-scale facilities available on the east side when, on occasions of adverse weather conditions, the ships had to sail from the west side; and by enabling disembarkation to take place at two levels simultaneously it speeded up the handling of ships arriving at the west or normal arrivals side of the Pier.  Passenger handling was, therefore, much smoother during the season despite a tendency towards sharper traffic peaks in the July/ August period.  For instance, an all time record of 16,000 passengers were dealt with on Dún Laoghaire Pier in one day in August, 1959, without any untoward incidents.</P>
    <P>For the coming season, the high-level enclosure on the west side of the Pier will be extended and certain other <Col N="830" /> improvement works estimated to cost £73,000 are planned.</P>
    <P>Since July, 1959, I have met personally, as have the officers of my Department, the Chairman of the British Transport Commission and the executive heads of the Commission responsible for rail and steamship travel to Ireland.  I also discussed the general importance of this traffic with the British Minister of Transport.</P>
    <P>Every effort has been and will be made to secure an improvement of the amenities on the various routes but particularly the Irish Mail route. Very great improvement has taken place; more is needed.  The improvement, however, is subject to the limitation imposed by the nature of the traffic, i.e., the relatively high peaks, for only about 10 weeks in the year, with a few peaks of only 48 to 72 hours in the number travelling. To provide facilities beyond a certain limit to cater adequately for such peak periods could be costly and wasteful since the facilities would not be used during the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>With this limitation in mind I hope that the new Chairman of the Midland Area Board of the British Transport Commission will be conferring with us here.</P>
    <P>Apart from the improvements in the transport of cars between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead, an air car ferry service is now in operation between Dublin and Liverpool.  The service will provide one flight each way per day at the beginning, rising to 4 flights each way per day during the height of the season.  It is expected that this service will carry 3,000 cars in the season, rising to 10,000 if the demand increases.  There has been a compelling need in recent times for the provision of air car ferry services. In order to develop our tourist trade, it is essential to ensure that visitors from Great Britain and elsewhere who wish to bring their cars to this country by air can do so with the minimum difficulty.  I trust that the new venture will be successful and that in a comparatively short time it will be possible to provide additional services from other points in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> I feel that there are great possibilities about the car ferry business. Statistics on other ferry routes indicate that once the service is established, an ever-increasing volume of traffic is generated.  There has been a phenomenal increase in the number of motor vehicles in Britain in recent years.  Statistics indicate that there is at present one car in Great Britain for every 34 yards of roadway.  Comparable statistics for this country indicate that there is one car for approximately every 170 yards of roadway. Clearly there is a vast tourist potential for motoring holidays in this country, and the establishment of car ferry services should play an important part in this development.</P>
    <P>The generation of electricity has risen from 314 million units in 1938 to 1,898 million units in 1959&mdash;a sixfold increase.  Our total consumption of electricity per head of the population is still, however, only about half the average for Europe.  Consumption per head for domestic purposes is indeed somewhat over the European average but consumption for industrial uses is much lower.  In 1958/59 consumption of electricity for industrial power amounted to only 475 million units as compared with 670 million units for domestic purposes.  Consumption for industrial purposes has, however, been increasing at about the European average, thus reflecting the expansion of industry here.  The further development of industry under the impact of the Government's economic programme should lead to a continued substantial increase in the industrial use of current and help bring our overall consumption closer to the level prevailing in Western Europe generally.</P>
    <P>As I announced a few months ago I have conveyed to the Electricity Supply Board general approval of the Board's proposals for expansion of generating capacity in the years 1964/ 65 to 1968/69 based on a projected annual increase of 7 per cent. in demand.  Planning for the programme must commence at this early date because it takes up to 5 years to bring a new power plant from drawing board <Col N="832" /> to full operation.  This programme will, however, remain subject to change in the light of developments and further expansion may be necessary if the demand should require it.  There has already been an encouraging sign in that the demand in the year to 31st March, 1960, has shown an increase of about 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Before the first plants in the new programme come into operation in 1964/65, the Electricity Supply Board will have brought into commission at Rhode, Co. Offaly, and Bellacorick, Co. Mayo, 120 megawatts of new plant all of which will use milled peat.  This will increase the total generating capacity of the Board's plant to 808 megawatts. The new programme envisages the addition of a further 340 megawatts of which 160 megawatts will be fired by milled peat and 180 megawatts by oil, and provides for the absorption by 1968/1969 of the annual output of all the bogs which are at present considered economically usable for the generation of electricity.</P>
    <P>Oid-fired stations will be sandwiched between peat-fired stations so as to ensure maintenance of electricity supplies in a year in which weather conditions were very adverse for either turf or water generation of electricity or both.  To ensure continuity of bog development and employment by Bord na Móna the oil stations will be used only to the extent that water and peat generation is insufficient to meet demand.  For the development and exploitation of the bogs in connection with this programme it is expected that Bord na Móna will provide additional employment for up to about 1,000 men each summer falling to about half that number in winter.</P>
    <P>All the more important rivers have already been harnessed for electricity generation.  Stations on the remaining rivers would be uneconomic in present circumstances having regard particularly to the high initial capital costs and current high interest rates.  The Electricity Supply Board, however, are continuing to collect data and investigate other rivers with a view to possible later development for hydro generation.  The Board have in operation a 15 megawatt generating station <Col N="833" /> at Arigna using approximately 45,000 tons a year of native coal.  Small quantities of native coal are also used at Ringsend Station.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, this country has a special interest in nuclear energy.  As national income rises, so will the demand for electric energy. Our known natural resources of energy are strictly limited and we must be prepared, in good time, for the day when the nation will be forced to rely on nuclear energy to supplement, if not replace, other available sources of electric energy.  The E.S.B. is keeping in touch with development in this field.</P>
    <P>Generation from water, peat and native coal in the year ended 31st March, 1960, was over 73% of the total.  In addition Irish refined oil was the fuel used for about 4½% of generation in that year.</P>
    <P>The programme of rural electrification, which was initiated shortly after the war, is now nearing completion. At the 31st March, 1960, some 688 areas had been completed out of a total of 792, and at the present rate of progress it is expected that the balance of the programme will be completed in about two years from now.  The completion of 688 areas has involved: the erection of over ¾ million poles; the stringing of over 40,000 miles of line; the connection of ¼ million new customers and the expenditure of £26¾ million.</P>
    <P>These statistics, impressive as they may be, are but the reflection of the virtual revolution which the advent of rural electrification has brought about in the economic and social life of rural Ireland.  In fact this revolution is only beginning and there are many evidences that the scheme will, in time, have even deeper and wider effects.</P>
    <P>This achievement, bringing our rural electricity development to a stage which is creditable by West European standards is one of which the Electricity Supply Board is justly proud, particularly as the scheme was designed and carried out entirely by the Board's staff and based to a substantial degree on the use of Irish materials.  The very success of the scheme has, however, <Col N="834" /> tended to obscure the cost of it, and it is just as well to realise that the programme has involved a heavy burden on both the electricity consumer and the taxpayer.  The justification for the burden is that the scheme has brought amenities and services to rural areas which they might have had to do without for years, or even decades, if the extension of electricity to rural areas were to be decided on purely economic grounds.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the rural electrification scheme when completed will amount to some £30 million, of which some £5 million will have been met by the State subsidy and the balance by the Electricity Supply Board. Despite the element of State subsidy, the supply of current under the scheme is showing a growing loss which for the year ended 31st March, 1959 amounted to over £650,000.  The most uneconomic areas for development have been left to the last and a further increase in losses can be expected. These losses have to be borne by the Electricity Supply Board revenue as a whole and therefore fall on the urban consumer.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that under no circumstances will there be any ultimate element of subsidy on current operations.  Consumption in newly developed areas tends to be low at first, although it does increase somewhat as the years pass and this will help to reduce losses.  A wider use of electricity by the farmer would undoubtedly increase his returns.  In the farmyard, there are many and varied applications of electric power. A mere one h.p. electric motor will drive many machines in regular use even on a small farm.  One of the most valuable of the amenities which electricity can supply for the farmer is a supply of water piped to any point in the farmyard where he needs it and, of course, to his dwellinghouse. I am glad to say that there is a growing demand for group water schemes from house-holders who use a common well and pump.  The Electricity Supply Board is co-operating fully in this manner with local authorities and with the Departments of Local Government and of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> During the year 1959 our coal imports came mainly from Britain 891,000 tons, but substantial quantities were also imported from the U.S. 462,000 tons, Poland 117,000 tons and Germany 113,000 tons.  The magnitude of pit-head stocks in Europe suggests that the present overall situation of ample supplies is likely to continue.</P>
    <P>During most of 1959 Irish anthracite producers, generally, were able to dispose of their output although some difficulties are currently being experienced. The possibility of solving these difficulties is being examined and I am in touch with the collieries and the coal trade with a view to easing the position. The output of anthracite was lower than in the previous year, being 138,000 tons against 151,000 tons in 1958.  Opencast production was commenced by a few anthracite mining companies but production so far has been small.  The Arigna mines, which produce semi-bituminous coal, found the competition from cheap imported coal very severe and the mines generally had to cut back production somewhat. The steady demand provided by the electricity generating station at Arigna has proved of great assistance in maintaining output and employment in the area.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board is also helping by accepting the maximum possible quantity of Arigna coal at its Ringsend station having regard to the fact that it is less economic than imported coal and is technically unsuitable for the boilers at Ringsend, which were designed for fuels of quite different characteristics.</P>
    <P>I have suggested to the Arigna mine owners possibilities of formulating jointly a technical assistance scheme for the improvement of the quality and utilisation of Arigna coal.</P>
    <P>Because of the good season, Bord na Móna had an exceptionally high output last year.  For the previous year which, of course, was a year of disastrous weather for the Board the output was 675,000 tons of sod and milled peat. The corresponding figure for the year ended 31st March, 1960, was 2,550,000 <Col N="836" /> tons and revenue from sales exceeded £3 million for the first time.  With normal weather, output this year is planned to reach 2,290,000 tons. Output of peat moss for 1958/59 and 1959/60 respectively was 111,000 bales and 160,000 bales.  The target for the current year is 200,000 bales, most of which is for the export market.</P>
    <P>During the year industrialists have shown a growing interest in turf as a fuel, and the Board also exported 22,000 tons of milled peat to a London gas-works where it is used to improve the quality of the coke.  As this latter development becomes more widely known, the Board is hopeful that the demand for milled peat will increase. The new briquette factory at Derrinlough has commenced production and the second factory at Croghan, will, it is hoped, be in production by the end of this year.  Production of briquettes will then be increased to 250,000 tons per annum as against 45,000 tons in the year ended 31st March, 1960.</P>
    <P>Recently a number of prominent businesses have installed peat fired heating systems because of the absolute net economy effected after calculating all possible costs.  I hope that consulting engineers will be more open-minded in regard to the use of peat and electricity as a source of heating power.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy that all Government Departments, State bodies and local authorities should use native fuel to the utmost practicable extent and should when planning new buildings or heating installations give special consideration to the use of peat and electricity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan </NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a really phoney Estimate and the lengthy memorandum which the Minister has just read is a not very successful effort to put some air of attraction around what is very unattractive when the realities are seen.  This Ministry is called the Ministry of Transport and Power and the net cost this year is £3,646,000.  This of course is mainly a Ministry to deal with continuing <Col N="837" /> losses, which are likely to continue, on various matters of air development. In this Vote what is put under the heading of &ldquo;Administration, Etc.,&rdquo; amounts to £916,000.  Of that my calculation is that about £650,000 has to deal with salaries, travelling and incidental expenses in connection with aviation services or things that are subsidiary to aviation.</P>
    <P>As far as the main items in the Vote are concerned, apart from the sum of £916,000 which is required for administrative expenses there is a sum of £1,350,000 which is a grant towards C.I.E., C.I.E. being described, when Deputies desire to ask the Minister for details of its administration, as an independent company into the working details of which he is not disposed to go.  However, he is a paying agent to the Company in the sum of £1,350,000 in respect of an annual subsidy and an amount for compensation to redundant employees.</P>
    <P>There is a very big sum of £1,685,000 in connection with airports, that is, for the purchase of land and for various constructional works at the three airports.  The only other item of any considerable size is a sum of £143,900 which is the State contribution towards rural electrification. There are other small items: £11,000 for compensation, arising out of war matters; £41,000 in respect of certain subscriptions towards international organisations; £38,000 for technical assistance; and a sum of £120,000 in respect of harbours.</P>
    <P>Of the 48 pages in the memorandum, more than 20 of them are devoted to aviation, the various airports and the two Companies; in other words more than half the memorandum is devoted to what is in fact the matters with which the Ministry is chiefly concerned, aviation and aviation losses.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping, the Minister has told us, is riding out the storm reasonably well.  Why could the Minister not give us an ordinary commercial account in respect of Irish Shipping, showing the capital that has been invested in it and showing what the <Col N="838" /> return has been; first of all, showing what the operational expenses and revenue have been and showing how far it is proposed to have Irish Shipping repay the State for the capital moneys put at its disposal?  The Minister's only comment on Irish Shipping is to say that it is riding out the storm reasonably well.</P>
    <P>I propose to enter into the matter of aviation in more detail later.  There is a record of losses, and all the Minister has said is that the loss in the first year for Aerlinte was not as bad as expected; but, undoubtedly, the estimated loss for the year ended last March is much worse than had been forecast by his predecessor a year ago.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. is being praised for its attack upon certain things, for the cutting out of unremunerative services, the elimination of waste, and so on. I propose to go into that in more detail in a moment.  Electricity presents a fair enough picture which would have been much fairer if the Department of Industry and Commerce had not intervened some years ago to coerce the E.S.B. into greater capital development of stations than they thought was required.  Coal requires no great comment; as far as turf is concerned, we know that last year, the bad year, the losses of Bord na Móna amounted to £900,000.  That they should have losses in that year was not a surprise to anybody but it was a considerable surprise to find that their losses were as heavy as £900,000.  When they produced a report regarding that loss, the best they could say about the future was that it would take some years&mdash;I am not sure they did not say many years&mdash; of reasonable weather before they could arrive at their old position and pay off the losses incurred in that disastrous year.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister apply two of his more rhetorical phrases to these other various services that come under his control?  At page 33, in dealing with C.I.E., he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If ever we needed an example of how desperately this country requires modern, searching, unsentimental, <Col N="839" /> 20th-century dynamic thinking and action through the application of modern, fast moving techniques, C.I.E. can be that supreme example.</P>
    <P>To how many of the other matters under the Minister's control would he apply what he thinks is so necessary &mdash;modern, searching, unsentimental, dynamic thinking and action to the application of modern fast moving techniques?</P>
    <P>On page 34 he permits himself another rhetorical outburst:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The electrifying process of examining costs, reducing waste, stepping up output so well demonstrated by C.I.E., is required in almost every part of our national economy...</P>
    <P>and C.I.E. is deserving of the Counterpart Fund contribution for that reason. C.I.E. is praised.  It is probably the only sphere of the Minister's activities that calls for anything in the way of praise.  But, whatever praise is given to it, it must be remembered that there is a new view now being taken of the transport services provided by that particular company.</P>
    <P>Legislation was introduced here in 1956 to meet a situation which had developed because of a Supreme Court judgment to the effect that vehicles could be hired, and that did not count, as if the man who hired a vehicle was running transport without having a licence.  That, of course, tore a tremendous gap in the legislation of earlier years in respect of transport.  Steps were taken immediately to repair that gap, to prevent its being widened, and to close it against other operators.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Second Stage of the Transport Bill of 1955&mdash;the Bill was introduced in 1955 and became an Act in 1956&mdash;the present Taoiseach made several remarks with regard to transport. At Column 665 of Volume 154 of the Official Report, 22nd February, 1955, he said, while putting aside the view &ldquo;that this is a suitable occasion for a comprehensive review of the whole transport situation ... this Bill is something more in the minds of <Col N="840" /> many people than a mere rectification of a position that arose accidentally from a court decision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking of the Irish Merchant Lorry Owners' Association, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The contention of this association is that the purpose of the 1933 legislation has failed; that, at any rate, the aims which were then entertained have not been achieved, and they urge that the whole structure and policy of our public transport undertaking should be scrutinised and overhauled.</P>
    <P>In the next column he mentioned some observations he would &ldquo;like to make in that regard&rdquo;, and the part to which I want to draw particular attention is the view held about transport matters in 1956, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>.... The Merchant Lorry Owners' Association have in their minds the idea, which is, I think, shared by many of the public, that the aim of the Road Transport Act of 1933 and the purpose of the restrictions imposed by that Act upon the carriage of goods for reward on the road by motor vehicles was solely to preserve the railways.  Now, that was not the aim of that legislation, and I can speak with some authority in the matter because I was responsible for framing it and for bringing it to the House; if any Deputy is interested enough to look up the matter, he will find that in the speech in which I submitted the Road Transport Act, 1933, to the House, I made it quite clear that that was not its purpose and that the aim was to provide this country with a nationwide transport service operating by rail or by road, as the public required, a service that would be obliged by law to carry, without discrimination as between persons, or trades, or towns, or ports all goods that were offered for transportation at known terms and at uniform fixed rates.</P>
    <P>At Column 667, the then Deputy Lemass continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>.... I agree that the public will not be willing to maintain the present <Col N="841" /> restrictions on the operation of private lorries on the roads, if the public transport services continue to need substantial subsidies from the taxpayers, or if they prove to be too costly in their operation, or incapable of giving efficient service to the public.</P>
    <P>At Column 669, Deputy Lemass said, presenting the same point of view:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is important that there should be in existence throughout the whole country a public transport service that is bound by law to carry everybody's goods at fixed charges without discrimination.  The merchant in the town who wants to operate his lorry occasionally for reward is not prepared to accept the obligations of a common carrier. The Act of 1933 placed upon licensed hauliers, common carriers, having got their licence, the obligation not to carry on their road transport business on a discriminatory basis.  They were bound by that Act to carry the classes of goods they were licensed to carry upon uniform terms.</P>
    <P>There was, then, a reference to the fact that, if all operators were allowed to develop a system in which they could cut in upon the business available for public hauliers and transport services, a very serious situation might arise; and at the bottom of Column 670, Deputy Lemass went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It would, however, be a very different matter to allow merchants the facilities they are seeking, the right to carry goods for reward whenever it suits them and without accepting any obligation to carry goods for everybody or to give uniform treatment to everybody.  We cannot have it both ways, have public transport services operating without loss and, at the same time, unrestricted carriage of goods for reward on the roads by private lorry owners.  We must make a choice between these two courses and I am quite satisfied in my own mind&mdash;and I think most people who will examine the matter will arrive at the same conclusion&mdash;<Col N="842" /> that the better choice is to seek to maintain adequate public transport services and adopt whatever measures are deemed to be needed in order to make that possible without subsidy.</P>
    <P>At the top of Column 671, Deputy Lemass said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Everybody can see the problems created by the present restrictions. They cannot visualise quite as easily the very much more acute problems that would arise if these restrictions were removed and if, as a consequence, the public transport operator, the common carrier, were to disappear from the countryside.</P>
    <P>To-day, the Minister for Transport and Power speaks of outmoded restrictions put upon the carrying business. Does not that phrase mean the old-time public carriers disappeared?  Was that not the purpose of the 1958 Act? The 1958 Act in certain phrases&mdash; Section 8&mdash;allows the Board of C.I.E. &ldquo;to fix, demand, take and recover such charges as the Board thinks fit for any services provided by it&rdquo;. Secondly, subsection (3) provides that the Board &ldquo;may attach to any service provided by it such terms and conditions as the Board thinks fit&rdquo;.  Is it not because the Board have operated that and got away from the old-time public carrier that the Minister is now able to come in here and praise them for the &ldquo;electrifying process&rdquo; by which they have arrived at a condition in which not so much is required in the way of subsidy as it was their habit to require for many years before now?</P>
    <P>It is very easy to talk of package deals and offering people, who might otherwise go into private transport, certain advantageous rates, but the old idea of the common carrier was that what he gave to one in respect of a certain classification of merchandise he gave to everybody.  He had to take the traffic that was offered to him. Merchandise was clearly stated.  There was no question of a company playing fast and loose with favoured customers. Everybody got equal service and the service was provided over the whole country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> The then Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke in terms of praise of himself.  He said that the aim was to provide the country with a nationwide transport service operating by road and rail as the public required a service that would be obliged by law to carry without discrimination as between bus or train to all parts all goods for transportation at known terms and at a uniform fixed rate.</P>
    <P>Am I right in saying that all that has gone and that C.I.E. are now busily engaged in cutting down services they think are uneconomic and are trying to make deals with people in a way not known and where there is no open competition and that many of these deals, as far as the public can get to know them, may be operating in a very discriminatory way as between individual traders?  In any event, where is the compulsion on them? Could they be brought before the Railway Tribunal, as it was in the old days, or any other tribunal to have their obligations investigated or to have them bettered if they were proving to be discriminatory in their services?</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that side of it, because that has been legalised by the 1958 Act, the Minister compliments himself on that Act having been passed and that we are in the position where these package deals are being made, where traffic might be refused and traffic might be snatched. I should like to ask the Minister also with regard to C.I.E.&mdash;the date of the passage of that Act is the 16th July, 1958&mdash;can he say how many employees C.I.E. had on that date and how many employees they have now? Can he say further how many times have the charges of C.I.E. been raised, such of them as are known, since July, 1958?  Can he say what revenue accrued to the company from the increases in passenger fares and freight rates that have been made since that time?</P>
    <P>Can he say further how many commercially-owned lorries are on the roads at the moment?  In 1956, when the same Road Traffic Bill was under consideration, at Column 709 of the debate of the 22nd February, 1956, these figures were given.  The question <Col N="844" /> had been raised about C.I.E.'s monopoly of vehicles for the carriage of goods mainly.  These were given as the facts:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In 1933, there were 8,400 commercial goods vehicles on the road and in 1954, there were 37,000.</P>
    <P>The speaker then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I have not got the figures for 1955, but if they follow the usual tendency, they go up by 4,000 a year.</P>
    <P>The figures were then repeated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Commercial road vehicles increased in number from 8,400 in 1933 to 37,000 in 1954. C.I.E. not only had to compete with the 8,400, which were in existence in 1933, but with the additional 29,000 which have come on the road since then...</P>
    <P>The comment was then made that one could not say that C.I.E. had anything like a monopoly of road transport under those conditions.  Can the Minister say what number of commercial vehicles were on the roads in mid-July, 1958, and how many are on the roads now?  I am asking for those figures because I want to find out how far people under these package deals and under this licence given to C.I.E. have been driven to put their own vehicles on the road for the carriage of their own goods, notwithstanding the discrimination that might be offered by C.I.E.</P>
    <P>On a different topic, I might remind myself in passing that under Section 19 of the 1958 Act, which has the side-note &ldquo;Termination of Train Services&rdquo;, full liberty is given to the Board to terminate any services of trains for passengers or merchandise or either of them.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to say how far that section has operated.  Over what length of line, say, has the service of trains for passengers and merchandise been closed down?</P>
    <P>The second sub-section of Section 19 is to the effect that the Board shall not terminate a service unless it is satisfied that its operation is uneconomic and that there is no prospect of its continued <Col N="845" /> operation being economic within a reasonable period.  Is there anybody other than the officials of the Board to decide when the operation of a service becomes uneconomic or when there is no prospect of its becoming economic inside a reasonable time?  Do the Board operate that section themselves? Are they free from any investigation or inquisition by the Minister or any of his officials?  I would take it from that that they are.  That is why I should like to know over what length of line have services been terminated.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Board's view varied from time to time, that at one time they regarded it almost as an obligation on them to close down a service if they were satisfied it was uneconomic.  That is not my reading of what subsection (1) would involve. I understand it was the interpretation put on it by the Board at one time&mdash; that they could not take the old time view that, even though a service was uneconomic, they could continue to operate it because they might have the feeling that they were a public transport service and that they were not simply to go along ruthlessly cutting lines because they had become uneconomic to the slightest degree.</P>
    <P>There is subsection (3) of Section 19 which forbids the Board to terminate a service or to close a railway station of the class referred to &mdash;the obligation is quite clearly stated &mdash;unless two months before doing so they publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in such newspapers circulating in the area affected by the proposal of the Board a notice of the Board's intention. The publication of the Board's intention is to allow people in the neighbourhood to make their protest, to see what could be done, and to see if they could promise further revenue to the Board through a particular station.  There has been considerable doubt along some of the stations between Dublin and Bray regarding the retention of the line and the closing of certain stations.  I have made an occasional search of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> for some months past and I know of no notice published.  Therefore, I take it that as far as the Bray line is concerned these preliminary <Col N="846" /> steps which should be taken have not been taken to put that section into operation.  I should like to be reassured on that point.</P>
    <P>The last report of C.I.E. that I have, shows that the number of their employees on the 31st March, 1959, was 22,000 and the salary and wages bill for the year amounted to £10,000,000 and some odd money.  It stated that pay increases and better conditions granted during the year cost £40,740.  I should like to get for comparison with that what was the number of employees, say, at July, 1958?  What was the salary and wages bill covering that number of employees in the year ending on that date?  One cannot get that from these Board reports, because they operate to March 31st each year, but I imagine the information is built up month by month, or quarter by quarter, and that the figures should be readily available.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which has been often referred to recently&mdash;more often than it used to be&mdash;the matter of transport was dealt with on page 42 and reference was made to the Great Northern Railways Act, 1958, and the Transport Act of 1958.  Under these Acts, C.I.E. became the sole public transport authority in the State with the exception of two small companies in Donegal.  The Programme says they were charged with providing reasonable, efficient and economical transport services, the encouragement of national economic development and the maintenance of reasonable employment for their workers.  These words, I imagine, were carefully chosen.</P>
    <P>But has the term &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, in the phraseology of C.I.E., any affiliation with the demands of the public, or does it mean such services as the Board think reasonable?  To my mind they seem to have set themselves up as arbiters on every point of that idea of providing efficient and economical transport services for the public.  The statutory term &ldquo;economical&rdquo; does not seem to enter their heads.</P>
    <P>The Programme also says &ldquo;the Act provides&rdquo;&mdash;and then sets out the <Col N="847" /> ameliorative provisions in the two Acts, dealing with the writing down of capital to a certain amount of money, the writing off of capital advances, the payment of compensation for possible redundancy amongst staff, and then there is a phrase which the programme says has been brought into operation by the 1958 Act:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The removal of the common carrier and other statutory obligations restricting the commercial adaptability of C.I.E.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The common carrier obligation apparently placed a restriction on the commercial adaptability of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>A question put very often recently is: &ldquo;What is the aim of C.I.E.&rdquo;?  As far as I take it from the Minister's laudatory phrases today, he accepts all C.I.E. have done recently in regard to the drastic pruning of services, the restriction of waste, the cutting out of inefficiency.  But there is nothing in the Minister's phrases here to say that it was the aim of C.I.E. to provide an efficient service throughout the whole of the country.  I want that matter elucidated and I accordingly ask the Minister to give the figures as to what extra number of merchandise lorries under private control are now operating in the country and if we must look forward to C.I.E. as a body no longer to be maintained on subventions from the State for providing little or no service adequate to the needs of so many areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Is it contemplated that what was thought would be a bad development is now to be regarded as something good and that we are to get back to the stage when we shall have a partial service, running a few main lines such as that from Galway to Dublin and from Dublin to the North but with minor lines cut out or restricted?  Surely that must be the objective.  In the Programme referred to, the objective, which was viewed with jubilation at the time was aimed at restricting the commercial adaptability of C.I.E.  I take it that commercial adaptability was the aim.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping is passed over by the Minister with the phrase: &ldquo;Riding the <Col N="848" /> storm reasonably well.&rdquo;  Surely it is possible at this stage to give a complete picture of Irish Shipping's operations&mdash;what capital was provided by the State or from the resources of Irish Shipping themselves, how far their operations pay for the expenses of those operations, and what is left over to meet interest, depreciation and interest on whatever capital is outstanding? Surely, in the case of Irish Shipping, there have been many good years when freight rates ran high; surely they must have been able to balance those years against their slump years.  The question of harbours requires very little in the way of comment.</P>
    <P>Aviation, in the Minister's speech, came under several different heads. There was a general head, there was Dublin Airport, Shannon Airport, Shannon Sales and Catering Services, Shannon Free Airport Development&mdash; which deserves comment by itself&mdash; Cork Airport, Aer Lingus, Aerlinte Capital Requirements and Meteorological Services.  When Aerlinte was first heard of in this House we were told the estimate for its first year of operation was that the organisation would lose £900,000.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce took it as something in the nature of praise for himself that it just lost about that sum in that year.  According to the Minister's statement tonight that figure has been somewhat reduced. How I do not know.</P>
    <P>We were told at that time that a feature of the operations of Aerlinte would be that they would break even and the then Minister said the prospects were bright for the company breaking even.  It seems that prospect has now been very distinctly falsified: the £900,000 is not as bad&mdash;by £200,000&mdash;as it had been anticipated at one time, but the second year of operations has gone very badly.  I would refer to page 27 of the Minister's opening speech:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the year ending 31st March, 1959, the excess of expenditure over revenue was approximately £790,000.  Certified figures for the year ended 31st March, 1960, are not available, but the loss on that <Col N="849" /> year's operations is estimated at £525,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a serious setback from what we were previously told.  We were told that the first year, in which there was a loss of £900,000, was the only year that there was likely to be a loss and that we would about break even in the second year.  The Minister now says:</P>
    <P>The estimate of losses originally made for the two years fell short of these combined figures by ten per cent., not an excessive figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a loss envisaged for the second year too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says here that &ldquo;the loss on that year's operations is estimated at £525,000.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said on the original Estimate that it was not possible to break even the second year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate was very optimistic for the second year.  I remember speaking on it and I said that figures, could be given for incidental advantages with regard to the tourist trade and all like that, and I was sharply admonished by the Minister's predecessor that he was not thinking of incidental advantages at all, and that it was possible it would break even in the second year.  The records will show it; anyway we have the reality now&mdash;£790,000 in the first year and £525,000 in the second year. That, of course, is the most serious loss but I think I am right in saying that nowhere in the whole of this aviation matter have we got a really balanced account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be said that the operating expenses of Aer Lingus show a surplus but they have to make provision for depreciation and interest, and that in regard to the airports, Dublin and Shannon, while Shannon from the point of view of operations gets closer to paying its way than does Dublin, I think I am right in taking it, as I read hurriedly through the Minister's memorandum, that no airport and no part of anything in connection with aviation is paying its way when everything <Col N="850" /> is brought into account.  The operating expenses may be nearly breaking even.  The account between expenses and the operating side of aviation may be nearly even in regard to certain matters, but nowhere in these accounts that I have been able to see has there been provision made for a charge against the various items of State capital and its repayment.</P>
    <P>Surely it is time we had this matter clearly placed before the public to be able to see what is the true cost of the many aviation services we have, and in that connection I presume the Minister will add in all the heavy expenses carried on his Departmental Vote under the heading of administration and such things as civil aviation, airport constructional matters, aviation operations, aviation communications, Shannon Airport management, together with the whole cost of the meteorological items.  These surely should all be put into one account and split up, and it is only in the Department that they can be properly split up as between, say, the services for the airports and the two different air services, Aer Lingus and Aerlinte.</P>
    <P>We are no longer at the stage when these things can be regarded as developmental.  There is a sufficient period for one to have an adequate experience of trends and all the rest, and one must be able to estimate from trends, with all of these fast jet aircraft entering into the calculations, and not merely should there be a figure given of what has passed since Aer Lingus was established, and more lately Aerlinte, but there should be some forecast as to how these things will work out for the future.  I still think I was justified some months ago in saying that the Minister's Department was one of &ldquo;jets and other debts,&rdquo; the jets being the main debts that he has to stand over or attempt to hide.</P>
    <P>The matter of electricity gets four pages in the Minister's statement.  In fact, when I take the introductory part out, I think I am correct in saying that two-thirds of his lengthy memorandum deals with air services and things connected with them. With regard to electricity, the Minister <Col N="851" /> has told us about all the new stations that are being built and are coming into operation but, the Grey Book, &ldquo;Economic Development &rdquo; dealing with electricity, at Chapter 20, was very critical of the Government's activity about that time.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 of that Chapter runs:</P>
    <P>In recent years the provision of generating capacity has run ahead of the country's requirements, and the E.S.B. has surplus capacity, over and above a reasonable reserve for contingencies, which would enable it to supply current of 400-500 million units a year in excess of the present demand of about 1,775 million units.  This alone would suffice for almost four years of growth of demand at last year's rate. The period of excess capacity will be prolonged by the completion of new generating stations now under construction.</P>
    <P>This very critical comment follows:</P>
    <P>The heavy excess investment in plant adds to fixed charges and represents a deadweight burden on the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 continues more or less on the same lines:</P>
    <P>Heavy investment by the E.S.B. without a commensurate rise in revenue has meant a steep rise in the proportion of capital charges (interest, sinking fund and depreciation) to revenue.  In 1951-52 capital charges represented 30 per cent. of revenue and likewise 30 per cent. of working expenses; they now represent about 50 per cent. in each case, or over £6 million a year, and will continue to rise.</P>
    <P>That paragraph should surely be taken as the basis of a better statement which the Minister should give in respect of electricity and of the preparations there are for extra generating capacity.</P>
    <P>Was that phrase right or wrong? Was there a heavy excess investment in plant?  Has that been caught up with?  Why has demand grown to <Col N="852" /> such an extent?  If the Minister is disposed to answer that question would he pay attention to one matter?  If one looks at the E.S.B. accounts over the last four or five years one point will be apparent.  I take that as the period in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce began to interfere actively in the plans that the Board had for its ordinary development. There was a time when the Board was allowed to operate on its own.  The members of the Board were regarded as the people who were experts in this whole matter. They had all the information at their disposal and they had experience of other companies, and a comparison with those led them to cut down in enthusiasm for the provision of generating capacity, as that was urged on them from time to time by various Ministers.</P>
    <P>There came a point when the Minister's predecessor in the Department of Industry and Commerce definitely interfered with the Board, when they were not merely exhorted but coerced by a Minister into making bigger provision for generating capacity than they themselves thought was proper.  That was the period in which there was the excess investment which brought about this comment in the Grey Book.</P>
    <P>The Minister will find that, of course, there is an effort made to cloak this thing a little bit by having various types of plant brought in year by year and the account that the Electricity Supply Board furnishes showing what proportion of units produced came from the various stations is rather carefully divided up but it has attracted attention that if one takes the potential of quite a number of these stations and takes then what is drawn by way of production of units from the various stations in any year, one will find that a very small proportion of the potential of the station is realised.  One can immediately understand the difference that in a wet year there will be greater use of hydro-electrical development, as it is the cheaper form of production, whereas in a dry year, when the Shannon lakes may not have sufficient water stored, there would be a turnover <Col N="853" /> to turf which, of course, should become more abundant in a dry period.  But, there always has been for years a great distinction between the potential of many of these stations and the actuality and the belief is growing that this is a device, probably forced upon the E.S.B., in order to cloak the excess investment in generating capacity and generating plant by showing some draw from each of them whereas, in fact, the situation properly is that if the potentiality of a number of these stations had been realised, as it might have been realised, there definitely would be disclosed a very heavy excess investment in plant.</P>
    <P>The Minister's memorandum referred to the use that may be made in the future of milled peat for the purpose of generating electricity.  I understand that there has been some disquiet caused amongst engineers in recent months with regard to milled peat.  In fact, I should like to see statistics of what was the declared potential development of electricity from milled peat and what is the highest that has ever been realised in actual operation.</P>
    <P>I understand, further, that at meetings recently there was certain disquiet also aroused as between Bord na Móna engineers and Electricity Supply Board engineers over the fact that in a dry year turf may be as bad as it is in a wet year, arising, of course, from different circumstances. I have been given to understand that from the point of view of boiler capacity and boiler usage over-dry peat presents as bad a problem, although not the same type of problem, as heavily wet turf does.</P>
    <P>The Grey Book on Economic Development goes on, in paragraph 6 of Chapter 20, to speak of rural electrification. To its previous comments about the dead weight burden on the E.S.B. and how the heavy investment has changed the proportion of capital charges to revenue it attaches in connection with rural electrification this comment:</P>
    <P>Apart from the over-capitalisation resulting from the provision of excess generating plant, a serious <Col N="854" /> burden is also being imposed by the loss incurred on rural electrification.</P>
    <P>This amounted to £552,000 for 1957-58 which profit on other operations reduced to a loss of £180,000.  The capital cost to date&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is, of course, a year or two old now&mdash;</P>
    <P>averages over £100 per rural consumer without including any element for generating cost.  Now that only the more remote and less populous areas remain to be connected, rural electrification will become more and more uneconomic according as it progresses; it is estimated that the annual loss on rural electrification will be up to £1¼ million by 1963, assuming completion of the scheme by that time.  To ease the burden on the E.S.B. it has been decided to recoup by Exchequer subsidy 50 per cent. of the capital charges arising from the completion of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7 says:</P>
    <P>Subsidisation will not, of course, solve the problem.  It will merely transfer part of the loss from the electricity consumer to the taxpayer, i.e., from Peter to Paul.  The case might be made that the general consumer of electricity is as good a mark as the taxpayer; indeed, viewed as a vehicle of taxation, the electricity bill is as effective, convenient and equitable as any other.  The primary consideration is that if more of our national resources are to be applied to productive development, uneconomic investment must be curbed. The investment of £23,000,000 in rural electrification since 1946-47, resulting in the supply of electric power to 75 per cent. of rural areas, represents a generous contribution from the nation's resources towards providing a desirable amenity as well as a means of increasing agricultural production.  In fact, on most farms, the use of electricity is virtually confined to domestic purposes; it contributes more to comfort than to output.  No material increase in agricultural production can be expected from the extension of <Col N="855" /> supply to the remoter areas.  These factors suggest that the rate at which further areas are connected should be adjusted so as to keep pace with an improvement in the Board's general finances, thus moderating the losses failing on the general electricity consumer and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Since that was written, of course, the Electricity Supply Board ran into the red for the first time in their history, followed by a second period in which they ran into the red, possibly due to this excess investment in plant.</P>
    <P>In any event, there was a warning given by the authors of this publication that, seeing that there had been a very generous contribution made to the amenities of rural life, any further provision should be made only if there was an improvement in the Board's general finances so that the losses falling on the general electricity consumer and the taxpayer could be moderated.  It is rather peculiar that an effort was made, if anything, to develop rural areas at a slightly speedier rate at a time when the Electricity Supply Board had got into the red for the first couple of times in their history.</P>
    <P>The last report that I saw from the Electricity Supply Board was not too optimistic.  With regard to the year ended 31st March last, I have not seen the report for that year but they did not hold out any hope that they would be out of the red and in the black in the year ended 31st March, 1959.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that what this pamphlet said was true with regard to rural electrification; it was an amenity; it contributed to comfort and not to output.  It is strange that that comment should still have to be made.  When the original Siemens Schuckert project came before this country they had a chapter about rural electrification.  They did not recommend at that stage any development of the rural areas because at that time the propaganda that developed about that particular project was that, so to speak, everything was <Col N="856" /> being grabbed in, pulled in, to try to get an effective demand for electricity which would leave what was supposed to be the terrible losses likely to be incurred on the electricity project less and less and it would have been regarded as a weakening in those days to mention rural electrification because, of course, the unit price was not going to be the normal price for public lighting, the cities and towns, or any development that was on.  The Siemens Schuckert observation was to the effect that Ireland was about 25 years at that date behind even comparable countries like Denmark, Switzerland and some of the smaller Scandinavian areas in the provision of electrification to the rural areas.</P>
    <P>First of all, a warning was given by the projectors of the scheme themselves and also by the experts who examined it that it would be wasteful use of electricity to have it provided for rural areas if it was only to be used as an amenity&mdash;for light or heat &mdash;and the exhortation was given that every effort should be made to see that electricity in rural Ireland would be applied to something to do with production on the farm or to do something in the way of amenity better than the provision, say, of light.  I notice that at the end of the Minister's memorandum there is talk of having the farms to some extent mechanised and, therefore, to some degree utilising electricity.</P>
    <P>Comment is also made in regard to water supplies.  For many years it was the ambition of certain people who were members of the Electricity Supply Board not only to have the rural areas developed but to have the main use of electricity, as far as propaganda could achieve that, for the provision of water. I know that records were kept by some of the Board's observers of the amount of time wasted in the ordinary country house in going to&mdash;whichever was nearer&mdash;the well or the pump to fetch water and cart it back to the house. The reasonable expectation in this country with its damp climate was that it was hardly possible to delve down in any part of the country to any great depth without discovering water and with the advent of electricity it <Col N="857" /> was expected to develop at least the provision of something more than a comfort amenity, something that would reduce the drudgery of the farmhouse, the drudgery imposed on the women on the farms, perhaps by the provision of water, either for washing purposes of various kinds or for drinking and sanitation purposes.  Here we are in 1960 coming to the end of this development and it is regarded as a hope that there may be some development in connection with the provision of water supplies through the better availability of electricity in the country areas.</P>
    <P>Rural electrification has cost this country a great deal of money&mdash;rather it has cost the general taxpayer and the Electricity Supply Board a great deal of money.  I do not think that is grudged by anybody; certainly it would not be grudged if there were greater development in rural areas and if something were done to make life more attractive there and to get rid of a lot of drudgery, as could be done by the provision of electricity.  But we are coming to the end of this stage and apparently we have not yet got to the point where there is any encouragement given to the people to use electricity in the proper way.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Economic Expansion spoke of electricity at paragraph 115 and said:</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government is to ensure</P>
    <P>(i)  that energy supplies are adequate to meet industrial, commercial and private domestic needs, actual and potential;</P>
    <P>(ii)  that these requirements are provided from native resources to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 117 there is reference to rural electrification and the numbers of consumers who had been supplied at the 31st March, 1958.</P>
    <P>I should just like to make one comment on that&mdash;that, first of all while there was a time when there was a great deal more electricity supplied than there was immediate demand for, when the demand grew so as to equate the supply and went beyond the supply, it was not until the 1939 war had started that there was any effort <Col N="858" /> made by the Government of the time to provide extra generation plant and that only came incidentally to the provision of the Poulaphouca scheme which was mainly a scheme to provide a better supply of drinking water for the city of Dublin.  It had an incidental effect upon the provision, of electricity.</P>
    <P>We then went through the war period, of course, not being able to get the machinery required to have any better development of our resources than we already had and it was not until about 1946 or 1947 that there was any thought of developing electricity with the special aim of providing for the rural areas.  That was the extent of the enterprise of the war in regard to something that had been started and provided against the antagonism of Fianna Fáil in those early years.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken of Bord na Móna and the Turf Development Act but I should like to find out what are the prospects of this institution.  They showed a loss of £904,000 for the year ended 31st March, 1959, and the best they could promise in those days was:</P>
    <P>The Board was confident that given average weather conditions in the future its finances would, within a reasonable period, be restored to the healthy position they occupied before the disaster of 1958.</P>
    <P>The comment made that year, that they had gone back in the disastrous summer period, did not surprise anybody and was in no way a reflection on the Board, but the loss of £904,000 certainly did surprise people and their anxiety was not lessened but was rather increased by the comment that, given average weather conditions in the future its finances would, within a reasonable period, be restored to the position they occupied before 1958.</P>
    <P>What position have we reached with regard to Bord na Móna?  Again, the capital allowances made to the Board were very heavy and I think it is surely possible at this time to say how the Board stands.  Apparently, they are drawing back from time to time, and have been allowed to draw <Col N="859" /> back, certain moneys due by them for repayment.  That is quite a healthy development and quite good but surely there must be an account which can be produced to show the operations of the Board retrospectively for whatever number of years they are in being?</P>
    <P>The number of employees, as shown in the 1959 Report, was 5,779 at peak. They say it is considerably fewer than in the previous year owing to restricted production and unfavourable drying conditions.  Of course it was understandable that the number of employed should have gone down.  For the year 1958 they show that at peak there were 6,720 employed by the Board so that the number had slumped by over 1,000 in the bad year.  I wonder to what point has the peak employment recovered and, apart altogether from peak employment&mdash;which is not a very satisfactory figure&mdash;could the Minister say what is the average employment over, say, a period of four or five years?  One knows, of course, that there is what is called the peak harvesting season, but I understood certain developments had occurred which meant that the harvesting period had been lengthened and I thought in that way employment would have been better spread and that something approaching the peak figure might have been sustained during a greater number of months than had been the case previously.</P>
    <P>However, no matter what the employment may be, it is quite clear that it is not up to the hopes expressed in this House.  The present Minister, speaking down the country on the 6th of this month, said: &ldquo;At no time did Fianna Fáil promise to employ any specific number of people.  Fianna Fáil had devised an extensive programme of economic development the success of which depended on the optimistic ambitions of the people themselves and their belief in the future.&rdquo;  There were, of course, very definite promises and statements made with regard to the numbers to be employed. I was driven to my library to look up some of these old things and there is just a passing reference <Col N="860" /> here to their old plan which was going to provide 86,041 jobs.  That is a very specific number, given in the original plan of 1932.</P>
    <P>He had it down to the very last figure on that occasion and the number he gave was 86,041; that was a most specific figure.  But at a later stage we had a piece of legislation which was called the Turf Use and Development Bill and the present Taoiseach unburdened himself on this when he said that some people were becoming alarmed at tales that the domestic users of turf would be required to use two tons of turf for every cwt. of coal.  He said that he had no hope that we would be able to reach that stage for a number of years to come but that if we did succeed in doing that we would abolish unemployment in this country altogether. He added that he thought there would be very few people who would not be prepared to contemplate such a state of affairs if it would lead to the abolition of unemployment.  A Deputy asked him why did he not do it and the Taoiseach replied that he hoped to do it in years to come but that it would take considerable time and organisation.</P>
    <P>The immediate effort was quite good but people were wondering whether 16 shillings for cutting and saving a ton of turf was good pay or not.  In a debate on the 8th May, 1936, in Column 2554 the Taoiseach is reported as having said:</P>
    <P>It is my ambition to see employed in the production and processing of turf a much larger number of people than is employed in any other industry in this country, except agriculture.  I believe we can do it. I believe we can get from 40,000 to 50,000 people in employment on turf.  It is going to take a long time to do it, but we can do it and we are starting now.</P>
    <P>At a later stage when the present Taoiseach was Minister for Industry and Commerce he referred to the matter again in a Dáil debate of 15th May, 1936, as reported in Column 568. Deputy Dillon said that he would oppose the Money Resolution and the <Col N="861" /> present Taoiseach again referred to the possibility of putting between 40,000 and 50,000 people into employment in the turf industry.  Deputy Dillon called this &ldquo;the wildest and most irresponsible misrepresentation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Galvin, at a by-election caused by the death of the former Deputy McGrath, spoke of the full employment proposals which had been recently announced by the Fianna Fáil Party and promised an increase over five years of 100,000 in the number of new jobs.  If that is not specific enough, I have quite a number of other quotations to give to the Minister but I would prefer to keep them for another occasion.</P>

      <P>I have given some quotations with regard to specific numbers but I do not think that the matter should be left there.  In May, 1946, the present Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, went to Waterford and told a Waterford gathering:</P>
      <P>At last our long night is ending and this is the start of a brighter day.  I am proud to have the privilege of bringing that message to Waterford on the anniversary of the Easter day on which that began.  We have travelled far since then and there is no power on earth to stop us now.</P>
      <P>We know how far we have travelled since then.  We now have 5,000 people fewer in industrial employment than we had in 1955 and 50,000 or 60,000 people have been driven out of agricultural employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister would give me the information for which I was looking with regard to these various accounts, I would be very thankful to him.  With a new Department being developed and the Minister being given charge of it, he should encourage the people <Col N="862" /> by the truth but he will not do so if he is going to develop in his present Department some of those moods which he has revealed to-day, when he said:</P>
    <P>If ever we needed an example of how desperately this country requires modern, searching, unsentimental 20th century dynamic thinking and action through the application of modern fast moving techniques, C.I.E. can be that supreme example.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The sole factor in determining the future pattern of public transport is that of providing the most modern economic and convenient form of transport.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to apply those moods to all the other areas of influence which come within his ambit excepting only C.I.E.  When the public were voting money under the 1958 Act they were not thinking of having their transport services reduced to a minimum which apparently it is C.I.E.'s objective to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have before us something like £3,500,000 for the Minister to play with.  That is quite a sizeable sum.  As regards C.I.E. there has been some improvement but there is still room for more improvement.  I should like to call the Minister's attention to the danger of over-dieselisation. It has been a good thing for C.I.E. but there is a danger that we might discover, in a time of crisis, that we have put all our eggs in the one basket.  One can see throughout the country numbers of steam engines cluttering up the side lines and deteriorating into scrap.  If I might use an American phrase, would the Minister consider putting some of these into moth balls so that in the event of an emergency we might have something to fall back on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to express my own appreciation and that of the public of some of the services provided by C.I.E., in particular on the main line between Galway and Dublin.  I am referring to the line via Portarlington. It is a very good service but, while it is a good service, we also have the <Col N="863" /> line via Mullingar and the speed at which the trains run on that line is about the same as it was forty years ago.  There could be no contradiction of that.  It evokes comments from visitors and tourists and is a matter that calls for improvement.</P>
    <P>I wish also to draw the Minister's attention to the need to see that justice is done to the C.I.E. salaried staff pensioners.  They are entitled to the same treatment as other pensioners who have received increases lately.  They have to live and the Minister must admit the cost of living has gone up in spite of the promises made by his Government.  It would be helpful if the Minister would use his good offices with C.I.E. to have a special rate for school-going children.  Where there is a number of children in the household the weekly cost makes a great inroad into the family budget and a reduced rate would be welcomed by parents.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. provide a ferry boat service to the Aran Islands.  It is subsidised like the services in the rest of the country but quite recently I have been informed that a number of cattle were allowed to remain on the islands of Inishmaan and Inisheer.  That should not have occurred because these islanders have not a lot to depend on and to miss, as they did, the May fair was a great blow to them.  The Minister should also take an interest in the improvement of the pier at Kilronan and thereby help to provide a better time-table.  There is also need for the provision of slipways.  This may be a matter for the Board of Works, but since there is a danger of currachs being dashed to pieces at times on the rough sea coasts between these islands, the Minister should see that these facilities, which may be instrumental in saving life, are provided.</P>
    <P>I may step on the Minister's toe when I refer to the Galway Harbour scheme.  This scheme has been made a plaything for the last ten years not alone by this Minister but by other Ministers and other Governments. However, the joke has gone a little too far.  Quite recently the Minister for the Gaeltacht made a public <Col N="864" /> announcement that a new scheme has been approved.  We have heard the Minister saying that he has not yet approved of a scheme.  Whom are we to believe, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, who is a Deputy for that area, or the Minister for Transport and Power?  My information is that the Minister for Transport and Power has done his utmost to quash the whole scheme but, due to the fact that pressure has been brought to bear on him by the different bodies, he is staying his hand in that regard.  I am further informed that it is the Minister's intention to cut by one-third the grant for the scheme and the Minister is waiting for the local elections to be over before he makes that announcement.</P>

      <P>No.  It would be difficult enough in our constituency without his putting the last nail in their coffin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it it will not be cut by one-third?  From what I can gather from the Minister's attitude he is about to lock the door on the Galway Harbour scheme and throw away the key.  That is the way I see the Minister's conduct since he went into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may ask what interest have I, as a western Deputy, in a port on the East coast but coming from a major tourist centre I think it is about time to examine the position in relation to the pier at Dun Laoghaire.  I raise <Col N="865" /> that question both from the tourist point of view and from the point of view of returning emigrants.  We have many returning emigrants and they should not be treated as we have seen such people being treated at Dun Laoghaire in the past few weeks.  We have heard the Minister speak on this question in the past and I hope that when the peak period comes he will show sufficient interest to avoid a recurrence of this situation.</P>
    <P>Expenditure to date on the provision of an airport at Cork is £625,000.  Now that this facility has been provided at Cork, I should like to stress the claim of Galway.  We have been promised technical assistance by the Minister. While we are grateful for technical assistance, we think something more should be done.  We do not want the vast expenditure that has been incurred on other projects.  We have the airfield. It is merely a question of developing it.  It is the property of Galway Corporation.</P>
    <P>We look forward to the Minister extending something more than just technical assistance.  Now that Limerick, Cork and Dublin have been developed, I think it is our turn.  We anticipate that the Minister will extend his activities to Galway.  It is only right that he should because we are a major tourist centre.  We have two seasons; we have the peak tourist season and we have the anglers in the off-season.  The point I should like to stress is the fact that Oranmore is a fog-free area and, from that point of view, its development would be an advantageous proposition in the event of Shannon being fog-bound.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us, when he is replying, whether he intends to cut the grant for Galway Harbour. I should also like him to reply to the other points I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to his new Ministerial post.  He is the one member of the Cabinet who never wastes any time in giving help when he sees a sound project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to C.I.E., I think many of the services provided could be, and should be, run on better lines.  There <Col N="866" /> are districts, thickly populated areas, which so far have not been served by C.I.E. at all.  When one goes to C.I.E. and asks them to investigate the possibility of diverting a bus service, or providing a new service, to cater for residents in a particular area, one is told that the road is not fit to carry a public transport service. I have in mind the area from Clifden to Cleggan, a very thickly populated area.  Children in the area attend schools in Clifden and they need transport to convey them to and from school.  There are three C.I.E. buses stationed in the town of Clifden.  One of them could easily go out in the morning and return to Galway and, on the return journey that evening, the bus could call to Cleggan, approximately seven miles, catering for both the school children and the residents in the area, plus the people landing at Cleggan Pier from the Island of Boffin.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will get the responsible officers to consult as soon as possible on the question of providing a proper pension scheme for C.I.E. workers.  Such a scheme is long overdue.  I understand the men are prepared to contribute a certain figure.  It is only right and fitting that in this year, 1960, a proper pension scheme should be drawn up for them.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to livestock being left on the islands at Aran. That may be so, but there is probably an explanation.  The Aran ferry boat looks all right, but she is not the right type of boat for that service at all.  In the first instance, she is built too high and it is next to impossible either to load or unload her at both Inishmaan and Inisheer in stormy weather or when there is a heavy sea running.  I have travelled on that boat several times.  I am fairly used to the sea and I understand the position. When she goes out of service, if she ever does, I hope a more suitable ferry boat will be provided.</P>
    <P>Investigations have been going on between the Office of Public Works and the Office of the Minister for the Gaeltacht&mdash;I dare say the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power will enter into the picture now&mdash;in connection with the pier at Kilronan.  It is <Col N="867" /> high time the pier was lengthened on the east side.  The approximate width of the pier at its head is roughly the length of the Aran ferry boat.  The skipper, having called to the other two islands, has only about an hour, or two, at Kilronan before he takes to the sea again.  If he does not take her out with the tide she is left grounded.  An extension of 30 or 40 yards on the east side would solve the problem.</P>
    <P>It is very disheartening for tourists, particularly on those days when the boat calls to the other two islands, to find that they have only an hour or two when they reach Kilronan for sightseeing purposes.  Everybody knows that transport on the island is by pony and trap or pony and sidecar. The main attraction is, of course, the Dun Aengus cliffs and the Seven Churches.  In the time available under present circumstances it is quite impossible for tourists to visit the Cliffs or Churches.  A longer period would afford them a better opportunity. At the moment they are compelled to turn back in disappointment.</P>
    <P>With regard to bus services, the emphasis where mystery tours are concerned is mainly in and around city areas like Dublin.  There is a great deal of scope for such tours in the West generally and it is high time that someone examined that aspect of the bus services.  From Galway city you have Salthill, a very popular bathing place, Barna, Forrba and Spiddal, which is just 12 miles away.  If C.I.E. want to make their services pay an ideal way of gaining revenue would be to put extra buses on this route, at least during the summer months, and provide a real service between Galway and Spiddal.  The Minister may tell me there are three services on that road at present.  I admit that is true, but the hours of these services do not suit people who wish to spend an afternoon at the seaside and then return home.  The last bus back to Galway is, I think, around 3.15 p.m. to give a connection with the 3.30 p.m. train.  That is too early because people <Col N="868" /> generally like to have their lunch first and go to the seaside afterwards.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tell us what is the position in regard to the Galway docks.  I know it has been a source of worry to him but the people of Galway are also worried about what is going to happen.  I think it time some investigation were made and engineering advice given in regard to our airfield. If that were done some air company would probably come to the West.  I feel it would be a most direct route for tourists coming from England or elsewhere and would result in much greater tourist traffic to the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested in the congratulations bestowed on C.I.E. for the improvements they have made nor am I interested in whether or not Fianna Fáil kept the promises they made.  That is not my worry at the moment.  However, rumours are prevalent about the West Clare Railway, and that railway is something I have followed with interest over the years.  I am told that C.I.E. are very interested in it at the moment, but I think, somehow or other, not in the right direction.  It is for that reason I speak tonight.</P>
      <P>Years ago I was one of those who helped to hold that railway when it was much worse than it is now, when there was only an old steam engine on it and when it was costing much more to run than at present.  Somehow or other we were successful in holding it at that time.  As a matter of fact, we can say that the West Clare Railway was the first in Ireland on which a diesel engine was tried.  If that railway is taken away from Clare, we might as well be out in Aran because it will cripple the whole of the county.  There is no good in the Minister telling me that he will give the people of Clare a better and cheaper service than they have at present with the railway.  I know that in places where the railways have been closed the people are not satisfied at all and I have heard complaints in this House.  I should not like it if the only thing we could say about the Minister after his new appointment was that he had closed the West Clare Railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see in the Estimates that a grant <Col N="869" /> of £1,175,000 was given to C.I.E. in respect of the years 1959-60 and 1960-61.  That is the taxpayers' money and there are taxpayers in county Clare as well as anywhere else.  Surely the Minister does not expect the taxpayers of Clare to contribute to the closing of the West Clare Railway, if that is what is in mind?  Perhaps I am wrong, but I am just giving a warning. I believe this railway should not be closed and I consider, rightly or wrongly, that the railways are the main arteries of every country.  In the bad old days when trains could not be run on the main lines, the extraordinary thing was that the West Clare Railyway kept going.  Even today it is doing its fair share in feeding the main line from Limerick with traffic.</P>
    <P>I believe we are entitled in county Clare to our share of that £1,175,000 as well as the other counties where it is being spent.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind what I say and, if he can at all, to make sure that this line will not be closed.  If it is closed he will have the people in Clare against him, no matter what Government are in power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very impressed by the Minister's detailed statement dealing with the various aspects of transport here, shipping, aviation, and so on.  I believe the Minister will be energetic in his new job and I have no doubt but that he will be successful.  It is the first time he has introduced this Estimate and I personally wish him well in his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has more or less sounded the death knell of the canals. I am not so much concerned about the canals as I am about the workers on them.  I am talking of my own constituency where there are many lock-keepers and others who gave years of service to the Canal Company and later to C.I.E.  I should like to see those workers, when displaced or rendered redundant, get a fair crack of the whip. Their wages have been very small over the years and while their work may not have been particularly difficult, they did have to stay at their posts sometimes for 24 hours a day.  I would ask the Minister to make representations <Col N="870" /> to C.I.E. to ensure that they are treated justly.</P>
    <P>While I know that C.I.E. are getting it very hard&mdash;that they have been forced to come to us time and again for help&mdash;I feel that some small gesture should be made by the Company to their pensioners who at the moment are endeavouring to exist on miserable pittances.  Any gesture would be appreciated and I hope this matter will be examined, particularly in relation to retired workers who have given over 40 years' service and who are now trying to eke out their final years on very small incomes.  Even though C.I.E. are working on meagre funds, I feel their workers, and particularly their retired workers, should be looked after.  With this in view, I am suggesting that a more advanced pension scheme should be introduced by C.I.E. even if it meant that workers have to pay higher contributions.</P>
    <P>I know of cases of men who retired from the services of the company at a weekly wage of £12 a week, who are now getting as low as 30/- a week pension.  Those men may get anything up to £2 5s. a week in social benefits, but their aggregate incomes are still very small, frequently sufficient only for the bare necessities, and consequently they have to rely on their families to keep themselves and their wives in even frugal comfort.</P>
    <P>It will be said, of course, as I have already pointed out, that C.I.E. must tread very warily because of their financial position.  While on that point I want to congratulate the present Board and the Chairman who are trying to do their best to get the Company out of its difficulties without having to approach us for the money.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make is in relation to the C.I.E. boat on the Shannon.  I must say it is very much appreciated and availed of during the summer months.  From the tourist point of view I think it would be a great asset if we had similar pleasure boats to take tourists on trips round the south and west coasts.  I would suggest that these boats should make a series of weekly cruises.  I feel sure such cruises would be a tourist draw. Perhaps Bord Fáilte could assist in <Col N="871" /> this.  It may be argued that the expenses would be prohibitive, but I consider the suggestion worthy of examination by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I was very happy to hear the Minister's very favourable report on our shipping services.  It was very heartening to hear that Irish Shipping has achieved some of the things we had always hoped for&mdash;that we have at last a shipping service that can compare very favourably with that of other countries in a competitive market.  It is a wonderful advance in a few years.  I welcome also the Minister's statement about our harbours. Indeed he is to be congratulated on the work he did during the period he was associated with the Department of Lands and Fisheries.  He took a very active interest particularly in the reconstruction of harbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What harbours did he reconstruct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>He could not have a magic wand.  He did bring over here an expert on harbours from Sweden and he got a report on how best our fishing harbours could be reconstructed. I appreciate very much the efforts he made to improve our harbours. I hope that his jurisdiction still extends over the harbour at Skerries.  Only the other evening I noticed there were up to 20 fishing boats cluttered on top of one another there.  I know the Minister for Lands and Fisheries has the matter under consideration but I feel the Minister for Transport and Power should still take an interest in an aspect of our economy which he started to improve.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the Hill of Howth tram.  I know it is not entirely due to C.I.E. but to Dublin Corporation that there is now no service there because there is not a proper road over which to take a bus.  I would ask the Minister to investigate the possibility of having a single deck bus specially constructed for hill climbing. Part of the road from Stella Maris to Bailey Post Office is rather dangerous and C.I.E. have decided not to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are two transport services going to the Hill and I must <Col N="872" /> again compliment the road transport manager who is doing his job as best he can.  I agree he is up against many difficulties but I wonder if a bus were specially constructed could it be put into use on that road to take school children into school, and be used by business people on their way to work in Dublin every morning? I have been agitating to have that road widened for the past ten years.  I know C.I.E. have nothing to do with it but, nevertheless, the people living there are not now enjoying the same service that they had when the trams were in operation.  I readily admit that the tram lines and overhead wires were just about worn out, that they were too dangerous to carry on with, and too expensive to replace, but nevertheless a number of my constituents have been deprived of the services they enjoyed heretofore.</P>
    <P>Many hard things have been said about Aer Lingus, Aerlinte, Collinstown and Shannon.  I would like to point out that when our aviation services were first established by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Taoiseach, they were decried, but I am very happy to say that they are now paying their way. They are an advantage to the country and it must be remembered that we have to try at least to keep in step with other civilised countries.  There is no use in saying that the country could not afford this, that, or the other.  Today we are in the happy position that not alone is Aer Lingus doing well but the Minister can now report that the number of passengers carried last year had increased, and the amount of cargo traffic carried by Aer Lingus and Aerlinte had increased by at least 20 per cent.  That is a very healthy sign and we are all very happy to hear that that side of industry is doing well.  I am sure the services will reach even greater heights. The increasing traffic has proved that the Taoiseach was wise in going into that field, and later extending our aviation services both at Shannon and Collinstown.  I feel that in years to come, as these services are improved, more and more people will use them and I can confidently predict a bright future for aviation in this country.  Our <Col N="873" /> services may have to meet an amount of competition from other companies but they are doing remarkably well.  I welcome the bright note in the Minister's report dealing with aviation services generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that you will agree with me, Sir, that it would be a pity if we did not have the West Clare Railway, and I am quite sure that it would be out of order to have Deputy Bill Murphy regale us with the song that made it famous.  However, I think it is a good thing that there should be a certain amount of sentiment about small railway lines which gave great service in the past but which may not in modern times be able to compete with other forms of transport.  These small lines have a certain value and possibly with an overhaul of rolling stock and a new idea in fares, that is really an old idea, they could compete.  The old idea I refer to, and it was one by which they were able to make money, was that they were not tied to fixed rates.</P>
      <P>I have had experience of another famous railway, the Waterford and Tramore Railway, which always paid a dividend until it was taken over by the Great Southern and Western Railway, which was later swallowed by C.I.E.  It was made pay by reducing fares in summer time.  They reduced fares so much that it was not worth while to stay in Waterford on a Summer's evening when it was so cheap to travel to Tramore.  Thousands of people went out there every evening but now we have the modern idea that there must be a fixed rate and that does not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 1937 there was fierce competition between private bus services operating to Tramore and the Waterford and Tramore Railway.  By then, of course, it was a part of C.I.E. but either C.I.E. or the Waterford and Tramore Railway woke up, introduced a sixpenny train fare to Tramore, and completely defeated competition from the buses.  I think the Minister should ask the officials in C.I.E. to produce the balance sheet of that year for the Waterford and Tramore Railway because I am sure it made a profit, <Col N="874" /> or at least paid its way.  It was much better to see 2,000 paying sixpenny fares than 34 paying two shilling fares and I think the matter is well worth investigating.  I draw the attention of the Minister and of Mr. Andrews to the special excursion trains run during the summer, one of which left at 7.20, allowing people in Waterford time to come home from work, change their clothes and go out to Tramore for a few drinks, or go to a dance or whatever they felt like.  Thousands of people availed of that service and it was good for Tramore to have so many people visit it.  Now, however, practically no one travels on that train.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister's Department, was set up the Department of Industry and Commerce gave good service to Waterford Harbour.  It gave grants and loans to Waterford Harbour Commissioners for the erection of jetties and the provision of cranes. Waterford Harbour pays its way, though perhaps I should be reticent about that because I have seen so much of the public's money poured into harbours which could never repay it.  There should be realism about such things and I am sure the Minister takes that into account.  It should not be just a question of getting a grant for a harbour.  Questions should be asked about it, such as, is its present accommodation sufficient, does anybody want to bring bigger cargoes into it, and are the merchants willing to import bigger cargoes through it?</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that over the years Waterford Harbour Commissioners have been progressive.  They took advantage of the fact that one of the situations that sealed off the advancement of Waterford was that the Great Southern and Western Railway owned practically the whole northern side of the harbour but, by negotiation with the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Taoiseach, and with Mr. Reynolds who was the Chief of C.I.E., an arrangement was made providing for a new jetty and last year the Waterford Harbour Commissioners bought it.  It might not be looked at by some people as a good <Col N="875" /> proposition for the Commissioners to buy it, but I have had the honour to be a member of that body and they approached the matter in a proper manner.  They said it was not a question of pounds, shillings and pence but a matter of policy that the Waterford Harbour Commissioners should own it, that it should not be the property of C.I.E., and that the Commissioners should maintain and look after it.</P>
    <P>As portion of their progressive scheme they acquired a wharf some years ago, called McCulloughs' Wharf, just below the new North Wall.  It is an old wharf mainly composed of wood and is not in very good condition. A scheme is about to be put up to the Minister in regard to the wharf.  It would be a splendid and progressive scheme because two or three ships of great length could lie at one berth.  McCulloughs' Wharf would bring a road in that would make a complete roundabout, giving a road in to the dock and a road out of it.  There are fine railway sidings there and C.I.E. in relation to some of their package deals could have cargo unloaded straight into trucks and driven away from the riverside.</P>
    <P>In the matter of river boats we always seem to look to the west of Ireland.  I have drawn the attention of the Minister's predecessor to this matter.  The Suir is a beautiful, wide and magnificent river with landings at Checkpoint, Passage, Duncannon and Dunmore.  In the pre-1914 days there was a river steamer there which paid.  The only reason why it was brought away from that service was that ships became scarce and valuable and it was sold for a great price. There was a river paddle steamer on the Blackwater from Cappoquin to Youghal, one of the finest river runs that one could have.  I regret that there is not some kind of public service on these rivers.  I would draw the special attention of the Minister to that matter.  I am sure he has enjoyed the Waterford run.  I do not know if he has enjoyed the Cappoquin run.  They are both to be commended.</P>
    <P>In that part of his speech in which <Col N="876" /> he referred to the cross-channel passenger service the Minister committed the sin of mentioning only Dún Laoghaire as an entry port.  I shall not heap coals of fire on the Minister's head for the fact that there was a crowd of people left at Dún Laoghaire for one night because I know it would be impossible to maintain a service up to the very high pitch required to deal with extraordinary circumstances but I would suggest that the reason for the overcrowding at Dún Laoghaire is that British Railways have been pumping passengers into that port for years past.  I have seen the passenger service at Waterford butchered by British Railways.  I have seen their bills advertising travel to Ireland via Fishguard-Rosslare.  One could see bills on railway stations from the carriage windows and if one went nearer one discovered in small print at the end of the bill that there was also a service from Fishguard to Waterford.</P>
    <P>At the ticket office in Paddington I have seen people who asked for a ticket to Waterford being presented with a ticket through Fishguard to Rosslare even though the Waterford boat was sailing that night.  I have been in our Irish Tourist Office in London&mdash;this is something outside the Minister's province&mdash;and heard a man inquiring about transport to Ireland and the Irish public servant there could only mention the trains from Euston and the Irish Mail and did not mention that there were alternative services from Fishguard to Rosslare, Fishguard to Waterford and Fishguard to Cork. The Fishguard to Cork service is still in operation and is a magnificent service. The Fishguard to Rosslare service is in operation.  If the Minister were to draw the attention of British Railways to this matter and ask them to attempt to funnel some of their passengers to these ports of entry during the busy season it would facilitate traffic.  I have seen these ports very crowded but never to the extent of the overcrowding that takes place at Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>This all comes of an old policy. I was at a presentation dinner to a gentleman who was an agent of British Railways in Dublin.  In all the <Col N="877" /> speeches that were made the port of Dublin was mentioned exclusively.  I got up and mentioned that it was possible to enter Ireland through other ports.  I regret that we have lost our passenger service which, in my opinion, we should not have lost. British Railways should have been compelled to retain that service.  A British Act of Parliament provided that they should maintain a six day service.  We made a concession and gave them a three day service during the economic war.  They bludgeoned us into it because it did not appear that the Waterford Harbour Commissioners would get any support from the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I want to commend the Minister in respect of the new air service for cars. That is a very important service in relation to the tourist industry.  The fact that the roads in England are crowded may induce people to come over here and bring their cars by air or by sea.  It was mentioned by British Railways that they were to bring cars through the port of Waterford if the Rosslare boats were overcrowded. I do not know the position in relation to that matter at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister should remember that there are other ports besides Dún Laoghaire.  Deputy Burke spoke about ports that the Minister had improved and when I questioned him he said that the Minister had produced a Swedish report.  I would not give two rows of pins for that report. It was mentioned in the debate on the Board of Works Estimate.  It said that Killybegs and Greencastle should be developed as major fishery ports. This has nothing to do with the Minister's office now, but as it was raised by Deputy Burke, I should like to say that it was a pity they were catching so much fish at Dunmore as to confound the experts.  They caught 300,000 to the 100,000 in Killybegs and to the 200,000 at Greencastle. That type of report is of no value&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am actually replying to something said on this matter just before you, Sir, came in.</P>
      <P>A matter that occasionally gets into the papers and to which I am sure, the Minister has had his attention drawn concerns C.I.E.  I suggest that the Minister should see the C.I.E. officials about it even though he has often protested that C.I.E. are a statutory body and that he cannot go to them.  The Minister's colleagues have often said that also about other concerns&mdash;that they cannot interfere.  I shall not accept that because I think the Minister is the representative of the people so far as transport and power are concerned and I consider that he has the right&mdash;if he has not that right he should bring in legislation to secure it &mdash;to go to anybody running a semi-State body.</P>
      <P>I feel the Minister should go to the C.I.E. chiefs and come to an arrangement with British Railways and also consult his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to provide some protection from the type of passenger that Dean Swift wrote about, the yahoo.  Only about one in a thousand of the people who travel in trains and boats carry on in this way, asserting their nationality, challenging everybody on the train or boat and, as we saw reported recently, assaulting a harmless teacher in charge of an educational tour arriving in Ireland and making a nuisance and a persecution of himself to everybody, whether travelling by bus or train.  I think the Minister should consult with the Minister for Justice and see if it is possible, where Gardaí are stationed near railway stations, to arrange that some of them should be on the platform when trains are coming in or going out. They could help the guard of the train, and if necessary take unruly people off the train.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power when he reads in the paper that Mr. Todd Andrews was concerned <Col N="879" /> with this?  Would it not be a matter he should look into?  If he dare not mention it to the Minister for Justice, could he not recommend that C.I.E. should appoint railway police?  We formerly had railway police and there was not such great need for them at that time.  We must try to cope with this singing, challenging type of person who will travel on trains and will always find himself, by accident, in a first-class carriage especially if it is occupied by some poor old lady or some children whom he can shout at, bully and terrify to get them out of it.  This matter should be dealt with immediately.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have mentioned C.I.E. pensions and I want to direct the Minister's attention to these people.  They were pensioned off 10, 12 or 14 years ago, people who, as I said at Question Time, worked for very small wages over very long hours when the railways were made to pay and were given pittances, not pensions, when they came out.  I have seen awards given to people with only very short service.  That is all right when they are declared redundant and are compensated or given reasonable pensions but it seems very hard that this small number of very good servants of the people&mdash;that is what they were&mdash;working for various railway companies should have these small pensions.  As time goes on, with the cost of living increasing, they find themselves in very straitened circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To do what we suggest would not create a precedent because we heard about teachers in the same position who had been working in the old days for very small pay and the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Education recently made an award to them.  I respectfully submit the C.I.E. pensioners' case to the Minister.  I believe he should make a recommendation to C.I.E. to have the matter investigated to see if their lot could be improved.  If somebody in his Department or in C.I.E. says to him: &ldquo;This is not your business&rdquo;&mdash;they might not say it so bluntly but perhaps would say: &ldquo;We are a statutory body and the Minister cannot <Col N="880" /> interfere,&rdquo; the Minister should reply: &ldquo;If you are prepared to put up a scheme that will do justice to these people I shall provide the money.&rdquo;  I am sure there will be no division on that if the Minister brings it before this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay </NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note from portion of the Minister's speech that the increased expenditure is not due in any way to the creation of a separate Department for Transport and Power.  It is interesting also to note that the disappearance of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been offset. If that has been the only result, good and well, but it does not mean that there has not been some additional expense incurred at some particular point.  However, we are not told about that.</P>
      <P>Coming to Irish Shipping I notice that the figures given by the Minister are extremely vague.  There is a good deal of talk about replacements, about keeping shipping efficient and modern and about the placing of contracts.  I notice that a contract for a new boat has been placed in Britain since 1957. I would have thought that contracts such as that might have been placed in Belfast where there is serious unemployment. If we are at all sincere in our expressions about that part of our country, a gesture of that kind would promote goodwill.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that in 1959-60, I think, before providing for depreciation Irish Shipping showed a trading profit of £216,000.  He did not tell us what the amount provided for depreciation is or is likely to be, whether it exceeds £216,000, still leaving a deficit or whether it is less than that figure enabling the company to show a profit.  I should like him, when replying, to say what that figure is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of harbours, we cannot very well be impressed by the promise of things to come.  It is a particular feature of the Minister's Party that the note that must be struck on all occasions is that the dawn is around the corner, that prosperity is looming up and that in the near future we are likely to be <Col N="881" /> on the road to better things.  It is a useful sort of anaesthetic with which to gull the people but how long the people will stand it is another matter. The provision and maintenance of harbours is a very serious matter in the west of Ireland.  I should like to know if the Minister has made any progress with regard to the harbour at Ballina and what is the present position with regard to the harbour at Blacksod.  I do not imagine that very much progress has been made.</P>
    <P>On the question of aviation, the Minister is inclined to rebuke anybody who would suggest that capital expenditure be taken into deficit. Unless it is a complete present I think that capital expenditure must be taken into consideration in some way unless you make all these things book-keeping transactions.  The hard fact is that from the inception of our airports, both at Shannon and Dublin, there has been up to date unrecouped expenditure of £13,016,577.  It is true that the Minister gives a figure in relation to each of them entitled &ldquo;depreciation and interest.&rdquo;  I want to know, and I am sure the House and the country would like to know, how that figure is to be divided, how much of it is depreciation and how much interest.  Again I want to know what the meaning of &ldquo;interest&rdquo; is, what it represents.  Does it represent a book-keeping transaction or is it interest paid to somebody? Was it paid back to the State or to any particular finance companies? These are things that people want to know and that they should know. There should be a proper segregation of these figures if they are to be accepted at all.</P>
    <P>I can well understand the enthusiasm of Air Lingus in the development and increase in the number of their shorter routes to centres in England and Europe.  I can well see the future for that but, having regard to the Minister's own figures for sales, catering and other receipts in Shannon since the introduction of jet planes, how does he expect, or how do the Government expect that the introduction of our own jet planes will improve that situation in any way?  If the jet planes from other countries are <Col N="882" /> by-passing Shannon and if the passenger numbers are being reduced, from what source does he hope or does the company hope to get passengers for our own jet planes so as to improve the situation?</P>
    <P>That is the situation confronting us with regard to Aerlinte and again we are left a figure which is up in the air. The Minister tells us that the excess of expenditure over revenue is £790,000. Why are we not given the figures of the actual expenditure and the figures of the actual revenue?  It is because the gap of £790,000 is in itself sufficiently appalling to contemplate and that if the figure for expenditure were put against the figure for revenue, it would show up the position in a much more unfavourable light?  I should like to know the figure for expenditure and also for revenue so that we could see where we are and what we are doing in relation to this fantastic gamble of £6 million of the people's money on three jet planes.  I cannot see how they are to be used as a profit-making venture except to give reduced fares for further emigration from this country.</P>
    <P>While there is a reduction in the amount which C.I.E. require from the Exchequer, it is quite correct to say that it has been brought about by shorter runs and higher fares in buses and fewer trains.  The closing of lines is causing some concern, particularly in Dublin.  We in the west of Ireland have our own experience of the dead hand on the branch lines with the consequent deteriorating effect that the closing of those lines has had on the areas concerned.  I refer to Achill Sound, Newport, Mulrany and the town of Killala.  These places have never really recovered from that. There is also serious duplication of road and rail services and, while the company says that the closing of branch lines is necessary because they are uneconomic, it is a fact that these lines are uneconomic because of the competition which exists between them and the road services.</P>
    <P>Why not devote some attention to discontinuing road services in certain instances?  I cannot see the point of having so many long distance buses <Col N="883" /> travelling almost side by side with the route that the trains are taking.  Now that trains have become faster, to a very great extent I can see a falling off in the use of the bus and I would suggest that some serious consideration be given to a feeder system of buses from outlying towns to the railway stations rather than have the buses and the trains pursuing a course almost side by side from all parts of the country, from the west, north and south coasts, into Dublin.</P>
    <P>With regard to the closing of certain stations in Dublin, if my memory serves me correctly, the Transport Act of 1958 lays down specifically that prior to the closing of any station notice of that must published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I do not think that has been done in relation to the halts between Dublin and Bray.  That has not been done; it should have been done and the Minister may well find himself in trouble as a result.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the drive in relation to rural electrification begun some years ago is coming to a close.  It is to be hoped that, while the Minister says the more difficult parts of the country have been left last, the E.S.B. will go back on them with all speed.  I can well understand one, two or maybe three houses being placed in such a position as to make connection difficult without a very high service charge but I know of villages comprising up to 20 houses where the initial charges and subsequent service charges are much too high in relation to these people.  These are the villages and the sort of outlying places which are largely in our Gaeltacht areas and these are the places to the maintenance of which we all give lip service.  We say we want to keep that mode of life and the language, in being; it is the mode of life and the language we are told at any rate, which are desired for the whole country ultimately, but it is the people of the Gaeltacht who are most inconvenienced by the attitude of the E.S.B. towards initial costs and special service charges.  There will be losses on rural electrification but <Col N="884" /> the losses are so great that the few villages and few outlying houses, certainly in my constituency, which are affected would not place a great extra burden on the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>The Minister can very well say he has no responsibility for this but, like Deputy Lynch, I think these statutory boards, the E.S.B., Bord na Móna, C.I.E. and all the rest of them, should have regard to what Government policy is.  I am sure they do and I am sure this disavowal of all responsibility on the part of Ministers, not alone the Minister for External Affairs but all Ministers associated with such boards, is merely an effort to by-pass queries of Deputies in relation to them.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that turf development is going ahead but there is one matter to which I want specifically to refer, that is, the private development in relation to milled peat. Bord na Móna tell people who are anxious to promote that interest privately that they have no objection but when companies, firms or individuals seek help from Foras Tionscal or bodies of that kind their applications are turned down without any reason being given, but the implicacation is always the same, that Bord na Móna are able to meet the demand. I know of one firm which has been refused financial facilities although they would have given considerable employment and provided a considerable income to many small producers of turf.  However, that is really not a matter for the Minister except to the extent that he should make it clear to Bord na Móna that, where there is a private industry of that kind likely to start, they should not impede the promoters in any way by private or secret dealings with Foras Tionscal and such like bodies.</P>
    <P>On the whole, while the Minister has done his best to present a picture that would appear on the face of it to be a happy one, it is page after page a record of debt.  Side by side with almost oblique references to debt there is expressed the pious hope that in the future things will be better. That future, from the point of view of these debts in relation to the State, <Col N="885" /> seems to be a long way off.  It is like Goldsmith's horizon of long ago which &ldquo;still as we follow flies.&rdquo;  We do not seem to be able to get ahead of it.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister the exact figures for depreciation and for interest in regard to the air services. I want to know if my figure of £13,016,567 is unrecouped capital, if any interest has been paid upon that sum.  That figure is arrived at by adding the figure of capital to the salaries paid and subtracting the figure given for revenue.  Would the Minister also say what was the figure for depreciation provided for Irish Shipping for the years 1959-60 as against the trading profit of £216,000? Has he any information about or any plans for the harbours at Ballina and at Blacksod?  In regard to the Shannon Free Airport Development Authority, I should like to know what that authority was doing from 1957 on its original setting up until it was superseded in 1959 by the later authority, what it expended and what it cost the people to operate during that time.</P>
    <P>I want to know, too, the figures for expenditure and the figures for revenue in relation to Aerlinte operations in the year in which the Minister says expenditure exceeded revenue by £790,000.  I should like the Minister to be a little more specific in matters of this kind where public money is involved and not to try to cover up through the medium of bookkeeping transactions, which seemed to be the objective throughout the whole of the Minister's speech.  While the overall picture shows great effort on the part of all the people concerned in administering these bodies, it should be remembered that they are operating against a very strong current indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to just one matter in relation to C.I.E. pensions.  The position is, as we are all aware, that the men who retired after 1st April, 1956, have an increased pension, the full rate being 51/3 per week as against 37/6 per week paid to those who retired prior to that date. The full rate is reduced to £1 and 12/- <Col N="886" /> respectively when these men reach 70 years of age.  I know it is very easy to argue that the cost of living is the same for the men who retired one month earlier and, on those grounds, I should expect the maximum of support. I am, however, seeking consideration not on those grounds alone.  I shall not make the case that it would be desirable, or that it would be social justice, to pay pensions to C.I.E. workers in respect of the service they gave to that concern regardless of other considerations.  What I wish to prove, if I can, is that this can be done without serious loss to the pension fund, and without any cost to the State or to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>For the information of Deputies who may not be fully aware of the position or completely familiar with the problem, men over 70 years of age, prior to 1st April, 1956, were in receipt of 6/- per week; this was increased to 12/- per week.  Unfortunately, this was not an absolute 100 per cent. increase because the voucher which had been available to them prior to that increase was withdrawn.  In any event, it is, I think, ridiculous to expect a man to live, especially in the city of Dublin, on a pension of 12/- a week. I know the proposed social welfare legislation will raise most of these pensions to £2 per week, provided these people have the requisite number of stamps, but we are not quite sure when that legislation will be finalised; neither are we sure as to what its final form will be.</P>
      <P>What is required immediately is that the men over 70 who retired before 1st April, 1956, be paid pensions at the rate of £1 per week, an increase of 8/- per week on the present rate, and the men under 70 pensions at the rate of 51/3d. per week, an increase of 13/9d. on the present rate, with a pro rata increase for females and those in between who are in receipt of pensions varying between the two figures I have quoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question tabled by me on 1st June the Minister for Transport and Power gave me certain information in the form of a tabular statement.  On that information I propose now to base certain calculations.  There is a total of 12,566 <Col N="887" /> employees covered by the pension scheme.  I am referring now to wage grade employees.  In the year 1957 those 12,566 employees contributed £37,132 and the Board contributed £302,500.  In 1958 the employees contributed £155,025 and the Board contributed £250,000.  In 1959, the employees contributed £118,079 and the Board contributed £200,000.  The total contributions to the pension scheme in the three years were, therefore, £339,632, £405,025 and £318,079 respectively.  From those figures we can, I think, assume that the average annual income to the pension fund will exceed £300,000 per year.</P>
    <P>The number of pensioners on 1st June, 1960, was 2,630.  The weekly amount paid in pensions at, as the tabular statement says, the most convenient date, was £3,416.  The annual amount therefore paid out in pensions is £177,632.  That leaves over £114,000, or almost half, going into reserve in the pension fund each year. The amount standing to the credit of the scheme at the latest available date was £2,557,662.  This sum is invested in various securities approved by the Government and must yield substantial dividends each year, dividends which are put to the credit of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I set out to show that almost as much money goes into reserve as is paid in pensions.  I should like to examine now what effect my earlier suggestions would have if they were adopted and acted upon.  There are 1,210 pensioners exactly, in receipt of 12/- per week.  One of the purposes of my contribution to this debate is to seek to have these pensions increased. For all those who are over 70 years of age&mdash;we can take it, I suggest, that the mortality rate would be fairly high&mdash;an increase from 12/- per week to £1 per week, or 8/- per week, for 1,210 would amount to £484 per week or £24,168 per annum.  There are 136 pensioners receiving 37/6d. per week. Those should be increased by 13/9d., I suggest, to 51/3d.  An increase of 13/9d. per week for 136 pensioners would amount to £93 8s. 4d. per week, or £4,857 13s. 4d. per annum.</P>
    <P>There are 43 other male pensioners <Col N="888" /> and 29 women pensioners.  It is impossible for me now to work out the exact pro rata increase in relation to these 72 pensioners but, taking an average figure of £1 per week, I am quite satisfied it would work out at a good deal less than that average and we would find the cost of the increase in respect of these 72 pensioners amounting, on an average, to £3,744 per year.  The total extra amount, therefore, to be drawn from the fund each year would be £32,769. In other words, the interest on £2,057,662 invested in gilt edged securities and on the £211,662 on Bank deposit would more than cover the cost of these increases and the amount standing to the credit of the scheme would continue to increase at the rate of at least £70,000 per annum from the interest alone earned on the pension fund.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, I think, that both in equity and justice, these people are entitled to be considered for a minimum increase in pension.  I should like to add that the same case can be made for salaried officers and clerks.  To the credit of the scheme in relation to them there is a sum of £1,338,446 standing.  For the C.I.E. superannuation scheme, 1951, for salaried staff there is £1,089,027 standing to credit.  I put it to the Minister that he should use his good offices with C.I.E. to see that these people get an immediate increase in pension.  Taking the average rate of interest at 4 per cent.&mdash;I think 4 per cent. is a fair figure&mdash;the increases I have suggested would not come to even half the moneys earned by way of dividends.  The dividends from this money invested could easily enable the increased pensions to be met.  That is the principal matter about which I wished to speak and it is the only criticism I have of the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>I think the establishment of this Department was a most desirable development and I should like to congratulate the Minister on the wonderful work he is doing.  Transport and power in this country are now moving as never before and are very much in the headlines.  The right steps have <Col N="889" /> been taken by the various semi-State bodies to cope with the threat of jet-airlines and to prevent further losses on our railway system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>We know at last from the Minister's statement what sections of the Department of Industry and Commerce were handed over to him when he became Minister for Transport and Power.  The last speaker congratulated the Minister on the good work he was doing but I can assure the Deputy that the people of South Kerry have not the same high opinion of the Minister.  One of his first actions was to close the branch railway lines in that area and leave it derelict in the matter of transport. Protests have been made by the people concerned in connection with the closing of the Headford-Kenmare line and the Farranfore-Cahirciveen-Valentia Harbour line.  An assurance was given that an alternative system of transport would be provided and that it would not be more expensive, but very soon after the closing of the lines bus fares were increased.  This was a blow particularly for school children who had concessions on the Farranfore-Cahirciveen line.  Representations by the teachers and parents were made to C.I.E. about three months ago, but we have heard nothing about it ever since and the increased fares still stand.</P>
      <P>Lorries are not suitable for the transport of livestock, and this is especially true in South Kerry where the roads are winding, narrow for the most part, and dangerous.  We hear a great deal spoken about road safety nowadays, but surely it is not improving road safety to have these heavy C.I.E. lorries travelling along these roads.  In view of all the tourist and other traffic in this area, I think it was suicidal to close down the branch lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also hear a great deal about improving the Gaeltacht, but surely no consideration was given to that when these branch lines were closed.  The railways are used by school children, or emigrants going abroad and are used particularly by the poorer section of the community.  The system of transport they have now is entirely unsuitable and not at all in keeping with <Col N="890" /> the promises made by the Acting-Chairman of C.I.E.  As I said, these lorries are not suitable for the transport of livestock and they are also not suitable for the transport of wool.  A large quantity of wool is sent from the mountainous districts of South Kerry.  The closing of the Farranfore-Cahirciveen line has had a very bad effect on tourism&mdash;numbers of people took advantage of that railway&mdash;and in fact it has had a bad effect on the whole Ring of Kerry route.  There is no other system of transport there.  People tell me that the C.I.E. buses are not as suitable at all.  They run regularly, but they are not entirely suitable.  People were so accustomed to the other system of transport that I am afraid it will take a long time before they are satisfied with the alternative system.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest sufferers of all were the employees on those lines.  The closing of the lines meant that many of them were retired on small pensions and gratuities and a number of them were transferred elsewhere, thus breaking up their homes and separating them from their old friends and neighbours. Some alteration was made recently in the Dublin to Bray line as a result of which some stations were closed.  Why was that not done in connection with these two branch lines in Kerry?  After all, the losses incurred were not so very much.  They were due, I think, to improvements on the lines which were carried out about a year or two before they were closed.  There did not seem to be much economy in that.</P>
    <P>The lines were improved in various ways, the stations were painted and the next thing was that an order was made to close them.  As I said, the losses would not be very much.  The Minister in his Estimate spoke a great deal about the airlines.  There are losses there too; yet the airlines are being continued.  But the poor man's system of transport is discontinued.  I admit that the people did not, perhaps, make use of these lines as they should have done, but no effort was made to induce them to use the lines to such an extent that no losses would be incurred.  The position now is that these people in South Kerry are left with a system of <Col N="891" /> transport entirely unsuited to their needs.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>Section 50 of the Social Welfare Act 1948 provides that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where</P>
      <P>(a)  a widow's (non-contributory) pension which includes any child's (non-contributory) allowance has ceased to include such allowance, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the widow to whom such pension was granted has not at the date of such cesser attained the age of forty-seven years and six months,</P>
      <P>such pension shall cease to be payable on the expiration of six months after the date of such cesser, without prejudice however to the regrant of a widow's (non-contributory) pension to her when she attains the age of forty-eight years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The widow in question was in receipt of a pension which included an allowance for a child up to the 2nd November, 1959, when the child reached the age of 16.  She had not then attained the age of forty-seven years and six months and accordingly her pension ceased to be payable six months afterwards.  The widow will not be 48 until February, 1964.</P>
