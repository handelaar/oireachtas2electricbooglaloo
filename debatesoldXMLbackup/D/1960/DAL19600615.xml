    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> That a sum not exceeding £335,800 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported last night, I was referring to some of the disabilities which applicants for various types of social assistance suffer with regard to the application of the means tests.  I cited a number of these cases.  Another type of case which I met concerned an applicant for an old age pension whose husband was in employment in England.  He was sending home a small amount per week to his wife. She lived with her married son.  There was a cottage plot and a cow.  The position was that these means were assessed against her in her application. What I was trying to convey was that in the application of this code and the regulations which govern an award of pension the officials should find on the side of the applicant rather than on the terms of the strict enforcement of the regulations.</P>
      <P>Might I inquire from the Minister regarding a statement I saw published in my constituency, concerning the three days waiting period in connection with unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, whether it is a fact that the three day waiting period is being abolished?  In regard to widows' and orphans' pensions the manner in which the age clause is applied at the moment does result in cases of hardship.  Take the case of a widow under 48 years whose children, still under 16 years of age, are at school.  If a child is over 16 and the widow is still under 48, I understand that the widow's pension ceases until such time as she reaches 48.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister will appreciate the fact that in rural areas it is not easy for a woman at that age to find employment readily.  At that stage she is left in a small town or village without any <Col N="1313" /> means beyond what she can get by way of assistance from the local authority.  I think that the hardship of these cases ought to be recognised and that the interpretation of the code in those instances ought to be in favour of the applicant rather than in favour of the strict application of the regulations.</P>
    <P>In regard to insured persons, I should like if the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary would clarify the position in connection with the single person who is insured and who has a rather small wage.  Such persons may be working away from home&mdash;in rural areas it happens that they might be three, four or five miles from the nearest town&mdash;and in receipt of a wage of approximately £5.  If these people have not blue cards, should they become ill and have to visit the local doctor, is there any way by which they can recoup the necessary fees they would pay to the local doctor for his services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The fuel scheme is not applicable to rural areas.  The old age pensioners in the rural areas, as distinct from the urban areas, have just as much difficulty in trying to provide fuel for the winter time, particularly an old age pensioner who is living alone.  When such a person applies for assistance one of the things held against him is the fact that he has an old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the provision of boots the amount of the assistance seems to be a pre-determined sum.  This scheme <Col N="1314" /> appears to be administered very justly and very wisely but it does not allow for the large number of applicants. The officer administering the scheme can only divide the money available between the number of people claiming assistance and he has to be more concerned with the amount of money at his disposal than with the number of people who apply for assistance.</P>
    <P>When dealing with these Estimates for social assistance, we should lay more emphasis on the word &ldquo;social.&rdquo;  In the rural areas those who engage in agricultural pursuits have a deep sense of grievance against the administration of the system which deprives them of a pension when they come to the end of their time.  They feel that having worked and contributed to the national income and having tried to make provision for their families, the fact that they have made such provision is held against them in such a way that they cannot qualify for a pension.  That is part of the operation of the means test and it would be preferable if it were widely understood and publicised that there is a limit to the class of person who can obtain a pension. People feel that when they reach the age of 70 they are entitled to a pension but, when they apply for it, they find that there are many things which debar them from getting it.  It would be much better if the regulations were more widely explained and publicised.  If that were done many heartaches would be avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few observations on this Estimate.  The unemployment returns suggest that there are more than 50,000 people registering as unemployed.  The Minister for Finance, speaking in this House on the 15th March, as reported at Column 558 said:</P>
      <P>In 1957 emigration was very high, as high as 53,000.  In 1958 the figure came down to 32,000 and all I have heard about 1959 is that it is higher than 1958 by a few thousands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means that in those three years over 100,000 people emigrated.  If those people had not emigrated how many unemployed would we have <Col N="1315" /> now?  Would it be a miscalculation to say that if those people had not emigrated we would have over 150,000 people unemployed now?</P>
    <P>It is true that Queen Elizabeth or Cromwell, after their activities, could have pointed out that there was no unemployment in the province of Munster.  We all know the report made by the poet Spenser, after he had travelled in Munster, when he said that there was nobody at all in Munster, and nobody at all over wide areas of the country.  He might also have reported that there was no unemployment but those of us who know the facts would have found little cause for rejoicing in that information.</P>
    <P>Cromwell used to say that he proposed to send the Irish to hell or to Connacht.  He sent a great many into eternity.  We would like to think that he sent them to Heaven.  Elizabeth sent many of them to eternity but the present Government sends them to the United States of America or to Great Britain.  The end result is that they are going.  It is necessary when we consider the unemployment figures that we ought to consider them in the background of the fact recorded by the present Minister for Finance that in the last three years over 100,000 people emigrated.</P>
    <P>When I see the Minister for Social Welfare shaking hands with the Parliamentary Secretary and thundering here about the glorious results of his Government's activities during the last three years, I often wonder if he and his supporters have entirely forgotten that tragic statistic that one of the economic results of their activities has been that 100,000 people between the ages of 18 and 25, with the addition of their parents, have left this country.</P>

      <P>The relevancy of this line of discussion does not seem very clear to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the tragedies of our present situation that no one seems to see the relevancy of <Col N="1316" /> this matter.  We produce unemployment statistics and the Minister can speak only of himself and the glorious activities of his Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting to you, Sir, that if these people had not been shovelled out of the country, the Vote which we are at present considering would contain provision for them and the fact that we are not providing more for unemployment is not due to the fact that more employment has been provided for our people but to the fact that they have been shovelled out of the country.  That is relevant surely?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, we can <Col N="1318" /> leave it at that.  If we are not to discuss it, we are not to discuss it.  They are gone and we shall not refer further to them.</P>
      <P>I should like to go on record as expressing my appreciation of the unfailing courtesy of the Department over which the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister preside.  I also have the experience that there is no Department with which one raises more queries, probably, than the Department of Social Welfare and in my experience no Department which takes greater trouble to assist Deputies in resolving the sometimes extremely complex and difficult problems.  I do not share Deputy Kyne's view that there is reluctance on the part of officials to answer questions because, in my experience, it is very frequently the case that the full facts are not placed before the Department and that where they are brought to their attention, the officers in that Department are only too anxious to help anybody who is in a position to collect the facts to get them interpreted so that the claimant will receive what he is entitled to under the law.</P>
      <P>I think it is true, and I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary will deny it, that as a matter of policy in recent times, the Parliamentary Secretary has been endeavouring to apply the rules and regulations somewhat more rigidly than they have been applied in the past.  I do not know the rights and wrongs of that but I can see that in rural conditions in Ireland, it often creates great difficulty if a practice which has been in operation for a long time is suddenly radically altered.  The Parliamentary Secretary might carefully consider, particularly in the congested areas in the west of Ireland, whether strict application of the letter of the law is always the wisest course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has often occurred to me&mdash;but this is purely a personal opinion&mdash; that it is worth considering whether the whole basis of unemployment assistance might not be reviewed in connection with the congested districts but on the whole I do not think I had better pursue that because I feel that if I did I would probably be opening a question which would involve legislation and that would be an unreasonable <Col N="1319" /> trespass upon your patience.  It is a matter to which I shall return on another occasion.</P>
    <P>There are three other details I want to refer to.  It has been drawn to my attention that when members of the Army are approaching the end of the period of their engagement, the basis on which they retire is that they are quite young men in their forties.  They naturally aspire to get jobs as soon as may be after they retire from the Army but cannot get registered with an employment exchange until they have retired from the Army.  That is a mistake. If a man is energetic and anxious to get into a job as soon as he has left active service, he ought to be provided with every facility that we can give him and one of those facilities ought to be that he should be entitled to put down his name at the labour exchange with a statement that he will be available for employment after a certain date.</P>
    <P>We have got into the unhappy habit of looking upon labour exchanges, not as places for bringing employees and employers together, but rather as places simply for registering unemployed people and paying them benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  We should emphasise more and more the functions of the labour exchange as an employment agency, a place where good men can register for suitable employment and where employers would be encouraged more and more to seek suitable applicants for any vacancies they may have.</P>
    <P>I imagine that ex-members of the National Army with good records would be eagerly sought by most employers who had vacancies suitable for them and if it were widely known that men retiring from the Army at the end of their period of service habitually registered at the labour exchange, a regular demand would quickly grow up with the branch managers to notify such applicants of vacancies and employers would put in requisitions for any available personnel that fell within that category.  I do not know why this regulation has been allowed to exist so long but the time is overdue when it should be altered and retiring Army personnel authorised to register before <Col N="1320" /> they are actually unemployed, provided they inform the branch manager of the date on which they will be free to take up employment, if it becomes available.</P>
    <P>When we were passing the legislation in 1954 or 1955 which enabled a small farmer in rural Ireland under £10 valuation to make over his holding to his son for the purpose of getting an old age pension, did we also provide, where a man in those circumstances had a small sum of money on deposit in the bank to dower his daughter or for some family purpose of that kind, that he could anticipate that event and make over whatever little deposit he had in the bank to the daughter or to the member of the family for whom it was ultimately intended for the purpose of getting a pension?</P>
    <P>I had a case recently where a man had received some money from relatives in America and had deposited it in the bank with the intention of providing a dowry for his two daughters. I recommended to him that he should transfer the money to the two girls which, of course, involved some element of risk, but I am not at all clear that, having done so, he was eligible for the old age pension.  If he conveyed the small farm under £10 valuation to his son, and if the money did not enter into the question, he would have become thereby entitled to the old age pension.  It is well worth considering allowing a man in those circumstances to divest himself of a bank deposit so that he may become eligible for the old age pension and put his children in a position to marry or settle their own lives sooner than their original intention to do so.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I wish to raise because it is one of those obscure occurrences that nobody hears about and yet they are a very great abuse.  There is some strange power in the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Department of Social Welfare to give a direction to a local labour exchange manager to include a particular name in any list of candidates forwarded by the branch manager in regard to employment in a State Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> There is a long history behind this. Fianna Fáil, when they developed a conscience about 25 years ago, largely because their jobbery at that stage of their career had become peculiarly nauseating in the nostrils of the people, announced that they had imposed upon themselves a self-denying ordinance that hereafter no minor post would be filled in Government Departments except through the labour exchange.  I do not remember who made that announcement but I think it was a Department of Finance regulation that gave effect to the decision and it sounded very well.  It then transpired that they had set up a patronage secretary in their own Party.  In every Department of State there are a number of small jobs as cleaners, charwomen, porters and messengers and these posts often relate to provincial centres as well as to Government offices in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The old rule in this connection was that these appointments were made by the Minister responsible for the Department.  Under this new rule they were all to be made hereafter through the labour exchange.  However, the patronage secretary was appointed and the practice grew up&mdash;before I was ever a member of any Government I found it an extremely difficult practice to understand&mdash;that when there was a vacancy in any Department of State the Minister's Private Secretary notified the Fianna Fáil patronage secretary, who was a member of this House, and he consulted the local Deputy as to who should get the job.</P>
    <P>All these jobs were to be filled through the labour exchange and a person might ask himself how this abracadabra worked.  The patronage secretary, having consulted the local Fianna Fáil Deputy and ascertained that so-and-so was in the Cumann, and therefore eligible for employment, notified the name to the Private Secretary to the Minister.  Then a very strange machinery went into operation. The Department of Social Welfare was rung up and they were requested to inform the local branch manager that whatever other name he sent up he was to include in the list the nominee of the Fianna Fáil patronage secretary.</P>

The first time this came to my notice was about 1944.  I suppose I was innocent and I had not observed the procedure until then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary procedure.  I discovered that this procedure was in operation in all Departments of State.  I thought it was quite improper and I think it is improper for this reason: it is wholly wrong to send for, say, three men and leave them under the impression that they are being sent by the labour exchange for a fair, impartial interview when in fact everybody knows, except the unfortunate men who are being sent up, that of the three persons, two have not the faintest hope of ever getting the appointment.  There never was any intention of considering them.  They were simply sent up as cover for the other one.</P>
      <P>I think one has to be realistic in these matters.  If the labour exchange sent up three or four men who were all treated <i>ex aequo</i> and one was a man to whom the Minister wanted to give a job, I would not mind if the Minister said: &ldquo;Put those men on a list and give the first available vacancy to my man but see that the other men are kept on the list and, as suitable vacancies arise, let them be appointed.&rdquo;  Somebody must get the job that is going and, provided the others are fairly dealt with, I have no serious reason to complain if the Minister puts them in whatever order he pleases, but I think it is unjust, unfair and an evil practice to ask a labour exchange to send up three unemployed men with a fourth man who will get the job anyway, leaving the families of those three genuinely unemployed men who are seeking work saying the Rosary at home that they will get the job.  Their wives will polish their boots, brush their clothes and get them ready to go to the Department; yet everybody in the place knows the whole thing is a cod, that there is not the slightest intention of considering them.  That is a brutal and shameful practice and it ought to stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When these three or four men, sent by the labour exchange, come to be interviewed, it may transpire that only <Col N="1324" /> two of them are suitable for the kind of post for which they apply.  That cannot be helped, but, if that is so, then those two ought to be put upon a list and given vacancies as they arise.  If all four prove to be suitable, then all four, if they are sent up by the labour exchange and are found to be suitable by the Department, should be put on a list and provided with employment as opportunity offers, but it is wholly wrong, wholly unjust, and wholly evil that we should go through a fake procedure, having three or four decent people put to all the trouble, annoyance and anxiety of coming from the labour exchange to be interviewed for a job when there is not the slightest intention at all of considering them on their merits.</P>
    <P>I would favour rather than that a straight system of patronage because then at least you would not raise false hopes in the hearts of decent people to whom the prospect of employment means everything.  If we are to have, and I think we should have, a system divorced from patronage, even in minor matters of this kind, then it should be an honest system in which all those nominated by the labour exchange will be treated <i>ex aequo.</i></P>
    <P>There is another problem of this kind present to my mind.  Where a person aspires to permanent employment as a postman, I think the labour exchange is consulted.  I have had cases&mdash;I cannot remember precisely the details&mdash;where a situation arose in which a man who seemed to have a very good claim to a vacancy in the service of the Post Office was debarred from applying for it because he was already engaged as a temporary postman and was, therefore, not eligible to register as unemployed, and because he could not register as an unemployed person, he could not be considered for the kind of vacancy he was looking for.</P>

      <P>The labour exchange says it will not nominate anybody unless he is unemployed.  I am trying to put this case: the labour exchange has a dual function.  One is to cater for the unemployed by providing them with benefits and the other is to look for jobs for them.  If a fellow is in a temporary job, apprehends its early ending and aspires to a permanent job, and if the labour exchange hangs up a notice in its window that there is a vacancy for a permanent postman, this fellow walks up to the exchange and says: &ldquo;I would like to have my name submitted for that job,&rdquo; but he is told that he cannot have it submitted because they cannot submit the name of anybody who is not registered with them as unemployed.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that is an improper visitation upon the functions of the labour exchange, and I draw a parallel between the man in temporary employment who aspires to permanent employment and the man in the Army who is about to be released and is looking for a job.  I think that is a category of persons that ought to be allowed to register for employment, that is, for employment different from what they at present have, or for any employment if they are about to retire from their present positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> Supposing a man is notified that his job as a temporary postman is coming to an end in six weeks' time and there is a permanent job available, it is extremely exasperating if he is told that he cannot apply because the rules of the labour exchange forbid the submission of the names of men who are not unemployed persons.  This is not a matter to get excited about.  I am merely suggesting that we should emphasise more and more the function of the labour exchange to get permanent employment for people who want it.</P>
    <P>Personally I cannot see why any man who is employed or unemployed should not have the right to go into a labour exchange and say: &ldquo;I am at present working as a temporary postman but I want a job as a painter, a carpenter, or a slater.  These are the trades to which I was reared but I found it impossible to get employment in them and I am now employed as a temporary postman.  Please put my name down and if a vacancy occurs in any of these categories put my name forward.&rdquo;  I think if a man did that to-morrow in rural Ireland, he would not be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and one of which I suggest the Chair should take notice. The Minister frequently makes reflections upon the capacity of the Chair to maintain order in this House.  They should not pass unobserved.  It is unbecoming that the Minister should invite recrimination across the floor of the House in regard to these matters. I know that so far as Post Office employment is concerned, the facts are <Col N="1327" /> as I have stated them because I have had more than one case in my personal experience.  Naturally that should not happen but it does.  In regard to the patronage operations of the Fianna Fáil Party I know that the facts are as I have stated.  They are, in my opinion, a reeking scandal which ought to be ended.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask, in conclusion, can those who have emigrated&mdash;any of the 100,000 to whom I have referred&mdash; register here for employment in our labour exchanges, while working in Birmingham, London, or Liverpool, or must they be resident here?  I think a great many of these boys and girls would like to come home if they could get employment here, but I do not know of any effective machinery whereby they can make their desire known to the labour exchange here and receive notification of available vacancies.  If such accommodation exists, then I think it should be more widely advertised because, of these 100,000 who have gone in the past three years, I am sure many would come back if there was any prospect of permanent employment for them here.  If notification of that employment has not been a function of the labour exchanges here, I suggest that the figures show that the time is long past when the employment exchanges here should concern themselves to provide employment for those who left this country in the past three years because they could not earn their bread at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent an Irish citizen in Birmingham, or anywhere else, registering by post in any labour exchange here.  Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde raised a point about the recriprocal arrangement with Britain in relation to sickness benefit.  If any Deputy wants full information about the recriprocal arrangements, I suggest he should write to the Department. The arrangements are very involved. With regard to the particular point raised, the following information may answer the Deputy's query:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disability benefit.  The six months' <Col N="1328" /> residence period in the new country during which under the old agreement a claimant was covered by the scheme of the old country is not included in the new agreement. The new country assumes liability for the payment of sickness disability benefit as from the date of the insured person's arrival there.</P>
    <P>I think that meets the point the Deputy raised.  If there are any other points, such as that raised by Deputy Dillon in relation to registration here, I suggest that Deputies should communicate with the Department, where they will get any detailed information they want.</P>
    <P>It amuses me to hear Deputy Dillon talk about jobs and jobbery.  In the Department of Social Welfare there are 60 cleaners, messengers, paper keepers, and so on.  Some have been there for the past 38 years.  The number of civil servants in the Department is in the region of 1,900.  It will be seen from those figures that there is very little scope for patronage.  The majority of the messengers and cleaners are ex-Army men or ex-I.R.A. men.  In the appointment of a cleaner, I have never asked whether he was on the Free State side or the Republican side in the Civil War.  It is enough for me to know that he has pre-Truce service. If there were a scrutiny of the exsoldiers serving in the Department, the majority would be found to have been on the Free State side.</P>
    <P>So long as I am there ex-Army and ex-I.R.A. men will get the preference all the time.  They have to register in the labour exchange, and I have no apologies for any appointment I have recommended.  It comes well from a Party to talk about patronage when it was that same Party which packed the whole Civil Service from 1922 to 1932 with their friends and relations.  Those friends and relations are there today in permanent employment, and devil an examination ever they did.  Even if we wanted to follow the example set we could not have done so because there was no room left.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies mentioned the question of agencies administered direct from headquarters. It was stated that insured persons had paid for the services of local agents and were, therefore, entitled to such services.  It was also stated that it could not be seen how failure to replace a local agent contributed to the efficiency of the service provided.  It is the aim of the Department to provide, and the right of the insured person to receive, the most efficient and expeditious service possible.  Where there is a local agent, the claim for disability, maternity, or marriage benefit must be made to him in the first instance.  He then sends it to headquarters. Cheques in payment of benefit are sent to him from headquarters and he must forward them to the claimants.  All queries in relation to claims are channelled through him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where there is no local agent, these transactions are conducted directly with the insured persons.  It is assumed that less time is taken up by direct contact.  Claimants would generally receive their benefit, therefore, earlier than if there was a local agent acting for them in the area.  It may be said that a local agent helps insured persons to make their claims. On that aspect, I should point out that the questions on the forms are of <Col N="1330" /> a straightforward and routine nature and are well within the capacity and understanding of the vast majority of insured persons.  When they have completed them on one occasion, they will experience no difficulty in making subsequent claims.  In the case of disability benefit the claim form has to be completed only at the commencement of the claim.  Thereafter, it is only a matter of obtaining a medical certificate from the insured person's medical certifier and sending it to headquarters.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the fact that the insured person receives this benefit more expeditiously than through a system of local agents makes this experiment worthwhile.  The experience to date has shown that the arrangements have worked smoothly and to the advantage of the insured person.  Few complaints have been received and the position is kept constantly under review.  Three areas in which there is no local agent were mentioned by Deputies: Galway, Youghal and Carrick-on-Suir.  In each of these areas there is a social welfare officer and an employment exchange or a branch employment office.</P>
    <P>To me, a fact is more important than a form.  In the administration of a large Department which, as the Minister stated last night, handles from 26 to 27 per cent. of the total revenue of the State, you can get tied up in red tape and it is the subscribers, the insured persons, who suffer.  We want to look after them and give them the best service possible.  Speaking from my own knowledge as one living in the country, I can say that many agents are merely glorified postmen.  Even if it costs more, I would recommend to the Minister that there should be direct administration from the office instead of the present position.  It is not general but I have seen sick people waiting until the agent got up or returned from some other task to receive attention.</P>
    <P>We have sickness visitors and I am strongly recommending to the Minister and the Government that they be employed to a greater extent as a substitute for the work of the agents. I believe that would result in the sick people getting better service.  If I may express a personal point of view, this is the way I look upon the administration  <Col N="1331" /> of Government services.  If by some unfortunate circumstance the Dáil were to cease to function and all the civil servants were to die overnight, the people in my area would still live, as would the people in Deputy Lynch's area and Deputy Dillon's area.  But if they, the people of the country, were to disappear, then there would be no Dáil and no civil servants.</P>

      <P>That does not take from the validity of what I am saying. I am concerned with the people in my constituency.  We have had all this sob stuff about agents.  No agent has to resign.  We are trying out an experiment in administering these sickness benefits through the office and by direct contact with the Social Welfare officer.  The experiment is working well and I believe it will help the people.  That brings me to the question of the Social Welfare officers, all 240 of them.  That is no pleasant job for any man.  If any Deputy were to put himself in their position and carry out their task conscientiously, he would not like it at all.  So long as there is a means test, they have to do their duty.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned the question of the assignment and transfer of a farm.  We provided back in 1952 for the assignment and transfer of a farm under £30 valuation to a son or daughter and we did not even stipulate marriage in that assignment.  In the case of a valuation over £30 we provided for the transfer but in this case marriage was stipulated.  Therefore, when the son got married the father and mother were both entitled to the old age pension.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon raised another point about money.  That must be taken into account in the computation of means.  But without transgressing the law, if there was any wisdom in that family that money would be gone long ago, transferred in dowries or invested for the daughter or the son.</P>

      <P>The Deputy raised another point.  I was not very lucid in an answer I gave to Deputy Ryan and in reply to Supplementaries put by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman in regard to soldiers on pre-discharge leave.  We are examining this whole problem.  Before I read this statement, may I say that it is a very big problem?  The State naturally gives a preference to soldiers on pre-discharge leave in the recommendations for subordinate employment in Government Departments.  However, we must consider the wider question of the reminder of the employers in the country.  Can you do the same thing when sending out a list to other employers? However, I informed the Dáil, through the Chair, that the matter is being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the answer I gave, which was incorrect, I wish to reply <Col N="1333" /> to Supplementary Questions by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman arising from a Question asked by Deputy Ryan on the 4th May last.  In my reply to Deputy Ryan's Question, I stated that soldiers on pre-discharge leave were still in receipt of Army pay and, in common with other employed persons who register at an employment exchange, were submitted to a prospective employer only if a sufficient number of persons actually in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, in that order, were not available to afford the prospective employer a reasonable selection.</P>
    <P>I then stated that persons, including soldiers on pre-discharge leave, who have not less than five years' service in the permanent Defence Forces were given preference in submissions for employment in subordinate posts in the service of the State.  When Deputy Sweetman asked if they were given that preference during the period of pre-discharge leave, my mind was still on the first part of the Question and I said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact the position is as stated in the second part of the answer.  The second part was &ldquo;Persons, including those on pre-discharge leave, who have given not less than five years' service in the permanent Defence Forces are, however, given preference in submissions for employment in subordinate posts in the service of the State.&rdquo;  Over and above that, you have employment by the local authorities and by other employers.  As I said, I can go no further now beyond indicating that the matter is being examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish was all hot and bothered about the Department dealing with people who violate the rules, put on stamps illegally and make claims as a result.  He dealt with the 13 stamps.  It is a well-known fact that if you invest two guineas for stamps, illegally, and put them on, you become entitled to about £80 worth of benefit. That is a practice which unfortunately exists and which we want to wipe out. Deputy Corish referred to farmers getting grants illegally.  I have seen farmers being brought to book again <Col N="1334" /> and again when they got grants illegally.  They have been taken up by the Department from which they got the grants and equally we are entitled to deal with offenders under this code.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with 700,000 insured people and it is only natural to expect that there will be offences under the social welfare code by a percentage of that number.  I am not saying the number of offences is very high but it is enough, and if we do not deal with them, then we are opening the door and condoning them.  It is not a trivial offence, as Deputy Corish said, to buy stamps, to put them on and to claim benefit as a result.  When Deputy Corish was Minister, he enforced the law; we are doing the same thing and we have no regrets.</P>

      <P>In regard to free boots, we give a grant to local authorities and it is up to the local authorities to supplement that grant to provide free boots.  I am in touch with the managers in the various counties and it would be very desirable&mdash;we cannot force their hand &mdash;to have a uniform system in giving out these free boots.  To my mind, they are given out too liberally in certain counties.  The free boot scheme was a war-time measure when leather was scarce and when there was real hardship. Now people who are in receipt of substantial wages are getting these free boots in certain areas, while in an adjoining county, there is a far stricter code.  It gives rise to uneasiness and to dissatisfaction and I am in touch with the managers to try to get uniformity. By and large, it was very often abused in certain areas, not all areas.</P>

They are first-class boots.  There has been a practice which I have stood against, and which I shall always stand against, of traders taking in vouchers for these boots and giving out inferior boots which were far worse than the boots the Department passed, and then trying to kick up a row with the local authority because the cheap shoddy boot will not be passed by the home assistance officer, and the home assistance officer will not certify them as being in accordance with the quality as stipulated by the Department.

      <P>Deputy Dillon raised the matter of a person in temporary employment who is looking for a permanent job.  Any person over school-leaving age, whether employed or unemployed, may register for employment at the employment exchange, either by personal attendance or by application through the post.  Details are recorded of age, industrial and other qualifications and experience, as well as the type of work desired.  Local officers canvass employers to secure notification of the vacancies to the local exchange.  That possibility is there and the fact is that, even though they are in temporary work, they can still register for the type of employment they are looking for.  The main function of the exchange with regard to Government employment schemes, of course, when work is available, is to put up for work, first, those who are in receipt of the maximum rates of unemployment assistance and have the greatest number of dependants and after the recipients of unemployment assistance those who are in receipt of unemployment benefit and have the greatest number of dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I do not know about that.  For instance, a drainage scheme may have been started in an area recently, employing technicians and manual labourers.  If it is not his main occupation, I do not see anything to prevent a man from registering and being employed later on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall read this also: &ldquo;For vacancies notified to local officers by private employers, the persons registered for employment who are best suited industrially are submitted, registered of whether they are receiving unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the means test in relation to unemployment assistance, the only way out is to <Col N="1339" /> raise the ceiling.  Beyond £72 16s. 0d. per annum, or £1 8s. 0d. per week in a rural area a man is out of unemployment assistance.  I have seen the interpretation of the means test by the Social Welfare officers and it is very liberal. During the Recess, I mean to make a study of this matter.  Values have gone up so much over the past 20 years that it is very easy to arrive at an income of £1 8s. 0d. on a farm.  I have the greatest respect for a farmer, whether he has two acres or 200 acres. He is the backbone of the country. He is the citizen we must all help out in every way.  Whether or not the dole is the correct way, I do not know.</P>
    <P>The primary object in registering for unemployment assistance is to be lined up for work with the local authority.  That is where the means test comes in.  A man is not so much concerned&mdash;although it is a concern of his&mdash;with whether he is in receipt of 8/- a week or 5/- a week.  He will not dispute that, but if he is knocked off altogether, it means he is knocked off the list the local authority will consider when there is special work in the area.  There is then the problem that is in all our minds, but which is not really relevant, that if you improve his holding and his production by co-operative nationally-directed effort, his income goes up again.  I am straying into two avenues now which do not relate to the Vote before the House, and to which the Ceann Comhairle would not allow me to refer.</P>
    <P>First of all, I think I could lay down the principle that what concerns a man in receipt of unemployment assistance around the seaboard, in the west, the north-west and the south, is where he stands on the list to be employed by the local authority or the State.  When he, by his efforts and his good production, goes off the unemployment assistance list, the supplement that came to him from the local authority or the State is gone.  As I say, I shall look into this problem and I shall make recommendations to my Minister if I can, but I shall endeavour to make <Col N="1340" /> them because the problem is constantly there.  However, I shall refer to it again later on.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any hardship in the application of the means test for old age pensions.  Of all recipients of these pensions, 94 per cent. are in receipt of the full pension.  In some counties, as many as 90 per cent. of those over 70 receive old age pensions. There is no severe hardship.  As a matter of fact, we came across a case the other day where a lady had an old age pension and in her will she left £3,000 to one person and the farm to somebody else and we were the worst in the world when we sought to recover some of the money she had got illegally.</P>
    <P>That is not the only case of that kind we meet in the Department, as Deputy Corish knows.  Saying that officials use Draconian tactics and all sorts of pressure to find out means of applicants is wrong.  If one places oneself in the position of any Social Welfare officer investigating means, one finds it is a most difficult task and, by and large, I think the officers do a good job of work for the State in everything they handle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney referred to the social insurance fund and spoke of tapping it for certain purposes.  I am not a financial authority but when you build up a financial structure such as we have here, it is very dangerous to interefere with it.  You can kill the goose that lays the golden eggs if you start interfering with these things.</P>
    <P>The appeals officers are in close attendance and very frequently visit the various offices throughout the country.  We have added one officer to speed up the hearing of appeals. Deputy Kyne was very helpful in his suggestions about the assistance the insured person can give in making his claim by quoting his number and having the insurance card available.  The insurance card has become a most valuable possession.  I heard Deputy Larkin at one time say of farmers that when the winds of adversity blow, they can retreat to their land, but now you have the position that when adversity comes, the employed man can seek the shelter of his insurance card and he should know its importance. <Col N="1341" /> He should bring his insurance card to his employer when seeking work.</P>
    <P>How often have we come across cases of farm labourers working for long periods for farmers without insurance and when the time came when the workers wanted benefit, it was practically impossible for them to become insured because of the bad financial position of the employers.  It should, therefore, be clear to the insured person that his greatest safeguard is his insurance card.  He should know his number and his rights and now, in a great many cases, he does. That situation is improving.  I want to thank Deputy Kyne for his contribution in that respect.</P>
    <P>In regard to the dental benefit which the Minister introduced and which is of great value, I think this benefit has become very well known.  Along with the treatment of children in primary schools it will tend to make us a very healthy race.  I do not know anything about what happens in the vocational schools, whether there is any school service or not, and it is not for me to introduce that into this debate. Children in primary schools get good treatment.  There is the added incentive to seeking good health in that when 26 stamps are affixed, after a half year's employment, insured persons can now get dental and optical benefits from the age of 16 to 19. These are some of the best benefits of social welfare the Minister has conferred on the community and I think they are fairly well known throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to youths employed as messengers and spoke about the practice of ringing up the employers when they leave work to find out why they left.  I do not accept the <i>bona fides</i> of Deputy Corish to state that.  Very often&mdash;not in all, or in the majority of cases&mdash;there is a desire to get sufficient stamps to go on the register of unemployed for work which does not materialise and I think in these cases the longest way round is the shortest way home and that we should encourage the youth to remain in employment.  If necessary, the method that Deputy Dillon <Col N="1342" /> referred to could be adopted&mdash;to register while employed with the idea of seeking better work, but at the same time to continue in employment while no better work is available.  That system, I think, would be much better than breaking off work on flimsy pretexts such as saying that the pay is small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In a well-organised county like Wexford, there would be no vindictive employers.  The idea of commencing benefit on a particular day of the week does not commend itself because people ordinarily do not get sick on Monday or Friday; they may be struck down with sickness at any time and nobody but the Lord can account for that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I interrupt? Nobody becomes unemployed on a particular day either but I honestly believe it would cut out a lot of confusion if there were certification for a particular day.  There is a particular day on which men are paid unemployment assistance or benefit.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should consider the idea without committing himself now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <P>In regard to employment on the cross-Channel service and the use of Irish stamps as against British stamps, perhaps if Deputy Corish will send us particulars of these cases, we can examine them.  What he said, however, is a feather in the cap for Irish insurance because we lead the British, at least in the case of certain benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a rough figure of 700,000 insured&mdash;not all of them in full insurance.  The weekly recipients of unemployment assistance averaged, over the year, 23,000; unemployment <Col N="1343" /> benefit, 31,000 and disability benefit, 42,000.  It is a very big Department, dealing with a very big sum of money.</P>
    <P>Our desire is to give the greatest benefit possible to deserving people at the least cost to the State.  We must ensure that the moneys they and their employers pay in are not misused, that they are administered properly, that the person who indulges in malpractices will not be encouraged but will, instead, be punished.  We shall see to it that the decent labouring man and the decent employer who stand for good, honest social welfare will get the reward as a result of their contributions. That is our attitude in the Department.  We are not out to make people work unduly hard but we want a return for the money.</P>
    <P>I think we are tending that way in relation to the point raised by Deputy Coogan about decentralisation of the Department.  The shape of insurance is changing.  The Bill the Minister for Social Welfare is bringing before the Dáil indicates a radical change in insurance. It takes a lot of people out of the assistance group to which Deputy Sherwin referred.</P>

(Minister for Lands.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned this debate I was suggesting that some radical measure should be taken to repair the disastrous situation arising in the west of Ireland as a result of the mass emigration that has been taking place which is leaving a very large number of very small holdings derelict.  The Land Commission should cause an inquiry to be made as to exactly how many holdings are now abandoned in the west of Ireland. When I speak of an &ldquo;abandoned holding&rdquo; I mean a holding from which the family has gone and the land of which is set on conacre to neighbours.</P>
      <P>In many cases, where these holdings are now growing nothing but rushes, the Minister might properly ask the Land Commission to consider whether negotiations might not be opened, under the new powers the Land Commission have to purchase holdings for cash, to see if the owners of these holdings who have been driven into emigration would be prepared to sell them to the Land Commission so that they might be used to enlarge the holdings of their immediate neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I foresee that, even if that were done, it is not enough if we are to reverse the disastrous trend which is manifesting itself throughout the western counties.  A very much closer degree of collaboration between the Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture is necessary.  In an <Col N="1346" /> immense number of these holdings one of the urgent needs is to have the soil tested.  Unless farmers get from a holding of 30 to 40 acres its maximum output, there is no prospect of their getting the standard of living which will maintain the rising generation in this country.  Thirty-three acres used to be regarded up to quite recently as an economic holding.  I think you will have to revise that.  With the increased burden which we have put upon the small farmers of the west of Ireland and with the declining prices for agricultural produce, I think it is very doubtful whether 33 acres will now give a man a living.  We are reaching a very critical point because if you enlarge a holding much beyond 40 acres, it will be no longer possible for one man to work it.</P>
    <P>All these holdings are based on family labour.  They are run by the farmer, his wife and family, but I believe still that if we could extend the ownership to farms of about 40 acres and if we could get the Department to collaborate enthusiastically in getting the soil tested, in helping the farmers to get out the necessary fertilisers and in assisting farmers in the technical problems of production and marketing, it would be possible to get from holdings of that size a reasonable living, which a considerable number of our young people might prefer to the alternative&mdash;emigration.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in discussing this Estimate is this watertight division between the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture, because much of what the Department of Lands may undertake becomes nugatory if the people for whose benefit they do certain things do not follow it up by availing of the advice and facilities provided by the Department of Agriculture.  I think that if the Department of Agriculture is not prepared to provide a national advisory service, the land division will have to follow the example of the beet sugar company and certain other enterprises and provide their own advisory services, because I am firmly convinced that launching small farmers out under modern conditions with 40 acres of land, with no advice how best to <Col N="1347" /> use it, is a very wasteful and ineffective procedure.</P>
    <P>Personally, I would prefer to see the national advisory services administered by the Department of Agriculture working in close collaboration with the Land Commission.  That is a matter which I suppose should be raised on the Agriculture Vote.  If that is not available, then I think the Land Commission ought to consider providing an advisory service of their own.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting thing that the Department of Lands does administer a number of credit schemes for a variety of improvements and so forth that farmers can undertake but I suppose the general question of credit is more appropriate to the Department of Agriculture again.  Probably it is better it should be left to the Department of Agriculture, provided that the close collaboration which I suggest should exist is brought into being.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would clear up one obscurity which exists.  It was stated here by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Childers, that there is now, as the result of a Land Act in the 1950's, no difficulty for a person who wishes to lease land to a neighbour in doing so.  The old problem of creating a tenant right, Deputy Childers said, was eliminated by some provision of the Land Acts in the 1950's but I am told that, even though that hazard has been disposed of, there is some other difficulty about giving a lease for land in this country against which a good solicitor will warn his client.  It has something to do with some leasehold Act.</P>
    <P>The net point is: Can any person with safety to his own title give a neighbour a lease for 20 years for a particular piece of land or holding of land?  I heard it advocated strongly that the Land Commission itself should lease land to young farmers.  That case has been pressed upon the Commission by farmers' organisations in the country.  I wonder would the Minister explain this to me?  What is the difference between the Land Commission leasing the holding to a young farmer and the Land Commission <Col N="1348" /> selling the holding, under the existing Land Acts, to the same young farmer? The only difference I know is that if the Land Commission lease the land, the young farmer will be expected to pay an economic rent, whereas if the Land Commission sell the young farmer the same land, he will be asked to pay only one half of the economic rent.  Is that not true?  If he leases the land, the rent will be in perpetuity, whereas if he purchases the land, the rent will be a terminable annuity extended for about 54 years.</P>
    <P>As I understand the present procedure, if a person has land given to him by the Land Commission and holds it for about ten years unvested, during that period it is open to the Land Commission to resume the holding, if it does not appear to them that the land is properly used.  After ten years, it becomes the absolute property in fee simple of the tenant purchaser. What advantage is that to a young farmer in being allowed to lease? As far as I know, the only thing that is requisite to achieve the purpose of providing accommodation for the young farmers who have no land but have capital and know-how is that the existing categories of persons to whom the Land Commission are permitted by law to allot land should be altered so as to include amongst the eligible allottees landless persons who have capital and a certain stimulating education in an agricultural school or college.  I should be glad if the Minister would say whether that is correct or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in answer to a Parliamentary Question addressed to him by me recently, said he was examining means whereby the issue of bonds by the Land Commission to persons from whom they purchase land will be expedited and that these inquiries had not at that time been completed.  I should be glad to know now if any progress has been made in that direction and, if so, what.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that land bonds paying 5½ per cent. are not a bad buy. The complaints I received are that the <Col N="1349" /> people cannot get them quickly after their land has been surrendered, not that they do not want to take them.</P>
      <P>I think it a terrible thing that people here may accept what is becoming a current heresy, that is, that the day of the small farmer is done.  It would be a great disaster for this country if that view were widely accepted.  The truth is that in most European countries the majority of the farmers have holdings just as small as our farmers have.  The fundamental difference between them is that, partly for geographical reasons and partly because their Governments have been more competent, they have much better marketing facilities than our farmers have.</P>
      <P>Farmers on the Continent are naturally associated with a wide variety of markets by good rail transport while we have to depend very largely on shipping.  Their small farmers are also sustained by effective marketing organisations, co-operative and otherwise, who have observers in their markets constantly watching those markets and developing the demand for the goods they are best able to produce and sending back information all the time to a comprehensive advisory service as to what would be most readily sold if the farmers produced it.  They are also backed up by comprehensive systems of progeny testing which improve the quality of their livestock.  If we had these things in this country, the future of our small farmers would be very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a problem here which many continental countries have not got and that is the great draw on our people to the available industrial employment in Great Britain because there is no language barrier.  A Dane cannot so readily emigrate to Germany and get industrial employment there, first, because he is a foreigner in a foreign land and would require a work permit which he probably would not be given and, secondly, because, even if he did get the permit, he speaks Danish while the people amongst whom he would be living speak German. That obstruction does not exist <Col N="1350" /> between us and the British or American labour market and so it becomes all the more urgent for us to prevent the emigration from the land which threatens our survival if it is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>There are two points which I want to put to the Minister.  The first is: what is being done with the Rockingham Estate?  That estate was purchased by the Land Commission and is one of the best in Ireland.  Every acre which was not under forestry was almost extravagantly maintained at the highest pitch of fertility and excellence. Almost all the grassland was reseeded within the last ten years, regardless of expense.  I am told that at present it is being set for grazing cattle and that all the neighbouring farmers put so many cattle in on it at so much per head.  That may be a proper arrangement for a very short time but it would be nothing short of a crime if the arable land at Rockingham were allowed to be treated in this way until it became almost useless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely a temporary measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is not a long term project and that farmers will be installed on it who will guard its fertility and capacity for production.  I am describing the situation at Rockingham in very restricted language.  It might be very poetically described if I chose to repeat some of the language which I heard locally about the situation there.</P>
      <P>The last point I want to make relates to Land Commission houses.  The Land Commission build a lot of houses and I was delighted to hear Deputy Flanagan congratulate them on their new agricultural design.  That reform was badly needed because the Land Commission houses were never outstanding for their beauty, whatever about their utilitarian value.  However, we now have a series of schemes to provide running water for rural dwellers.  Some of these schemes are administered by the Department of Local Government and others by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it unreasonable to suggest that, in <Col N="1351" /> this day and age, when the Land Commission are building a house for a tenant purchaser who will ultimately pay for it, instead of sinking a well and leaving it at that, they should instal a pressure pump and at least one tap in the kitchen, leaving it to the tenant to extend the water supply through the house, if he wishes to do so?  In the old days, if you wanted to instal a water supply, you had to erect a tank on the roof and a pump to raise the water.  That involved a good deal of difficulty and then there was the question of power.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister for Transport and Power tells us that rural electrification is very near completion, that it will be completed within the next two years, so that electric power is available in almost every part of Ireland.  It is now possible to get a pump which does not require any tank and which will work automatically when the tenant turns on the tap.  I do not think it is unreasonable to suggest that when the State is building a house for a tenant purchaser, that house should have running water.</P>
    <P>I am deliberately pausing now because I do not think, either, that it is unthinkable that if we are building a house and putting in running water we should provide a septic tank and instal the usual modern conveniences of most residences.  I say that deliberately for this reason, that if you live in rural Ireland and want to get a septic tank installed it is quite a problem to find an engineer, (1) competent to do the work and (2) willing to exercise the requisite supervision to ensure that it will be properly installed.  Presumably when the Land Commission are building houses they have on their staff competent engineers and architects who could supervise that kind of work and see that it is properly done. If it were done, I do not believe that it would be a very expensive addition to a house.</P>
    <P>There is all the difference in this wide world between a house in rural Ireland that has running water, a bathroom, lavatory and hot and cold water and a house which has none of these amenities and from which the tenant's <Col N="1352" /> wife must perennially travel with a bucket in each hand to draw water from the well.  Seeing that the Commissioners have now improved their architectural standards, I suggest that they might seriously consider providing these minimal amenities in any houses they may build in future because I believe, in 1960, less is not enough.</P>
    <P>I differ from some Deputies who seemed to think the Land Commission should be swept away.  I think the Land Commission has useful work to do.  The Land Commission can look back with pride on much of the work it has done but I do suggest that, if the Land Commission is to do useful work in future, it must wake up to the fact that much closer co-operation between itself and the Department of Agriculture is necessary and that the development of an effective advisory service is an essential part of the ultimate success of the work of the Land Commission. Whether that service is to be provided by the Commissioners themselves, as has been done by the Sugar Company, or by the Department of Agriculture is a matter which the Ministers, between them, must determine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>At Column 1088, Volume 182, No. 8 of the Official Report, the Minister is reported as referring to the outstanding congestion problem.  He quoted the figure of 168,000 holdings in the State above one acre and not exceeding 30 acres. Most of these holdings are situated in the west of Ireland.  In the Limerick constituency which I represent there are a great many small holdings.  It is a difficult problem to rearrange these or to enlarge them because of the fact that there are so many of them within a limited area.  For that reason I find myself in disagreement with the Minister who expressed surprise that there are people who would advocate an extension to the classes of allottees for Land Commission land.  On these small holdings, on which the tenants find great difficulty in eking out a livelihood, there are young men who have no opportunity of being considered for land that becomes available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> I spoke of this problem before and make no apology for raising it again. The previous Minister referred to the possibility of arranging for a longer lease of lands for people who take land to enable them to make a living in dairying or raising of livestock. Normally, land is taken for 11 or 12 months.  Perhaps it has been explained in the meantime what the length of the lease might be, but I have not seen any publication of it.  It would be a help where the pool of land is growing small and the land that does become available is at a distance from the congested areas if small farmers' sons could get such land on long lease. The previous Minister referred also to an investigation which he would make into the situation.  I do not know whether or not that investigation has been concluded.  If it has been, we should like to know what the result has been.</P>
    <P>I wonder if there is rigid enforcement of the regulation in regard to the distance of applicants' residences from land that is being divided?  The regulation refers to one mile.  There is no necessity for rigid adherence to that rule.  With modern transport facilities and farm machinery a farmer could very easily and competently deal with land that might be farther from his residence than one mile.</P>
    <P>There is one other portion of the Minister's statement with which I wish to deal.  It concerns land offered by public auction.  Under the Land Act of 1950 the operation of the Land Commission in respect to the acquisition of land by public auction was confined to the relief of congestion. While the figures given in the Minister's statement show that the amount of land that has passed into the hands of outsiders is not very large, in view of the Minister's statement that there are some 168,000 holdings above one acre and not exceeding 30 acres, it must be considered that the 4,700 acres sold to non-nationals in 2½ years would accommodate 100 families on the basis of about 40 acres per family. If land could be bought by the Land Commission on the open market, the vendors would be at no disadvantage and this land would be available for <Col N="1354" /> the relief of these deserving people to whom the Minister referred in introducing his Estimate.</P>
    <P>I should like also to congratulate the Department on the new houses they are building.  They have an attractive appearance and from what I hear the interior is attractive as well.  That modern advance in regard to the design of houses, a part of the Land Commission's work to which many people might not advert, is to be commended.</P>
    <P>It only remains for me to reiterate that, as far as the constituency which I represent is concerned, we claim we are entitled to be regarded as a congested district because of the large number of small holdings of which the Land Commission is well aware, in that part of Limerick to which I referred.  We would welcome anything that can be done for the people in that area who are trying to maintain themselves and their families on these small holdings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister saw fit in the course of his introductory speech to refer at some length to the problem of land congestion. In recent times a number of well-intentioned people seem to be finding fault with the policy of the Land Commission in regard to this problem.  One can expect that from well-meaning people in a democratic country.  They have the right to criticise the administration of Departments of State but criticism, desirable though it may be, is of little value if the solutions offered are impracticable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is advocated that the Land Commission should provide financial facilities to enable landless people to acquire land, particularly the second and third sons of farmers who cannot be settled on their own farms.  Various individuals and bodies connected with the land problem have in fact advocated that the Land Commission should go around the country purchasing land, either by public auction or private treaty, and thus create a pool of land for division amongst such people.  That is easier said than done. First of all, I do not think the Land Commission as a Government Department <Col N="1355" /> is entitled, or should be expected, to do that.  If such a course were adopted, I am sure some of those people who advocate this type of action would be the first to say that the Land Commission were buying land at enhanced prices with money put at their disposal by the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason why the Land Commission should be expected to be the bank for the provision of finance for the purchase of land.  The provision laid down by statute for the accommodation of a person in acquiring his land on an annuity basis is an entirely different business from paying a substantial sum to a person to acquire property.  The commercial banks would be the proper body to deal with the advance of money for such purchases.  There is also the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It would not be proper for me on this Estimate to deal with the activities of that corporation but, in affording such facilities, I imagine it would be serving the purpose for which it was set up, namely, to provide agricultural credit whether for the purpose of land acquisition or for the purchase of stock or machinery.</P>
    <P>Those two sources are available to creditworthy people who want to buy land on the market.  I am sure the commercial banks would give them reasonable facilities.  Although there are some people who would not commend themselves to any agency in respect of the purchase and operation of a parcel of land, there are others in whom confidence could be placed.</P>
    <P>However, before one considers the provision of land for people who have not land already, one must deal with the problem of making existing holdings economic.  The Minister has told us that there are a large number of holdings, particularly in the western counties, which are still uneconomic. From experience in our own constituencies, we know that a large percentage of holdings in the poorer areas are uneconomic.  It is good economic policy for the Government, through the Land Commission, to make these <Col N="1356" /> holdings economic.  They are not serving a useful purpose as they are.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained the difficulties with which the Land Commission has to contend in the acquisition of land and many Deputies are aware of it.  When large farms come under the notice of the Land Commission as suitable for acquisition, though this does not happen so often in southern or western areas, the owners resort to every legitimate means within their power to prevent the Land Commission acquiring them.  As I say, we do not have that problem very much in the south, for the simple reason that there are not many properties there suitable for direct acquisition.  Any activity which takes place there is more or less through the exchange of holdings, whereby an existing landholder offers his uneconomic holding to the Land Commission in exchange for an economic holding in another part of the country.</P>
    <P>I would say that the Land Commission's policy in that regard is one that has stood the test of time, but some people take the view that the size of holdings which the Land Commission offers to these people is not sufficiently large to guarantee an economic living.  I do not think that is so.  There is a tendency nowadays among the families of farmers not to remain on the land and often it is very difficult to get even one member of a family to stay on the family homestead and farm it.  However, I understand that the usual size of holdings parcelled out by the Land Commission in recent years has been approximately 40 to 50 acres, and I believe that if a holding of that size is properly worked it can provide a very good economic living.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which the Land Commission has been rather conservative is the acquisition of land adjacent to small towns and villages for the provision of accommodation holdings for the residents in such villages.  Most of the residents in Irish villages are people with small shops or who have casual employment, be they self-employed, or with local farmers or contractors, and if <Col N="1357" /> each household had a piece of land it could make a very big difference to their standard of living.  The centralisation of trade has generally undermined the trade of these small shops and the people who own them would be in a very bad way were it not for the fact that they usually own a few acres of land adjacent to the town in which they live.  They keep a cow or two to provide milk for themselves, to sell in their shops or to supply to creameries, and this provides a very useful supplement to their normal source of income and has enabled many of them to keep their heads above water in recent times.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I do not think the Land Commission is favourably inclined towards providing accommodation holdings on the lines I have suggested, but I know a number of villages and towns in my own constituency where there is a reasonable possibility of acquiring land by negotiation through an exchange arrangement, and where the demand for local allotments and accommodation holdings is very strong.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might have a word with the Land Commission on that subject now, because it is a problem that will have to be tackled sooner or later, and there is no point in shelving it until such time as the question of general congestion is settled.  This is a form of congestion in itself and, indeed, an acute one from the point of view of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the establishment of certain personnel connected with his Department and mentioned people who were formerly supervising gangers.  I entirely approve of that arrangement and I am glad the Department of Lands had the initiative&mdash;I should say courage&mdash;to cater properly for that type of employee.  Up to now I do not think anybody bothered about their interests and I think it is a step in the right direction to have them established on a Civil Service status with security and pension rights, which is essential to get loyal service from workers.</P>
    <P>I also notice that the Minister has <Col N="1358" /> introduced an incentive bonus for ordinary workers employed in the operations of the Land Commission, somewhat similar to that provided for forestry workers.  That is a very wise step because the supervision of workers on estates is rather difficult and an incentive bonus will help to get a better standard of efficiency and a higher degree of productivity from them.  I believe that any moneys the Minister provides for incentive bonuses will give a good return in future.</P>
    <P>I should have dealt previously with the delay which takes place in the resetting and reassigning of lands taken over by the Land Commission by way of exchange or direct acquisition.  To say the least of it, a considerable time elapses before the Land Commission puts such land into the permanent use for which it was intended, and various excuses for that are given in reply to Dáil question and queries addressed direct to the Land Commission. Though I can well imagine that with so many interests involved, and so many consultations necessary before a final rearrangement can be carried out, a certain amount of delay is inevitable, yet I think a lot of the delay is inexcusable, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>I know of one property acquired three years ago and the resettlement of the 100 acres involved is being held up because it is understood that another adjacent property may come on the market.  I do not think that is a good excuse.  There is no certainty that the other property will come on the market and there is no certainty that the Land Commission will proceed to acquire it.  I think a reasonable time has elapsed for this land to be divided for the purposes for which it was acquired, though I must admit that it is at present let by the Land Commission on very reasonable terms. However, that is beside the point.  It is a source of agitation and Deputies and other people in public life are being pestered by would-be applicants to press their claims.  I think the sooner it is finally disposed of the better.  If the Land Commission would make some more expeditious arrangement it would be to the advantage of all concerned.  It would certainly be <Col N="1359" /> good from the point of the Land Commission itself because it would inspire more confidence in the general standard of efficiency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the style of Land Commission houses and out-offices. Certainly the design is a credit to the Land Commission.  One cannot help noticing these homesteads in rural areas.  They hold attention as compared with the farm houses erected by private enterprise.  I think the addition of the amenities suggested by Deputy Dillon would be an excellent idea.  He referred to pressure pumps in connection with the laying on of a water supply.  The pressure pump would be a rather doubtful economy in this country where there is an abundant supply of water which can be tapped through gravitational forces. Experiments should be carried out to discover if a gravitation supply is possible.  Even though it might be more expensive initially it would prove, I think, a better job; it takes care of itself, does not entail the incurring of expense by way of electricity, or equipment, and gives more satisfactory results in the long run.</P>
    <P>Water should be installed in these Land Commission houses.  These houses are inevitably a model in particular districts and the installation of water and other amenities would act as an incentive to neighbours to follow suit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, I think, in keeping with the general policy of Fianna Fáil for the Land Commission to keep lands for such long periods prior to dividing them.  The Shanbally Estate has been in the hands of the Land Commission for a number of years.  Unproductive estates should be taken over and divided.  The Minister should make inquiries into the running of these estates.  I have in mind the Murray Moore Estate of some 800 acres on which only four or five men are employed.  I know that the tendency is for fewer labourers to be employed because of the introduction of machinery.  Nobody can prevent that reduction.  Even Deputy Dillon, when he occupied a box office seat, did not <Col N="1360" /> try to prevent it.  Its prevention would not pay dividends.</P>
      <P>There are many tenants in my constituency who were promised water as long ago as twenty-five years back.  They have not got it yet.  The Grace Estate was divided well over twenty years ago and water has not yet been installed for some of the tenants.  The Minister should look into the position immediately.</P>
      <P>With regard to land division as a whole, we are coming near the end now.  Most of the big estates have been taken over by Fianna Fáil Governments from time to time and divided amongst uneconomic holders and landless men.  I am sorry that cottiers are excluded.  It is quite true that cottiers in former times were failures when given holdings, but the failures of the past should not debar cottiers today from getting a bit of land on which to keep a cow and do a little bit of tillage.</P>
      <P>There were failures in the past. Many of them sold the land they were given.  The Land Commission should not allow anybody to sell the land he gets from the Land Commission.  If a man cannot work the holding satisfactorily, or make a livelihood out of it, he should give the land back to the Land Commission.  He should not be permitted to sell it just for the sake of getting some money.  I am not, of course, against a man selling in order to better himself.  By and large, a hold should be kept on tenants and they should not be allowed to sell except for the purpose of getting a larger farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to bring to the attention of the Minister the fact that cottiers have been given allotments in other constituencies.  I understood that it was a hard and fast rule of the Land Commission that applications for land from landless men would not be entertained.  Reading some of the Leinster papers I discovered that landless men were getting allotments in Carlow and in some parts of Laois-Offaly. There should not be one rule for one county and another for another.  It is true to say that circumstances differ to an appreciable <Col N="1361" /> extent, but yet I do not think that hard and fast rule should be adhered to.</P>
    <P>I have urged in the past that where suitable landless men are anxious to get land they should be given it on a rental basis.  Land should be taken over and given to suitable young men who have proved their knowledge of farming was such that they would naturally make a success of any land they could get.  If after a period of, say, 15 years&mdash;the usual period before investment&mdash;they made a success of it, they should be given title to the land, either at a continuation of rent or at some charge considered sufficient to recoup the Exchequer.  If, on the other hand, they did not prove successful, there is nothing to prevent the Land Commission from putting them out.  That should be made clear to them when they accept the farm, and in those circumstances I think the Land Commission could put them out without any qualms of conscience.</P>
    <P>In recent years, because of the increased prices for milk, wheat, barley and so on, the price of land has increased very much, and, therefore, the purchase of land has gone beyond the reach of the ordinary young man or farmer's son.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there will be more weary and sleepless nights for the Deputy.  I would advise him not to take it so badly.  If three or four young men are in a farm, the most you can possibly do is make a division of 40 to 50 acres to each, and less in certain circumstances, so that it is almost out of the question for farmers to provide land for their sons.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider seriously the question of making it possible for them to be granted allotments through some form of tenancy.  The suggestion might be developed by people with greater knowledge.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the magnificent way he has handled the work of the Land Commission and I thank him for the many divisions which have been carried out in my constituency. I am sure I am not asking too much when I ask him to ensure that these outstanding divisions will not be allowed to continue and that immediate division will take place.</P>

      <P>The Minister has endured a long debate and I do not propose to keep him very much longer.  Running like a thread through the whole debate has been the problem of excessive rural depopulation.  It was mentioned by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Blowick and, indeed, by nearly everybody who spoke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blowick suggested that the people of the west hold grimly on to their land.  How is that consistent with the statement of Deputy Dillon that he knows a place in East Mayo where seven families have locked up their homes and gone away from the west I happen to know that is true, and I know that many of the houses which were left had previously been built or reconstructed with moneys provided by the Government and the ratepayers.  But Deputy Dillon goes on to suggest that this was <Col N="1363" /> brought about through the sheer incompetence or inadvertence of the Government and that the Government and the Land Commission are complacent about it.  He goes on to suggest that we, the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, are either closing our eyes to the fact or, knowing it, refuse to talk about it.  I, for one, do not close my eyes to the fact and I am not afraid to talk about it.  It disquiets me just as much as it does Deputy Dillon.  But may I say that the Government and the Land Commission cannot be accused of being complacent about it?</P>
      <P>There is a place in my own constituency&mdash;Deputy Blowick and myself played a considerable part in helping the Land Commission there&mdash;where the Land Commission spent something like £70,000 in resettling people who had been for centuries on miserable, rundale holdings, divided up into many little patches and living in low-lying small, poor houses, although admittedly well-kept.  The Land Commission gave each of those tenants a new holding, which was either in one single unit or in two compact units; they gave them £900 of a free grant and £200 by way of loan.</P>
      <P>They moved the people from these old houses and put them up on the side of the higher land in healthy surroundings. No sooner had the Land Commission changed them from being tenants into being owners, by getting them to sign on the dotted line, when two or three of them locked their doors and went away.  It was not complacency on the part of the Government and the Land Commission that made them spend £70,000 of our money on these people.  But I should like to ask what is the answer to that problem? What are you going to say or do to prevent that man, now that he is, for the first time, in a position in which he can carry out farming operations as distinct from grovelling operations, from locking his door and going away?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested by Deputy Davern&mdash; and I cannot possibly agree with him &mdash;that land should be given on a rental basis or on trial.  One of the things on <Col N="1364" /> which we have prided ourselves is security of tenure.  By giving land to a person on a conditional basis you immediately destroy security of tenure. By saying to him: &ldquo;I give you this farm of land and this building and this grant on condition that you stay here for the next 20 years whether you like that or not and that your family will continue to occupy it,&rdquo; you are doing something which is contrary to the democratic structure of this State and the Constitution under which we live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to the time of vesting, yes, but the whole basis of the land code is that the land should be vested as quickly as possible in the person in order to give him pride of ownership.  Indeed, many complaints have been made about the Land Commission because for such a long period, they refuse or fail to vest the land or the buildings in the people for whom they are intended.  Deputy Moloney complained a short time ago about delays in setting land and I am inclined to agree with him up to a point.  If there is not an immediate, reasonable prospect of additional lands being acquired in an area, the Land Commission should go ahead and divide the lands they actually have on hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency, there are examples of land being held for as many as 20 years without being divided because substantial additional land was expected to be acquired in due course.  The Land Commission did not expect that &ldquo;in due course&rdquo; was to be 20 years, but that is what happened.  I do not think that is likely to happen again because the Land Commission are aware that lands do not improve when let in conacre and that people will put their hearts into the work only under private ownership. But then, as I say, the land having been vested in them, all the necessary money having been spent <Col N="1365" /> and having been put into good houses &mdash;perhaps for the first time in the history of the family&mdash;they lock the door.  If anybody can give me an answer to that question, or if anybody can give an answer to the Land Commission or the Government, as to why they do that, the whole country will be very thankful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is simple: the farmer at present is not being paid for his produce or his labours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not concede for a moment that what Deputy Blowick says is true.  I believe the answer is a social answer.  I believe, firstly, that younger men are more attracted nowadays to the ready money in factories in England and America. Secondly, and more important, I believe, that young women are not prepared in any circumstances to live on the land and that if young men want to get married&mdash;which is a sensible thing for any young man to want &mdash;they must go to America or England to get somebody because there are no girls at home to marry. I remember two or three years ago when an assistant of mine came into the office crying because her friend had gone to England and there was nobody of her own age, which was about 18 or 19, left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a pretty grim picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the area from which Deputy Dillon said seven families had emigrated within a distance of half a mile.  I have seen the houses just as much as Deputy Dillon and I think he will bear me out that beyond seeing children of school-going age, up to 16, from the ages 17 to 30, you will not find more than two or three girls in the whole parish who are unmarried. I do not know the answer to that social problem.  It is unfair and wrong to suggest that it is the fault of the Land Commission and that the Land Commission, by waving a magic wand, can solve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which I want to raise is in regard to houses.  I believe <Col N="1366" /> that the Land Commission should make a particular effort to turn over every house they acquire with a minimum of delay.  They must know well that a house which is locked up becomes, within a matter of less than 12 months, dilapidated and broken down and a house without fires and without ventilation will deteriorate with extraordinary speed.  I am afraid I have to say there are several cases throughout the country where the houses have been retained by the Land Commission without being given to anybody for far too long a period. That should not be allowed to happen in the future.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it was brought to my notice about a week ago, perhaps wrongly, that there is a regulation which prohibits the Land Commission from allotting a house for a period of 12 months.  It was the first time I heard that and I do not know if it is true. If it is true, it should be changed immediately. I do not believe it is but, in practice, houses seem to be kept for a minimum of one year.  That is too long and I suggest that the Land Commission should decide straight away which applicant is entitled to the house and put him in occupation.  Of course, in recent times, the cost of acquiring lands, the cost of proving title and such other matters, have greatly increased, with the result that annuities which people are being asked to pay are out of all proportion to what they used to be.  Time marches on and the Land Commission should make every effort not to discourage people from taking land because of annuities which perhaps are beyond their capacity to bear.</P>
    <P>A final matter which I should like to mention to the Minister is one which I raised seriously with his predecessor, that is, the present system in the Land Commission of proving title.  Since the Minister himself is a lawyer, he should take steps to simplify that procedure, where possible.  The delays in the Land Commission are quite considerable at the moment and it becomes particularly disquieting to people who are being paid in bonds if in the meantime the bonds depreciate in value.  As the Minister knows that <Col N="1367" /> has happened on several occasions. In effect, it means that if the person were paid through sale by public auction or private treaty he would in the ordinary course receive full value but through delays and the depreciation in the value of the bonds, he is losing one quarter of the money due to him.  This is a serious matter and one which the Minister, as a lawyer, should appreciate he is bound to do everything he possibly can to alleviate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>A few specific matters were raised by Deputy Dillon which I think I should clear up first.  The Deputy posed me the question as to whether land could be leased.  The position is that there is nothing in the world to stop anybody leasing land for a period of 20 years, if he just gets the Land Commission's consent, which is readily given.  A public announcement was made by my predecessor in November, 1958, dealing with this matter, but even since that announcement on this question of leasing land, the number of applications that have come to the Land Commission have really been insignificant.  There were only 20 to 30 cases.</P>
      <P>Since the 1936 Land Act, the equity of a tenant to come in under the Land Acts is gone and, therefore, from the landlord's point of view, if any letting is made now, there is no question of a tenant acquiring any legal rights under the Land Acts, so that for those who want to know, land can be leased for a period of years.  It is a question of a bargain being made between the parties themselves.  If application is sent to the Land Commission and consent is applied for, as I have said, it is readily available, unless the transaction would cover up some socially undesirable movement, as for example, someone grabbing a lot of land in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves that, may I take it on his authority that no tenant right under any Act is created and that the leasehold tenant does not acquire a right to hold the land against the landlord, if the first lease has run out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1368" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is taking me correctly.  I am saying that has been the position since 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is sure there is no Act, other than the Land Act, which would give a leasehold tenant an automatic right to renew the lease if he had complied with all the terms and conditions of the original?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no law I know of at the present time.  Of course, there is the possibility I was thinking of, under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, that if he carried on some kind of business, he might acquire certain business equities.  At present, the tenant accepts the terms of the lease but acquires no such rights under the Land Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but I assure him there is a good deal of misunderstanding about this matter in the country. I suppose it derives from the age-old belief that a leasehold created a tenant right.  If the Minister desires to promote this business, it would be well if the Land Commission examined the matter and, on a suitable occasion, he could make a positive statement declaring that no tenant right, or no permanent right, was created in the lessees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be done.  I quite understand the misunderstandings that may be abroad about this matter because, under the 1923 Act, if the tenant, as far as my recollection goes, was there on a certain date&mdash;15th April, 1921, I think&mdash;he came in.  We had, at a later stage, further tenants being brought in, but since the 1936 Act, that position has been changed and any lettings now made do not qualify under the Land Acts or the land code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy S. Flanagan also raised the question of expediting the Land Commission procedure with regard to purchase.  In reply to a question put down by Deputy Dillon, last week, I think, I gave the actual figures for the delay which, indeed, is very long.  It is 27 <Col N="1369" /> months, as far as I recollect, from the date of getting possession, to the date of the issue of the money.  I want to make it clear that so far as the Land Commission delay is concerned, of that period of 27 months, only two months are taken up with them.  I fear that my colleague, Deputy S. Flanagan, and my profession generally, are very much to blame for delays of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is open confession, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the scale of fees, which is now being adjusted, was very small and the tendency, I suppose, in busy solicitors' offices was to leave on the long finger something they regarded as not being worth very much from a business point of view.  At all events, I realise that the procedure is rather archaic and gives rise to a certain amount of delay. It was for that reason that I recently had discussions with the Incorporated Law Society with a view to devising some means of short-circuiting the existing procedure.  That matter is under examination and I hope, in the very near future, to be able to provide procedure that will, largely, shorten the time-lag.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of delay in the forestry section, I did abolish the requisition for the discharge of equities in cases up to £500.  That is having a very salutary effect on shortening the time-lag and getting over the delays.  I hope, in conjunction with the Incorporated Law Society, to be able to provide some procedure on the Land Commission side which will substantially cut down the delay that now exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some comments were made by Deputies about land bonds and their value.  My information is that over the past three years, they did not vary very much.  They are standing at approximately 99 and there has not been the great drop there used to be in these bonds.  The market seems to be buoyant enough and they should yield 5½ per cent.  In my view, they are an excellent investment.  I hope, however, that by expediting the procedure, the complaints voiced here by <Col N="1370" /> Deputy Flanagan, about the danger of a drop in the bonds between the time the lands are taken and the time the money is paid, will be largely relieved.</P>
    <P>On the question of farmers' sons leasing land, let me say that the job of the Land Commission, as I conceive it, is to relieve congestion.  As I pointed out in my opening statement, there are about 60,000 congests still left in the land slums of the country. Every class whom it is sought to bring in under the wing of the Land Commission will reduce the work the Land Commission are there to do, that is, to deal with these 60,000 uneconomic holders.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to state, as has been stated by Deputy Moloney, I think, that cottiers cannot get land.  Cottiers, in fact, do from time to time get land. It all depends on the local situation. It all depends on whether there is enough land in the area to go around, having dealt first, of course, with the uneconomic holders in the immediate vicinity.  Accommodation plots comprising 1,342 acres have been given over the past eight years, from 1951 to 1958 to 280 people.  That gives an average of 3½ acres to each person and the vast majority of these would have been cottiers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Would they have been landless men?  Or could they be described as such?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them might be described as landless men but a good many of them were cottiers.  Again, getting back to the principle I have enunciated, the suggestion that you can give cottiers 10 acres or that we can provide for farmers' sons out of a national land pool which does not exist is completely unrealistic.  Whatever purpose the people who advocate that have they are, to my mind, holding out hope to a class of people for whom there is no hope, as far as the vast bulk of land division is concerned. That issue was raised here by Deputy O. J. Flanagan and others and I think I could do no better than quote the statement by Deputy Dillon in the House some years ago.  He well realises  <Col N="1371" /> that there is not enough land to go around and that there is not nearly enough to give everybody in the country anything like 50 acres or even a good deal less.</P>
      <P>Speaking here on the Estimate for Lands on 24th April, 1959 as reported in Vol. 161, columns 179-182, Deputy Dillon said:</P>
      <P>I thought I might offer those few words in order to restrain the other warriors I see licking their chops ready to intervene.  Deputy Cunningham exasperated me when he said he wanted to give everybody in this country 50 acres of land.  The island is not big enough.  There are not fifty acres for everybody, if you took all the farmers in Ireland and settled them.  There is not nearly enough of land on the island to give every farmer 50 acres.</P>
      <P>And he proceeded on the same page to say:</P>
      <P>One of the elementary facts is that there are not 50 acres of land to give each farmer.  What are you going to do?  Are you going to build the land into the Atlantic Ocean?  It is all very well to say: &ldquo;Now, Deputy Childers, you are Minister.  Will you give everybody 50 acres, because that is what Fianna Fáil wants?&rdquo;  No one adverts to the fact that there are not 50 acres for everybody.</P>
      <P>And, in his own inimitable language, further down on the same page, he says, in reply to Deputy Cunningham who intervened to say that there were not 20 acres, or five acres, for everybody:</P>
      <P>Then what the hell is the use asking the Minister to give them 50 acres each?  If Deputy Cunningham were talking through his hat I would not have minded, but I thought he was talking seriously. That is what exasperated me.  It shows you the kind of puerile nonsense that is going on.</P>

I am quite sure there are not and the larger you make the unit, the less the number of people you can deal with and the less congestion you can deal with.  Therefore, in my view, the suggestion of bringing in landless men and giving them farms and providing land for cottiers&mdash;up to 10 acres as has been suggested&mdash;is unreal.  Every new class you include, merely cuts across the policy laid down by the State since its inception for the relief of congestion.</P>
      <P>I should like somebody to tell me where this land is to be found to give to these people.  I do not want to go into the argument of the justification for giving a farmer's son a present from the State of £3,500.  It could equally well be contended that the taxpayer would be as much entitled to give a £3,500 present to the shoemaker's son, the small shopkeeper's son, or to any other section of the community.  Let us be realistic about the matter.  It is time we made up our minds that as regards the amount of land likely to be available through Land Commission operations, the first charge on that land are the people in the land slums and, having them to deal with, it is unrealistic to talk about giving large farms or providing for other classes.</P>

If one followed up the histories of the seven individuals concerned, like those who went down on the bridge of San Luis Rey, I wonder whether we could draw any conclusions and find some cause and effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon waxed very eloquent on this subject and in connection generally with people leaving the land when he went on record on 26th May, 1955.  On the 26th May, 1955, I think he was still Minister for Agriculture. As reported at Column 225 of the Official Report, Volume 151, he said:</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy for Deputy Madden's concern about migration from the land which is going on, but I would ask Deputies of this House to be realistic in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>It is not alone an Irish problem. It is a problem which is perplexing every country in the world.</P>
      <P>Later on, he quotes the position in the United States of America:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do Deputies in this House realise that 50 years ago 60 per cent. of the population of the United States of <Col N="1374" /> America lived on the land and that the remaining 40 per cent. were in the cities?  Note the percentages to-day: there are 20 per cent. on the land and 80 per cent. in the cities. There is no use blinding our eyes to the fact that transport is so fast between this country and Great Britain and family relationships are so numerous on both sides of the Channel that the big centres of industrial development in Great Britain are operating on our rural areas just as Chicago is operating on Dakota, just as St. Louis is operating on the State of Kansas, and it is illusory for us to imagine that boys and girls who are going to industrial employment in Great Britain at the present time are going primarily as a result of economic hardship.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon went on to deal with the problem of people leaving the land.  At Column 227 he is reported as saying:</P>
      <P>It is not an Irish problem; it is a world problem.  Whether it will adjust itself or not, I am not sure because it is bringing in its train the introduction of a very great degree of mechanisation that might not have come but for this problem of getting labour to work upon the land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy continued:</P>
      <P>What is the answer to this problem? I do not know the answer to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> The Deputy did not know the answer to the flight from the land in 1955. Evidently, he has not found a solution since, from anything he contributed in the debate.  However, he would try to get the House to believe that this matter started during the past three years and that, before that, in the good days of inter-Party Government, there was no such thing as flight from the land when he was Minister for Agriculture in that year.  His explanation&mdash; and it is correct&mdash;was that there has been a movement from the land all over the world and certainly all over Europe and that our figures on this issue, taking them all in all, are approximately at par with those of countries such as Sweden and Denmark.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talked about certain farms and said the doors were locked. The Land Commission evidently spent a lot of money on them, but there is this to be said: Whoever comes after them will have a workable unit of land and will not have the dreadful problem of the intermixed plots that was the position in these areas before now.</P>
    <P>I have often thought that the Land Commission, in dealing with estates, might be just as well advised to go according to the proposition of creating the unit irrespective of who happened to be there.  Time and again, I have noticed that people who were there one day moved off in a few years and somebody else would then be there.  The real objective should be to make the unit as compact and viable as we all desire.</P>
    <P>As far as the other parts of the congested areas are concerned, what has been said about some people who go away is very true: it is not solely an economic problem.  People in this country are not prepared to accept to-day the standard of living not alone of their grandfathers but of their fathers.  Being a free society, they are at liberty to go and better themselves if they can.  Indeed, I for one certainly would not blame them for leaving some of the congested areas; some people go and do not come back. A number of them, having gone and <Col N="1376" /> got some capital together, come back. I do not know, but it may well be the position, in relation to some of the houses that have been referred to, that they go across for a year or two in order to get some capital.</P>
    <P>That has been a movement in the west of Ireland as long as I know the west and for generations past.  With regard to this talk of closing up houses, I should like some Deputies to have the experience I have, as Minister for Lands, with people looking for land.  There is still strongly ingrained in our people a desire for land and for more land.  That is all to the good. To suggest that people are running away from the land is completely untrue and completely unrealistic. Where any land is being divided or even where there is a possibility of getting land into the Land Commission machine for division, the local people go to all extremes to get land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At half price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>They urge the Land Commission, day in and day out, to get more land for the relief of congestion in these areas.  Far from the picture being that the people want to run away from the land, the opposite is the truth.  It is quite true that on a small farm there is room for only one son and possibly one daughter.  If there is a larger family the remainder must go somewhere.  To suggest that our people are running away from the land is not in accordance with the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested that one of the biggest problems on the small farm is that the farmer's income had been drastically reduced over the past three years.  I want completely to refute that allegation.  As regards the movement in prices, the agricultural price index number has risen, though slowly, from 100 in 1953 to 102.5 in 1958.  Over the same period, the price index number for certain farm materials purchased by farmers&mdash;foodstuffs, fertilisers and seeds&mdash;has fallen from 100 to approximately 97.2.  The indications are that there will be a further fall in 1959-60 due to the effect of the Government subsidy on fertilisers. Therefore, the index number <Col N="1377" /> for prices received and the index number for prices paid by farmers for their principal requisites have been moving favourably.</P>
    <P>Again, in the congested districts, the farmers in the north and east derive the major portion of their income from the sale of cattle and sheep. Thirty-four per cent. of the cattle of this country are located in the congested districts and approximately 50 per cent. of the sheep of the country are located in these districts.  Cattle account for over 30 per cent. of the farm income in these areas and sheep another 5 per cent.  The prices of cattle have been generally good in recent years.</P>

As far as that is concerned, the prospects for the future, particularly in regard to cattle, are good, especially following the recent trade agreement with Great Britain under which the cattle differential was abolished in the case of attested cattle. The Government are trying to go as far as they can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me revert to the argument of Deputy Oliver Flanagan who wants everybody to get land and who wants the size of the farm increased to 45 acres.  He must not have read what his colleague, Deputy <Col N="1378" /> Dillon, had to say on this subject a few years ago.  At all events, I should like to quote from an independent source for the delectation of Deputy Dillon.  It is an article by Mr. J.F. Keane, B. Agr. Sc., about a 22½ acre holding at Foxfort, Bansha, Co. Tipperary, owned by a Mr. William Morrissey.  The article appeared in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of the 9th May, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the area where we started the parish plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In this article the author points out that on this 22½ acre farm the output was £1,445 from the 22½ acres.  The article goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>What is the minimum size farm that could be classed as an economic holding?  There are wide and varied views, indeed, on this question.</P>
      <P>The other evening in South Tipperary at a farm demonstration we saw how a 22½ acre dairy farmer, William Morrissey, of Foxfort, is winning a very good living from his small acreage.  As a matter of fact, he has a gross output of £1,445&mdash; or over £62 an acre&mdash;and that is on a very ordinary balanced farm system at that.  I say the system is ordinary, but the management is excellent.</P>
      <P>That is from an independent source. There is no sign in that of the vast decline in the small farmer's income about which Deputy Dillon was so eloquent when speaking here the other day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>What does that prove&mdash; that 22½ acres are enough for anyone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It proves that it is not so much a question of the acres as how they are worked.  It proves that on 22½ acres, through good management, <Col N="1379" /> this man can get a gross output of £62 per acre.  While I am on this, let me reiterate what Deputy Dillon said&mdash;that the vast majority of our competitors in Denmark and in the Netherlands are on farms under 25 acres.  I dealt more extensively with that matter in an article in the N.F.A. Year Book and I do not want to go over the same ground now.  In the last year the Deputies on the opposite side were in office the total number of males in farmwork throughout the country dropped by almost 11,000 men.  The latest corresponding figure for 1958-59 was just over 6,000, so that is a change in the picture which Deputy Dillon would ask us to believe.</P>
      <P>Certainly, under this Government the drift from the land has been halved compared with what it was when Deputy Dillon and Deputy Blowick left office.  The work of the Land Commission is contributing substantially to this improvement.  I want to give the House some percentages because of the allegation by Deputy Blowick that according to my tame opening speech, as he calls it, much more was done by the inter-Party Government, as far as land acquisition and division was concerned, than was done since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the figures and they will speak for themselves. In comparison with the last year of the inter-Party Government the total acreage resettled by the Land Commission last year is up by 28 per cent. The number of migrations is up by 26 per cent.  The number of allottees is up by 55 per cent. and improvement works expenditure is up by 19 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Blowick to be very careful about these allegations or I shall come back to the time when the cold wind of economic stress created by his Government came to play on Deputy Sweetman and when Deputy Sweetman <Col N="1380" /> ordered Deputy Blowick to stop any further purchases under the 1950 Land Act and ordered Deputy Blowick to cut down the expenditure on the improvements grants.  That is on the record.</P>

      <P>These substantial increases disprove Deputy Blowick's claim that his Government did as much for the relief of congestion as is now being done.  I want to announce to the House now that this very year the Government are making available to me, as Minister for Lands, an extra £250,000 for the further acquisition of land for the relief of congestion.  The limit that there was of £500,000 of land bonds is now increased by the Government to £750,000 to deal with the job.  Deputy Blowick can put that in his pipe and smoke it when he talks about what is being done to deal with the problem of congestion.</P>

That was the highest amount of money ever made available in any one year by any one Government for the acquisition of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would advise Deputy Blowick to accept this, that when this Government talk of millions or quarter millions they will provide it and it is no bluff.  We put up the money to do the job and we do not try to bluff the people like the Deputy's Government did when nobody could get a grant for houses, when a manager could not write a cheque for more than £12, when the Deputy was &ldquo;bust&rdquo;, his Government was &ldquo;bust&rdquo;, his Minister for Finance was &ldquo;bust&rdquo; and the country was very nearly &ldquo;bust&rdquo;.  The people decided that issue and decided to get out of the financial morass created by the Deputy and his colleagues when they were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the points made by Deputy Jones are concerned, it is true that there is a regulation limiting the distance <Col N="1382" /> at which land can be acquired to increase a holding.  The Land Commission found in practice that when they gave additional land two or three miles away from the original holding it was usually unworked and was let.  The regulation of trying to keep additional land within one mile of a man's holding is a reasonable one. Experience down through the years with the other method, by which they could go up to three miles for additional land, proved very unsatisfactory. The more compact a holding is the easier it is to work it.  While there is no statutory authority for this limit of one mile, I think it is a reasonable regulation and should be adhered to.</P>
    <P>I share the concern of the Deputies who express some misgivings about the delay in the division of land.  All I want to say, and I say it for the benefit of people who are not familiar with the job that has to be done, is that it occurs largely in connection with rearrangements and in nine cases out of ten the delay is solely due to the lack of co-operation by the people concerned.  A man possibly has to give up a field in the middle of another man's holding and get another acre somewhere else.  Unless you can get the agreement of the people to do that, it is often a very difficult task.  Unless they get the agreement of the people there is nothing the Land Commission can do.  Sometimes they have to leave it for a number of years and sometimes they try to solve it by trying to get more migrants out of the place.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say that it is not always easy to get some people to migrate.  You get a number who are anxious to go but in nearly all the rearrangement schemes there are one, two or three people who must be got out before the job can be done.  Some of these men are well on in years and would like to be buried with their own people, as they say in the west of Ireland.  They would not like to move to holdings up the country.  In such cases there might be some prospect of limited local migration but you will not get some of the people to migrate out of the congested districts for the asking.</P>
    <P>It is a very complex and difficult problem which inevitably leads to <Col N="1383" /> delay if there is not co-operation between the people concerned.  Might I make an appeal to these people in whose areas these schemes are in progress and are being held up for lack of co-operation?  The Land Commission are most anxious to get on with the job and they cannot do it without co-operation on the part of those concerned. The work is for the benefit of these people themselves and they should realise the advantages of having a compact workable holding instead of the scattered stretches some of them have at present.</P>
    <P>Regarding the points made about the type of Land Commission house now being built, I should like to say that in some of the new houses water is laid on and water has been provided for them.  It should be known to Deputies that, when they speak of elaborate houses and elaborate facilities, it is a very expensive business. The present cost of settling an ordinary migrant runs from £3,500 to £4,000 a man.  I know that it is a very necessary social work, leaving out the economic side of it altogether, but there are limits beyond which we cannot go in providing very elaborate houses and in providing all the amenities that we should like them to get.</P>
    <P>The individual who is shifted into one of these new houses knows that he has got a very substantial grant from the State.  There is a very substantial loss on resale in all these matters and I think that we have come to the time when there is a duty on some of those people to do a little for themselves. We must try to cater for as many as possible and the higher these costings go, the fewer the people that can be provided for, in the relief of the land slums.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any other substantial points to which I need refer. I am grateful to the House for the different suggestions made and these will be examined and considered by me.</P>

    <P>These figures account for an increase of £603,070 in the gross estimate.  The increase in the net estimate is reduced by allowance for a rise of £32,500 in <Col N="1385" /> Appropriations-in-Aid under Subhead H.</P>
    <P>The Subheads upon which Deputies will particularly desire information are, Subhead C.1&mdash;Acquisition of Land, Subhead C.2&mdash;Forest Development and Management, Subhead H&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid and Subhead D&mdash;Grants for Afforestation purposes.  Before dealing in detail with these Subheads I propose to refer briefly to the remaining subheads of the Vote.</P>
    <P>Subhead A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;shows an increase of £48,480 on the original provision for 1959/60.  The rise in requirements is due mainly to increases in the indoor and outdoor staff employed on land acquisition work, minor other additions to the inspectorate and additional forester staff together with the usual allowances for incremental increases and allowance for the recent Civil Service salary adjustments.</P>
    <P>Subhead B&mdash;Travelling Expenses&mdash; is higher by £20,000 than the original provision in 1959/60.  The steady expansion in the total area of forest land and the concurrent increase in the number of field staff employed involves an inevitable rise in the annual rate of expenditure on travelling expenses. Insufficient allowance was in fact made for travelling expenses in the Estimate for 1959/60 and an additional £9,000 had to be provided under that head in the Supplementary Estimate 1959/60. The Estimate now before the House allows for a further rise of £11,000 in 1960/61.</P>
    <P>Subhead E.1&mdash;Forestry Education&mdash; shows an increase of £4,740 over the original Estimate provision for 1959/60.  The increase arises partly on the salaries portion of the subhead but allowance has been made also for an increase in the number of students undergoing a course of training.  In the school year 1960/61 it is expected that there will be the record number of 95 trainees undergoing instruction.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead F&mdash;Agency, Advisory and Special Services&mdash;the provision has been increased by £1,300.  The main charge arising on this subhead at present is the payment of fees to a <Col N="1386" /> firm of industrial consultants.  When the Estimate for 1959/60 was being prepared it was not clear for how long it would be necessary to continue the services of the consultants and an additional provision had to be made in the Supplementary Estimate for that year. Allowance is made also for the employment for some months of a consulting engineer on road construction questions.</P>
    <P>Subhead G&mdash;Incidental Expenses&mdash; shows a decrease of £2,600.  There are minor variations, up and down, within the subhead but none of them is significant.</P>
    <P>Turning now to Subhead C.1&mdash; Acquisition of Land&mdash;it will be noted that the provision made at £185,000 is higher by £15,000 than the provision in the 1959/60 Estimate.  The balance in the Land Acquisition Grant-in-Aid Fund at the 31st March, 1960, which was estimated at £56,000 according to the note appended to the printed Estimate, in fact proved to be somewhat higher at a figure of slightly over £74,000.  With a new grant of £185,000 there will, therefore, be a total of slightly over £259,000 available for the acquisition of land in the current year.</P>
    <P>Last year a total area of 27,052 acres was acquired in 346 property deals.  The approximate plantable content of the lands acquired during the year was 24,000 acres.  Final computations are still outstanding in relation to the extent to which areas classified formerly as unplantable were included in the planting programme for 1959/60 and data in relation to the extent to which former woodland was cleared during the year for replanting is also still incomplete.  I am, therefore, unable to give the House at this stage a definite figure as to the extent of the plantable reserve held by the Forestry Division at the 1st April, 1960.  It is not, however, expected to differ substantially from the reserve position 12 months previously, that is, a total of 57,500 acres of which some 9,000 acres were not immediately available for planting for various reasons, leaving an effective reserve of 48,500 acres.</P>
    <P>Although the total number of property <Col N="1387" /> transactions brought to completion in the year was slightly higher in 1959/60 than in the previous year the total acreage acquired was lower. My predecessor dealt extensively with this question in introducing the Forestry Estimate for 1959/60 in the House and mentioned various measures which were being taken with a view to increasing the intake of land and thereby improving the plantable reserve position.  The various measures to which he referred contributed to an acceleration of the handling of acquisition cases within the year although their effects were not apparent in the statistics of cases brought to fruition by the close of the year.  The acquisition of land target for 1960/61 can, however, be set at a higher level in consequence of these various improvements in arrangements.  If a higher target is achieved the main gain will have come from an enlargement in the staff dealing with this work so as to secure a more expeditious handling of acquisition proceedings at all stages. A hastening in the average time required to put a case through to finality will come from some procedural changes recently adopted in relation to the treatment of equities.</P>
    <P>Since the promulgation last year of the Statutory Regulations under the 1956 Forestry Act it has been possible to make some progress with the difficult commonage areas, the acquisition of which the Act was designed to facilitate.  The first case, a commonage area of 72 acres in Donegal, has just been brought formally before the Land Commission under the new procedure. Another, a substantially larger commonage area, has now been brought almost to the point where the formal procedure can also be initiated.</P>
    <P>In the other type of case&mdash;one where serious title difficulties have arisen&mdash; with which the 1956 Forestry Act and the new Statutory Regulations dealt, some progress has also been made and the first formal proceedings will shortly be instituted.</P>
    <P>I should mention before passing from subhead C.1 that last year we were successful in acquiring two <Col N="1388" /> blocks of land, one in Wexford and one in Waterford, suitable for the new large-scale nurseries which the Department is anxious to establish. Negotiations for other areas are being pursued actively and further progress with the establishment of new big nursery units is expected during the present year.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.2&mdash;Forest Development and Management&mdash;shows an increase of £504,550 over the original Estimate provision for 1959/60.  In the Supplementary Estimate for that year an additional sum of £137,000 had to be provided under this subhead and the increase in the current year as compared with the revised Estimate for 1959/60 is, therefore, £367,550.</P>
    <P>From the details given in Part III of the Estimate now before the House Deputies will see that the main increases as compared with the original Estimate figures for 1959/60 are on Head 3 of the subhead, that dealing with new roads and buildings, which is up by £184,500, and on Head 4&mdash; General Forest Management&mdash;which is up by £208,000.  On Head 3 an additional £40,000 was provided in the Supplementary Estimate and the increase over the revised Estimate figure for that head is, therefore, £144,500. On Head 4 an additional £100,000 was provided in the Supplementary Estimate and the increase this year over the revised 1959/60 figure is, therefore, £108,000.</P>
    <P>Taking the Subhead item by item: item 1&mdash;State Forest Nurseries&mdash;shows no significant change as compared with 1959/60.  The provision includes a sum of £131,653 for labour compared with an actual expenditure in 1959/60 of £122,269.</P>
    <P>In dealing with item 2, Establishment of Plantations, I must first draw the attention of the House to the fact that a total area of just over 25,000 acres was planted in 1959/60.  It will be recalled that in recent years the Forestry Division has been working to a plan of progressive annual increases in the rate of planting which was designed to reach an ultimate level of 25,000 acres in 1959/60.  That target was duly reached and it is intended to <Col N="1389" /> plant a further 25,000 acres in the current year.  It is, I think, very creditable to the Forestry Division and I wish to thank all concerned, that the planned progression of annual planting rates was maintained and brought to its ultimate peak last year despite all the management difficulties associated with the paucity of the plantable reserve available.  The comparatively low level of the plantable reserve in relation to annual planting rate has, of course, made it impossible for the Division to organise planting programmes at individual forest centres in the manner best calculated to bring about stability in labour force requirements.  These difficulties will persist in 1960/61, but, if, as I hope, there is a substantial improvement in the rate of acquisition of land this year, we should be able to look forward to an improvement in the position of the plantable reserve and a reduction in our management problems as from 1961/62 onwards.</P>
    <P>In the course of last year's Estimate debate, attention was directed to the increasing extent to which the planting programme is situated in the counties along the western seaboard.  In 1959/60, 10,270 acres, 40 per cent. of the total planting programme, was located at forests in the Congested Districts and present indications are that some 41 per cent. of this year's programme will also lie in the congested districts.  A substantial part of the planting programme in western areas is in peat soils.  Progress on plantations already laid down on western peats continues to be encouraging although, of course, a final decision in relation to some of the more difficult peat soil types, upon which afforestation has been attempted, must still be deferred for quite some time.  I should say in this connection that the Forestry Division's research unit has been devoting a considerable amount of its efforts towards scientifically controlled research work on these peat areas including experiments in relation to species selection, manurial applications and plant spacings.</P>
    <P>The westward swing in planting in recent years has, of course, been <Col N="1390" /> accompanied by an increased reliance on mechanical preparation of ground which is essential in the peat areas and is generally regarded as an aid to successful crop establishment on most soil types with which we are today concerned.  In 1956/57 mechanical preparation preceded planting on 36 per cent. of total area planted, 47 per cent. was mechanically prepared in 1957/58 and 51 per cent. in 1958/ 59.  In 1959/60 a total of 15,700 acres, 61 per cent. of the entire planting programme, was mechanically prepared and in the current year it is expected that some 18,000 acres, almost 70 per cent. of the entire programme, will be so prepared.  This increase in the extent to which ground is prepared by mechanical means is a good thing in so far as mechanical preparation either improves the prospective timber yield or renders plantable areas upon which forestry could not otherwise be attempted.  It has, however, a limiting effect on the volume of immediate employment provided by new plantings.  I shall refer later to this aspect of the matter when dealing with labour questions generally.</P>
    <P>The sum provided for Labour under the Establishment of Plantations head is £414,020 compared with an actual expenditure of £388,740 last year.</P>
    <P>On item 3, New Roads and Buildings, a provision of £528,500 is being made against a provision in the 1959/60 original Estimate of £344,000. Only slightly over £20,000 of the provision relates to Buildings and allowance is, therefore, being made for an expenditure of over £500,000 in 1960/ 61 on the construction of roads and bridges.  Some years ago when the acreage of plantations approaching the thinning stage began to mount up rapidly there was a developing arrear in the construction of forest roads required for the extraction of thinning produce.  Construction was slow and progress was impeded also by organisational and other difficulties in a rapidly enlarging volume of work which had special characteristics.  The extent of the progress which has been made in setting aside the difficulties and in speeding up the work is evident from the following figures showing the mileage of roads completed <Col N="1391" /> in each of the past four years and the programme for the current year: 1956/57, 71 miles; 1957/58, 123 miles; 1958/59, 106 miles; 1959/60, 200 miles (a provisional figure); 1960/61, approaching 300 miles.</P>
    <P>With this very rapid acceleration the position in relation to the servicing of forest properties with extraction roads has improved very substantially.  During the past year when favourable summer weather conditions permitted of remarkably quick progress, most of the remaining difficult areas were handlled and indications are that work planned for the present year should bring the position on the extraction road front generally up to date, thus enabling attention in future years to be devoted rather more to improving the servicing of young plantations with roads useful for general management and fire protection purposes.</P>
    <P>The rapid progress which has been made is attributable in large measure to new methods of road construction adopted on the advice of a consulting engineer with considerable experience of forest and other pioneering road construction work abroad.  The consultant was first engaged for a brief period some years ago and was reemployed last year for a 6-month period.  We have been fortunate enough to secure his services again for a short period in the current year but at this stage he is mainly concerned with bridge construction problems.</P>
    <P>The adoption of a new methods, apart from enabling progress to be accelerated, has also brought about a significant reduction in the construction cost of forest roads in many areas. This reduction in cost will have a significant bearing on the final economics of forestry as the capital costs of road construction in the early stages of the rotation have a considerable impact upon the final Profit and Loss Account for timber production.</P>
    <P>The provision for Road Construction this year includes £309,990 for labour as compared with £186,073 actual expenditure last year.  The direct labour element in forest road construction on the scale now in progress <Col N="1392" /> is, therefore, quite considerable despite the significant diversion of labour into the indirect employment category which has followed from the more extensive letting out of contracts for the supply of road materials in recent years.  The cost reduction from the adoption of new construction methods to which I have referred has reduced the &ldquo;on site&rdquo; labour content of the work and has thus limited the growth in direct employment from an enlarging total volume of work but the new methods have had no significant effect on the indirect labour content, the growth of which over the past few years may be gauged from the following figures in relation to contract expenditure on the supply of materials for roads and bridges: 1958/59, £62,250; 1959/60, £137,641; 1960/61, £177,000, estimated.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provision for 1960/61 under the item of General Forest Management shows an increase of £208,000 over the original Estimate figure for 1959/60.  In the Supplementary Estimate for that year, however, an additional £100,000 was added to the provision under this head and in the final outturn expenditure proved even higher at a level of £640,000.  At that level the expenditure, which under this head is almost entirely on labour, was some £95,000 higher than in 1958/59.  The very big increase in expenditure in 1959/60 in comparison with the previous year is partly due to the effect on work progress in the forests of the wet summer in 1958/59 in contrast with the unusually dry summer in 1959/60.  A further rise in expenditure is anticipated in the current year.  A pattern of regular annual increases in expenditure under this head is to be expected with the increase in the total area of the State plantations; the increase has been all the greater in recent years because of the considerable additions to the total area of young plantations, management expenditure requirements being higher in the first few years after planting.</P>
    <P>To some extent the rapid rise in expenditure under this head has been <Col N="1393" /> influenced by a deliberate policy of stepping up general forest management work to the maximum extent possible to enable the rise in labour productivity associated with the introduction of the incentive bonus scheme to be taken up without creating disemployment in the period pending a normal expansion in total work volume.  I am happy to be able to say that, as a corollary to this, reports show generally that the management and maintenance of the State forest plantations are now at a high level which should result ultimately in higher timber yields and contribute towards a reduction in danger of damage from fire and trespass.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the high labour content of operations under this head.  The provision for 1960/61 includes £701,977 for labour as compared with an actual expenditure in 1959/60 of £602,371.</P>
    <P>Under item 5&mdash;Timber Conversion &mdash;the provision in the current Estimate is £100,000 compared with £94,500 in the Estimate for 1959/60.  As regards thinning produce, up to 75 per cent. by volume has in recent years been sold standing in the woods and on a contract basis under which the purchaser does his own felling.  The areas in which the Department still fells the timber before sale are usually those being thinned for the first time or where there are unusual felling problems; in such cases sales standing may be either unattractive to prospective purchasers or inadvisable from the Department's viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Final figures of thinning output in 1959/60 are not yet available&mdash;partly because of a change-over to new methods of compiling returns which are expected to give a more accurate picture.  Such information as is available suggests some increase on the 1958/59 figure of 2.3 million cubic feet with the probability of a further rise in 1960/61.</P>
    <P>For the direct labour work to be charged to this head provision has been included in the Estimate at a figure of £88,440 as compared with an expenditure of £79,978 in 1959/60.</P>
    <P>Under item 6 of Subhead C.2, that <Col N="1394" /> for Mechanical Equipment for Forest Development and Management, there is an increase of £13,400 in the provision for purchase and hire of mechanical equipment and vehicles and an increase of £27,850 in the provision for operation, maintenance and repair.  The increases in both heads are directly related to the rise in the extent to which it is desirable to prepare ground mechanically before planting and also to the expanded level of road construction work.</P>
    <P>The total sum included for labour in the various provisions within Subhead C.2 amounts to £1,705,940 which must be compared with an allowance for labour within the subhead in the 1959/60 Estimate of £1,352,114.  The need for the Supplementary Estimate in 1959/60 arose in substantial measure from labour expenditure running above the level originally anticipated and the actual outturn of expenditure on labour on Subhead C.2 in 1959/60 was slightly over £1,437,000. The 1960/61 Estimate, therefore, allows for labour expenditure on this subhead exceeding the expenditure level in 1959/60 by approximately £268,000.  The increase is partly attributable to the fact that there are 53 pay-days in 1960/61 but, even apart from the extra pay-day, allowance has been made for expenditure at a level approximately £240,000 higher than in 1959/60.  An increase in the basic rate of wages for forestry labourers which operated from the 2nd January, 1960, and, therefore, had only partial effect on the level of expenditure in 1959/60 is contributing towards the higher wage bill anticipated in the current year.</P>
    <P>The average number of men employed in 1959/60 was 4,779, an increase of slightly over 100 above the average level in 1958/59.  The higher level of employment last year was gratifying when regard is had to the substantial extent to which the incentive bonus scheme for forestry labourers was introduced within the year and to the lower labour content of planting on mechanically prepared ground.  Employment was in fact somewhat higher than it would otherwise have been because of the remarkably <Col N="1395" /> fine summer and the opportunities it presented for rapid progress with certain aspects of work.  It seems unlikely that it will be possible to maintain employment at the enhanced 1959/60 rate in the current year but employment is expected to run above the 1958/59 level at an approximate average of 4,700 men.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made during the past year with the application of the incentive bonus scheme for forestry workers.  On the 1st April, 1959, approximately one-seventh of the total labour force were working under the incentive scheme at the 29 forests to which the scheme had by then been applied.  At the 1st April, 1960, two-thirds of the total labour force had been brought under the scheme at 112 forests.  Application is proceeding at a rapid rate and it is anticipated that the scheme will have been applied to all forests by December, 1960.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that I am an enthusiastic disciple of work study and incentive bonus systems of payment as likely to serve the interests of employers and employees alike in all circumstances but I must say that the forestry incentive scheme has at this stage proved itself a success.  The application of fair and uniform incentive conditions to the wide range of field operations being carried on at so many forests spread over the country was a very big task and the firm of industrial consultants who undertook the assignment and the Department's staff had to face many problems of rationalisation of work patterns and specifications to ensure that the scheme would work properly. Most of the difficulties have by now been surmounted and a uniform basis for work evaluation at all forests has been settled.</P>
    <P>The response of the workers to the scheme has been good and they have shown confidence in its fairness which has reflected itself in an appreciable rise in productivity.  The pattern varies somewhat from forest to forest but all the reports I have received have indicated that the reaction of the workers to this form of indirect profit-sharing incentive has been to apply themselves intelligently to finding ways and means <Col N="1396" /> of husbanding time and securing a greater work production from their efforts.  It is from this more thrifty use of time rather than from an increased tempo of physical exertion that the real gains of such a scheme can be secured for both employee and employer.  I am told generally that where the scheme is in operation there has been a positive improvement in the quality of work as well as an increase in quantitative production.</P>
    <P>I touched already in dealing with the General Forest Management head on the extra attention which it has been possible to pay to that work in consequence of the incentive bonus scheme.  In general it is true to say that the scheme has enabled the standards of maintenance and management of State Forests to be stepped up in a way which should have an ultimate effect on net average timber yields per acre.</P>
    <P>The main gain, of course, from the Department's point of view, lies in the sharing between the Department and its workers of the profits coming from a higher productivity level.  The gain to the Department or, if I may put it that way, to the taxpayer in the current year is estimated at a net figure of approximately £220,000 and should be higher still when the scheme is fully bedded down.  A gain of this magnitude is, of course, of very great importance in contributing to the ultimate financial soundness of Forestry as an aspect of the national economy. Forestry has obvious social advantages but in line with the Government's general approach to the fundamental problems of our economy it is essential that the State forest service which is now engaged on such an extensive scheme of afforestation should operate profitably.  In pursuing afforestation at a level beyond that required to meet the domestic market for timber and other forest products it has been reassuring to us in the past that the British market in these commodities would never be substantially supplied from internal sources in Britain and would, therefore, be readily available to this country when our forests came into full bearing.  In this, as in other fields, we must now take serious cognisance <Col N="1397" /> of the breaking down of international trade barriers which have in the past given us a measure of protection on the British market.  It becomes all the more important to us to put our forest economy on the soundest possible footing if the considerable investment of public capital in afforestation is to prove well spent.</P>
    <P>The labour content of Forestry is high and the attainment of optimum labour productivity which should be secured from the continued success of the incentive bonus scheme is essential if we are to be in a position to continue to look to forestry as a worthwhile branch of our economy and to develop its future employment possibilities to the maximum advantage. The scheme is succeeding in achieving these objectives.  The biggest difficulty has been that of avoiding a temporary fall-off in the level of employment in consequence of the rise in productivity pending the natural enlargement in work volume which will come from the development of the plantations already laid down.  It has been something of a headache to the officers of my Department to make sure that there would not be such a temporary fall-off in the employment level.  Up to the present that danger has been successfully avoided and it now seems reasonably certain that it will be possible to maintain the labour force at its present level over the next few years.  Within a few years the natural increase in the volume of work will bring us to the point where a steady upward movement in forestry employment will be possible with much greater assurance than in the past that the employment will be steady and permanent.</P>

      <P>As I have already told the Deputy in reply to a previous question, I have been informed by the Cork Harbour Commissioners that they are satisfied that tankers are making full use of the facilities provided by the refinery and are not discharging oil into the Harbour. The Harbour Commissioners are the responsible public authority on whom the duty of preventing oil pollution in their harbour primarily devolves and I have no grounds for not accepting their assurances.  I am in any case advised that pollution of the kind which has been reported could not be caused by the small tankers carrying refined oils from the refinery, but is due to the discharge of crude oil on the high seas.  In these circumstances I have not considered it necessary to direct that any special investigation should be carried out by my Department into the allegations made by the Deputy.</P>

    <P>The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Ships' Equipment) Regulations, 1957, require that all oil fuelled Irish registered ships must be so fitted as to prevent oil fuel from leaking or draining from machinery spaces into bilges.</P>
    <P>I have made arrangements for officers of my Department to examine and report on the extent of oil pollution of southern beaches but I very much doubt if the results will add anything to our information on the subject.  The principal cause of oil pollution of this kind is the cleaning out of the crude oil tanks of oil tankers and the disposal of oily ballast water from such tanks on the high seas.  The persistent oils so discharged may be carried by wind and tide for many hundreds of miles to pollute the beaches of this and other countries.  The only entirely effective method of preventing oil pollution is the complete avoidance of the discharge of persistent oils into the sea. International agreement on such complete prohibition has not been possible and the International Convention applies only to discharges within certain zones and binds only those countries which are signatories to it.  Many countries with substantial tanker fleets are not signatories to the Convention. Success in preventing or substantially reducing oil pollution depends ultimately on an increased measure of international co-operation.  We are playing our part but there is nothing we can do to prevent pollution by the vessels of other states who are not parties to the International Convention.</P>

Legal doubts have now been raised as to whether there is sufficient distinction in terminology between a railway station and a railway halt to ensure that the Board could properly close these halts without first giving formal statutory two months' notice in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> of its intention of so doing.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,748,700 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course <Col N="1424" /> of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946 and No. 6 of 1956), including a Grant in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Subhead H&mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid, allowance has been made for receipts totalling £363,000 as compared with an allowance of £330,500 in the original estimate for 1959/60.  Actual receipts realised in 1959/60 including receipts appropriated under the Supplementary Estimate for that year totalled slightly over £380,000, which was substantially above the highest level of receipts in any previous year.</P>
      <P>The important receipt head is that for sales of timber.  Receipts from timber sales in 1959/60 totalled almost £313,000 which was over £30,000 above the level in any previous year. The Estimate allowance under this head in 1960/61 is £320,000 and in relation to the level of receipts last year there should be little difficulty in realising this sum.</P>
      <P>Apart from sales of firewood, nearly 4½ million cubic feet of timber were sold in 1959-60 compared with 3½ million cubic feet in the previous year. More than one-third of the timber sold in 1959-60 was over 8&rdquo; quarter girth, that is in the size class suitable generally for box-making and sawlog purposes. The sawlog market which was sluggish and uncertain in 1958-59 was much stronger in 1959-60 and prospects for the current year are satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Discussions with the Electricity Supply Board, mentioned in the House last year, with a view to increasing the proportion of home-grown timber used to meet the Board's transmission pole needs were successful.  Through selective forest felling co-ordinated with the Board's intake requirements, sales to the Board were stepped up from 3,500 poles in 1958-59 to 13,000 poles in 1959-60.  Improved co-ordination also enabled sales to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for telegraph poles to be increased from 9,000 to 14,000 poles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> The pulpwood market was improved by the commencement in the autumn of 1959 of purchases by the new factory of Chipboard Ltd. in Scariff, Co. Clare, which went into production in December.  The opening of this new factory enabled the Department to pursue a more vigorous sales policy in relation to small size timber and was of course particularly useful in providing a convenient outlet for the produce of thinnings at forests in Clare and South Galway.</P>
    <P>For the coming year the prospects in relation to the timber market generally appear reasonably satisfactory at the moment and I would expect to see some volumetric increase in sales over last year's level providing receipts somewhat in excess of the allowance made in the Estimate. Further progress was made during the past year in the campaign to promote more extensive use of home-grown timber in the building trade by encouraging contract specifications based on appropriate moisture contents for different purposes and permitting equally of the use of home-grown or imported timber.  The report on the European Productivity Agency Small Pulp Mills Survey in which this country participated was published recently.  The report is still under study by various interests concerned.</P>
    <P>The only remaining Subhead of the Estimate is Subhead D&mdash;Grants for Afforestation Purposes.  It will be noted that the provision included in the Estimate&mdash;£25,000&mdash;is £10,000 greater than in 1959/60.  Actual expenditure in, 1959/60 was over £14,000 by comparison with £4,300 in 1958/59. It is estimated that a sum of £2,500 will be required in 1960/61 to cover second instalments on grants made in earlier years.  The Estimate provision is, therefore, adequate to cover first instalments on new grants totalling £22,500 which would represent the planting of 2,250 acres.</P>
    <P>The rise in expenditure last year and the anticipated further rise in the current year is indicative of the increase in private planting which has been brought about by the enlargement of the rate of grant to £20 an acre and by the publicity campaign <Col N="1426" /> conducted over the past few years by the Department.  During last year the general campaign through newspaper publicity, etc., throughout the country was accompanied by intensive propaganda in Counties Cavan, Clare, Cork and Monaghan.  The campaign in these counties centred on a series of lectures spread over the county regions which were organised in cooperation with the local County Committees of Agriculture and the various rural organisations.  Altogether 73 lectures were given in the counties concerned. The lectures were well attended and a good deal of interest was displayed, much of which was subsequently converted into positive action.  It is still too soon to establish any figure as to the actual level of planting last winter but it seems certain that there was a further substantial increase on the 1958/59 level; in 1958/59 about 1,200 acres were planted by comparison with an average annual figure of 400 acres in previous years.  The free Advisory Service which the Department is now making available to all prospective planters is proving well worth while and there was a big increase in the number of advisory inspections sought in 1959/60 as against the previous year.  Altogether in 1959/60, 1,073 separate areas totalling 3,138 acres were inspected under the Advisory Scheme.</P>
    <P>It is intended to continue the intensive propaganda campaign this year and as in previous years a series of lectures will be arranged in a number of counties.  It seems certain at this stage that we are on the high road towards securing the active cooperation of the farming community in bringing into useful production as farm wood-lots, the small waste areas on farms scattered throughout the country which are not being used for agricultural purposes, are suitable for tree cultivation and cannot conveniently be included in the State afforestation scheme.  That is the primary objective of the Private Planting Grant Scheme and it is encouraging to find such a growing response to the scheme by farmers, big and small.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to report a year of sustained progress in both <Col N="1427" /> State afforestation and private planting and I recommend the Estimate to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help recalling some of the comments the Minister made some years ago when he was in Opposition when I was trying to develop the forestry programme.  He referred to plantations of young trees as plantations of bushes and ridiculed the opening of new forestry centres in the west of Ireland.  There is no need to be ashamed of what is being achieved.  The 25,000 acre planting that has been carefully built up over a number of years is a very good record for the Forestry Division. Account must be taken of the fact that our people are amongst the most land-hungry in western Europe and it is difficult to understand how it is that the Department can acquire 27,000 or 28,000 acres from people who have scarcely enough land for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One disturbing aspect of the Minister's account of the progress for the last year is that the acquisition is a bit low.  If we are to continue to plant 25,000 acres a year&mdash;and I submit that we should&mdash;it would take something more than the acquisition of 27,000 acres to keep that up.  I notice the plantable reserve, not the total reserve, is around 48,500.  The Minister did not tell us how much <Col N="1428" /> unplantable land is in the hands of his Department.  With the help of machinery much land that was unplantable has been rendered plantable and with the exception of lakes and bare mountaintops, I do not see why land covered with peat or other such land could not be planted.</P>
    <P>I take it that the ceiling price for the purchase of land for forestry purposes is unchanged at £10.  That is too low.  With increased staff the Department can make a great effort but when they come up against the fact that people will not sell their land at prices offered, the intake of land will not be increased.  The plantable reserve must be kept up if the Department is to run properly and if the nurseries are to be looked after. There should always be a three years' reserve in hand; in fact a bigger reserve than 75,000 acres is desirable. If the Minister wants people to sell their land he must increase the ceiling price; otherwise the available reserve will go down and, if it does, the whole planting programme for the year goes down with it.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what progress has been made towards the purchase of commonages or parts of commonages provision for which was made under the 1956 Act and how that Act has operated.  At the time the Act was being drafted grave doubts were expressed by people whose opinion I respected that the partition of commonages would not work.  I have often wondered, since I went out of office in 1957, has it been put into operation and, if so, with what success.  That provision was inserted in the 1956 Act in order to allow those who are willing to sell their shares in a commonage to sell for cash so that forestry could be started in the area and, at the same time, avoid creating an injustice in the case of those who wished to retain their shares.</P>
    <P>I did that with the best intentions but I have no information as to what has happened because I have no knowledge of any case in which it has been tried out.  I should like to know if it has been tried out and with what <Col N="1429" /> success.  If it is not a success, or if it threatens to perpetrate an injustice on any of the holders, my advice would be to drop it.  It was not intended to work in that way.  It was intended to give justice to both sides, to those who wished to sell and to those who wished to retain their shares.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to continue the intake of land, I suggest the appropriate provision in the 1956 Act offers him the most reasonable prospect.  It has been my experience in the last 10 years that the rights to commonages given to tenants by the C.D.B. have been grossly abused.  It very often happens that 15 or 16 people have the rights in common but only one or two are sufficiently wealthy to avail themselves of these rights.  The others pay their annuities and rates, but the fortunate one or two who are wealthy enough to be able to stock the commonage grab the lot.  That avenue would, I think, be well worth exploring because the pools of land available when I extended forestry in 1949 to 1950, and my successor after 1951, have dried up by now.  There were several big offers of land then.  There was one offer of about 8,000 acres in North Mayo.  There was another in Oughterard in Galway of between 1,200 and 1,300 acres.  I am sure the offers the Minister gets now of 100 acres, or something over that, are very few.  The only way in which the Minister will be able to procure land will be by raising the ceiling price.</P>
    <P>Forestry is one of the ways in which we can hold down at least a certain population on the poorer land in the rural areas.  These people cannot live on the little mountain holdings they have but, if there is any kind of steady employment in the locality, they will not leave.  I suggest forestry is one of the most useful instruments we have in stemming the tide of emigration.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the question of pests in connection with forestry.  The Minister did not advert to that aspect in his opening statement.  Forestry experts in 1948 and 1949 were of the impression that, if we expanded our planting to 25,000 acres per year, <Col N="1430" /> serious pests would develop.  Have they?  I remember reading in a Canadian forestry journal of a pest which was imported into Canadian forests from Europe.  Damage to the tune of millions of pounds was done.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister also tell us if a research section has been established? When Shelton Abbey was rebuilt and converted into a forestry school the idea was to establish a research section there which would work in close harmony with the Universities.  Research is necessary from the point of view of investigation into pests and diseases, and their control, as well as from the point of view of investigation into soils to find out how different soils affect trees.  I should like to have some information on these points when the Minister is replying.</P>
    <P>The raising of the ceiling price may not be the answer to the problem of procuring more land.  The Minister has excellent advisers.  He has forestry officials who are second to none in any forestry service in Europe of which I am aware.  They are far ahead of men in services much older than ours.  It is a section of which the Minister can be proud.  I am sure it is within the competence of his excellent officials to find out exactly what is the best approach, without encroaching on the rights of land owners.</P>
    <P>We read from time to time of a certain opposition to forestry development but, so far, I have not come across any really convincing argument. It is argued that forestry displaces people from small holdings.  The fact is that, if these people have made up their minds to go, nothing will hold them.  They will sell their land for forestry because they will get a better price for it than they would from a neighbour who wants it for agricultural purposes.  Forestry helps to counterbalance those who go because it holds others in the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that 4,500,000 cubic feet of timber were sold in 1959-60 as compared with 3,500,000 cubic feet in the previous year.  I was very anxious that a pulp mill should be established to use up the fairly large quantity of otherwise unusable <Col N="1431" /> timber which will come out of our forests in six or seven years' time.  The plantings done in 1948 and 1949 will then be 15 years old.  They will not be felled until they are 20 years old.  The Minister should now consult with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the desirability of establishing a suitable industry to absorb these fellings.  If my recollection is correct, by the year 1967, or 1968, there will be something in the region of 12,000,000 to 14,000,000 cubic feet of timber coming out of the plantings that started in 1948, 1949 and 1950.  There may not be any difficulty at present in disposing of the thinnings but the planting programme has been stepped up by 2,500 acres a year for the past few years, until it has reached 25,000 acres.  I take it the acreage will be 25,000 next year and the year after also.  We shall not feel 15 or 20 years passing and if we do not provide for the use of the timber then available we shall have a big quantity of home-grown timber for which there will be no market.  We shall be paying at the same time some £10,000,000 for timber from other countries for paper and so on.</P>
    <P>It was to get data on that subject that I spent a fortnight in Sweden in 1956.  I want to impress on the Minister, as I did on his predecessor, the absolute necessity for coping with that matter.  I want to warn the Minister that it is not enough to produce timber.  Producing timber is a waste of time if we do not make the best possible use of it.  I would ask the Minister to try to contemplate how he is to get a market for 12 million or 14 million cubic feet of timber of anything from eight inches to 14 inches in breast high diameter. I should like to see even a small move made towards establishing a pulp mill which could produce paper from our own timber and save sterling which we have to pay for timber at present to other countries which have natural forests.  The Minister would be doing a good job if he proceeded on that line.  If he neglects it then in 12 or 15 years the generation of that time will have some nasty things to say about him or his successor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> I was disappointed to note the drop in the employment figures which the Minister announced.  I suppose the Minister's answer is that the mechanisation of the Department has resulted in the drop.  When I left office, if I remember correctly, the planting programme was around 17,000 acres and 4,800 men were employed.  I do not see how mechanisation in the form of tractors and new types of ploughs, could have reduced the number to the present figure.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, when he was Minister for Lands was guilty of wiping out a number of small nurseries which had been giving useful employment.  There was one in Lecarrow where the employment was as high as 30 men.  The plants were quite good and the young transplants which were being produced were as good as any in the country.  I cannot understand why that was wiped out. It was a mistake of the first magnitude.</P>
    <P>I was not here to hear the whole of the Minister's brief and I should like to know if the Department has progressed towards supplying the E.S.B. with poles and other timber, because up to the present at least, the Forestry Department could not supply them as they had not got the trees.  It seems a bit ridiculous to purchase trees from Sweden, Finland and parts of the American Continent, when we could grow them at home.  Have we poles of the correct quality and the correct size to supply them and if so in what numbers are they being purchased? While on the subject, I should like to mention that recently men have been dismissed in the Cong sawmill and I wonder why.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of that. On the question of private planting I should like to make a suggestion which I made before.  I understand that applications for grants will be entertained only for one statute acre, that is where the private owner plants a statute acre or more.  I think the minimum should be reduced to half <Col N="1433" /> an acre and I will give my reasons. Many people are completely unaccutomed to planting even a shelter belt and they are chary or scared of facing something new.  We are all the same in that respect when facing something new.  I believe that many people would put down half an acre where they could not chance the cost of one acre.  They would be afraid it might fail or that it might be a joke in the locality.</P>
      <P>It would be a step in the right direction to make the grant available for half acres.  I know people who have a particular kind of rocky ground suitable only for timber and unsuitable for agricultural purposes where people might avail of such a grant.  I understand that half of the grant of £20 per acre will be paid when the planting is done and that the other half is deferred for three to five years, conditional on proper care being given to the plantation.  That is all to the good and some check is needed.  You might meet a type of person who would put down the plantation and then, if he found it suited him, deliberately destroy it after he had drawn the grant from the Department.  If the area were made smaller it might encourage people to plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things which pleased me most in the Minister's outline of the work of his Department was his statement in regard to planting in the congested areas, particularly in the west. The west of Ireland is the part of the country having the smallest holdings but I believe it is the best hunting ground for land for planting.  In the arable areas, particularly in Leinster and parts of Munster, it would be nothing but sheer madness to utilise them for planting, not that I think any Minister would attempt such a thing.  I should like to see the 40 per cent. being increased.  We have the heaviest emigration in the west and, as was stated on the Vote for the Land Commission, whole families are moving out.  The pattern of emigration heretofore was that the sons and daughters left and the fathers and mothers remained behind, perhaps with one son or daughter staying with <Col N="1434" /> them, as the case might be.  For the last few years that pattern has changed and now whole families are packing up and locking the doors.  The Minister when replying to the Land Commission Vote would not admit that such was the case.  That only shows that he is not keeping in touch with his people because it is the case.  I know of one district in which 19 houses have been closed up.</P>

If forestry were developed in those areas the employment afforded by that development would help to retain a great number of these people at home.  The last thing I want to impress on the Minister is that some provision should be made at once to utilise the vast pool of timber which will be available at the end of this decade, around 1968, 1969 and 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the least idea of what the cubic footage of thinnings would be out of an annual planting programme of 25,000 acres. I imagine it would go into 15 million cubic feet per year and because of the nature of the thinnings we cannot find a market for all that, irrespective of how much is used for pit props, farm fencing and so on.  What I would deplore is if, after growing a crop of timber, we had not the means of disposing of it and converting it into the paper that we need and if we still had to buy woodpulp from other countries because we failed to establish the machinery to use our own produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That will consume a certain amount of it but it will not consume a fraction of the vast quantity that will come out of plantings inside the next twelve or fifteen years. <Col N="1435" /> My guess is that it would take seven or eight years from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; to establish such an industry as I have in mind, and by that time there would be ample timber to keep it going.  It might be argued that we have some industries in that line at present; we have, but I believe they are on too small a scale to deal with the vast quantity of timber coming out of the forests.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to impress on the Minister the necessity to make provision for that development.  Much as I would stress the necessity of keeping up a decent planting programme, now that we have reached our goal of 25,000 acres a year we must also make provision for the natural output of that planting programme.</P>

      <P>The problem to which Deputy Blowick has referred of finding a market is not peculiar to the timber or forestry industry.  The importance of that problem cannot be over-stressed but it is one of the difficulties we have in regard to many of the farm products we produce annually here.  I do not want to enlarge the scope of this debate except to say that I have not the same detailed knowledge of forestry as the Minister and the former Minister have and while I am concerned about the timber we plant, I am primarily concerned with the employment potential of forestry which I believe has not been exploited to the full even yet.  It took quite a long time to convert many people here to the idea of a big forestry programme. I remember that the former Deputy Seán MacBride was laughed to scorn when he suggested we should aim at a target of 25,000 acres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We have achieved the target of 25,000 acres and it has given valuable employment but I believe it could give much more much-needed employment, in rural areas especially. Rural employment has been diminishing year by year for the past two decades.  There is no point in trying to increase employment in rural Ireland in agriculture, road-work, building and fisheries; it seems that the only way we can do something to stem the rush from the land is to engage in much greater planting of forestry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick mentioned the marketing problem and spoke of Britain as a potential market.  We have certain advantages, I suppose, in exporting timber to Great Britain, but when the Seven amalgamate with the Six countries of the Common Market then we shall have our problem.  However, much of the timber we are producing can be used here, through the E.S.B. and the farming community and, as the Minister suggested, in the building industry, small as it now is.</P>
      <P>I do not think we can throw any brickbats at the Minister or his officials.  He and his predecessor must be congratulated for what they did. Apart from interruptions from various sides of the House about what Ministers did or what ex-Ministers said in the past, I believe there has been a genuine desire on the part of all Ministers for Lands to do the best they could in the matter of afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to go slow on one aspect of forestry and I do not expect much agreement when I say this.  The Minister suggests that we are about to mechanise afforestation to some extent.  He should beware of that.  I do not want to go back to the time when we asked our workers to use shovels and spades only but let us not behave as we did when we started to reconstruct our roads after the emergency period when we introduced a great quantity of machinery.  The Minister says he now proposes to do somewhat the same so that we can carry out afforestation on a more economic basis.  That sort of economy can be carried too far if workers and their families are displaced&mdash;and the Minister suggested that they might be displaced. <Col N="1437" /> We can force them to look for other employment in Britain.</P>
    <P>If these machines were made here I should not mind but they are not made in Wexford, Dundalk, Waterford or Dublin.  The Minister proposes to import them from Britain, Germany or the United States.  The manufacture of these machines gives employment to workers in Britain, Germany or in the United States and they will be used here to displace Irish workers, as happened in the case of the roads where they displaced thousands of Irish workers who, strangely enough, had to go to Britain or some other country to find employment. That is a daft sort of economy. Let me qualify that by saying that I am not against progress but I do not like too rapid progress which disrupts family life.  I do not like the type of economic progress which displaces workers and their families.  Unfortunately, I suppose the case is that we have Irishmen now in Britain constructing machines to be sent back here to work in our forests or on our roads and displace more Irishmen. That may not be entirely a matter for the Minister but I think it is something he should consider before he engages in any scheme of rapidly introducing machinery in afforestation.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister can do a tremendous amount to alleviate unemployment and emigration in this country.  Forestry and the employment given in forestry can do that.  If we are to have any confidence at all I think that we should have confidence in the industrial revival and we should also have confidence in our ability to provide for those people who have no employment at the present time.  I can visualise the time, if we proceed as we are proceeding now, when we shall have factories in this country and no manpower to operate them. These people in the rural areas who are now being unemployed by the too rapid introduction of machinery are the people whom we expect to man the factories but if we do not cater for them now they will be forced to emigrate to Great Britain where they can get steady jobs.  They will stay in those jobs, rear their families in <Col N="1438" /> Britain and never come back to this country.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to ensure, as far as he can, that there will be continuity of employment in forestry.  I know it is difficult.  I know that the type of work is seasonal and that it is divided into two or three parts of the year but seasonal work is not good enough for any worker.  If he cannot get security of employment he will emigrate.  He wants twelve months' work in the year and it is not sufficient to say to him that he got seven months' work last year and will get another seven months this year.</P>
    <P>None of us would like it if we were told that we were to be paid for only eleven months in the year.  No civil servant and no shop assistant would be satisfied with that.  The Minister should try to ensure that there will be continuity in forestry work and that there will be the security of 12 months' employment.  Men are being laid off in the forests.  I do not say that it is a mass lay off but in forests like Camolin, Ballybrennan, and Curracloe in my constituency men are being laid off in twos and threes.  These men cannot afford to be out of work for two or three weeks; that is why we are losing Irish workers in this country.</P>
    <P>There is no one in this country who can afford to be idle for two or three weeks and forced to have recourse to the employment exchange.  These men must seek employment elsewhere. They cannot get it in the towns or on the land.  They cannot get it in the agricultural industry as farmers do not need labour on the land any more because they have got fancy machinery which was not bought in this country. The worker who is laid off for two or three weeks has to travel to Rosslare or Dún Laoghaire and go across to get work in Cardiff, Liverpool, Birmingham or London.</P>
    <P>That is the reason I asked the Minister to try to ensure that through planting, thinning and roadmaking a man will get 12 months' employment every year.  If we do get to the stage where we shall have factories and industries established in this country then we will have the manpower, the men who work at present in the <Col N="1439" /> forests or in any other type of State employment.  The important thing is to keep those men in the country so that when we want them they will be here.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear in the Minister's speech that, despite the progress he speaks about and the fact that we have provided much more money for afforestation, there was an increase of only slightly over 100 workers employed in the year 1959-60 as compared with the year 1958-59. That is not a tremendous increase and it shows the effects of a too rapid introduction of machinery into this industry. I am not against progress or against the introduction of machinery but in our circumstances, where we have such a big unemployment problem, we should try to guard against such a situation.  The Minister boasted, and rightly so, that we have achieved the target we set ourselves of 25,000 acres.  I wonder would he say whether or not we are to rest on that figure of 25,000 acres or if there is any prospect of increasing it or whether it would be wise to increase that level?</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want the Minister to investigate a particular complaint made to me.  It has nothing to do with the general policy or general administration of the Department, but it has to do with the Camolin forest.  I am informed that, when a number of men were laid off recently, it was the ordinary labouring man who was sacked and those retained were people who had some property.  They were not men who could be regarded as big farmers or even middling fair-sized farmers but they had some land and they had some resources.  One of them, or his people, had a shop.  Those who were laid off had nothing at all and had to make application for unemployment benefit.  Some had to leave the country and go to Great Britain. I wish the Parliamentary Secretary to report this matter to the Minister for investigation.  These complaints were made to me and I can only give them to the Minister for what they are worth.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to say a few words of encouragement to the <Col N="1440" /> Minister by telling him to go ahead as rapidly as other Ministers have done for the past four, or five or even ten years.  Forestry work is the only hope of employment that there is in the rural areas.  If the Minister believes that our target should be greater than the 25,000 acres we have achieved, he should push on up to 30,000 acres or whatever figure he believes right having regard to the possibility of disposing of the timber we plant.  This work gives valuable employment in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone will disagree with the opinion of the last speaker that there is considerable employment in afforestation. As I see it, the policy of the Forestry Division is to acquire and plant 25,000 acres every year.  If in the next ten years, they acquire 25,000 acres of land every year they will have a quarter of a million acres under their control in that period.  I do not know how much land the Forestry Division already has but I would like the House to consider whether it is desirable that the State should acquire land and hold it in perpetuity.</P>
      <P>I would very much favour the idea that the State should acquire land, afforest it and lease it to private individuals or local authorities.  There is nothing new in that idea.  It is a policy that has been adopted in other countries.  Some people favour State control of everything.  I do not think that that makes for a satisfactory or business-like arrangement or efficiency. It is very desirable that there should be private afforestation to augment State afforestation.  In the past there was considerable private enterprise in relation to forestry.  The private individual works at a disadvantage. The State does not pay rates or income tax and if it had to pay these charges would do so by an annual provision in the Budget.  A satisfactory forestry policy necessitates private, enterprise side by side with extensive State afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other countries, where I have had an opportunity of studying forestry, it is the exception rather than the rule for the State to hold on to land.  In France, Germany and the United <Col N="1441" /> Kingdom the forestry departments act as advisers and stimulators in regard to afforestation.  They take over estates which they plant and lease to persons who satisfy the Departmental inspectors as to their efficiency in carrying out State policy in regard to afforestation.  I have often suggested to Ministers through Parliamentary Questions that such a policy might be adopted here but the answer has always been in the negative.</P>
    <P>As a member of a Government that is dedicated to private enterprise, as we have heard so often from Ministers of this Government, does the Minister think it desirable that there should be such a big takeover of land by the State and that it should be held for all time by a Department?  I do not see anything in the Minister's speech to indicate any change in that policy.  I would ask him, when replying to the debate, to refer to the suggestion I have made and to indicate why he thinks it is not feasible.</P>
    <P>There are extensive forests in France.  Admittedly, there is a terrific demand for timber there.  The forests are owned by the local authorities or municipalities.  Of course the system of Government in France is based on local authorities.  The fact that the forests are owned by the local authorities means that there is continuous employment available locally.  In this country the majority of men who work in State forests for nine months of the year and who are then disemployed go to England.  There is no alternative for them.  In France the forests are planted, tended and thinned and the hardwood is harvested by the local authority and sold in the villages and towns.  That helps to maintain continuous employment.</P>
    <P>I cannot envisage a central Department in Dublin carrying out such a system.  It would not be possible for them to do so.  There would have to be staff, experts and advisers on the spot all the time.  Therefore, the Minister should seriously consider a policy of decentralisation.  The basis of any scheme like that would have to be the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I do not see how any private person <Col N="1442" /> in Ireland can be expected to be enthusiastic about planting.  It may be possible to get people interested in planting an acre of forest or a shelter belt with the grants that they get.  If a private person plants an extensive forest, hardwood will lock up his investment for 120 years and softwood will lock it up for six years.  For 60 years he will pay rates and income tax on the land.  Is it likely that a farmer who has 20 or 30 acres of land on which timber was cut during the emergency or at some other time, will reafforest it?  Is there any encouragement for him to do so?  The Minister may reply that he will get a grant. The man will get no return from it in his lifetime.  It is recognised that a person plants timber for those who come after him.  If a person plants timber for posterity and for the nation, it is rather hard luck that he should have to pay rates and income tax on it.  If there were some arrangements made between the Minister in charge of forests and the Minister for Finance whereby lands under timber would be freed from these charges, it would be an incentive to private afforestation and once private afforestation starts on any scale it will advance generally throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick dealt with the sale of timber.  Although I know a little about the sale of timber I do not claim to be an expert on the subject. I do know that the international market for timber is as uncertain as it could possibly be.  That has been the condition of affairs for some years. If the State spends huge sums of money in planting 25,000 acres a year, while other State forests are maturing, there must be some guarantee of a remunerative return.  That applies also to private forests.  The Minister said that the market for timber is satisfactory.  That is not my personal experience as a person who has timber on his own land nor is it the experience of other people, who told me they can find no such market. They can find a market for one or two trees but for extensive supplies of timber there is none.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, therefore, to tell the House what is the policy of the Department in this regard. <Col N="1443" /> Does it intend, as is apparent from the Minister's opening remarks, to go on planting extensively?  Both the State and individuals have over the years been planting timber to a greater extent than before, particularly since we established our own Government over 40 years ago.  There is a great deal of timber maturing and, as time goes on, there will be more and more maturing.  Has the Forestry Division any long-term policy in that regard? I have made inquiries on many occasions about pulp for the manufacture of newspaper, and I have been told it would be uneconomic.  I have been told we have not enough timber with which to supply factories, that the amount of newsprint we import would not be sufficient to maintain factories in production.  I have been told it would not be economic because the United Kingdom imports the major portion of her timber from Canada and other sources.  I would ask the Minister to tell us what is the general policy in regard to timber, whether there is a market and whether he has made arrangements to deal with the situation which must become more acute every year.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister a question this week as to the amount of land available in Wexford.  The answer was that there were 8,000 acres available in 174 different lots; he said it would not be feasible to give the dates of offer, how long it had been there and when it was proposed to take over the land.  The Minister also said&mdash;I allow for the fact he was a little heated when he said it&mdash;I did not want the Forestry Division to take over land. If the Minister looked up the records he would find that on several occasions I have brought estates to the Forestry Division whenever I have been asked to do so.  There is some complicated machinery operating in the Department of Lands over the years whereby it is impossible to acquire forestry land within a reasonable period.  Working with all the expedition that the Minister's officials can command, it takes twelve months to take over land.  With regard to estates I have been asked to bring to the Forestry Division, not <Col N="1444" /> one of them was taken over within twelve months.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty of the Forestry Division in acquiring land. It is their policy to plant 25,000 acres a year.  If there are 8,000 acres of land on offer in Wexford it is a fair assumption that there are thousands of acres on offer in other counties.  Is there no means by which the Minister and his Department can expedite the taking over of land?  I have a case in mind&mdash;it did not arise during his tenure of office so that he need not become angry as he is inclined to do when any criticism is offered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte offered the Courtown Estate in Wexford to the Forestry Division.  It took eight years for them to take it over.  People who were waiting for a job had to emigrate because of the delay which was due to some legal quibble over a few houses on the estate.  That is an exceptional case but the fact that one estate like that could cause such trouble indicates that there is something seriously wrong with the system being operated. It is an antiquated system which up to now nobody has been able to break.  I submit the Minister can break it if he accepts what I say.  If he sends for the file on the Courtown Estate he will appreciate my complaint about the unnecessary delay which occurs.  Although that may be an exceptional case, I do not know any instance where the Forestry Division has ever taken over an estate, freely offered by the farmer, under twelve months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his officials may think I am speaking here merely for the purpose of lambasting them.  My sole desire is to promote employment and I agree with what Deputy Corish said.  Continuity of employment is essential if we are to avoid emigration. People have given up in despair waiting for estates to be taken over.  It should not be impossible to evolve a new system for the more expeditious transfer of land.  There was at one <Col N="1445" /> time&mdash;I do not know if it still exists in the Department&mdash;the idea that land could not be taken over if it was not near what was known as a forestry centre.  I do not think that applies in modern conditions.  It probably did apply 30 or 40 years ago when we had not available the transport we have to-day.  The assumption is that every forester has a motor car.  I think that is a safe assumption. Surely it should be possible to take over 20 or 30 acres of land eight or ten miles from a forestry centre and have it supervised by the forestry officer using his motor car to travel backwards and forwards?</P>
    <P>These are some suggestions I make in relation to forestry.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will deal with the question of delay in the taking over of land and say whether or not it is the policy of the Forestry Division to go on acquiring land and hold it in perpetuity for itself.  Or is it the intention to encourage private enterprise and local development on the lines of the policy adopted in every other country in which I have had an opportunity of studying forestry schemes?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I appeal to the Minister to take my criticism in the spirit in which it is offered.  There are certain suggestions I should like to make.  The Minister is a member of the legal profession. That is a good qualification in a Minister for Lands.  One of the matters which has been a source of complaint both in the House and outside it is the legal delays.  I am convinced that the Minister is just as anxious to make a success of his Department as any former Minister was.  Indeed, he may try to better what his predecessors have done.  I deplore the Minister attacking his predecessors just as much as I deplore the Minister's predecessors attacking him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that lands have been offered in various parts of my county for afforestation purposes.  I have asked several Parliamentary questions about these lands.  I have always got the same reply.  The lands are scattered; the lands are not of an acreage which <Col N="1446" /> would make acquisition attractive. Lands have been offered to the Minister in the neighbourhood of Cheekpoint. I hope they will be taken over, if they have not already been taken over.</P>
    <P>In every county there are lands which farmers would be prepared to sell at the price the Minister's Department would be prepared to pay.  If they are not prepared to sell at that price, there is no need for the Minister's officials to waste any time on them.  I suggest the Minister should initiate a drive to take over the lands offered as speedily as possible.  I suggest he does that county by county.  I further suggest he send his officials into the county, advertising their advent in the local Press and inviting those who wish to sell lands to furnish all the particulars. Having the officials resident in the area for a certain period is bound to have more beneficial results than fleeting inspections.  There is a tendency, if land is sold to the Minister's Department, for neighbouring farmers to ask for shocking prices for their lands.  There is a way of dealing with these.  They can be offered a reasonable price and, if they do not accept it, they can be told their lands will not be bought for a period of years.  In the interim they will be hollering after their local Deputies to appeal to the Minister on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish is evidently jealous of some of the Wexford land that is being planted.  I want to encroach a little on Deputy Corish's and Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde's bailiwick. Great heights surround the estuary of the Suir.  Where the heights have been planted the effect is magnificent, but unfortunately there are several very bare patches.  If these were planted&mdash; the wastelands in Cheekpoint and around Minawn, which is a very famous hill on the Waterford side, and on the Wexford side&mdash;the scheme would be truly magnificent from a scenic point of view alone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick referred to the enormous output from our forests in the years to come.  He suggested the Minister should make preparation now for absorbing this output.  In loyalty to my own constituency, I suggest a great deal of this timber could be <Col N="1447" /> turned into chipboard.  The Minister mentioned the chipboard factory of Scariff and said that the factory gets its supplies from the local forests.  That is excellent, but we should also consider the case for this second chipboard factory in Waterford.  There are many forests in Waterford, Tipperary, Kilkenny and Wexford.  Many of them <Col N="1448" /> are approaching thinning.  It would be an excellent idea to have a chipboard factory which would absorb these thinnings.</P>

      <P>Two small industries came to the notice of my Department as having commenced production in Limerick City during the three years ended 31st March, 1960.  As there are only two private firms involved, it would not be open to me to give the employment figure.</P>
