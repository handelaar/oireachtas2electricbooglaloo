    <Title>Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Bill, 1960&mdash;from the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
      <P>In line 11, &ldquo;pigs, poultry&rdquo; inserted before &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would elaborate a little on this.  In the original Bill he defined livestock as cattle, sheep and horses.  I think it is perfectly reasonable to provide, in the event of a dog showing a tendency to chase any of these categories of livestock, that the provisions of the Bill should apply.  I am not familiar with the problem of dogs chasing pigs. It is a problem with which, in my experience on a small farm, I have <Col N="1048" /> never had much trouble but I have seen dogs from time to time chase poultry.  It is not, as far as I know, a common problem and I wonder is the Minister well advised to invoke all the provisions of this Bill in the case of a dog momentarily chasing poultry?</P>
      <P>We all know that, once a dog becomes a sheep chaser, he becomes a public menace.  Unless rigorous measures are taken to control the dog he will go out at night, seek out sheep and do very serious damage, both from the point of view of the cruelty inflicted on the sheep and livestock and from the point of view of the economic loss as a result of chasing sheep.  Therefore, it is right and proper that we should take the statutory precautions envisaged in this Bill for the prevention of a recurrence of these events but is it seriously suggested that all the sanctions envisaged in this Bill should be available to anybody, because the other two amendments now extend the powers to invoke these sections not only to the owners of livestock and occupiers of land but to anybody who sees the thing happen? Does the Minister really think that if a dog momentarily chases a hen any passer-by should be entitled to seize the dog and deliver it to a member of the Garda Síochána at the nearest Garda Station whereupon the provisions of Sections 3 and 9 of the Dogs Act, 1906, shall apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that this Bill should function effectively and to function effectively it should have the good will of all reasonable citizens.  I know that to the dog lovers the provisions of the Bill, as it was originally drafted, caused some concern but I am here to defend the terms of the Bill, as originally drafted, on the grounds that a really serious problem existed which it was desired to control.  I find it hard to justify a proposal that somebody's dog may be collected from him, carted off to the pound and made subject to all the provisions of Section 3 of the Dogs Act, 1906, if while out walking it momentarily chases a hen.  I am not at all sure that we are not enacting a Statute which provides that if some reasonable citizen is out walking his dog <Col N="1049" /> and the dog chases a hen, any passer-by can pick up the dog, take it away from the owner and bring it to the Garda station, and if the owner intervenes and seeks to prevent his doing so he makes himself liable to penalties under this Bill.  Does the Minister really think that is consistent with the real purpose of the Bill as introduced?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I have my own doubts and misgivings about the need for or the wisdom of some of these three amendments but at the same time they were fairly actively discussed in the Seanad and I saw something in favour of all three of them, even if I have those doubts in my mind at the same time.  Now in the case of the first amendment to Section 1, the inclusion of pigs and poultry, I admit I have never had a complaint myself and I have never heard of dogs attacking pigs.  I have known of dogs sometimes in a half-friendly way attacking poultry.  We are all aware that these more or less domestic stock are usually not too far from the yard and that in the main they are housed at night, so that the urgency of including them did not make a strong case to my thinking.  As I say, I was pressed to accept the amendment and I felt there were circumstances, especially in the case of poultry, in which a dog could do damage, apart altogether from the damage that is sometimes done by one's own dog to one's own poultry, and I did not have any great fears in agreeing to the inclusion of pigs and poultry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the amendment to Section 3, which in a fairly substantial way extends the scope of the powers in that section in the sense that any person who finds a dog doing harm can seize the dog, as I said in the Seanad, and say here, I do not regard that section as a very practical instrument anyhow.  The chance of a person guarding stock or the owner of stock being able to seize a dog while he is engaged, or after he had taken part, in some of these depredations is remote.  I did mention in the Seanad that my only fear about this was that an innocent dog could be <Col N="1050" /> seized in a kind of jocose way although the animal might not have been causing trouble at all.  It provided a certain opportunity to play a trick on one's neighbour by taking a dog, which might be a perfectly harmless animal, bringing it to the Garda station and saying that at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning it was seen attempting some depredations on a neighbour's stock.  At the same time the idea of restricting the right to seize to the owner of the land or the stock seems to be hard to defend.  There must be many occasions on which people coming home, neighbours and people in all walks of life, might find a dog attacking sheep.  Who would know who owned the sheep?  They would have the good intention of relieving the sheep&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but I was talking only about amendment No. 1, relating to poultry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going over the three amendments because I thought the Deputy was referring to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not intend to refer to the three amendments.  Is each of these amendments being considered in Committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring only to the first amendment which extended the scope to poultry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt that the Deputy was taking the three amendments. Anyhow, I shall finish with the others and the Deputy can make his observations on them.  I felt that it was not unreasonable, when I was pressed by members of the Seanad who had experience at least as good as my own, to accept the amendment which provides for widening the scope of the section and giving to any individual who found a dog doing depredation to stock of any kind, freedom if he <Col N="1051" /> could do so to seize that animal and to do with him as the section provides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to dissent from the proposition that there is no serious objection to extending the scope of the Bill to include the casual passer-by if you are dealing exclusively with the worrying of cattle, sheep or horses by a dog.  I agree with the Minister that the probability of a passer-by ever coming upon a dog engaged in the worrying of sheep, horses or cattle and being able to lay hands on it is remote but I do not think that reasonable people would object to a public-spirited passer-by picking up a dog which was engaged in activities of that kind.  Every one of us knows that one of the great evils of the worrying of livestock by dogs at night is that it is done in silence.  Ordinarily, the owner, the shepherd or whoever is looking after the livestock, gets no notice unless he is actually keeping vigil, and he might go out in the morning and find this slaughter done.</P>
      <P>A dog may run into a farmyard and what dog has ever gone into a farmyard that did not chase the hens?  We all know that 90 per cent. of the people are reasonable, and will not seize a dog and take it off to the nearest Garda barracks because it chased a hen.  As the Minister himself said, there is usually a loud clear indication that they are being chased.  I have never heard of a dog making its way into a poultry house.  Certainly a fox, a rat or a badger will, but I have never heard of a dog doing so.  If a dog goes into a yard and chases poultry even if no one is about the yard, the owner will hear it and quickly come out and chase the dog away and rarely is there time for serious damage to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see this Bill generally accepted as a reasonable law, but I think we are inserting something into it here which could enable mischievous people to bring the whole scheme of the Bill into disrepute.  The farmers ought to have the protection envisaged in the Bill for their sheep, cattle and horses, but I am afraid, if we extend it to cover poultry, the Bill would give <Col N="1052" /> good grounds for a number of reasonable people to say it is carrying things to fantastic extremes and giving mischievous people who want to make trouble amongst neighbours, statutory grounds to do so.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that living in rural Ireland as we do, we know there are mischievous people in existence. Suppose someone is walking his dog and it chases a hen, this mischievous person can say: &ldquo;Under the new Act, I will pick up the dog and take it to the nearest Garda barracks and if you interfere, you are breaking the law.&rdquo; That is calculated (1) to give rise to trouble and (2) to cause a lot of people who are prepared to defend this remedial legislation to say that it is carrying things altogether too far and doing far more than the legitimate rights of farmers call for.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should be prepared to take poultry at least out of the amendment.  I do not think any problem such as I envisage arises in respect of pigs.  I believe that is just codology.  I have never seen a dog chase a pig in my life.  If the Minister drops &ldquo;poultry&rdquo;, then I think we are back on sound ground because we should not give every person in the State the right to arrest any dog that chases a hen anywhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I did confess to being disappointed when I saw the Bill that came from the draftsman, and I expressed my disappointment to my own officials and to the members of the House that it did not seem to be the sort of instrument I thought it would have been.  In that frame of mind, when I heard the discussion that took place on these amendments in the Seanad, as I said, I was not in any way enthusiastic about some of them, but they did appear to widen the scope of the Bill as it stood and bring it nearer to satisfying me in the sense that if I were to err at all on the side of giving freedom, it was my intention to err in favour of the owner of the stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point being made by Deputy Dillon as to what might happen in regard to poultry, if he looks at Section 2 of the Bill, he will <Col N="1053" /> see that if he or any other person is out walking his dog, and if the dog should behave in the fashion he describes, there would be no question of the seizure of the dog, because it is, to a limited extent, under control, and if it could be shown that reasonable care was being exercised by the owner, that would be the end of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister look at Section 4?  So far as I know, under Section 4, anyone could shoot the dog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not apply. Section 2 is the section which will cover the case the Deputy has cited. As I say, I opposed these three amendments in the Seanad, not in the sense of having my mind made up that I was going to resist them, but in order to hear from the members of that House who were interested in this matter, the best case they could make. They succeeded in tilting my mind in favour of this amendment.  As we are coming to the other amendments also, I think it is better that we should err, if we are to err at all, in making the measure as effective an instrument as possible without going too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I direct the Minister's attention to Section 4?  In the event of amendment No. 1 being carried Section 4 will then effectively read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In an action for damages for the shooting of a dog, it shall be a good defence if the defendant proves:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)that the dog was shot when worrying hens on agricultural land,</P>
      <P>(b)that the hens were lawfully on the land,</P>
      <P>(c)that the defendant was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)the occupier of the land, a member of his family or a person employed by him, or</P>
      <P>(ii)the owner of the livestock, a member of his family or a person employed by him,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> (d)that the defendant notified the shooting within forty-eight hours to a member of the Garda Síochána at the nearest Garda Síochána station.</P>
    <P>I am not making the case that the body of reasonable people in rural Ireland would shoot a neighbour's dog because he chases hens, but we all know rural Ireland, and we all know that there is sometimes ill-will between people.  If there is a little spite or misunderstanding between two persons, if one person is walking his dog and the dog chases a few hens in his neighbour's yard, his neighbour may go out and shoot the dog, go to the nearest Garda Síochána station and notify it there within forty-eight hours.  Is there anyone in this House who feels that is a reasonable sanction for a reasonable man to invoke against a dog which, after all, may be very precious to the owner?</P>
    <P>The Minister may think I am making an undue fuss about this.  I do not think I am.  I have lived a long time in rural Ireland and I know how family feuds are started.  We have all heard of family feuds which were started in rural Ireland by the trespass of one hen.  That can happen, too.  The shooting of your dog is a most fertile source from which the most bitter personal animosities can arise.  I am prepared to say that where a neighbour's dog is allowed to rove by night and injure sheep, cattle or horses, most reasonable people will feel it is not an excessive sanction to invoke against such dog that he should be shot, if there is no other means of restraining him, but I think most reasonable people in rural Ireland will say it is just not right that any man should have the right to shoot a neighbour's dog because he chased hens.</P>
    <P>I think it makes this legislation ridiculous to include such a provision in it.  I want this legislation to be accepted. I want to be able to defend it to all sections of the community as necessary and proper legislation.  I cannot defend it as proper legislation and I do not think it is right to provide that a neighbour has a right to shoot his neighbour's dog if it chases a hen.  I <Col N="1055" /> do not believe any Deputy believes that is right.</P>
    <P>Some of us here may entertain a deep affection for dogs and some of us may be relatively indifferent to them, but there is no use closing our eyes to the fact that there are a great many of our neighbours who feel most deeply and passionately on the subject of their dogs and their cats.  That may seem excessive and unreasonable to many of us but such people have a right to their feelings.  I do not think the Minister ever meant to legislate to provide that somebody's dog, which is very precious to him, can be lawfully shot in his presence because it chases a hen. That is what this Bill will provide.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister inadvertently suffered this amendment to be pressed upon him by Senator Cole.  I suggest that he ought to delete &ldquo;poultry.&rdquo; There is no desperate urgency about this Bill.  If it passes within a reasonable time, it will achieve its purpose. This Bill applies at all times in so far as it applies to sheep and livestock. The Spring months are the most dangerous in regard to the chasing of sheep.  A delay of a week or a fortnight will not make any difference.  The Minister ought to delete the word &ldquo;poultry&rdquo; because I think he is making the Bill unacceptable to a very large body of reasonable people by the inclusion of the provision in regard to fowl, whereas it ought to be a Bill which will command the consent and approval of all reasonable people with any understanding of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever I might do about eliminating pigs, I cannot see the point in dropping the word &ldquo;poultry&rdquo;.  I do not agree with the Deputy at all that dogs have not been known to do extensive harm to poultry.  I have no prejudice at all against dogs.  I like them.  I do not think it is any harm at all to provide in this Bill that people should be careful about them if they like their dogs and their animals.  There is no point in allowing them to take them out on the loose if they are suspicious that they are likely to do injury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case the Deputy has cited is met by Section 2 and not by Section 4. <Col N="1056" /> If the dog is taken out by its owner and if in the course of the journey the dog should do damage to the stock of his neighbour, there are certain things provided for which can happen to the dog, but if an effort should be made to seize or otherwise while the dog is in the charge of the owner, it is provided in subsection (2):</P>
    <P>It shall be a good defence in a prosecution for an offence under this section if the defendant proves that reasonable care was taken to prevent the worrying of the livestock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister look at Section 4?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 is not the section applicable in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is applicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection which I have read out&mdash;subsection (2)&mdash;is the one which covers the case cited by the Deputy where a dog is in the owner's charge and, while in his charge, does damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister look at Section 4?  Does that not give a good defence for the shooting of a dog?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It deals with a dog on the loose.  I have none of the fears to which the Deputy referred in this case. I believe it is time the law was tightened so as to ensure that those who have dogs and think a good deal about them, whether they are taking them out for a walk or otherwise, will take care.  If they do not take care, it is they who will have to take the risk and not the people who have to live by and from farm animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly certain that the Bill, as it stands, provides that if a man shoots a dog for chasing a hen and the owner of the dog takes an action for damages against him, it is a good defence if the defendant proves that the dog was shot when chasing a hen on agricultural land; that the hen was lawfully on the land; that the defendant was the <Col N="1057" /> occupier of the land, a member of his family or a person employed by him.</P>
      <P>I do not think that anybody in Dáil Éireann would agree that it ought to be a good defence to say that the dog chased a hen.  I do not think we ought so to legislate.  I do not believe the Minister thinks we ought so to legislate.  I do not believe the Minister ever meant to accept this amendment. If it was trivial, I would not care.  I am not interested in pigs.  I do not believe it will ever arise in the case of pigs.  I have lived long enough in the country to know that it can apply in the case of hens.</P>
      <P>The thing I apprehend is that you can start a family feud in rural Ireland by a case of this kind which would go on for a generation.  What I am afraid of is that this legislation, which ought to command the support of everybody, will not command it if it contains a provision of that kind. It ought to be dropped and the sanctions and provisions of the Bill confined to dogs which worry sheep, cattle or horses.  That is sensible.  The proposal that you can shoot a neighbour's dog if it chases a hen is insensible and unjust.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 3, paragraph (a) deleted.</P>
      <P>I have already explained that this amendment is designed to extend the right to seize to any person who finds a dog doing depredation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, the likelihood of a person catching a dog in the middle of such operations is so remote that it does not matter a fiddle-de-dee whether or not this amendment is inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fairly tough proposition for the person who has the job of seizing him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If he can run as fast as <Col N="1058" /> the dog, I suppose he is entitled to the statutory right to do so.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 3, line 7, &ldquo;such occupier or owner&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;the finder&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>On Second Reading, I mentioned that I did not like the idea that where the owner of the livestock knew the owner of the dog that had done the damage, he should be obliged to warn such owner before taking drastic action against the animal.  I saw several objections to that.  One was that he would never admit that he knew the dog, even if he did, because if he felt he was endangering himself, he could say: &ldquo;I did not know the dog was my neighbour's dog.  I just saw him attacking sheep and I killed him.&rdquo;  I consider that that should be deleted.</P>
      <P>This amendment was moved in the Seanad.  It did not go as far as the removal of the subsection but it met my point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The removal of this subsection constitutes a pretty substantial widening of the Bill.  If the Bill were restricted to sheep, horses and cattle, I would not be prepared to dissent from the arguments now adduced by the Minister.  The provision was in relation to the plea that when the dog was shot it was not known to the defendant. As the Minister says, in many cases the defendant would say: &ldquo;Maybe I ought to have known the dog but I did not.&rdquo;  It would be hard to prove that he did not but it would be possible to prove that he did.  It would be some protection for the owner's dog.  It may be that the owner of the dog had been warned by or on behalf of the defendant&mdash;and that is taken from the common law.  The common law, as laid down by judicial decision, is that if a dog attacks you, the fact that the owner had been warned that the dog has done that before transfers the onus of proof on to the owner of the dog. That principle is carried over to this Bill.  I think probably the Bill was better with paragraph (d) in it but if <Col N="1059" /> the Minister presses for the elimination of paragraph (d) for cattle, sheep and horses I would not argue against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Paragraph (d) deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it to the Minister that, if the Bill applied exclusively to cattle, sheep and pigs, I would not demur at the deletion of the paragraph, although I think it is going to the very limit to which we ought to go.  If the person who shot a dog wanted to defend himself against an action for damages he could plead that the owner of the dog, when the dog was shot, was not known to the defendant.  The Minister has pointed out the difficulty of proving that the defendant knew who owned the dog. In many cases in rural Ireland, one could prove to the satisfaction of the court that if a neighbour was passing every day with his dog at his heel, the man living next door to him knew the appearance of his dog and knew whose dog it was.  Secondly, he could plead that the owner of the dog had been warned before that his dog worried sheep, cattle and horses.  I say that if this Bill applied to sheep, cattle or <Col N="1060" /> horses, I would not be prepared to dissent from the proposal to delete paragraph (d) but this now means that if a man is walking down the road with a dog which he may have spent years training and it chases a hen inside his neighbour's ditch, either in the field or in the yard, that neighbour can take out his gun and shoot the dog at this owner's feet and, by statute of this House, is declared entitled to shoot the dog at his owner's feet.</P>
      <P>Nominally, this Bill exonerates the person who shoots the dog from an action for damages.  Does anybody believe that if a man is encouraged to do that by statute of this House, the owner of the dog will step back on the road and say: &ldquo;I will consult my solicitor&rdquo;?  He will do nothing of the kind.  There will be a row. There will be bad feeling.  God knows what will flow from such an incident. I do not believe there is a single Deputy here from rural Ireland who believes that any man ought to have the right to shoot his neighbour's dog because it chased a hen.</P>
      <P>Similarly I believe there is not a single Deputy who knows and understands rural Ireland who does not agree that if a neighbour's dog chases sheep the owner of the sheep ought to be entitled to shoot the dog if there is no other means of preventing it from chasing the sheep.  This amendment in regard to poultry has been put in quite casually by the Minister at the instance of a Senator in the other House.  It has not been fully considered.  The implications of it have not been studied.  To most people who have not lived in rural Ireland it has no serious significance at all, but I suggest that those of us who do live in rural Ireland and know something about it realise that the introduction of the word &ldquo;poultry&rdquo; will turn the Bill into something which has in it many inherent dangers.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the Bill unanimously passed, as it had been in its original form, but the inclusion of poultry introduces a flaw into the legislation which deprives it of the unanimous support that it enjoyed in its original form.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in our thinking that if power is given to a <Col N="1062" /> man to use a weapon in certain circumstances the result is more unjust than if he steals out and throws poison at the back of ditches and kills everything that picks it up.  I am not one bit sensitive about this.  I feel that in a case like this there is often far too much soft talk and, as a result of soft talk, you get an instrument that is completely ineffective which can be tossed about in court from month to month, and year to year.  When that happens everybody says that the law does not give him any protection, that people can have dogs and allow them to roam the country, and when that continues dogs can get into packs and travel out through the country from towns and villages to wreak destruction all over the place.  I certainly would not encourage anybody to destroy a dog in any sort of callous way but my pity and sympathy go entirely to those who have other interests and more important concerns.</P>
      <P>These amendments were discussed in the Seanad by a number of Senators who had at least as much experience of this whole subject, and as much knowledge of rural Ireland and its problems as I, or indeed anyone in this House.  As I said, I resisted them not because I did not see some purpose in them but because I wanted to find the best case that could be made for them.  I came away from the Seanad with the belief that the Bill requires to be changed and that these amendments would go a certain distance to effect that change.  For these reasons I have no hesitancy at all in recommending them to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this perfectly clear.  There is a net point joined in issue here.  This Bill, with amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4, is not objectionable to us if it applies to cattle, sheep and horses.  The sole reservation that I am concerned to make to-day is that I do not think it reasonable to give a man the right to shoot his neighbour's dog without notice because it chased a hen.  I believe that is a mistake.  It will make the enforcement of the Act more difficult and I apprehend it will give rise to bitter ill-feeling if it is availed of by anybody in rural Ireland to shoot <Col N="1063" /> a neighbour's dog because it chased a hen.</P>

Bhí mé ag caint freisin faoi chúrsaí tithe gloine agus tá mé cinnte go bhfuil an t-am tagtha iad a réiteach ionas nach mbeidh an mhoill atá ann faoi láthair ina dtaobh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí mé ag déanamh tagairt freisin do dheontais deasú tithe.  Is é an rud a tharlaíonn i nGaillimh nuair a chuireann duine foirm chuig an gComhairle Contae go dtagann cigire amach chun scrúdú a dhéanamh. Ansin cuireann an cigire scéal chuig an Roinn agus bíonn sé ag fanacht tamall fada go dtí go bhfaigheann sé scéal ar ais ón Roinn i láthair na huaire.  Níl sé seachtain ó shoin ó bhí mé thall in oifigí Chomhairle Chontae na nGaillimhe ag iarraidh tuairisc a fháil faoí rudaí mar sin.  An tuairisc a fuaireas uathu, nach bhfuaradar aon scéal faoi dheisiú na dtithe le cúig bliana anuas.  Níl an milleán ar an gcomhairle contae. I gcás an rialtais aitiúil níl moill ar <Col N="1064" /> bith.  Tugtar meastachán ar an spota. Tá mé ag ceapadh go mbeadh ar Roinn na Gaeltachta an rud céanna a dhéanamh.

    <P>Tamall gearr ó shin bhí me ag iarraidh tuairisc a fháil ón Aire Tailte faoi shoilse treorach i gCuan Chill Éanna agus an freagra a fuair me ón Aire sin gur bhain an ní sin le hAire na Gaeltachta.  Tá an rud seo á phlé le scaitheamh maith.  Ba mhaith liom go dtabharfadh an tAire freagra cathain a mbeidh sé réitithe.  Tá go leor daoine i nÁrainn a théann le hiascaireacht.  Níl aon ché acu le bád a thabhairt isteach.</P>
    <P>Chuala mé clamhsán faoi thithe gloine.  I gcás éigin tháinig cigire ón Roinn agus cheap sé amach áit le teach gloine a chur suas.  Bhí gach uile shórt socraithe.  Cúpla lá nó seachtain sul a rabhadar ag dul á thógáil tháinig fear&mdash;níl fhios agam arbh é an fear céanna é nó fear eile&mdash; agus dúirt sé nach raibh an áit oiriúnach le teach a thógáil ann.  Bhí an fear sin ag clamhsán go raibh sé seachtaine ag réiteach na háite agus nuair bhí sé réidh go ndúradh leis nach raibh an áit oiriúnach.  Níl fhios agam ainm an fhir seo fá lathair ach gheofaidh mé an t-ainm agus bhéarfidh mé don Aire é agus b'fhéidir go scrúdódh sé an cás.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an Teachta Mac Loingsigh ag cur fáilte ar ais go dtí an Roinn roimh an Aire.  Níl mórán agam le rá ar an Meastachán&mdash;cúpla focal ar fad.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few brief observations on the Estimate.  I may be critical at times but I believe that by trial and error the Minister may arrive at a certain degree of success in dealing with this important Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing the Department of the Gaeltacht set out to do is to preserve the Irish language.  To preserve the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, you must preserve the Irish-speakers there. In that respect, there is some poor <Col N="1065" /> reading in the Minister's statement.  It says:</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, there has been a general reduction in the rural population and because of this there is a corresponding drop in the number of children in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>There lies a hint as to the future of the Irish language.  There is more Irish spoken in Coventry and Birmingham than there is in any part of the Gaeltacht.  I have said that before. The only way to improve the position is to improve the standard of living in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked a question as to the wages paid to girls in some Gaeltarra Éireann factories.  I was informed that the wages went as low as 25/- a week.  If we heard that some of the Jew boys of the back rooms of Dublin paid such wages, we would be up in arms.  The Department of the Gaeltacht close their eyes to that.  Is that any incentive to children to remain in the Gaeltacht?  The only thing it might do is to keep them there while they are earning their passage to England.</P>
    <P>In the past I have raised the question of safeguarding the little home industries on the Aran islands.  I referred to the Aran crios and the Aran gansey.  The Department should interest themselves in this matter.  The back-room workshops in Dublin are cashing in on this and have been doing so for years, making a nice penny out of it.  I suggest that the Department should supply looms to the Aran islanders to help them meet the demand.  Further, they should supply official tabs to be attached to the products of the Gaeltacht, especially to those of the Aran islands, as proof of origin.  I do not see why we should have these imitations.</P>
    <P>I have seen them actually in the Show in Dublin where they were supposed to represent Aran islanders' traditional dress.  It is a great shame that people should cash in on that and even do it at the Show in Dublin. From a cultural point of view, I should like to see the Department encourage the islanders to continue to <Col N="1066" /> wear the traditional dress.  The islanders, we can see, are inclined to adopt the habits of the mainland and lose most of their characteristics which have been admired by people coming from abroad to visit there.</P>
    <P>I should like the Department to direct attention to the need for slipways between the different islands under the heading of minor marine works.  It is very hard at times when you find a currach torn to pieces by the rocks and, during rough weather, they must manoeuvre in such a way that it is difficult to avoid damage. There is great need for these slipways and I think the Department should note it.</P>
    <P>I understand that funds are available whereby roads in Aran could be improved.  I should not like the money required to be taken from the normal Board of Works grant&mdash;why not let it be an additional grant? Possibly, the work could be done through the Board of Works.  There is great need to improve the roads in the Aran area.</P>
    <P>Certain moneys are allocated for amenity schemes, bathing pools and so on, and, while I do not want to be taken as being against amenities, I believe first things should come first. There is a great need to raise the standard of living by providing industries and while I know the Minister has the matter just as much at heart as I have, I suggest that he should note the need for further development of home industries, which are very important.</P>
    <P>I should not like to let the occasion pass without commenting favourably on the products of Gaeltarra Éireann. These have drawn favourable comment from visitors to the country and the toy industry is second to none.  I should also like to express appreciation of the work done by Gael-Linn and I hope they will get more co-operation from the Department in future.  Gael-Linn has done some wonderful things and if there is more co-operation, for which I think the will is there, we shall achieve something worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I find it amazing that families who for years have been getting the £5 <Col N="1067" /> school grant have been refused the grant when the younger children come to apply.  They are told that Irish is not the spoken language of the home. It is unfair that examiners should come from different parts of the country, Cork, Kerry or Donegal.  That has an effect on small children and it is unfair that children should be debarred from qualifying on these grounds.  The child who speaks Irish fluently and comes from a home where Irish is not the spoken language should qualify if we are to encourage the Irish language and I suggest that the Minister should do something to extend the scheme in that direction.</P>

Má tá an talamh ann, is dócha go bhfuil gá leis sa Ghaeltacht. Pé ar domhan é, is dóigh liom gur cóir gach rud is féidir linn chun an Ghaeltacht a choimeád beo a <Col N="1068" /> dhéanamh agus pé mhéid airid a chaitear ann, ní caiteachas in aisce é.

An príomh-ábhar clamhsáin a bhí ag duine amháin&mdash;nílim á shéanadh go bhfuil bunús leis an gclamhsán&mdash;bhain sé le cuntas trádála Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Dob é sin an rud ba mhó a luadh aréir ag an Teachta Mac Loingsigh.  Deirim an méid seo leis agus le Bord Ghaeltarra Éireann freisin: níl mise sásta le toradh an Bhoird ach ní hé sin le rá nach gceapaim go bhfuil sé i ndán don Bhord sin an scéal a leigheas.  Tuigim go rí-mhaith nuair a thagann bord nua isteach agus nuair a thagann foireann as an nua ar fad isteach agus go nglantar amach na seandaoine a bhí cleachta ar an obair, go mbíonn cúlú, agus má bhí cúlú ins an chás seo sin í an chúis atá leis.  Chuile sheans go dtabharfadh sé sin ar an Teachta fiafraí: Tuige a ndearnadh amhlaidh?  Tuige a ndearnadh an glanadh iomlán sin as Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta?  Is féidir a rá gur tugadh breithiúnas ar an gceist seo i bprionsabal ag an Rialtas a bhí ann cheana, mar dúirt an Teachta Mac Loingsigh aréir, agus glacadh leis an gcinneadh sin ag an Rialtas a tháinig isteach ina ndiaidh agus cuireadh bord neamhspleach ar bun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil cead ag Aire na Gaeltachta dul chuig an mBord agus chuile thuairisc agus chuile eolas a thóraíocht <Col N="1069" /> orthu, ní dóigh liom gur maith an rud don Bhord an chumhacht sin a chur in úsáid an iomarca go mór-mhór ós rud é gur bord nua é.  Táimse thar a bheith cúramach i dtaobh dul ag tóraíocht an iomarca eolais róluath ar an mbord nua.  Tar éis an méid sin a bheith ráite agam, is é mo leithscéal do na Teachtaí a labhair nach bhfuil mé ag dul isteach go mion ar an ócáid seo i gcúiseanna na gclamhsán a rinneadar i dtaobh rudaí áirithe a bhaineas le Gaeltarra Éireann don bhliain 1958/59.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Teachta Mac Loingsigh ceist orm agus táim ag ceapadh go bhfuil teideal aige freagra a fháil uaim comh cruinn beacht agus is féidir liomsa sin a thabhairt: Tuige ar éirigh an chéad Chathaoirleach a bhí ar Bhord Ghaeltarra Éireann as an gCathaoirleacht?  Nuair a chuir sé litir chugam ag éirí as an bpost chuir mise an cheist cheanann céanna air agus dúirt sé liom: &ldquo;Níl mé sásta níos mó a rá leat mar Aire na Gaeltachta ná a chur in iúl duit go bhfuil mé ag éirí as an gcathaoirleacht agus caithfidh tú bheith sásta leis sin.&rdquo;  Mura bhfaigheann tú go hoifigiúil an fáth ar éirigh duine as a phost ní dóigh liom gur ceart do Aire Stáit chuile eolas a thabhairt atá aige den dara láimh.  Caithfidh mé a rá mar sin don Teachta Mac Loingsigh nach bhfuil an teolas sin agam.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé nílim ag dul isteach go mion i gcúrsaí Bhord Ghaeltarra Éireann ar an ócáid seo ach dúradh &mdash;agus táim á cheapadh go bhfuil dualgas orm tagairt a dhéanamh dó&mdash; gur fostaíodh an chuid is mó den fhoireann nua atá ag Bord Ghaeltarra Éireann as football club éigin anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Níl fhios agam an fíor nó bréag é sin ach ní hé sin an pointe.  Ní locht ar bith ar dhuine a bhfuil baint aige le football club post ar bith d'fháil, fiú amháin má tá sé ag iarraidh bheith ina Theachta Dála, ach sé an rud gur chóir dom tagairt a dhéanamh dó gur cuireadh i leith Rúnaí Roinn na Gaeltachta gurb eisean ba chiontach leis an scéal a bheith amhlaidh chomh fada agus a bhí sé amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Séanaim anois go hoifigiúil agus go <Col N="1070" /> húdarásach gur fíor é sin.  Ní raibh aon pháirt nó láimh ag Aire na Roinne ins na poist a líonadh ar an bhfoireann nua de Gaeltarra Éireann.  Má tá locht le fáil ar an bhfoireann nua sin is é an bord agallaimh a cheap Bord Ghaeltarra Éireann chuige sin atá ciontach.  Tá fhios agam cé hiad. Bhí ceathrar acu ann.  Is féidir liom a rá leis an Dáil nach raibh Rúnaí na Roinne ar dhuine acu.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, fágfaidh mé Gaeltarra Éireann ar an ócáid seo gan a thuilleadh a rá mar gheall air.  Is eol dom go bhfuil roinnt ceisteanna tábhachtacha ach níl mé sá eolasach ar cheann amháin acu chun freagra a thabhairt anois.  Tá sí roinnt bheag teicniúil:&mdash; Má laghdaítear méid an bhunábhair tús-bhliana agus má laghdaitear freisin an táirgeadh i rith na bliana conas is féidir, ag an am céanna, luach na dtoradh a bheith chomh mór ag deireadh na bliana sin agus a bhí sé cheana?</P>
    <P>Tagann freagra chun m'aigne ar an bpointe agus is é sin ardú pá.  Míniú ar chuid de is ea é sin ach nílim á tabhairt sin anois mar fhreagra ar an gceist.  Déanfaidh mé machtnamh ar an gceist sin.  Níor mhaith liom gan tagairt a dhéanamh dí ar eagla go gceapfadh an Teachta a chuir an cheist chugam go bhfuilim beag-beann air: níl.</P>
    <P>Do thagair gach Teachta a labhair so diospóireacht seo don deontas £5 do leanaí scoile atá ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht agus don laghdú atá air. Le blianta anuas is é an méid a bhí á íoc amach gach bliain ná £48,000 agus fágadh £51,000 sa Mheastachán&mdash; seans, is dócha, go raibh na hoifigí ag súil go mbeadh méadú ar bhealach éigin ar an gcaiteachas sin agus b'fhéidir gurb í sin cúis na leisce é a laghdú roimhe seo.</P>
    <P>I mbliana, tá an méid á laghdú againn anuas go dtí an méid a bhí á íoc gach blian le blianta beaga anuas agus sin é an chúis leis an laghdú.  Ní raibh aon laghdú thar an gcoiteann ar líon na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht thar mar a bhí le blianta anuas. Níl aon ghá le himní i dtaobh an laghdaithe sa Mheastachán.</P>
    <P>Dúradh freisin go bhfuil méadú sa <Col N="1071" /> soláthar le haghaidh deontas tithe agus nach comhartha é sin gur cóir go mbeadh méadú in uimhir na dtithe a soláthrófai.  Faoi mar a tháinig na hiarratais isteach tá chuile sheans ann go mbeidh méadú mór ar an méid airgid a bhéas le híoc amach i mbliana agus sa bhliain seo chugainn. Tógann sé dhá bhliain mar meántréimhse ón am a fhaightear iarratas go dtí go n-íoctar amach an deontas. Sin í an chúis go gceapaimid gur gá an méadú sa soláthar seo i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Maidir le teas ins na tithe gloine sílim nach bhfuil aon rud ag baint leis a chuirfidh ar mo chumas breis eolais a thabhairt don Dáil mar gheall air. Ceist nua í seo agus tá sé rud beag ró-luath mórán a rá mar gheall air faoi lathair.  Ar chuma ar bith tuigeann na Teachtaí an cuspóir atá romhainn ina dtaobh, is é sin, go mbeadh séasúr níos faide ag na daoine a bhfuil tithe gloine acu agus go mbeadh sé ar a gcumas sa gheimhreadh glasraí eile a fhás iontu chomh maith le trátaí sa samhradh.</P>
    <P>Maidir le scéim na muc, tugadh an méid seo cráin amach:&mdash;I nDún na Gall 15; i Maigh Eo 58; i nGaillimh 65; i gCiarraigh 61.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh an cheist chugam: cén fáth go mbíonn muir-oibreacha mar chúram ar Roinn na Gaeltachta nuair atá oibleagáid agus dualgas ar Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí an réamh-obair, agus go minic an obair féin, a dhéanamh ina dtaobh.  Más muir-obair í a bhaineas le hiascaireacht tagann an cheist faoi bhráid an Aire Iascaigh. Más muir-obair í a bhaineas le talmhaíocht&mdash;cuirim i gcás gaineamh a thabhairt i dtír nó feamainn&mdash;cuirtear an cheist faoi bhráid an Aire Talmhaíochta an fiú an méid airgid a mholtar a chaitheamh air.  Tá seans, scaiti, ann go dtiocfadh an cheist fé bhráid, fiú, an Aire Tionscail agus Tráchtála.  Pé ar bith é, pé seirbhís a mbaineann an obair léi cuirtear faoina bráid í.  Cuirtear an cheist ar an údarás sin más fiú é an tairiscint a chur chun cinn.  Má tá sé suite sa Ghaeltacht agus más rud é nach mbaineann an togra le haon cheann de na húdaráis seo fé leith, tagann Aire na Gaeltachta isteach agus tugann <Col N="1072" /> sé freagra mar gheall air.  Sin é an fáth go bhfuil baint agam anois is arís leis na hoibreacha mara seo.</P>
    <P>Dúradh i dtaobh Gaeltarra Éireann &mdash;agus cheap mé go raibh mé réidh leis&mdash;go raibh mé ag dul ar ais go &ldquo;civil service control&rdquo;.  Nuair a d'éirigh an Cathaoirleach as an gcathaoirleacht b'éigean domsa, ar ndóigh, dúine nua a cheapad gan mórán moille.  Tá sé deacair duine feiliúnach a fháil le haghaidh an phoist sin.  Dá bhrí sin, ní fhéadfainn an post a fhágáil folamh ar feadh i bhfad. Céard a rinne mé?  Bhí baint fhada ag Rúnaí Roinn na Gaeltachta le seirbhísí na Gaeltachta agus bhí sé ann nuair a tháinig an Bord nua isteach. Shíleas gurb eisean an duine ba fheiliunaí a d'fhéadfainn a fháil agus sin é an fáth gur chuireas isteach sa phost é go sealadach.</P>
    <P>Seo é mo fhreagra ar &ldquo;civil service hack&rdquo;:&mdash;níl san gCathaoirleach ach duine amháin.  Níl aige ach an t-aon vóta amháin.  Tá ceathrar eile ann agus ní Státseirbhísigh iad.  Níl aon chumhacht ag an duine amháin sín atá ina Státseirbhíseach cé go bhfuil sé ina Chathaoirleach ar an gceathrar eile.  Níl mise mar Aire ag iarraidh aon &ldquo;sleamhnú-as&rdquo; a dhéanamh maidir leis na dualgais atá leagtha orm faoin Acht um Thionscail na Gaeltachta le neamhspleachas a thabhairt do thionscail na Gaeltachta a bhí ann roimhe seo faoi stiúrú na Státseirbhíse.</P>
    <P>Ó rinne mé tagairt don scéal seo, ba mhaith liom anois tuairim phearsanta a nochtadh i dtaobh an ruda.  Dá mbeadh an chumhacht chéanna ag an sean-dream a bhí ann sular cuireadh an Bord seo ar siúl, tá mé ag ceapadh go ndéanfaidís níos fearr ná mar a rinneadar faoi &ldquo;cheangal&rdquo;.  Dá mbeadh oiread saoirse acu agus atá ag an mBord seo, ní dóigh liom go mbeadh na lochtaí a fritheadh orthu le caitheamh ina leith.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam ar fhág mé aon duine amach as mo chuid freagraí.  Ar aon chaoi, ba mhaith liom freagra a thabhairt ar an gclamhsán a rinneadh faoin mhoill i dtaobh freastal ar iarratais tithíochta san Iarthar.  Le tamall anuas táimid ag iarraidh cigire nua a fháil, ach táimid i muinín Choimisinéirí na Státseirbhíse chuige sin. <Col N="1073" /> Ceapadh duine cheana ach níor ghlac sé leis an bpost.  Táimid ag fanacht le scéala ó na Coimisinéirí agus béimid á bpriocadh go dtí go dtabharfaidh siad an cigire sin dúinn.  Nuair a gheobhaimid é tá chuile dhóchas agam nach mbeidh aon chlamhsán i dtaobh moill ar iarratais ón Iarthar.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do na scoláireachtaí agus na nithe a bhaineas le Gaeilge.  Sin é an t-aon fháth amháin go bhfuil Roinn na Gaeltachta ann.  Is é an bhrí atá le &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo; ná an teanga, ar ndóigh.  Mura mbeadh sé sin mar chuspóir againn, maille le gach a bhfuil ar siúl againn chun leas geilleagrach na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh, ní bheadh ach feall á dhéanamh againn.</P>
    <P>Mar dhuine amháin, leagaim an bhéim is mó ar an oideachas agus tá airgead ar fáil sa Mheastachán le na aghaidh.  Thug mé cúntas ar an chúnamh airgid is féidir leis an Roinn a thabhairt do dhaoine atá sásta meánscoileanna a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht.  Sin é an spreagadh cúnamh is tábhachtaí, dar liomsa, is feidir leis an Roinn seo a thabhairt don Ghaeltacht. Tá, cheana, meánscoileanna bunaithe sa Ghaeltacht, i nDún na nGall, i Maigh Eo, i nGaillimh, i gCiarraí, i gCorcaigh agus i Rinn ó gCuanach, i bPort Láirge.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh tagairt don imirce.  Nílim á rá gur féidir linn, de bhárr a bhfuil á dhéanamh agus a bhéas á dhéanamh againn amach anseo, muintir na Gaeltachto a choinneáil sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is é an cuspóir atá agamsa mar dhuine amháin, ar ndóigh, má caithfidh siad imeacht as an nGaeltacht agus má fhanann siad in Eirinn nó má théann siad go Sasana nó go Meiriceá go mbeidh siad i bhfad níos oilte le obair níos fearr, fostaíocht níos feiliúnaí a fháil sna tíortha sin ná mar atá siad cheal meán-scolaíochta. I ngeall air sin, is é mo thuairm go bhfuil ceist na meán-scolaíochta thar a bheith tábhachtach.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom i ngeall leis an gceist seo mo mheas ar chomh-oibriú an Aire Oideachais agus na Roinne Oideachais a chur in iúl.  Tá siad thar a bheith go maith nuair a iarraimid <Col N="1074" /> cúnamh orthu agus is iad, ar ndoigh, an t-údarás oideachais, agus ní muide. Tá muide i Roinn na Gaeltachta ag brath orthu chun cabhrú linn meánoideachas a fhorbairt san Fhíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Anois ba mhaith liom a rá le Teachtaí a cheapann go bhfuil faillí á déanamh ar áiteanna sa Ghaeltacht dul síos sa Leabharlann agus féachaint ar léarscáil na Gaeltachta.  Ní mise a tharraing amach í.  Mura bhfuil aon cheantar a bhfuil spéis acu ann, mura bhfuil sé taobh istigh de theorainn na Gaeltachta mar atá sin línithe ar an léarscáil sin, tá sé fánach acu teacht ag iarraidh cabhrach ormsa.</P>
    <P>Ar aon chaoi, beidh muid ag súil de bharr na suime sa bhreis atá sa Ghaeilge anois go mbeidh an Ghaeltacht féin á leathnú amach de réir a chéile agus níor cheart dom gan mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le dreamanna airithe.  Tá sé luaite ins an ráiteas a léigh mé amach aréir ach tá sé roinnt bheag foirmiúil.  Ba mhaith liom ó mo chroí amach mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na dreamanna agus leis na daoine atá ag caitheamh a ndúthracht agus a ndíchill ar an gceist seo agus a chur in iúl dóibh&mdash;leithéid Chumann Lúth-Chleas Gael, Comhaltas Uladh, Gael-Linn&mdash;tá seans na gcuimhním orthu ar fad.  Pér bith áit a bhfuil siad, ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl dóibh go bhfuil meas ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ag an Rialtas ar a ndúthracht.  Gan an dúthracht sin, is beag a d'féadfadh Rialtas nó Roinn Gaeltachta ar bith a dhéanamh ar mhaithe le sábháil agus le leathnú amach na Gaeilge.  Is orthu sin atá an cheist ag brath agus ba mhaith liom a rá leis na daoine sa Ghalltacht, ar ndóigh, gur orthu sin sa deireadh thiar atá sábháil na Gaeltachta ag brath.  Is minic a dúradh liomsa sa Ghaeltacht i gConamara faoin gceist seo nuair a deirinn leo gur chuala mé daoine ag clamhsán go raibh siad, muintir na Gaeltachta, faillíoch sa Ghaeltacht dá bhfeiceadh stróinséir postaer thuas i mBéarla nó ag cleachtadh na Béarlóireachta le páistí, go gceapfadh an stróinséir go raibh an Ghaeilge ag meath agus go raibh na daoine ag tabhairt droim láimhe leis an nGaeilge.  Ar an gcaint sin, freagraíonn <Col N="1075" /> muintir na Gaeltachta:&mdash;&ldquo;Abair le muintir na Galltachta go bhfuilimid sásta an Ghaeilge a choinneáil mar beo-theangain chomh fada is atá muide sásta san Ghaeltacht go bhfuil muintir na Galltachta dáiríre i dtaobh sábháil agus leathnú na Gaeilge; ach dá mbrúfaí isteach ar inntinn muintir na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil muintir na Galltachta ach ag mugadh magadh faoi cheist seo na Gaeilge, an lá san, tabharfaimid freisin, muintir na Gaeltachta, droimláimhe leis an nGaeilge faoi mar a thug siadsan roimhe seo.&rdquo; Cé thógfadh orthu é?  Tá siad suite sna háiteacha is iargcúlta agus is boichte agus, ar ndóigh, teastaíonn Béarla uathu agus is é dualgas atá orainn Béarla a mhúineadh go maith dóibh.</P>
    <P>Is féidir liomsa a rá go bhfuil Béarla á mhúineadh go maith, go héifeachtach agus go hinniúl do pháistí na Gaeltachta.  Chonaic mé le mo linnse mar Theachta Dála athrú mór amháin ar an scéal.  Nuair tháinig mise isteach i 1932 is beag duine ón nGaeltacht a bhí in ann litir mhaith a scríobh chugam i mBéarla nó i nGaeilge.  Is amhlaidh go bhféadaidís litir a scríobh i ndrochBhéarla mar ní raibh aon Ghaeilge ag a bhformhór agus iad ar scoil.  Ach anois má fhaigheann tú litir i mBéarla nó i nGaeilge is féidir bheith cinnte gur Béarla maith nó Gaeilge mhaith a bhéas inti.  Sin athrú mór ar oideachas na Gaeltachta le fiche bliain anuas. Tuigeann na daoine sa Ghaeltacht go bhfuil an córas oideachais atá ann feiliúnach dóibh, chomh fada agus a théann sé.</P>
    <P>Níl mise sásta gur ceart, as seo amach, iad a fhágáil taobh le bunoideachais amháin.  Tá chuile cheart acu atá ag muintir na mbailte móra meán-scolaíocht a bheith acu as seo amach.  Nach bhfuil sé le feiceáil anois, cuirim i gcás ins na grádanna ísle ins an Státseirbhís, go bhfuil meán-oideachas ag teastáil le dul isteach ansin?  Má tá cailín ag iarraidh dul isteach mar probationer in ospidéal caithfidh meán-scolaíocht a bheith aici. Ní fheicim anois aon fhostaíocht dena postanna siúd fágtha ag lucht bunscoile ach amháin an Garda Síochána. <Col N="1076" /> Más mar sin atá an scéal, caithfimid iad a oiliúint agus a ullmhú i gcóir an tsaoil atá ann.</P>
    <P>Sin é an fáth go ndúirt mé go bhfuil níos mó spéise agam sa cheist seo ná in aon cheist eile.  Dá fheabhas iad na scéimeanna eile&mdash;agus tá meas agam ar gach uile cheann de na scéimeanna tá luaite agam sa ráiteas seo&mdash; san am chéanna, chomh fada is atá na Gaeltachtaí is mó a bhfuil eolas agamsa orthu is gceist, ní bheidh tairbhe cheart uathu mura mbeidh dúshraith cheart oideachais faoina mbun.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh tagairt don chaillteanas i nGaeltarra Éireann, £82,000 a bhí mar chaillteanas ann i gcóir na bliana dar críoch an Márta seo caite.  Nílim sásta leis sin; b'fhéidir go fhuil mé abhfad níos míshásta ná mar atá an Teachta Mac Loingsigh, ach chuir mé ceist ar na hoifigigh, agus ar oifigigh na Roinne Leasa Shoisialaigh, faoin gceist seo.  Murach na tionscal go mbaineann an caillteanas £82,000 seo leis, bheadh idir £100,000 agus £130,000 á íoc amach ar chúnamh díomhaointis nó mar árachas, agus sin é an fáth is mó atá againn leis na tionscail seo a choinneáil ag imeacht, ar ais nó ar éigean.  Ní aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Cuagáin ina thaobh sin. Ní hamhlaidh atá an scéal mar a deir sé: luaigh sé an ráta is lú, £1 5s. 0d. sa tseachtain, ach níl ansin ach obair pháirt-aimsireach.  Níl aon duine atá lán-fhostaithe ag fáil suim chomh híseal sin.  Cibé scéal é nílim sásta leis an ráta.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a few questions?  While I appreciate very fully the Minister's difficulty in getting a full explanation of the trading account of Gaeltarra Éireann for the year 1958/59, I am grateful to him for his undertaking to reconsider the matter but I should like to know within what period of time he hopes to have an explanation so as to save a series of Parliamentary Questions and a possible motion to discuss the matter.  Secondly, within what period of time does he hope to have a fulltime, outside chairman of the board, because he will agree, I am sure, that the person who was managing director of this board which lost £40,000 in one year is thoroughly unsuitable and incompetent to be chairman of a board and to guide its destinies?</P>

      <P>I dtaobh na seallaí réamhdhéanta, táim ar aon intinn leis an Teachta Ó Cuagáin.  Dá ndéanfadh muintir na Gaeltachta na seallaí as na hábhair atá in aice láimhe b'amhlaidh ab fhearr, ach tá a fhios aige, ar nós gach duine eile sa tír go mbíonn fear na Gaeltachta ag iarraidh an ru a beith aige ar an gcaiteachas is lú, agus más féidir leis sealla réamhdhéanta a bheith aige ar níos lú caiteachas ná an ceann a dhéanfadh sé ar an gnáth nós, bheadh sé andeacair ag an Teachta Ó Cuagáin nó mé féin é a stopadh, ach is feidir a rá gurb é mo chlaonadh féin bheith ar aon intinn leis an Teachta.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an gceist a thóg an Teachta Ó Dioliún i dtaobh toradh na gcránach muice a chur ar an margadh, caithfidh mé a admháil nach raibh eolas agam ar aon scéal den sórt sin. Is cosúil, ar ndóigh, go mbeadh oifigigh de chuid na Roinne sásta cuidiú le muintir na Gaeltachta i dtaobh fadhb ar bith a bheadh ag baint le muca, nó le bainbh, nó le aon cheo eile, a réiteach.

Bheadh an cheist seo rud beag mór do Roinn na Gaeltachta, ag féachaint don bheag-líon daoine atá ag obair sa Roinn.  Is Roinn an-bheag í agus ní bheadh an fhoireann againn le scéim den tsórt sin a ghlacadh ar lámha.

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,287,740 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I should mention that the format of this Estimate has been generally revised since last year, with the approval of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It has been found possible to reduce the number of former subheads by half.  A key to the corresponding subheads is on page 170 in the current Estimates Volume. It is in the form of straightforward cross-references which seem to be self-explanatory. To facilitate comparisons within the current Estimate, the details for last year have been brought into line throughout with the new format.  I feel that Deputies will find this new format of the Lands Estimate generally satisfactory.</P>
      <P>As is customary, I propose to begin with an explanation of the important subheads.  I shall continue with a review in some detail of the activities of the Land Commission during the past financial year and I also intend to comment on some matters of general interest, which are appropriate to this important Vote.</P>

    <P>When last year's Supplementary Estimate of £32,000 has been taken into account, the net total of £2,231,940 for the current year shows an increase of £110,860 on the corresponding amount, namely, £2,121,080, voted last year, including the Supplementary Estimate.  This overall increase this year is attributable mainly to the substantial increases in four <Col N="1080" /> subheads&mdash;A, D, G and I, to each of which I shall now refer.</P>
    <P>Subhead A, in respect of Salaries, Wages and Allowances, shows an increase of £34,059 over last year's provision. This increase is almost entirely attributable to the general Civil Service salary award, effective from last December.  The reduction of 32 shown in authorised personnel is accounted for by the continuing progress towards completion of resale of tenanted land.</P>
    <P>Subhead D in the main represents the taxpayers' contribution in the current year towards the service of land purchase debt, accumulated on both tenanted and untenanted land, since 1923.  This year, that contribution totals £889,300&mdash;almost two-thirds of which relates to tenanted lands which were purchased from landlords between the years 1923 and 1931.  The moneys in the subhead are in the nature of statutory commitments.  They account for almost 40 per cent. of the whole Estimate.  The increase of £10,950 this year is almost entirely due to the halving of purchase instalments payable by new allottees.</P>
    <P>Item 1 of Subhead G, carries a substantial increase of £35,000 for cash purchases under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950.  This increase brings the provision up to £60,000 which is by far the largest sum to date provided for this purpose.  I am confident that the entire £60,000 will be spent this year.  Last year, approximately £40,000 was spent in purchasing 1,032 acres, mostly in the congested districts counties.  It is scarcely necessary to remind Deputies that, by the Land Act, 1950, these particular funds are confined to the purchase of lands required for migrants' holdings or to facilitate the re-arrangement of fragmented holdings.</P>
    <P>The second and smaller item in subhead G provides a repeat of last year's figure of £5,000 in respect of compensation payable in cash for holdings that may be resumed on the diminishing residue of C.D.B. estates. Thus, the two items in Subhead G cover the limited but important sector of cash purchases.  The bulk of land <Col N="1081" /> settlement continues to be financed in land bonds issued under Land Bond Orders made by the Minister for Finance.  The land bond interest rate of 5½ per cent. and the annuity rate of 5¾ per cent. remain unchanged from last year.  At these rates, the relevant purchase annuities are amortised in 58 years.  To correct mistaken notions, heard from time to time, I want to emphasise that the repayment period was not increased by the halving of annuities under the Land Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>Subhead H provides £3,500 for the payment of gratuities to persons displaced from employment on lands being taken over by the Land Commission for division.  Last year, twenty-four ex-employees received gratuities aggregating £3,074 and averaging £128 each.  Since the system of cash gratuities was introduced in 1950, a total of £22,508 has been paid by way of gratuities to 204 persons&mdash; an average of £110 each.</P>
    <P>I should point out that not all ex-employees are compensated in cash; last year, twenty-six ex-employees who were considered suitable to take on the responsibilities of farming, were given allotments totalling 806 acres.  In all cases, the award of compensation&mdash; whether in terms of land or money&mdash; is an excepted matter within the jurisdiction of the Land Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Subhead I provides £670,510 for the improvements works programme, being equivalent to 30% of the entire Estimate. This has always been a popular debating sector of the Land Estimate and the retention of the traditional subhead letter &ldquo;I&rdquo; will help to preserve continuity.  There are a few significant differences of detail in the present Subhead I compared with previous years.</P>
    <P>First, there are the items of £20,000 salaries and £10,000 travelling expenses of the 38 supervisors referred to in footnote (d) on page 175 of the current Estimates Volume.  The former grade of &ldquo;supervising ganger&rdquo;, which is now known as &ldquo;supervisor&rdquo;, has been integrated into the regular Civil Service organisation and provision <Col N="1082" /> for superannuation has been made for this staff as far as practicable. That is a change I am particularly glad to announce; the need for awarding established status to some of these men found many mouthpieces in this House and I know that Deputies generally will welcome it.  The pay and travelling expenses of this important field staff used formerly be borne on Subhead I as overheads going to make up the global estimates for building and general improvement works.  In view of the altered status of the supervisors, it is considered more appropriate now to provide for their salaries and travelling expenses in the orthodox subheads for these items.</P>
    <P>Another significant change in Subhead I concerns the minor provision which used to figure in previous years under the subtitle of &ldquo;Purchase of Tenancy Interests&rdquo;.  This year, it is classified as Subhead G2, to which I referred a few moments ago, in connection with the repeat of last year's provision of £5,000 for resumed holdings on C.D.B. estates.  These subhead transfers represent a deduction of £35,000 from the old Subhead I.</P>
    <P>In effect, Subhead I provides the entire funds for carrying out the various improvements works associated with and inseparable from the land settlement programme.  These works include the erection of dwelling-houses and out-offices on new farmsteads and re-arranged holdings, the construction of roads, fences and drains on resettled lands, turbary development works and so on.  Last year, when the original provision of £639,605 proved inadequate, a supplementary estimate of £50,000 was granted, making a total of £689,605 voted for the year.  Of this sum, the amount actually expended was £683,778.</P>
    <P>Deducting the sums applicable to supervisors and tenancy interests, which are no longer appropriate to Subhead I, we had an actual expenditure last year of just under £653,000 for comparison with the current Subhead I provision of over £670,000, representing a nett increase of approximately £17,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> It is anticipated that the increased funds will be wholly required to finance the improvement work engagements in the current year's programme. An Incentive Bonus Scheme similar to that in operation in the State Forests is now being extended to workers employed on Land Commission improvements works.</P>
    <P>The remaining few substantial expenditure Subheads relate to travelling and incidental expenses, telegrams, telephones and postage and legal expenses&mdash;which are self-explanatory. Indeed, these subheads show little change from the previous year and the detailed breakdown is set out in Part III of the printed Estimate.</P>
    <P>As regards appropriations-in-aid, Subhead L at £178,000 is some £4,500 higher than last year.  This increase is almost entirely attributable to item (5) for &ldquo;Excess Annuities, etc.&rdquo;  This item is statutorily regulated by Land (Finance) Rules.  The relevant receipts take the form of tenant purchasers' repayments on improvement loans, turbary rights and other resales not primarily financed in land bonds.</P>
    <P>I now turn to a review of the main activities of the Land Commission during the year ended 31st March, 1960.  Though some of the statistics are provisional, they are unlikely to vary to any appreciable extent from the final returns which will not be available for some little time yet.</P>
    <P>On the tenanted land side, progress continued towards the completion of land purchase, i.e., the conversion of tenants into proprietors, through the process of revesting their holdings in them.  Of a total of some 112,000 tenanted holdings which vested in the Land Commission under the Land Acts, 1923-54, for ultimate resale to tenants, approximately 103,000 had been dealt with by 31st March, 1960.</P>
    <P>The number of such holdings revested during the year was 1,010.  The essential work of selling their holdings to the sitting tenants has now virtually concluded in 15 counties, namely, Carlow, Cavan, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow, <Col N="1084" /> and the balance of cases under Land Acts, 1923-1924, has been reduced to 9,000 which represents only about 8% of the original total.  In addition, approximately 3,000 holdings, on estates of the former Congested Districts Board, still await resale and the aggregate total of 12,000 holdings constitutes the hard core of tenanted land on actually congested estates.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 7,000 of these holdings, apart from being undersized, are in rundale or intermixed plots. The solution of these difficult cases is inevitably a tedious process.  They represent what might be termed &ldquo;a recalcitrant residue&rdquo;, disposal of which is affected to a large extent by negotiations for migration and re-arrangement and the acquisition or purchase of other lands.  Even at the expanded rate of progress in the past two years, the re-arrangement of unvested fragmented holdings will probably take another ten years to complete. Much will necessarily depend upon the degree of co-operation among the occupiers themselves and the willingness of a sufficient number to migrate from rundale townlands to new holdings elsewhere.</P>
    <P>On the land settlement side, during the year ended 31st March last, the total area acquired, resumed or otherwise taken over by the Land Commission was 28,000 acres, while the total area distributed, in some 2,250 allotments, was 39,000 acres, in addition to the provision of 868 rights of turbary.  Bearing in mind that land settlement policy has aimed at a steady intake and allotment of 25,000 acres per annum, I think the results which I have just quoted for the year are certainly good.</P>
    <P>At 31st March, 1960, the acreage of arable lands on hand, forming the programme stock-in-trade, amounted to approximately 37,500 acres and the lands in the acquisition machine totalled 27,500 acres.</P>
    <P>The number of migrations carried out during the year was 118 and, in addition, 600 re-arrangements were effected.  I should like to say a few words on these two inseparable <Col N="1085" /> features of land settlement in this country.  I referred a few moments ago to the difficulty in disposing of the residual hard core of tenanted land. These holdings, as Deputies are no doubt aware, are situated for the most part on acutely-congested estates in counties along the western seaboard. A high proportion of them stands in dire need of re-arrangement as a prerequisite to revesting, while the bulk of them would also benefit from enlargement.  In this connection, it is necessary to emphasise that, due to the scarcity of untenanted land in the immediate vicinity of the congested estates, migration is generally the main source of obtaining the land needed for re-arrangement and enlargement purposes.</P>
    <P>Coming, as I do, from the west of Ireland, I am naturally very deeply interested in the Land Commission's migration and re-arrangement programme, and I think that the most heartening news for tenants on congested estates is the fact that about 600 holdings are now being re-arranged by the Irish Land Commission each year.  The re-grouping into compact workable units of the series of scattered and intermixed plots which normally constitute their holdings is of very great benefit to these tenants of what are often called &ldquo;rural slums&rdquo;. This is the vital work being done by the Land Commission in their voluntary re-arrangement schemes and I know that Deputies, including those who may be only remotely conversant with the conditions obtaining on some of these badly-congested estates, will fully endorse the worth and merit of this work.</P>
    <P>Here, I believe it appropriate to say that the circumstances under which land may be acquired are laid down by statute; owners of land sought for compulsory acquisition have a legal right of objection by way of public hearing; they also have further legal rights of appeal.  Frequently acquisition proceedings are vigorously contested. In contrast, the success of migration and re-arrangement schemes wholly depends on the voluntary co-operation of the participants.  The human element plays a big part in <Col N="1086" /> this aspect of the work, demanding long and careful negotiations by the inspectorate to procure the goodwill of all the landholders.</P>
    <P>In practice, the more acute the congestion and overcrowding, the more difficult it is to secure the agreement of suitable families to migrate and also to win general consent for a satisfactory re-arrangement scheme.  Consent and co-operation are not easy to achieve when many landholders are involved, particularly if, in the general exchange and re-shuffle of disconnected plots, there is not sufficient land to inspire and induce them to resettle. The entire business of migration and re-arrangement is a slow and exacting process involving patient negotiation and bargaining but it is an inescapable item in our land settlement.</P>
    <P>I cannot pass from this subject without emphasising the vital need for tenants concerned in the formulation of re-arrangement proposals to cooperate fully with the Land Commission inspectors with a view to bringing re-arrangement schemes, which, in any event, are solely for the tenants' benefit, to a successful conclusion.  Though the need for this co-operation has been stressed many times already, I am now compelled to refer to the matter once more and I earnestly appeal to any Deputies who may have an opportunity of doing so to impress on tenants, in their own interests, the importance of wholehearted co-operation with the Land Commission in this section of the work.</P>
    <P>Turning to housing activities, 210 new dwelling-houses and 338 new out-offices were erected and eleven dwelling-houses were substantially reconstructed, by or with assistance from the Land Commission during the year ended 31st March last, the total expenditure on buildings being £321,494.  Recently, some prototype dwelling-houses, to new architectural designs, were completed in Laois and Westmeath.  The Land Commission are now considering the results of this experiment, with special reference to practical farmstead utility and building costs which must of course be assessed also.  After such assessment, <Col N="1087" /> it is hoped that these prototype houses will serve as a useful guide for a range of new designs for general use in land settlement schemes.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of activity during the past year was the vesting of a total of 5,350 properties, comprising holdings, parcels of land and rights of turbary, in tenants and allottees.</P>
    <P>The collection of land purchase annuities continues to be most satisfactory. Out of a total of nearly £65¾ million collectable since 1933, payment of over £65½ million had been secured by the Land Commission at 31st March, 1960.  At that date the actual amount outstanding was £147,574&mdash;less than one-quarter of one per cent. of the sum collectable; that is some index of the credit-worthiness of Irish farmers and I hasten to express my appreciation for their prompt payment of annuities.</P>
    <P>Good progress continues to be made under the Land Commission scheme for resettlements out of the areas of high flood risk in the Shannon Valley. This Land Commission scheme is confined to farmers whose holdings have been seriously flooded or whose farms lack secure stands for livestock, against the risk of abnormal floods. The estimated cost of the scheme, approximately £100,000, is being defrayed out of the National Development Fund.  The objective of this particular scheme is to give relief from the hazards of serious flooding, as far as this can be done, by providing alternative buildings on safer sites, together with dry-stands to accommodate stock in times of abnormal floods.</P>
    <P>Altogether, some 105 farmers are involved and already something has been done, by the Land Commission, for about 80 of them, by way of building operations and allotments.  The worst cases are being given priority. The expenditure to a current date amounts to approximately £45,800.</P>
    <P>Some few farmers in the scheme have refused dry-site allotments for the erection of proposed new buildings. Apparently, they want the Land Commission to build on sites which are <Col N="1088" /> liable to flooding.  It would be objectionable to expend public funds in that way and it is hoped that these particular beneficiaries will not prove unco-operative.  The scheme is a voluntary one and can be carried into execution only to such extent as the individual beneficiaries will cooperate. For some of the outstanding cases, the question of further land acquisition is involved, possibly through a few further migrations. Negotiations are continuing in these cases.  In the general interest, I would ask for the utmost co-operation from all concerned so that the completion of this very important scheme may be expedited.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to comment on the outstanding congestion problem.  According to the latest official statistics, there are in the State some 168,000 holdings above one acre and not exceeding 30 acres.  It is probably safe to say that from 60,000 to 80,000 genuine small farmers, about half of whom are in western counties, are still trying to derive a subsistence livelihood from uneconomic holdings. These uneconomic farmers have a strong and serious claim to enlargement. The very large number of them involved makes one thing quite plain. The problem of congestion is still far from being finally solved.</P>
    <P>In face of that, I cannot but be surprised that there are those who advocate an extension to the classes of allottees for Land Commission land. Here land is a valuable but limited commodity&mdash;very limited indeed by reference to the almost limitlessness of applicants for it.  With the situation as I mentioned it, that is, upwards of 60,000 small-holders struggling on uneconomic units, it ought to be clear, and abundantly clear, that before there can be any question whatever of introducing a new group, those 60,000 who are already on the land in an uneconomic way must be regarded as a first charge on any land that becomes available to the State.</P>
    <P>To put it another way; every new holding bought or created by the Land Commission and diverted to a person not already on the land, means the <Col N="1089" /> perpetuation of one or more of the existing small-holders on dwarf holdings not sufficient to give even a modest living.  Let me put it still another way: the 40 odd acres needed to establish just one landless person would be sufficient to advance three or perhaps four existing small-holders to economic level.</P>
    <P>I know it is said, and said as if it were something of a heresy and utterly opposed to reason, that the only way to qualify for land from the Land Commission is to have land already: it is easy to shift the heresy out of that facile statement by saying that the best way to qualify for land from the Land Commission is to have some land already but not enough to return a modest livelihood.  There is no heresy in that but an article of sound policy, in the correctness of which I have an unswerving belief.  Surely it is the height of sense to insist that upwards of 60,000 small-holders must be improved first before new recruits are brought in.</P>
    <P>Any assessment of the extent of congestion automatically poses the question of the minimum size of economic holding or, as it is more often termed nowadays, the viable unit.  I think it will be accepted that, having regard to the wide range of thriving farms throughout the country, the definition of an economic holding cannot be reduced to any dogmatic formula in simple terms of acreage. Neither can it be treated in practice as a problem in abstract economics.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is a complex issue of sociology, economics and agronomics, with very great emphasis on the human aspect.  In my view, it is absurd to generalise that 35, 45, 65 or 105 acres is an economic farming unit.  We have all seen, on the one hand, the individual with the 60 to 100 acre farm having most of it let to his more industrious neighbours and eventually being forced to sell out; and, on the other hand, the 30 acre ambitious farmer progressing to the extent that he becomes a major land-owner in his own parish.</P>
    <P>The practical approach to the question <Col N="1090" /> of the size of the viable holding in this country, is to try to determine the desirable minimum unit and, in doing so, to ensure, having regard to the size of the country, that we cut our national land cloth according to our measure.  There are so many deserving applicants for land that a solution lies in ascertaining&mdash;not how much land a farmer can work&mdash;but rather the minimum area on which an industrious farmer can be expected to succeed.  It is on such basis only that the maximum number of families can be established on the land in economic security, this being amongst the Directive Principles of Social Policy outlined in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I can see no reason why a compact Land Commission standard holding, containing 33 acres of good Irish land, or equivalent larger acreage of varied quality, cannot be really rewarding, provided that it is intensively worked and that the allottee avails himself fully of the excellent advisory services operated by the county committees of agriculture.  In Denmark&mdash;so often cited here as a country to be imitated in terms of agriculture&mdash;the farming economy is largely based on units of under 25 statute acres.  It is not so much the size of holdings that matters as the competence and will with which the acres are worked.</P>
    <P>While on this subject, I should refer to allegations which have been made in this House that many allottees of Land Commission standard holdings are selling out and emigrating because the allotments are too small.  I can say, however, that these allegations are not borne out by investigation. As far as I can ascertain, the general experience is that Land Commission migrants have been quick to settle down and they work their new holdings remarkably well as a general rule. Naturally, it takes a little time to get properly established in new surroundings. In an undertaking of this kind, much depends on individual judgment and the course of circumstances, with runs of good-luck and ill-luck, but no well-disposed or even neutral person will withhold from our migrants a reasonable period of grace in which to find their feet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> The administration of the Game Preservation Act, 1930, which formerly came within the ambit of the Department of Justice, is now the responsibility of my Department.  Since my appointment as Minister for Lands, I have been considering the lines on which game preservation and development on a national scale might best be guided.  I welcome wholeheartedly the formation and growth of voluntary organisations for preservation of game and control of vermin and look forward to an expansion of this development with a view to providing the necessary groundwork for action on a national scale.  Indeed, it goes without saying that the appearance of such organisations is ample evidence of the existence of a keen practical interest in our potentially valuable game resources.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate my appeals for full co-operation by all interests&mdash; sporting, rural and agricultural&mdash;to ensure the success of the game movement, a vital activity which presents a challenge to all organisations concerned with sporting and rural life. It would, indeed, be a tragedy if sectional or partisan interests were to affect adversely the attainment of such a worthy aim.</P>
    <P>My own approach to the subject of game promotion is flexible and unbiased, my primary concern being to see the emergence of an organisation, representative of the country as a whole, suited to our conditions, and firmly rooted in the pattern of rural life.  As already intimated, the matter is at present under active consideration with a view to settling the lines of long-term policy, as soon as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>The rate of purchase of land by non-nationals is another important general aspect which calls for comment.  As Deputies already know, this matter was investigated in 1950, when it was ascertained that during the previous decade a total of 50,000 acres had been purchased by 200 persons who were believed to be non-nationals.  In fact, a number of them turned out to be of Irish origin.  Also, many of the properties were of a residential type unsuitable for land division.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> Last July, another investigation was made by the Garda Síochána with the co-operation of the Department of Justice into the extent of sizeable acquisitions of agricultural properties by non-nationals.  The investigation period covered from April, 1957 to July, 1959.  In summary, the returns showed that in the period of 2¼ years a total of 23 properties containing 7,027 acres had been purchased by reputed non-nationals.  The vendors of three of these properties, containing 891 acres, were themselves non-nationals. In the same period also, 12 properties owned by non-nationals containing 2,327 acres were sold back to Irish nationals.  The net sales to non-nationals covered by the inquiry, therefore, comprised 11 properties containing 4,700 acres in the period 1st April, 1957, to July, 1959&mdash;averaging 2,100 acres a year compared with the earlier average of 5,000 acres a year from 1940 to 1950.</P>
    <P>Reasonable reciprocity in regard to property purchases could scarcely be denied.  But close watch is being kept for any unreasonable or excessive developments and if it should transpire that the free play of economic forces was threatening the wide distribution of property which we fortunately have in this country, then I should be moved to suggest restrictive measures to my Government.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in stating that suitable action will be taken against any attempted frustration of land settlement policy, whether by proposed sales to non-nationals or otherwise. In this connection, it should be noted that, in the case of properties to which the Land Acts apply, the sale of land to a new owner does not impair the ultimate power of the Land Commission to acquire such land for the relief of local congestion.</P>
    <P>I shall now bring this opening statement towards conclusion with a reference to the Land Commission itself.  As Deputies generally know, the Land Commission's functions are partly administrative and partly quasi-judicial.  In the sphere of general policy and administration, the Minister for Lands has the overriding responsibility. <Col N="1093" /> But there are 14 functions listed in the Land Act, 1950, and clearly defined as &ldquo;excepted matters&rdquo;.  These functions arise in the day-to-day operations of land settlement and they touch very closely upon the fundamental private rights and circumstances of the individual citizen in relation to agricultural land. These are the quasi-judicial functions.</P>
    <P>In relation to these statutory &ldquo;excepted matters&rdquo; the Land Commission has the status of a Court and functions independently of the Government. This principle was enshrined first in the Land Act, 1933 and again in the Land Act, 1950.  There is general acceptance, in the light of experience, that such division of function is fundamental and I have no great quarrel with it.</P>
    <P>Entrusted with wide powers in a difficult and contentious sphere, the Land Commission has onerous responsibilities and I am satisfied that they are discharged faithfully and impartially. I take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the work carried out during the past year.</P>
    <P>As a people, we have a socially active conscience and that conscience will not be at ease until the problem of acute congestion which still persists in some areas is undone.  This Estimate is directed at that problem and I confidently recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>When I consider some of the wild statements the Minister made when he was a Deputy on this side of the House, and I was in the position in which he now is, and as this is the first Estimate for Lands he has introduced, I would have expected some revolutionary changes because I cannot help recalling some of the things he expected me to do, particularly in 1948 and 1949.  I suppose the Minister, now that he has had a look inside the Department, if he admitted the truth, would agree that an excellent amount of work was done during the 1948-51 period and also in the second period of office of the inter-Party Government.  The Minister's opening speech was very tame and did not give Deputies much hope that there will be <Col N="1094" /> any revolutionary changes or any great speeding-up of the work of the Land Commission.  It showed that the Minister realises that the Land Commission had, and always did have, a very difficult job to do and I am sure he now realises they have done a good job in spite of a great deal of opposition, both in this House and outside, and very often from the very people who would most benefit from their activities.</P>
      <P>The work of the Land Commission during the year was good but no better than in previous years.  The intake of land was about 28,000 acres.  When I was Minister for Lands, the figure was also about 28,000 to 32,000 or 33,000 &mdash;in some years, a little less, and in others a little more.  That is a very good intake considering how landowner-minded we are in this country and how difficult it is&mdash;and it is a difficult matter&mdash;to dispossess a man of his property.  It should be realised that the Land Commission have a power that no similar body have under any Government in Western Europe, as far as I am aware.  It is a sweeping power to give to anybody, even to a judicial body such as the Land Commission, the power to dispossess a man of his property and, except in a small way in the case of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the county councils which can acquire small portions of land&mdash;nothing like on the same scale as the Land Commission&mdash;no other body has this power.</P>
      <P>I see that 39,000 acres were allotted last year.  That is just about the average for quite a number of years past.  The Minister told us in one part of his speech that 1,010 holdings or farms were vested last year and later on he told us that 5,350 were vested.  That is on page 9 of his brief and I cannot quite follow that because I thought all the vestings were, or used to be, lumped together into one figure. His exact words were:</P>
      <P>Another important feature of activity during the past year was the vesting of a total of 5,350 properties, comprising holdings, parcels of lands and rights of turbary in tenants and allottees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, he had told us that the number of holdings vested during the year was <Col N="1095" /> 1,010.  I feel that the Land Commission, particularly the section of it that has the responsibility for vesting holdings, deserve very great praise from everybody for the tremendous work they have done.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm to give a short review of it because it is something I remember quite well.  Under the 1923 Act, roughly 112,000 holdings were bought over on estates owned by landlords up to that time.  Provision was made that vesting should take place in a few years.  For many reasons, some of them political, the vesting, which was a very important part of the work of the Land Commission, that is, the handing over of ownership of the holding to the tenant making him his own landlord or proprietor, was shelved and it was not until the inter-Party Government came along in 1948 that the job was tackled on a big scale, when vestings were as many as 16,000 a year for quite a number of years.  I admit, now that the bulk of these holdings have been vested, the remaining ones require rearrangement and improvement in many ways and vesting naturally will be slower.  If we had a total number of 112,000 holdings remaining to be vested in 1948, or the great bulk of them, and if they have now been reduced to 9,000, that is an excellent job.</P>
    <P>To speak broadly on the work of the Land Commission, they still have a long way to go and I think the rate of progress should be speeded up.  I am not subscribing in any way to some of the foolish nonsense we read in the daily newspapers from time to time suggesting that the Land Commission should be abolished, that they have outlived their usefulness.  I do not know what kind of mentality is behind such statements.  The most charitable thing that can be said for those who make such statements is that they have absolutely no knowledge of conditions on small holdings and they seem to be ignorant of the position in the west of Ireland where the congestion is.  They seem to imagine that congestion is something brought about by the tenants themselves and they seem to forget that the work of establishing farmers as <Col N="1096" /> owners of their holdings began&mdash;if I remember correctly&mdash;back in 1871.  It has been going on ever since.</P>
    <P>The very fact that it has taken all that time should be sufficient proof to anybody with any sense or sympathy with the lot of people living in the rural slums that the job is a big one and that, taking it by and large, the Land Commission&mdash;not forgetting the body that was there before the 1933 Act, the Congested Districts Board&mdash;if they have not brought about a revolution in the country as visible as in the case of forestry or arterial drainage, they have nevertheless brought about a revolution for the betterment of conditions to an extent which it is hard for people nowadays to realise.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to think that the present size of holdings is sufficient but I do not agree with him.  That is not the fault of the Minister, the present or the previous Government or the Land Commission.  It is due to the march of time and to the increased standard of living people are becoming accustomed to.  The Minister must be quite well aware of the very serious flight from holdings that were settled in 1948, 1950 or 1951, or even later. I am sure the Minister knows what is happening on part of the North Sligo estate where whole families have been clearing out from holdings, some of which were settled only in recent years.  I do not blame the Minister or the Land Commission for that&mdash;it is largely due to circumstances outside our control&mdash;but I suggest that the time has come to have a complete review of the size of additions to holdings.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister, Deputy Childers, removed the ceiling of £10 in congested areas.  That did not make much difference; it was just a gesture; but even if he could have increased the valuation up to £50, no man could get land if it was not there for him.  I should like to make a practical suggestion in this regard.  It is better to increase the size of holdings beyond what the Land Commission are accustomed to, or confined to, under present policy by tradition and experience.  I say that because we <Col N="1097" /> are now losing whole families.  The pattern of emigration which, up to this, usually took the form of some of the boys and girls going and some of them&mdash;usually a son&mdash;staying at home to inherit the holding and carry on the work there, is changing.</P>
    <P>In the past few years, the pattern has changed.  The Minister must be well aware of the change.  He certainly does not, I am sure, go around his constituency with his eyes closed. The pattern today is that whole families are locking up and moving out.  It is a serious matter for the country to lose whole families.  I am told that in one area in south-west Mayo 19 homes have been closed up in the past three years.  Some were admittedly single men, but in other cases whole families moved out&mdash; father, mother, and two or three children.  In one case, seven children left with their parents and went over to Birmingham.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission can do a great deal to stop that kind of emigration. If the Minister would induce the Government&mdash;I do not want him to think I am saddling him with an impossible task&mdash;to invest a fairly sizeable sum in the land problem for a few years, we would save a great many of these families for the country. We shall be discussing forestry latter. Forestry can also help to keep the people at home.  If people were given sufficient money to purchase holdings, or to make decent additions to existing holdings, the pattern would be different.  Steps will have to be taken to cope with the hard core of congestion that still remains.  It is from holdings which are not yet settled that emigration is heaviest.  I am not in touch with other counties, but I take it the position is the same in Donegal, Kerry and Clare.  I do not know if the flight from the land is so serious in these counties as it is in Mayo, but I feel the movement out is not confined to Mayo alone.</P>
    <P>People who have been compensated for land in the past through the medium of 4 per cent. and 4½ per cent. Land Bonds are pretty badly hit. <Col N="1098" /> These bonds were issued at par.  Now when they go to sell them, instead of having a value of £100, they are worth only £83 or £84.  All the people have are scraps of paper with £100 written on them and all they can get is £83 or £84 for them.  That naturally depreciates the selling value of land. No Government can wash their hands of responsibility.  The bonds are issued by the Minister for Finance with face value of £100, but they do not retain that value.</P>
    <P>In the last year of the inter-Party Government, the interest rate was increased to 6 per cent. and bonds issued then and since are holding their own on the market.  That is all to the good.  I suggest the Minister take the matter up with the Minister for Finance.  There will probably be a cry from the Department of Finance that any steps taken will increase the loss on resale, on the £889,000 the Minister mentioned which has to be met this year for the purchase of land since 1923.  Nevertheless, we must not continue an injustice.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I must refer to the price that obtained prior to the 1950 Act, the method of fixing the price and the insistence upon taking the redemption value out of the purchase price before the owner is handed the purchase money.  A remnant of that injustice still remains in the issue of Land Bonds which sell considerably below their face value.  I know that this obtained long before the Minister or I had any responsibility.  I went some part of the way to rectify the position, but something still remains to be done.  It was wrong to penalise land owners in this way as if it were they who were guilty of an injustice. I cannot understand how men who would not handle a penny wrongfully could subscribe to such a method.</P>
    <P>A review of the size of holdings is absolutely necessary.  To my own knowledge&mdash;I can supply plenty of names&mdash;holdings which were settled at the end of the war in 1955, on which new houses and outoffices were erected, are now closed up and apparently useless.  There are too many of them to make letting attractive. The State has put money into <Col N="1099" /> them.  The reason they are derelict is two-fold: first, the standard of living has gone up and, secondly, they are incapable of sustaining people on an improved standard of living.  That is an aspect to which the Minister should give serious attention.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Land Commission on the good work done in the Shannon Valley.  I am glad to know that 80 holdings there have been either wholly or partially improved. I hope the good work will continue and that the remaining 30 or 40 will be dealt with in due course. Like the congests in the west, these people found themselves in an impossible position.  They could not afford to move out; they could not afford to purchase holdings elsewhere.  All they could do was to remain on these lands which are constantly subject to flooding.  The Land Commission deserves great credit for the good work done there.</P>
    <P>The Minister towards the conclusion of his speech, referring to the functions of the Land Commission in relation to &ldquo;excepted matters&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;excepted matters&rdquo; are the function of the Commissioners alone&mdash;said: &ldquo;This principle was enshrined first in the Land Act, 1933, and again in the Land Act, 1950.  There is general acceptance, in the light of experience, that such division of function is fundamental, and I have no quarrel with it.&rdquo;  What exactly does the Minister mean by that?  Is it that he barely tolerates a system which has been in operation since 1871?  This seems a rather crude way to put it.  It is a danger signal for the Commissioners, as far as I can see.  It is possible that, while the Minister has no quarrel with the system at the moment, he may quarrel with it if the Commissioners rub him the wrong way or ruffle his feathers too much.</P>
    <P>I shall not go back on the statements the Minister made or the accusations he levelled during the Committee Stage of the 1950 Land Act, but, if he wants to undermine security of tenure and destroy ownership, whether in the case of farmer or business man, the surest and simplest way to do it is by <Col N="1100" /> taking away that function from the Commissioners and giving it to the political head of the Department. Security of tenure, as we know it and as we knew it all along, will vanish overnight if that is done, and the Minister will have something red hot and thorny on his hands.  Very calmly and deliberately, I increased the number of excepted matters from six to fourteen under the 1950 Act.  I never regretted that.  In fact, I feel very proud of it and I feel that a great measure of security was given as a result.</P>
    <P>In the case of these two major questions, acquisition and allotment, this country would never tolerate any system under which these questions would be in the hands of people other than judicial men of known integrity and sound understanding of the problems of the country and of the laws of ownership.  Such people understand the very tenacious grip we have on the ownership of our lands, be it only a couple of roods of cut-away bog or a large farm of good land.  We would always defend it with our lives.  I daresay the Minister had not any sinister object when he used that peculiar phrase, but it was a rather crude way of putting it.</P>
    <P>A complete revision of the size of allotments and the enlargement of existing holdings is completely overdue. I should also like to mention the Kilmaine Estate about which I have put questions to the Minister.  The answers I got, even this week, were that the delay was due to lack of co-operation. The Minister knows as well as I do that these two townlands are perched on the side of a mountain. While it might outrage the Commissioners and some of the inspectors, I think some effort should be made to save these seven or eight families, four in each village, and purchase land for them.  The proper thing to do, even at cost to the State, would be to give over all the useless land on the holdings to forestry.  There are in the nearby Fitzgerald No. 2 Estate many people who would be glad to get whatever arable land there is in these two villages. No doubt the Commissioners will say that that would be uneconomic, but I think it certainly would not be <Col N="1101" /> good economics if, for fear of breaking the usual rules of settling land, we were prepared to lose those eight families.  Some of them told me they could not get their sons to stay at home.  In some cases the sons are gone and the old people are just lingering on.  I would ask the Minister to take a personal interest in this and make an effort to save those eight families.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission inspectors will probably say: &ldquo;We can give them £10 or £12 valuation of land,&rdquo; but we must look at the peculiar location of these two villages on top of a mountain with a winding, narrow road to it that a car or lorry could hardly travel. We must not fool ourselves.  The youngsters of to-day will not live in a place like that, and if we insist on holding them their answer will be: &ldquo;I will get a much better job in Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds.&rdquo; That is what is happening elsewhere, and it will happen there also.  I can assure the Minister that I know the difficulties he will be up against, but I think his advice to the Commissioners and the inspectors would go a long way towards settling the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was sorry I was not present when the Minister made his opening statement.  I shall confine myself to one or two remarks. The first is the allocation of turbary rights to tenants, a very sore point in my area.  I have put down several questions concerning turbary rights. This matter affects an area in South Connemara stretching from Spiddal to Lettermullen.  I know negotiations are going on in connection with turbary rights north of Spiddal.  There are two villages, Kylerae East and Kylerae West, both very handicapped in the matter of turbary.  This is the position all along to the Lettermullen peninsula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was about this time last year that some people in the Lettermullen area cut whatever little sods they could get on top of the rocky land there.  They were visited by the Garda Síochána and, eventually, were prosecuted.  I am not sure what they were fined, but I understand they were <Col N="1102" /> fined.  These people have no turbary rights, and they must have turf for their winter fires.  Are there not sufficient inspectors and Land Commission engineers in Galway to deal with the allocation of turbary plots in that area?  I feel the Minister should investigate what happened in this case and find out why these people were prosecuted and who was responsible.  I think it was a very high-handed action and I hope nothing like it will happen in the present season.</P>
    <P>These people should be allocated turbary plots.  I put a few questions to the Land Commission, and I was told it would cost thousands of pounds to build roads into some of these bogs.  I know that a fairly large stretch of bog is to be taken over this year, but they say it will not be ready for turf cutting for at least two years.  The people of the area have told me that they do not mind if the roads are not built for a couple of years so long as they get plots on which they can cut turf.  They said they would get out the turf to the roads somehow in order to bring it home by lorry.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the land left behind by migrants from the West is the cause of friction and trouble.  Some time ago migrants were moved from a certain part of the West and the land they left behind was actually auctioned. If it is auctioned and if there are some people with substantial means in the area, it is only natural to assume that they have a greater chance of getting that land than the people who are probably most entitled to it. I think the matter should be investigated and the land should be given to the people who are most entitled to it.</P>
    <P>In regard to land taken from migrants, if you take a village say of about 15 families, in order to give these families a little extra land you have to move about six families.  This year three are moved, although there may be five willing to go, but houses were built for only three.  Next year comes along and they may go to a different townland altogether to move a new crowd.  If possible that village should be cleared out in the first year or, if <Col N="1103" /> not, in the second year and rearrangement should take place at the earliest possible opportunity in order to divide the land among the remaining people and make their holdings more economic.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there is no better person to fill the post of Minister for Lands than the present occupant.  He is a man of long experience of congested areas and I have the greatest confidence that anything which has not been going right in the congested areas will be put right by him before the present session of the Dáil terminates.  He comes from an area like that from which I come where there is a lot of congestion and I am sure that down the years he has been attentive to and fighting the people's cause.  I am confident he will iron out the problems existing in these areas and I wish him the best of luck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the greatest problems confronting us, together with unemployment and emigration, is rural depopulation.  These problems go hand in hand and the Minister for Lands is as familiar as any other Deputy with the prevailing conditions throughout rural Ireland.  It is true to say, although apparently not to the knowledge of the Minister according to his statement to-day, that entire families are moving from the land.  I feel that in recent years there has been a greater flow of emigration from rural Ireland than for a long time in the history of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that in many parts of this country we have had, as was pointed out by Deputy Blowick, a new type of emigration where we see not one of a family&mdash; not the father, the older daughter, or the older son&mdash;but the entire family moving out, putting up a sheet of galvanised iron on the window and a large padlock on the door.  There are many such cases west of the Shannon and if they are visible to Deputies on this side of the House it cannot be that they are invisible to Deputies on the other side.  In the midlands there are many such holdings where the entire family <Col N="1104" /> has moved and has settled down elsewhere. In other words, these people are trying to get a sufficient sum of money together abroad to enable them to return some day to their holdings. They have put their lands on the books of an estate agent or an auctioneer and instructed him to let the lands in conacre until such time as they return. If there are signs of decay in the country they lie in the fact that no effort is being made to prevent the movement of entire families from rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was introducing his Estimate this morning, I thought we should hear something about the Government's land policy, a policy by which the Government would endeavour to settle families on the land and to encourage these people who are moving off their land to remain on it.  I expected that the Land Commission, through the Minister, would be submitting to the House whatever scheme they have in mind in this regard and that the Minister, who is answerable for the land policy of this Government, would give an indication as to the future land policy of Fianna Fáil.  It appears from his statement to-day that it is a continuation of the policy which the Land Commission have operated in the past.</P>
      <P>There is little use in Ministers rejoicing about the achievements that may have taken place during their term of office.  The position is that we live in 1960; we live in new times and in new conditions which are moving swiftly and changing rapidly. We must plan our policy in accordance with present day circumstances and give all credit due to Ministers for Lands of the past and forget their failures or the lack of achievement.  We must look to the future and to the present day.  If we examine the Government's land policy, as announced by the Minister to-day, we see that there is no improvement laid out for the future and that in so far as the present day is concerned it is just a continuation of the decaying policy which has been operated in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Minister for Lands should be deeply and gravely concerned about <Col N="1105" /> the vast movement taking place from rural Ireland.  If the statistics in many parishes in rural Ireland to-day were compared with those of ten years ago they would show a considerable fall in population; if compared with 20 years ago they would show a greater fall and if they were compared with 30 years ago a still greater fall.</P>
    <P>There are many parts of County Cork where, according to statistics taken in various parishes, there has been a reduction of almost 50 per cent. of the population.  In the parish of Shannonbridge in Offaly in my constituency there has been an alarming reduction in the number of people resident there ten years ago, and certainly in the numbers resident there 20 years ago.  That is probably typical of every parish in rural Ireland to-day.  That should certainly cause any Minister for Lands to examine what is really responsible for it. If it is the case that there are not sufficient people settling on the land, or if the holdings on which the people live are not sufficient to enable them to bring up their families in accordance with proper Christian living standards, it ought to be examined with a view to putting it right.  Whatever the Land Commission have been responsible for in the past&mdash;and it would be wrong to say they have not had many good achievements&mdash;they should realise that, living in the times in which we are living, there are a number of great evils facing us which call for great measures.</P>
    <P>We can all sympathise with the Minister and the Land Commission because we know there are many more applicants for land than there is land available.  That is recognised by all sides.  If we examine, on the one hand, the results achieved by the Land Commission, which, mark you, was set up as a temporary institution and which was never intended to be permanent, and the amount of work yet to be done, on the other&mdash;and we realise that it is a big body which moves very slowly, and which is bound by various Acts of Parliament&mdash;we must ask ourselves are they competent <Col N="1106" /> to solve the great problems of rural depopulation and congestion which exist in this country to-day.  The time has now come when the Government should carefully examine the entire land policy and find out for themselves whether they are achieving a measure of success in accordance with present-day trends of flight from the land, rural depopulation and the continuance of congestion.</P>
    <P>There are many credit-worthy farmers' sons&mdash;and I am particularly interested in those people&mdash;who have not sufficient money to buy land, and who are taking land on the conacre system, and paying £15, £20, £25 and, in some cases, £30 for tillage land. They will never become the owners of that land.  I have been wondering whether the Land Commission and the Minister have given any serious thought to the question of providing that type of credit-worthy farmer's son with land on a rent or other basis. These young men are prepared to pay for it, and they could pay for it, and they will gladly pay in the hope of enjoying ownership some day.</P>
    <P>I should also like to hear from the Minister if it would not be advisable for the Land Commission to suspend the acquisition of that type of holding, except in cases where they are offered to the Land Commission and agreement is reached.  The time has now come, having regard to the many failures in the past, when it should be possible to give land to the credit-worthy deserving farmers' sons and others who are anxious to get land, and are willing to work it, and who, in the opinion of those competent to judge, deserve to get land.  On the other hand, we have a large number of holdings on the public market in respect of which there would be no question of having to dispossess any man who did not want to sell.  One of the greatest safeguards in this or any other country is ownership of one's land.  We must always recognise that, and any Government who fail to do so are facing doom.  The right of private ownership and the right of a man, or a member of a family, to his own holding, without any hindrance from the State, is something that should be cherished and defended very strongly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> In the case where land is being acquired for the relief of congestion or otherwise, I should prefer to see that no hardship was caused to the owner.  The Minister indicated here a year ago that the Land Commission were about to enter with great enthusiasm into the purchase of land on the public market and take their place with other bidders and intending purchasers.  If they are prepared to pay the full market value, let them be the highest bidder.  There cannot then be any question of injustice to the land owner or any question of injustice whatever.</P>
    <P>In any case where there is serious objection to the Land Commission acquiring land, I should like to see agreement reached rather than to see compulsory powers used.  I am glad that in very recent times there is a tendency on the part of the Land Commission to negotiate more reasonably than they did in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We made them pay market prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was due to the fact that the Land Commission were given the right and authority to pay the full market value for the land.  On the other hand, it is a safeguard for the interests of the owner of the land.  No matter what type of land policy is formulated by any Minister or by the Land Commission, it should always be borne in mind that one of the cherished principles of that policy should be free sale and that any man who wants to sell his land should be allowed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the question of land agitation, I join with other Deputies who from time to time have condemned agitation in various forms in connection with the acquisition of land.  No group should be allowed to take the law into their own hands in this regard.  That has always been the policy on this side of the House, and I want to endorse the view that people should not take the law into their own hands.  If they feel they have a genuine grievance, there is a genuine legal remedy.  If they are dissatisfied with the Land Commission, with land policy or with the <Col N="1108" /> conduct of the Minister for Lands, they have a remedy at the various general elections and an opportunity to make changes.  No section of the people, great or small, should be or will be allowed to take the law into their own hands.  I trust the Minister will have a word or two to say on that matter when he is replying.</P>
    <P>There are various parts of the country where, because of land agitation, hard-working, honest, industrious people are not on speaking terms.  Due to the land policy of this Government and to the system, envy, ill-will and spite are carried on from family to family and from generation to generation.  If that is so, it must be admitted that there must be some defects in, and something wrong with, a system which has given rise to so much discontent, disunity and uncharitable conduct in many areas.  If the Minister goes to the trouble of getting details of the unpleasantness that has occurred in many areas in rural Ireland, he will find that it is caused entirely by land agitation.  There is probably no county in the Twenty-Six Counties in which there has not been some form of land agitation in the past which has caused spite, ill-will, discontent and unpleasantness among very decent, hard-working honest citizens.</P>
    <P>Where you have a system breeding that kind of discontent in rural Ireland it surely calls for some revision and review.  That is why I think, now that there have been in recent years so many cases of unpleasantness in every county, that the time has come when an effort should be made to bring about unity in those areas and create friendship among the parties by a sound and sane land policy.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious thing for people to take the law into their own hands; it is something no Government can ignore and no member of this House can tolerate.  When we have so many cases of unpleasantness, it must occur to the Land Commission and to the Minister that there is cause for it.  The time has come to review the whole position and in doing that, let the principle be to set up as many families as possible on the land and to acquire <Col N="1109" /> land for the relief of congestion, and land for creditworthy farmers, even, as I said, on a rented or other basis.  I have often wondered why the Land Commission could not set themselves up as an agency to which people anxious to dispose of their land could apply and which would have available, on the other hand, the right type of people to whom to allocate the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister received a deputation from the N.F.A. some time ago and, according to Press reports, discussed in great detail the suggested plans of the Bishop of Clonfert in relation to the setting up of a Land Bank.  I do not know what the outcome of the discussions was but I know that organisations such as Macra na Feirme and the N.F.A. favoured some policy based on the ideas and suggestions of the Bishop of Clonfert.  We have not heard from the Minister whether he has any proposals in that regard or what the outcome of the discussions was, whether he viewed the matter with concern or whether he was prepared to take any action in the matter, having regard to the fact that organisations representative of young farmers such as Macra na Feirme and the N.F.A. took up the matter seriously with him, with the Minister for Agriculture and, if I am not mistaken, with the Taoiseach.  Such an important step in regard to the formulation of land policy ought not be allowed to pass without some comment on the occasion of the annual Estimate.  This debate should be the occasion for some reasonable comment on that proposal and I should like to hear what the Minister has to say in regard to it.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk from time to time on all sides of the House as to what should be the size of an economic holding.  In the past, the Land Commission have given very small parcels of land to people, with the result that after some time they were worse off than if they had never got the land.  It may have been of a little temporary help to them.  Where you have people rearing a family and striving to exist on 17 or 20 or 25 acres of land, if there is no work in the district for the older members of <Col N="1110" /> the family to supplement the farm income, they are left in complete misery with no alternative but to leave.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how many families live on 25-acre holding if there is not road work, forestry work or bog development work in the locality to give some of the grown-up members of the family employment and if there is not employment during the slack period of farm work, for the head of the family.  I do not see how they can live and pay rent and meet ever-increasing rate demands, as well as having to face falling prices of livestock, the uncertainty of the agricultural market and the downward trend in prices for agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>Surely some consideration must be given to the people who are asked to live, or exist, in such circumstances and there are very many such people.  There must be Deputies who have an intimate knowledge of people living on 25 or 26 acres and who must take grazing on the 11-months system at very substantial rates.  In addition, their tillage land has to be supplemented also at a very high charge and it is for people of that type I appeal, in the hope that either the Minister or the Land Commission will realise that this is a problem that faces every smallholder in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>To give a smallholder of 10 acres an additional five or even 10 acres is no solution of the congestion problem. It might be wise for the Land Commission to have an established policy that no farm or holding under 45 acres would be regarded as economic. That should give sufficient tillage, grazing and meadowland on which the family could at least eke out an existence.  But anyone with a knowledge of farming conditions and particularly those who know the livelihoods earned by very small farmers must wonder how they can possibly exist on uneconomic holdings.  How many of these people appealed to the Land Commission, in some cases 15 or 20 years ago, but because of pressure of more urgent and important work in various areas, it was not possible to reach their cases?  Most of those who are expecting relief from <Col N="1111" /> the Land Commission will be long dead and gone and their families will have grown much older by the time we have a land policy implemented here that will give them substantial relief.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not made very clear what he thinks of the actual policy of the Land Commission in regard to the size of the economic holding.  In my opinion, it ought not be less than 45 acres and at that, the holding should have reasonably good tillage land and sufficient grass to make it possible for the owner to have his own grazing, without having to seek it in the conacre market.</P>
    <P>What is the policy of the Land Commission in relation to the acquisition of very large holdings?  There has been a suspension of the taking over of very large holdings.  A good deal of time, expense and so on, would be involved unless these holdings were acquired by agreement.  This Estimate and the future land policy of this Government hold out very little hope for credit-worthy farmers' sons or for the person who is paying a very substantial part of his income year after year for land in conacre.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have not found a solution to that big problem. I understand that in 1956 this matter was under consideration by the then Government.  Has the examination of such an important problem in rural Ireland ceased?  Can the Minister give us any information as to the result of the investigation?</P>
    <P>Private ownership of land must be encouraged.  The payment of full market value for land must be encouraged. The law permits the entry of the Land Commission into the public market but that permission has not been fully availed of.  Every rural Deputy knows that there are hard-working, industrious, very small holders in his district whose financial position will not permit them to purchase land, while in the same areas very substantial lands are from time to time available on the market.</P>
    <P>I recommend that some scheme be put into operation whereby in all these areas, by agreement, the Land Commission will purchase suitable <Col N="1112" /> holdings and allocate them in the parish or in the adjoining parish.  That would give relief to hard-pressed people who must pay large sums for land on the conacre system.  If we must have the long-drawn-out tedious system of acquiring land by compulsion to try to solve our problem, and wind up by pleasing nobody, if we allow months and years to pass in this manner, I fear our young men and women will leave the land and seek alternative employment abroad.</P>
    <P>A thriving agricultural policy, hand in hand with a sane and sound land policy, will be our salvation.  We are an agricultural country.  We can never be converted into an industrial country. Everything we can do, not by the spoken word but by action, should be done to encourage our people to remain on the land.  They cannot do so unless they have something to keep them there.  Eventually, it comes down to the size of the holding on which a farmer and his family must eke out an existence.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the designers of the new Land Commission houses. They add considerably to the attractiveness of the countryside.  I understand that at present these houses are available only in counties Laois and Westmeath.  It would be well if Deputies would ask the Land Commission for plans of the modern and very creditable houses they are now erecting.  A number of these houses have been built on the main Dublin-Limerick road, near Mountrath.  People have stopped to look at them.  I hope the Department will continue to build that type of house, particularly on main and county roads.  The older type of house provided by the Department was by no means attractive.</P>
    <P>The engineering and architectural sections of the Land Commission are to be complimented on the new design of these houses.  Can the Minister give us&mdash;this also would be a guide to local authorities&mdash;the cost of the modern Land Commission house compared with the older design?  No matter what the difference, the appearance of the new house, as well as its practical value, is worth the cost.  The outoffices are also of a superior standard. <Col N="1113" /> They are far more spacious and the general lay-out has been considerably improved.  I have inspected a number of these new holdings.  If I had any criticism to offer, I would avail of this opportunity to do so.  The outoffices in the new type of residence are worthy of favourable comment.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that in the past year 5,350 holdings were vested.  I do not know the position in relation to each county but the vesting of 5,000 holdings in a year is reasonably good progress.  Again, I would ask the Minister if it is possible to increase the vesting staff so that vesting may be speeded up.  The vesting of holdings is certainly of very great importance to counties like Mayo, but judging by <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, when it is published every three or four days, it appears that the vesting orders are particularly for county Mayo.  It may be that there are more small holdings to be vested in county Mayo than in any other county.  It is right to vest them. Nevertheless, I should like to know what the figures for the vesting of holdings are in relation to each county.  I feel that information can readily be made available.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is taking steps with regard to game preservation.  The preservation of our game is of the greatest possible importance. It adds considerably to the attractiveness of our tourist industry. I hope to have a word to say about the preservation of our game when the Estimate for Forestry comes up for discussion.  As I say, the preservation of games is of very great importance. It has been neglected in the past and I am glad that reference was made to it on this Estimate.  I trust it will occupy a very important place in the formulation of future policy.</P>
    <P>I wonder why county committees of agriculture have not taken a keener interest but I suppose that when the lead was not given by the Department of Lands, it was too much to expect the lead to come from the bottom.  I cannot stress too much the importance of the preservation of our game. County committees of agriculture <Col N="1114" /> ought actively to interest themselves in this matter and the friendly spirit of co-operation of the N.F.A., Macra na Feirme, Muintir na Tíre and other public-spirited movements should be solicited.  I am sure it will be readily forthcoming in a general reorganised scheme for game protection and game development.  Agricultural and sporting interests ought to be got together.</P>
    <P>The general development of our game is something that deserves the active attention of the Department of Lands.  It is something that ought not to be taken too easily or too lightly.  I appreciate what the Land Commission have done in that regard.  It is a little and I hope it is not too late.  When the Forestry Estimate comes up for discussion, the Department will hear a little from us in that regard.  I trust that there will be general co-operation between the Land Commission, the Forestry Department and the sporting and agricultural associations to which I referred concerning the development and preservation of our game.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the state of affairs prevailing in the Shannon Valley.  He reported that a considerable sum of money was spent.  I agree that a considerable sum of money was spent but will that prevent the flooding?  I feel that in regard to the Shannon flooding, the amount of money spent by the Land Commission will probably make it easier for livestock to escape a fatal end during heavy flooding but I am very doubtful, from what I have seen in the Shannon Valley, if, when the Shannon is again at high water, the work already done on high land will prevent a recurrence of what has been taking place there over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>I know that there are a number of people in the Shannon Valley who were offered holdings and who will not go. Nobody likes leaving the home where he was born and where his parents, grandparents and great-grandparents lived.  If they feel they are in a place of safety, that is their own business but I really think that portions of good land ought to be made available for them in districts within easy reach of the Shannon Valley.  There are many such districts along the Shannon.  The <Col N="1115" /> farmers in the area would be more concerned with the spending of this money on some means to prevent a recurrence of the flooding.</P>
    <P>In the constituency I represent, the areas principally concerned are the parishes of Shannonbridge, Banagher, Lusmagh and the district round Shannon Harbour.  Unfortunately, the scheme designed by the Land Commission to give relief does not include those areas of county Offaly.  That is why I ask that even that scheme should be considerably reviewed.  The farmers in the Shannon Valley district of the parish of Lusmagh ought to be included and given the benefits of whatever scheme is devised.  I cannot see this money rendering any really useful service to the farmers in that area, if more serious flooding occurs.  In some ways the money may have helped considerably.  The measures taken by the Land Commission may be appreciated by some. I am sure they are very grateful for what has been done but it certainly will not prevent a recurrence of the flooding.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have a scheme in mind in this regard.  I have often wondered whether it would not be much better to devote some of the money which was spent on the scheme to the removal of the islands and obstructions in the Shannon.  There is a substantial amount of money available in the National Development Fund for spending and if the Land Commission are interested in the plight of the farmers in the Shannon Valley, instead of building outoffices in the midst of flooded districts, would it not be better to remove the main obstructions and islands in the Shannon rather than reinforce the foundations which one day will again be covered with water?</P>
    <P>That is why I feel the money could have been better spent.  Could some of this money not have been spent by the Land Commission, in co-operation with the E.S.B., on some type of remedy in respect of the extraordinary weir at Meelick?  The Land Commission would be well advised to act in greater co-operation <Col N="1116" /> with the other interests in relation to the Shannon flooding.  Because of the very small use for the weir at Meelick at the present time and because of the erection of a number of power stations and the other means by which electricity can now be generated, ought we not consider that the weir has now become obsolete? If the weir were attended to, one of the causes of flooding of the Shannon which so distresses the farmers in the area would be immediately remedied.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the Land Commission that they should examine that proposal in co-operation with the E.S.B., the Office of Public Works and the Shannon navigation people.</P>
    <P>The distress caused in the Shannon Valley, which has been referred to by the Minister, will continue until effective measures are carried out.  I have often wondered why the Land Commission have not included in their scheme some means by which that distress can be further relieved.  Every time serious flooding affects the area, there are appeals for fodder, hay, food for livestock.  There may be considerable loss of livestock.  There never seems to be a penny made available to replace anything lost.  I have often wondered why the Land Commission do not set aside a certain sum for the purpose of rehabilitating people in their holdings after flooding.  These people do not want to leave their holdings and it is not right to compel a man to leave his land or force him out of his holding.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a sum of money be provided for that purpose by the Land Commission to be administered by a committee representative of the county councils of Leitrim, Westmeath, Roscommon, Galway, Offaly, North Tipperary and Clare.  If these county councils agreed to strike a rate of 1d. in the £, it would bring in £1,000 from each of these counties.  That could be supplemented by a similar sum of money provided by the Land Commission out of the National Development Fund.  In that way, considerable relief could be provided for the people whose livestock are endangered and whose own lives are endangered during very severe flooding.  I make that <Col N="1117" /> suggestion in the hope that the Land Commission will give it their consideration. The problem is grave and can be solved only by the exercise of commonsense in the spending of public money and acting upon the best engineering advice obtainable.</P>
    <P>We are all deeply concerned about the drift from the land.  This House should concern itself not merely with keeping our people at home but with keeping them on the land.  Our land needs more workers if it is to be properly and fully developed.  It is capable of supporting a greater population than it does at the present time.  I trust that as a result of the contributions from all sides of the House, the Minister will realise that, in face of the radical decline in the population of rural Ireland, the time has come for measures of a drastic and ruthless character.</P>
    <P>It is within the powers of the Government to formulate a suitable policy to remedy the deplorable decline in the rural population by setting up on the land credit-worthy people who are not afraid of hard work, not afraid to work from sunrise until night, who will be prepared to marry and live in rural Ireland and to bring up their families in accordance with Christian decency, if given an opportunity to do so.  The first opportunity they require is a holding of a size they can live on.  The Land Commission have a function in moulding a suitable, progressive, modern land policy that will meet the economic difficulties of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister, being a rational human being, ought to be as alive to the requirements of rural Ireland in this regard as any other Deputy.  The policy of the Government in relation to land acquisition, distribution and congestion calls for review and investigation. The problem has not been tackled.  It is high time there was an implementation of an up-to-date, speedy policy, not a policy designed to give results in 5 to 15 years but one that will give results for credit-worthy farmers' sons who are now anxious to marry and who are not in a position to purchase holdings.  They are the type of people we want to help.  They are <Col N="1118" /> the type of people the Land Commission do not seem to be too eager to assist.  They are the type of people on whom the future of the country entirely depends.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the Land Commission should get down to work in this connection and that the Minister should consult his colleagues in the Government, that they should examine their consciences in relation to the land question.  They should realise the benefits that can be obtained from an up-to-date land policy based on the principle of keeping our people working on the land, happy and contented on their holdings.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Lands affords an opportunity to put before the Minister the many grievances of persons in the country areas.  Unfortunately, the Ministers appointed to this Department, in this Government and in the previous Government, come from county Mayo, in the heart of the congested districts.  They may be noble gentlemen but they are bound to be biased by the conditions they see in their own areas and the counties to which the allottees come are sadly neglected.  I should prefer to have as Minister for Lands an independent person who did not come from the congested districts, so that there would be unbiased allocation of land.  I am not saying that against this Minister or the previous Minister. Human nature is very weak and when a man sees problems around him, these are the problems which he wants to solve and he forgets that there are problems in other places.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have been operating for 40 years and the Congested Districts Board were working for as long before that.  We have not seen the end of land division. That is not to our credit.  A vast amount of money should have been spent on land acquisition, the clearance of rural slums and the placing of people on the land.  Progress is altogether too slow.  That work should be speeded up until the major portion of land division is completed so that the Land Commission can close down the different wings in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> No matter what the Minister may have said in his opening statement, a new approach is needed.  It is a disgrace that farmers' sons, the cream of the land, not only the cream of the land today but for the past 500 or 600 years, are denied an acre of land in their own country.  If a farm is put up for sale in my constituency, no farmer's son can purchase it.  That is where the Land Commission have failed.  They should have taken up these farms instead of allowing outsiders to come in and buy them.  Any fairminded person knows that is wrong and the Minister must know it is wrong.</P>
    <P>There is concern about the relief of congestion in the west of Ireland but you will not relieve congestion by putting people into little holdings here and there.  In any case, I should like to know what is a congest.  Does it mean that a man with one, two, or three acres of land in the midst of a number of people is entitled to get 40 acres of land in some other county?  Most of the people coming to my county from congested areas can get roughly 37 acres of land, with a good house and two good outoffices. No Meath man can get that. It would be far better if industries were established in these congested areas to absorb those people instead of moving them to other counties to create a problem there.  A new approach is needed so that justice will be done all round.</P>
    <P>We talk about the revival of the Irish language.  As far as I can see, the Minister is scattering the Irish speakers from the west of Ireland all over the country.  Many of them are brought to county Meath and put here and there and they will never speak the language because they have no one to whom to speak it.  It is a colossal blunder for one Minister to be trying to preserve the language and for another Minister to be trying to kill it.  Most of those migrants were good Irish speakers, getting a grant of £5 as Irish-speaking families. If the language is to be preserved, these people should be put in Irish colonies, but it appears the Government do not give a damn about the language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I have to say on the subject.  I have no objection to the relief of congestion in a reasonable way.  The type of migrant being brought up from the different counties is satisfactory.  These migrants work their holdings well; they are good citizens and we are all proud of them, even thought I am one of those who said a different thing 20 years ago; the people coming up now are a more industrious type of people.  My only complaint is that we have a problem in our county in that we must look after our own people first.  I ask the Minister to review the situation to see what can be done to provide farmers' sons with land.  I do not expect every farmer's son to get land, but it should be possible to allocate a certain amount on a lease or allotment basis.</P>
      <P>Many of these young men, farmers' sons, go to Warrenstown College and elsewhere to equip themselves as farmers and then come back to their own county in the hope of being able to purchase land.  When they discover this is not possible, they look for their passport and we never see them again. It is very unfair to see seven or eight men coming up from other counties and being provided with a new house, a fine farm and two good outoffices, while the farmers' sons in the neighbourhood are denied a hearing.  But for the fact that we are the type of people we are and that we ask our people to keep quite, telling them that agitation will get them nowhere, there would be almost a revolution in every county where there is land division to-day.  It is the good sense of the parish priest, the curates and the parishioners that there is not a burning agitation that could get out of control.  However, we have a Christian outlook and believe we ought to live within the laws as they are passed in this House.  The Bishop of Cork and other members of the Hierarchy have called on the Government to do something for the small farmers' sons and the Government should give serious consideration to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> In the allocation of land, whether to migrants or others, there is not enough care taken at the start.  A man is given, say, 37 acres of land but when he comes up to the holding, he finds that half of it is waterlogged and choked with rushes.  There was a farm divided some years ago in Dunboyne and the men who got that land got about 38 acres of rushes each and could not find a place to grow grass at all.  The very same occurred on another estate in Porterstown.  The allottees found the land waterlogged with no outlet whatsoever, due to the fact that the tributaries of the river were not cleaned up.  The county council had no authority to do it; the Board of Works would not do it; and the allotment holders could not do it themselves.</P>

      <P>While the Attorney General at times engages counsel to conduct the taking of depositions in the District Court it is not his usual practice.  In the case referred to the material received from the investigating Gardaí was not received in a form in which it could conveniently be made available to Counsel.  At the special request of the Attorney General the Chief State Solicitor assigned one of his most experienced assistants to conduct the taking of the depositions.  The preparation of the case for presentation involved the examination of many thousands of transactions representing millions of pounds sterling and the consideration of hundreds of statements taken from employees of the firm, investors and others.  Part of the Senior Assistant Solicitor's task was the examination of all this material and its reduction to measurable compass for presentation in Court.  For that purpose he had hundreds of consultations with Gardaí and other witnesses, the majority of which had to be held outside normal working hours.  The Solicitor's own work in making up the case for presentation in Court was to a large extent also carried out outside normal working hours.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General in view of the complexity of the case and the amount of work done outside normal office hours represented to me that the exceptional services rendered by the Solicitor in the case warranted recognition in the form of payment of a gratuity, and I agreed with that view.  In the exercise of my general powers, I occasionally authorise the payment of gratuities of this nature. A gratuity of £250 was paid to the Solicitor concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that any nugatory expenditure was incurred in this case.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is so wide that it admits of no ready answer.  Regard must be had to the cases of young offenders in varying stages of delinquency, as for example those who have not been charged but merely cautioned, those who have been dismissed under the Probation Act, those placed on probation, those convicted and sent to places of detention, to industrial or reformatory schools or to prison or detained in St. Patricks Institution, and finally, those who have been discharged from these institutions.  Moreover the treatment of juvenile delinquents who have been sent to places of detention or to industrial or reformatory schools is a matter for the Minister for Education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been dealing with the giving of farms which are waterlogged to people who have no means of availing of land reclamation schemes.  It is the duty of the Land Commission before allocating such land to see that it is drained.  If it is not, it should not be given to anybody unless he can avail of a land reclamation scheme.  It is disgraceful for the Land Commission to expect a family to come a long distance and try to earn their living on 27 acres of land, half of which is waterlogged and two-thirds of which is covered with rushes. They should give that family a holding upon which they can live.  It should be remembered that these people are not getting something for nothing. They have to pay their rents, rates and taxes over 60 years and I can tell Deputies that will be a dear little farm at the end of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the Land Commission estate at Summerhill is being held back for a number of years and I cannot understand why they are not allocating it. Some of the estate is in forestry and some has gone to local people, but I cannot understand why a scheme was not introduced long ago whereby all <Col N="1139" /> this land could be utilised.  There are two cottage tenants with families who have been living within that demesne for the past 30 or 40 years and who have ways and means of working the farm.  They had cows on an adjoining farm, but they had to sell them when the Land Commission took over the farm and divided it.  They did not get an acre; surely they are entitled to the land left on the estate.  I would ask the Minister to consider the position of these people.  They had a cow or two, but the Land Commission came in and dispossessed them.  They tried to hold the cow on the road but failed and had to sell it and the result was that now there are only two old goats on the road.  That is not fair to people of this type, people who are able and willing to work and to remain on, and who have sons to follow them.</P>
    <P>The Crowley Estate, which is near the town of Trim, is also a very important estate and one which has very good quality land.  People came from America, Europe and several other places to see the type of soil on that land.  That land will be allotted some time, but I should like to see a proper scheme worked out so that it will not be cut up into small patches.  I hope the people put on the holdings, which should be of a decent economic size, will get a proper living from them.</P>
    <P>The Murray Estate at Tanderagee is an estate to which four large migrant families were brought last year while at the same time all that was allocated to a neighbour were five acres of scraggy land miles away from anywhere.  At the same time, there was a man who had 25 acres of land, taken for the best part of 20 years, which he had stocked and worked himself.  He was ignored and thrown on the side of the road.  He had the ways and means to work it but the Land Commission saw fit to leave him high and dry and he had no land, not even on the eleven months system. More consideration should be given to people of that type.</P>
    <P>It is the very same in the Slane area. Three or four Meath men were asked to sign forms some years ago and were practically told by the local inspector that they would be suitable men to <Col N="1140" /> get land elsewhere.  They signed the forms under the impression that they would get holdings somewhere in the vicinity but they were left high and dry.  It is not fair to leave such cases on the long finger.  If a man is told: &ldquo;You are eligible and suitable for land; sign this form and we will look after you,&rdquo; it is not fair to do nothing for three or four years, leave him in suspense all the time, and then bring in somebody from outside and throw him aside.</P>
    <P>In regard to pumps on Land Commission holdings, I think we should work in conjunction with the country councils.  We do not want to see the Land Commission putting up a pump on one side of a holding and the county council putting another one up on the other side.  There should be joint consultations to spare money and let the pump serve everybody.  At present the Land Commission sink a pump 15 to 20 feet on the farm and regard that as being enough.  When May or June comes along, the pump runs dry and there is no water for three months.  It is most essential that holdings should have water, no matter what the cost, and a proper pump should be sunk if there is no water supply on the farm.  There is no point in giving out farm land which has no water because it is a big task to have to draw water all the year round.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see proper co-operation between the Land Commission and the county councils in regard to making roads.  In the past, there was very little co-operation but in the past two years there has been more.  In county Meath, we have embarked upon a scheme of making public roads out of lanes which are of considerable public utility, and even out of <i>culs-de-sac.</i>  When the Land Commission make a road, we should like to see them making it a reasonable size and in places which will suit the county council, so that when the Land Commission step out, the county council can step in.  There should be co-ordination between the county council and the Land Commission in all these schemes.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that, in 1932, 1933 <Col N="1141" /> and 1934, we started off on the migrant scheme by giving 19 to 20 acres of land to allottees.  That was the greatest number of acres they got. I once heard the Taoiseach say that 12 acres were sufficient for any man but he did not worry very much about the land.  We have hundreds of people of this type in the county Meath with 19, 22, or 24 acres of miserable land and these people are expected to live off that land.  Then we come along to give up to 37 or 40 acres of land with a better type of house and two new outoffices, whereas in the past we gave a rotten type of house and one poor outoffice.</P>
    <P>If times get slightly worse for these people, they will sell out and I know many of them who are contemplating doing so at the moment.  They are put to the pin of their collars to live there at all and they have a cruel existence.  When an estate is being divided up, people will go a reasonable distance, three or four miles, to get a number of acres.  People just cannot live on 20 statute acres and they have not got the slightest hope of getting land on the eleven months system.  As I said, if times get bad, they will sell out and we shall be back where we were 40 years ago.  We shall have the big land holder coming back again and the small men being squeezed out.  I should like to see those people who received small holdings at the commencement of land division being reconsidered for common grazing of 20 or 50 acres on an estate.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is looking into the position of game preservation. I hope he will be slow to bring in any scheme that will infringe on any individual's rights.  A man is fully entitled to his farm, to his home and to his shooting rights and I would not support any enactment which would deprive the individual of those rights.  We should do what we can to preserve game by the destruction of vermin.  If we can destroy the vermin which are detrimental to game, we shall be going very far. People have been waiting scores of years to own their own shooting rights and in most cases they own them now. <Col N="1142" /> They should be left with the right to sell the shooting rights to anybody they like.  If we can agree on the destruction of vermin, we can bring in something which will be satisfactory to all, but let us not infringe on the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the game preservation committee in Meath and the farmers there are afraid we shall infringe on their rights.  They must be told clearly that we shall not.  If they know that, they will join in the organisation and help it in every way they can.  In the past, very few people had shooting rights even on their own holdings.  They are in the happy position now that they can shoot over their own land or their neighbour's land with his goodwill.  What we want is the goodwill of the people, and we can have it if it is properly explained to them that we do not intend to infringe on their rights.</P>
    <P>We shall then be in the position that we can destroy the vermin which is so destructive and dangerous.  It is the vermin, and not the poacher with the gun, that do the most damage.  It is no harm for us to rid the country of the scaldcrows, the foxes and the magpies.  They destroy thousands of eggs and young birds in every county.  When they have gone, the game stocks will go up by leaps and bounds.  Nowadays meadows are cut around 5th June to 12th June.  We used to cut them between 12th July and August, when the game were strong and fit to fly, but now with the early cutting of the meadows, a hen pheasant or a partridge can be killed in the nest.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take into consideration some of the matters I have mentioned in connection with the grievances we have.  I ask him to give us more consideration when he is sending migrants.  We welcome migrants when they come.  That is a national and social problem and we have no objection to them when they are good, decent hardworking people. I want the Minister to try to devise some scheme which will be of more advantage to the people in the locality. The cottier with a family is entitled to <Col N="1143" /> have a cow.  A cow is most essential in the rearing of children.  In the past, the Land Commission embarked on a scheme of giving seven or eight acres to people, but they did not consider the type of people to whom they were giving the land.  They did not envisage that the moment it was vested in them, it would be sold.  Land should be given to men of character and ability, who will have families coming after them, and they have also a right to be able to keep a cow and some calves.  If a man is respectable, works hard, and takes on some other work when he can, he will not think of emigrating. He should be given a chance to settle down in his own country.  If there were co-operation between the migrants and the local people, many grievances could be avoided.  If we could have a 50-50 bargain, we would be satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen numerous cases of hardship where estates were divided and people had to leave land which their forefathers had worked before them, and look for work.  They had a moral, if not a legal, right to some portion of these holdings.  I have known people who had land taken from them, people who with conacre, or otherwise, had built up a small head of stock over the years. The land was taken and they were told: &ldquo;You must get out.  We cannot accommodate you any longer.  This land is to be divided up.&rdquo;  That is a case of hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who is prepared to work hard to accumulate capital, invest it in livestock or in land and is really desirous of getting a holding, big or small, deserves at least consideration. I do not believe everyone who applies for land should get it.  That would be <Col N="1144" /> completely unrealistic in relation to the people themselves and to the State. I hold that people who have shown themselves competent to work land, whether in conacre or otherwise, should be considered when estates in their counties are being divided.  They would make excellent tenants, indeed, in many cases.</P>
    <P>Again, it is hard to pinpoint what an economic holding is.  Like my colleague, Deputy Giles, I remember injustices which occurred in Meath when small holdings were foisted on unfortunate tenants.  That is entirely unrealistic. I have known cases of people who suffered absolute hardship, indeed agricultural slavery, and certainly if estates in their county are being divided, they should have first preference to enable them to enlarge their holdings.  They are deserving of that consideration because they have shown themselves to be industrious and hardworking. They have built up small stocks and they are the people we want on the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that half the uneconomic holdings are in the western counties.  That may be correct, but I can assure him that in Meath there are plenty of uneconomic holdings, particularly in the northern portion of the county.  I ask the Minister in future land division schemes to give these people every consideration.  They have shown they are capable of living and working hard on small holdings and if they were given more land, they would make a success of it.  They are deserving of any facilities the Minister is prepared to give them.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister has under review the position of non-nationals buying land in this country. I believe that is a complete defeat of the intention of our Land Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of stressing free sale can be pushed too far.  It was never envisaged that our land would be sold wholesale to foreigners at the expense of our own people.  I am prepared to accept the view that excessive buying of land should be kept under review.  Very <Col N="1145" /> often, large tracts of land are bought and later on thrown back to the Land Commission.  That should not be encouraged.</P>
      <P>Another matter I am concerned about is the undue delay in allocating land taken up by the Land Commission. I hold that in the matter of the 11-months letting, there is undue delay.  There are people with bits of land, and so long as land remains with the Land Commission, they will live in hope.  They should not be kept on a string for such a long time.  The Land Commission, perhaps, set land for a few years in order to get back some of the purchase price, but it is entirely wrong that there should be undue delay.  It gives a bad impression to the local people and it gives the impression to the incoming tenant that the land is less valuable when he gets it than it was when the Land Commission took it over.</P>
      <P>My colleague has dealt with most of the matters that affect county Meath.  I appeal to the Minister to give consideration to what I have said.  We have many cottiers in Meath who are quite capable of working the land, if they got it, as they have shown by their thrift and industry.  They are entitled to at least as much land as will support a small head of stock, a cow and a few calves.  Some of the biggest families in Meath started as cottiers and some of our finest people are living in cottages. The cottage scheme was an excellent one but it was a bit too liberal.  Everyone could get seven or five acres, but everyone is not as thrifty or industrious as he might be. If a cottier has shown himself capable of work and willing to put some capital into stock, he should be considered for a plot of five or seven acres, or whatever the Minister thinks fit.</P>

      <P>At Question Time just now, when I was asking a question with regard to the taking over of land for forestry purposes in my constituency, the Minister said I did not want them to get land for forestry.  I am glad he said that.  It brings up the very point I want to make here.  I can never understand <Col N="1146" /> why there should be these interminable delays between two sections of the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>I do not want the Forestry Department to get arable land.  I have always objected to the planting of arable land; it is a waste of good land.  We have not sufficient land to go around among uneconomic holders and those who require it.  That is why I have always objected to its acquisition for forestry.  The Minister and his officials know quite well that when another section of the Department has taken over tracts of land I have made representations on behalf of my constituents who are interested in the tillage portion of the land.  That is where the interminable delay takes place.  Is it reasonable?  You have the same Minister over both Departments and the same controlling secretariat and surely it should be an easy matter, if a Deputy goes to the Land Commission and says that the Forestry Section has acquired 50 or 60 acres and that contained within that estate are 20 acres of arable land, for somebody in the Department to pick up the telephone and ask that some official of the Land Commission should inspect that land.  One might reasonably expect that could be done within a few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister when replying to explain why there must be these delays. Why is it necessary, when one makes such representations, to wait three or six months before getting a decision? Further, I have waited three or six months and I have gone back to the Department and I have been told that the matter is under consideration.  Is there any reason for that?  In Land Commission administration is that any benefit to anybody?  Is it satisfactory administration if, as has been said by successive Ministers, it is their desire to have the land divided and utilised for the purpose of greater production? I take it that is the purpose of the Land Commission and what it was originally created for many years ago. Yet, in spite of the fact that there is less land, fewer estates to be divided, we still have this enormous staff in the Department.  No doubt they carry out the procedure of a trained secretariat <Col N="1147" /> but it seems reasonable to expect that there would be much more rapid division of land than heretofore.  I would ask the Minister when replying to give the House a clear and lucid statement about what happens when a Deputy or, indeed, an ordinary citizen, makes representations to the Department that another section of the Department has acquired arable land. What happens then and why are there these seemingly unnecessary delays?</P>
    <P>Deputies have spoken&mdash;Captain Giles was one&mdash;on the problem of the farmer's son.  I thoroughly agree with him; it is a very serious problem.  I conceive that the Land Commission was created for the purpose of trying to give land to those who have not got land or to provide a living for people who have not land by settling them on the land.  I cannot conceive that it exists for any other purpose but, with the archaic laws we have and the administration that is going on, one finds that the landless man cannot get land.  It is perfectly possible within the existing law for landless men to get land.</P>
    <P>When I first became a Deputy I found many cases of sons of farmers whose parents were not sufficiently well off to provide them with land and who had no opportunity whatever of getting it.  One asked a Parliamentary Question as to whether a landless man could get land and one was told he could but I have known no instance of a landless man getting land, except occasionally in the case of a herd employed over a great many years on an estate.  Some of them have got allocations and that was absolutely just. Even in cases where a fairly big estate was divided and where the smallholders had been accommodated in the district and there were perhaps ten or 15 acres left over, I have not known of a case where the Land Commission allocated that extra land to a farmer's son to enable him to stay in his own country.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at this from a reasonable point of view.  I have no doubt that he desires as a new Minister to do his best to see the Department properly administered.  What chance have the sons of a farmer say, <Col N="1148" /> with 50 acres of land, of staying at home unless the father has saved sufficient money to buy farms and stock and equip them?  He cannot reasonably be expected to do that because he has not the funds and, naturally, they turn to the Land Commission.  That poses the question: what is the policy of the Land Commission?  Is it their policy to put people on the land who have done well on the land, people who have proved they like farming and rural life and want to stay on the land in the districts where they have worked on the land since they were reared?</P>
    <P>There are many other cases.  I was very impressed with what the Deputies from Meath said.  It is absolutely true and it is an indictment of the administration of the Land Commission. The Deputies gave examples of people whose forefathers lived in Meath, perhaps in cottages, and who have taken land, perhaps sons of farmers, living on small farms.  Land was available there and they saw people brought in from the West of Ireland and dumped there.  I am glad to say that the Land Commission are not doing that in Wexford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we would stand up for our own rights.  I know the difficulties that existed in Meath and in Kildare some years ago and it seems to me that we are brought back to the old question: has the landless man who is fond of land any rights with the Land Commission?  The question can be answered in various ways, but I know the position in the Land Commission is that a person who gets land is, in the first instance, someone living close to the estate, within one mile.  If there are not people within one mile the Commission sometimes go to people within three miles.  After that, smallholders come in for consideration and then landless men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know many estates that have been offered to the Land Commission since I appeared in Dáil Éireann.  I know of estates that were not small holdings, and I know of some quite decent-sized estates.  There were many farmers' sons in the area and I know <Col N="1149" /> the pressure put on the Land Commission to take over those estates and divide them among those farmers' sons.  I want to be fair; that was not in the time of the present Minister.</P>
    <P>There was an estate in the neighbourhood of 600 acres, which, had it been taken over, would have set up the whole countryside which was comprised of small farmers.  The Land Commission would not take that estate in county Wexford because of some administrative quibble.  Since then, people have emigrated from practically every homestead in that district.  They were forced to do so. What else could they do in the circumstances?</P>
    <P>With increasing costs and increasing competitive conditions, the small farm does not go as far nowadays as it did at one time.  In the past, it might have been possible for farmers to save. There is also the point that in those days they accepted a lower standard of living.  Land was cheaper at that time.  It might have been possible for some farmers' sons, with the help of their fathers, to buy farms.  That day has gone and the problem is far more acute now than it ever was.</P>
    <P>I can only tell the House of my experience in my constituency.  If the Minister thinks I am not giving a true picture, he can refute my statement when he comes to reply.  An estate is usually taken over because it is constantly being let in conacre.  I know of estates in my costituency which were let for a considerable period.  These estates, when taken over by the Land Commission, are in poor condition.  They are run down as a result of being let in conacre for many years.  That is not the fault of the Land Commission.  However, they do not divide the estate in some cases for up to five years.  I do not say that that is the usual thing but it has happened in quite a few cases.</P>
    <P>Very often, people who take land in conacre, as Deputy Giles said, are hard workers.  They love the land. They want to stay in Ireland and own land of their own.  Others are farmers' sons.  The Land Commission lend the land and subsequently divide <Col N="1150" /> it, according to old, stereotyped rules. I am afraid it is bureaucracy.  They divide it into small holdings.  I have no objection if they do this but would it not be reasonable and to the ultimate benefit of the people who have been taking the land in conacre for years, maybe for ten years or so, to say: &ldquo;We shall give you a five-year lease of that land&rdquo;?  I should prefer to see them giving a ten-year lease of the land.  The Land Commission can do that within the present rules.  They could then say to the people concerned: &ldquo;If we are satisfied, at the end of that time, that you are improving that land and farming it properly, we shall renew the lease.&rdquo;  In other words, the Land Commission would then be a beneficient landlord.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission originally came into existence to divide land, the major portion of which was in the hands of landlords here.  Surely my proposition is reasonable?  If they worked the land well, as no doubt they would if they had a reasonable security of tenure, surely it would be an improvement on the system of taking land in conacre from year to year?  If the Department know anything about land, they must know that if it is let in conacre, it will become less fertile and poorer than if it is let on a ten-year lease.  Persons taking land on a long lease can build it up.  They can set a programme for themselves and prove they are worthy of the land.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would agree to do that, it would alter the whole complexion of the problem as it exists to-day.  It would lessen the dissatisfaction that exists in every area.  As Deputy Giles said, with all the frustrations and annoyance in relation to land to-day, we are a most law-abiding community.  If people ask to be allowed to lease land for a certain period of years, they are told that it is not the policy of the Land Commission to do so&mdash;because that policy is one they have had for 40 or 50 years. It is frustrating and is not achieving the object it was intended to achieve.</P>
    <P>Here is a factor which, I think, militates greatly against the Department getting land.  Recently&mdash;I think <Col N="1151" /> since the time Deputy Blowick was Minister&mdash;the Land Commission have been empowered to go into the open market to buy farms.  They have been able to get more land and, to a certain extent, the system has made the transaction more of a free sale.  Within reason, I believe in the free sale of land.  I do not want to see the land of Ireland bought out by foreigners.  I do not want to see rural Ireland made up of farms owned and occupied by non-nationals.  However, when the Land Commission come to buy a farm, the auctioneer who has the farm up for sale finds that if the Land Commission buy it, he does not get his auctioneer's fees.</P>
    <P>Human nature being what it is, it is only reasonable to assume that, even though the auctioneer will get a fairly reasonable competitive price from the Department, he will not let them know that the land is available.  He will try to sell it to some outside interest, where he may be assured of his fees. It is very simple and a small thing for the Minister to make it possible in these cases for the auctioneer to get his fees.  I have known several such cases.  The Land Commission could have got farms and an easy sale, provided they were prepared to go into the competitive market.</P>
    <P>What happens is that if someone wishes to sell a farm&mdash;maybe someone who has worked the farm very well but for some reason or another, cannot carry on and wants to sell it&mdash;and puts it up for auction, instead of the Land Commission bidding for the farm, they can send somebody else to bid for it, and nobody knows.  The Land Commission say: &ldquo;The sale may go ahead but it is sold subject to the Land Commission deciding whether or not they will take the farm.&rdquo;  That is not a free or satisfactory sale.  It does not seem equitable or just.  I think the Land Commission are losing a lot of money on that.  I have said much of this before&mdash;perhaps in a different way&mdash;in regard to giving an opportunity to people to get land who appear to be entitled to it.</P>
    <P>I fear the Land Commission are not moving with the times.  We must bear in mind that we are in a changing <Col N="1152" /> world.  Everything is different from day to day.  There is no use in trying to administer the Department on the basis of the same old laws and rules as existed 40 or 50 years ago.  That is my principal complaint against the Land Commission.  My other complaint, which I cited at the outset, is that I fail to understand why it should take weeks in the same Department to decide which section will take the land.  That is a matter to which the Minister should give his very earnest consideration.  If he does, he will achieve a great deal more efficient administration of both sections of the Department than is the case at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame Deputy Esmonde for not being acquainted with the problem of congestion but I certainly think he should at least have an idea of the purpose for which the Land Commission were established. As I have pointed out here before, the Land Commission were established not for the purpose of looking after landlords or any type of person other than congests, but to deal with the problem of congestion in cases where people try to eke out a livelihood on six, eight, ten or 12 acres of land of £3, £4, or £6 valuation.  They were established to relieve those people in the circumstances in which they found themselves.</P>
      <P>When a survey was taken of this country many years ago, a Congested Districts Board was established.  That was the one and only problem we were confronted with.  It was only when the bigger areas of land were taken over and divided and when the amount of land for distribution at a later period became much smaller that we seem to have pushed into this question of the landless man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point he made was that a person who is selling land should get the market value for it and that the Land Commission should be entitled to go into the open market and bid for it.  We had a Minister in Office representing the Coalition Government who brought in an Act covering that very point.  What did it do?  It created a racket which prevented the Land Commission from purchasing an acre of land, again because if somebody had a farm of land up for sale and the <Col N="1153" /> inspector of the Land Commission was prepared to bid, there was a puffer, or call him what you will, brought in immediately and whatever price the Land Commission inspector was prepared to bid, this individual was prepared to go higher because he thought the Land Commission would buy it at any sort of price.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission always find themselves in the position where they must halt.  They are not purchasing the land for themselves.  They are purchasing it for the relief of congestion and they must get the land at what they term a reasonable price for the purpose of allocation to whoever may get the land at a later stage.  We do not seem to realise these things in this House and they are things which we should study.</P>
    <P>Deputies talk about the delay in the provision of land.  I am fairly well acquainted with the problem. There are very many cases where the Land Commission take over parcels of land here and there which they have to hold because they hope day after day they will be able to acquire some more lands in the locality in order to bring in a scheme to cover the whole area in a satisfactory manner.  In that effort, they have my sympathy.</P>
    <P>In the main, there are two offices in my constituency.  One is the Galway office and the other is the Castlerea office.  I am delighted to pay a tribute to the people in these offices. We have in those places nowadays staffs who are of the people, who understand the people and who know how to deal with the people.  In that way, they are getting over the difficulties at a much faster rate than in the case of their predecessors who were not acquainted with the problem and did not understand the people.</P>
    <P>One of the things I find it hard to understand is the type of people getting land.  One man gets 35 or 40 acres of land and by way of rearrangement, gets an additional piece of land.  It is very hard to get the people living on 10 or 12 acres to understand why that happens.  It should be explained to them why this <Col N="1154" /> is done.  Rearrangement at the present time is going on very satisfactorily and the Land Commission are doing a good job in that direction.  I should like to pay tribute to them for the work they are doing in that regard.  It will take quite a long time.</P>
    <P>Some 30 years ago, when people got land, they did not mind very much whether it was five, six or eight miles away from them.  They did not realise that, when they went to plough or work this land, if the weather broke and it was a wet day, they would have to go home.  That has been changed by the Land Commission. The sooner we have compact holdings made, the better it will be for all.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, there are a number of cases where pretty large tracts of land are being sold without Land Commission interference.  In any place where there are 60, 80 or 100 acres of land for sale in the west of Ireland, every effort should be made by the Land Commission to take them over.  That would be one of the ways in which we could relieve congestion.</P>
    <P>In regard to migrants, they do not like going into strange territory.  They did not in former years get a céad míle fáilte from Deputy Giles.  I am very pleased that he has changed his mind.</P>

It appears, now that they have settled down, that they have made their presence felt in many different ways.  The first time our people came to Meath, you could not get anybody there to believe it was possible to till the land in Meath&mdash;you would only destroy it. In debate after debate here, we heard of all the racketeering going on, the lands that were being broken up and the number of wheat racketeers who were coming in.

I think Deputy Giles has wakened up to the fact that these people are good citizens. The Land Commission should give those people a further opportunity of showing how the work can be done by making more and bigger holdings available to them in Meath.  I remember Deputy Giles asking how a man with seven or eight growing sons could make a living on one of those holdings.

I ask the Minister to continue to give the Land Commission every opportunity to purchase land in the midlands and anywhere else, to try to thin out the thickly populated areas and give our people an opportunity of living on the land.  Nowadays, it is not easy to make a living on many of the holdings in the congested areas and every effort must be made to increase the acreage of these holdings as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently there was a farm in Blind-well offered for sale.  The Land Commission were asked to take it over but they did not touch it, because, as they said, there was not very much congestion in the area immediately convenient, that if they were to make a couple of holdings, there might be a row locally.  These rows fizzle out and the Land Commission should make the effort.  There was another farm in <Col N="1156" /> Carranseer.  In that case, it was suggested that the land was not very good. Nowadays, there are land reclamation schemes and the Land Commission should avail of them to put these lands in good shape.  They should carry out the necessary drainage and other work to put the lands in good condition. That can be done quite easily.</P>

It is a source of astonishment to me that Deputy Killilea, who has represented Galway for as long as he has, finds himself constrained to intervene in a debate of this kind and, beyond poking some fun at Deputy Giles, to the manifest discomfiture of Deputy Johnston who was sitting beside Deputy Killilea, has not a word to say&mdash;not a word to say&mdash;of what he sees every day around him in county Galway and what all of us who live west of the Shannon see&mdash;the derelict holdings out of which entire families have moved in the past two or three years.

      <P>I know Deputy Killilea's conscience is now at him <Col N="1157" /> and I do not blame him that his conscience is at him.  He is supposed to represent Galway and the people of Galway here and he is ashamed because he is afraid to speak for them now.  But, it is illusory, as all of us who know the west of Ireland well know, to believe that a family of seven or eight can live permanently on a holding of 20 acres and we have been accustomed to see the sons and daughters of that holding in the old days mainly moving into the towns and villages and getting employment amongst their own neighbours and some of them emigrating.  It is an entirely new phenomenon to me, as I believe it is to the Minister for Lands &mdash;and our memory goes back quite a considerable time in the west of Ireland&mdash;to see whole families leave, close the home and abandon the holding. I know one road in East Mayo and there are seven adjoining houses which have been closed down in the past two years, the whole families having gone out of them.  I wonder is there a Deputy representing any constituency in the province of Connaught, in Clare, Kerry and West Cork, who cannot recall, of his personal knowledge, one family gone and a house closed in a townland of which he knows.</P>
      <P>What is the reason for that phenomenon? What has happened to the people?  Why is the whole land settlement of this country being undone by this catastrophe?  That is something this House ought to ask itself when the Estimate for Lands is under consideration.</P>
      <P>I did not think Deputy Killilea would long stand this examination. We must praise him for the delicacy of his conscience that drives him out of the House when I rebuke him for his failure faithfully to report the facts as he must know them and as we all know them who come from the west of Ireland.  It is a very tragic thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The land settlement in this country was something of which we were legitimately proud.  There has been much adverse criticism of the Land Commission, but those of us who <Col N="1158" /> have had contact with foreign governments know that they have looked with admiration on the work done in Ireland by the Land Commission and have wished that they had evolved as early as we did so effective an instrument for the land settlement as we have employed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I look back with pride on the work the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board did for our people because it settled on the land of Ireland a vast community of property-owning farmers who lived in dignity and security in their own homes and it shocks me to see that pattern being shattered as it is being shattered at the present time.</P>
    <P>It often strikes me as odd that a Minister for Lands who was born in Mayo, who knows Mayo, can reconcile himself to the task of presiding over the operation of the resettlement of rundale estates and the enlargement of holdings in the congested areas, while he sees, at the same time, the evacuation of holdings going on.  I often ask myself how is it that he does not pause in his labours and say: &ldquo;Is this not like sealing one of 20 holes in the bottom of a bucket?  For every area I settle, ten other areas are producing derelict holdings, with nobody living on them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is, I think, one of the most grievous problems of land settlement in Ireland at present because, quite apart from the personal sense of loss any of us feels in watching this evacuation of our neighbours from their own country, there is the economic disaster that each of these small holdings, whether it be 10 or 20 or 30 acres, begins to decline the day the family which owns it leaves.  The reason is that what actually happens, when a family goes to England, is that the holding is set in conacre and anybody who has any experience of it knows that a holding built up by the labour of a family over two or three generations requires to be in conacre for only two or three years to see its output reduced by one half, and within five or six years it is a miserable rush-infested property grazed by a few store cattle, well on its way to reversion to marsh or bog.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> That is the problem the Land Commission ought to be excogitating and that is the real problem this House ought to face.  They should ask themselves why it is happening and what if anything can we do to reverse the trend which is proceeding.  I know why it is happening because I live amongst those people and incidentally I am one of the thousands or tens of thousands who get my living out of those people. I see employed between 50 and 60 people, all of them depending on these small farmers for their living, all of whom will lose their employment if the present trend continues, and that is reproduced in every country town in Ireland.</P>
    <P>People in this House habitually forget&mdash;they are so accustomed to residence in the City of Dublin&mdash;that if you compare the total number of persons employed in our cities on work not connected directly or indirectly with agriculture, with the number of persons employed on small holdings, in the service of those who live on small holdings and in the production of goods purchased by people who live on small holdings, it is the small holdings which are carrying all of them or the vast majority.  If these small holdings are not only abandoned but cease to produce, the reaction on people living in towns or cities will be catastrophic. So long as full employment obtains in Great Britain and the United States, the consequences of that are largely concealed from immediate perception because, instead of accumulating in a mass unemployment situation here, they pass out of the country at the rate of 100,000 young persons in three years.</P>
    <P>I do not think that rate of emigration, or that type of emigration, has been known here since the Famine. Catastrophic as the emigration was economically in the Famine period, there were always left at home people who kept the land in production.  That is not happening now and this whole problem is extremely complex because emigration in the last century was attended by destitution, hunger and poverty and our people were going out as unskilled labour of a very poor kind with the result that they were cruelly exploited in the countries to <Col N="1160" /> which they went.  They excited indignant reaction at home and immense exertion to eliminate the evil which was causing this desperate type of emigration. That is what precipitated the Land War and all the effort that was put into getting rid of landlords and making people secure in their holdings. That element is not in the present situation.  With the state of full employment obtaining in Great Britain and the United States, that atmosphere of destitution, woe and misery that used to attend emigration has disappeared.</P>
    <P>There are no American wakes. There is now no desolation, or weeping at the railway station.  There is no feeling that when your children go you may never see them again because they are going so far away that they cannot come back.  That is the way it used to be 100 years ago, even 50 years ago, in rural Ireland.  But today these people can go more readily to Birmingham and come back from thence than their fathers and grandfathers could have gone to Dublin or Mullingar. There is proceeding this desperate&mdash; and it can only be described as desperate&mdash;disaster of a steady efflux of the most productive elements of our community and in a form which is not only depriving us of their potential effort but which is leaving after them land which was producing and which is directly heading for a period of progressive dereliction until, in effect, it is producing nothing.</P>
    <P>That is the problem with which the Land Commission is confronted and when I see the amount of money we spend every year and the apparent indifference of a Deputy like Deputy Killilea to these developments or the apprehension perhaps in Fianna Fáil Deputies' minds that it is not tactful to mention such matters in Dáil Éireann at this time, I am sometimes tempted to despair of our Government.</P>
    <P>There is a terrible danger in complacency.  One of the dangers of a Government getting a clear majority in this House is that they simply, as we say in the country, sit on their sash, do nothing, and so long as they do nothing they are unlikely to come in for very serious criticism from their <Col N="1161" /> supporters and they feel that in the last analysis, no matter how stringently they are criticised from the Opposition, the Whips can be put on and they get their majority and stagger on.</P>
    <P>However, I think Deputies, to whatever Party they belong, have a duty to bring the facts of which they have as much knowledge as I have to the attention of the House.  Maybe they do it behind the closed doors of the Fianna Fáil Party room and believe that, having done it there, they have done their duty but I think that is a mistake.  This Parliament functions not only as a legislative body but as the sounding board for public opinion in this country and we have all got a duty if an evil exists to expose it here and to urge on the responsible Minister speaking on behalf of the Government to tell us what plan, if any, the Government have to meet the problem we know exists.</P>
    <P>What is the problem?  One of the problems is that we used to believe, and I think it was at one time true, that on a 30-acre holding in rural Ireland an Irish family could get a modest standard of comfort, and there were a sufficient number of people in our country who preferred the security, the dignity of life, the peace of their home and the right to call themselves their own masters, to maintain a steady supply of Irish families who would prefer to live on the 30-acre holding than to go and earn a high industrial wage over in America or in Great Britain and accept the position of a paid servant living in a flat or a rented room.</P>
    <P>Thus you would always get a minority who would want to get back, particularly young people who would want to see the world for a while, but they would tend to return home as soon as the opportunity offered.  That certainly was the case in rural Ireland. It was the way in places like the Rosses in West Donegal, and it was very striking to see how, in that desolate area in West Donegal, you would see a house rising up in what seemed even to me, coming from Ballaghaderreen, a very arid area.  But, as surely as you inquired, you would be told: &ldquo;That <Col N="1162" /> fellow was in America and he came home as soon as he had enough made.&rdquo; His yearning was to come home and very often it looked as if the house was out of all proportion to the resources of the farm for which it was built to cater.  Yet one watched with admiration when American money was invested in a holding of that kind; what looked like a derelict farm began to thrive and prosper, and little families grew up.  This was because they wanted to come home, and they wanted to come home because they made their choice.</P>
    <P>They preferred the limited income in the atmosphere of home and Ireland to the larger income they could get elsewhere.  I remember once standing on the end of the Mullet of Belmullet, on a winter's day, speaking to a man and it struck me that he had an American accent.  I said: &ldquo;Were you in America?&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;Yes; I was in Providence, Rhode Island.&rdquo; I asked him: &ldquo;What brought you back to the Mullet of Belmullet from Providence, Rhode Island?&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;I will tell you.  There were four or five of us in Providence and we could not get work.  We would sometimes have a job and we would sometimes be out of work, and we put our heads together and made up our minds we would come home to Belmullet to improve ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It struck me that that man was a very wise man.  When he was in work in Providence, Rhode Island, he was relatively affluent but he had always hanging over him the apprehension that he would again be unemployed, and when he came home to Belmullet and bought a small holding he felt then, though he might never know the periods of affluence he enjoyed in Rhode Island, yet he would never know the periods of destitution involved in unemployment.  Here is the kernel of this matter.  His experience had taught him that in Belmullet from Binghamstown down to the end of the Peninsula, he could get a modest living.  Sometimes he would do well, sometimes not so well, but he would always have a living.</P>
    <P>Do you realise what you have done? I think through sheer incompetence and <Col N="1163" /> inadvertence you have created a situation in which you have rendered 80 per cent. of the holdings west of the Shannon uneconomic.  You thought when you were raising the cost of living on everyone in the country that it would all be set right by raising more taxes for recompensing the civil servants and white collar workers, and by arranging for consultation between the Trade Union Congress and the Federated Union of Employers whereby employees would get ten or twelve shillings a week added to their wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The one category of people who were forgotten were the small farmers living on the farms for which he is responsible.  The Minister for Lands is now faced with the position that the farms on which he settles the small farmers will not now produce the wherewithal to raise a family. Their income is going down.  The price of what their land produces is going down but the price of all they have to buy is going up, and they have no organisation to speak for them but that army of 100,000 people who have marched out of Ireland in silence. They are the silent demonstrators. They are the strikers of rural Ireland, but instead of picketing their homes they are picketing the mailboat and the transatlantic aircraft.  I do not believe you have realised what you yourselves are doing; the frightful problem is how can we undo what you have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have wrecked and disrupted the whole economy of a vast countryside and to those of us who were born and reared in that countryside it is very dear to us.  The more one sees of this House the more it is borne in on me how little do those who live and get their living in this part of Ireland understand the problems of the West, the South-West and the North-West.  I say quite deliberately&mdash;and I know whereof I speak&mdash;that the time now has come to face the problem of helping the small farmers in the areas for which the Minister for Lands is primarily responsible. <Col N="1164" /> You cannot any longer run away from the consequences of your own actions in that part of Ireland.  You have been forced by organised labour to make the adjustments which were the inevitable consequence of your decision to allow the cost of living to rise.  You have now to pay the piper in the West of Ireland or see that whole area abandoned.  Even if you steel your hearts to let them go, that does not solve the problem because the economy of this country will not function; the economy of this country is not viable without the output of the land upon which those people live.  If they are suffered to go and if that land is suffered to become derelict, there will ensue, albeit not without some delay, economic consequences which will roll up to the thresholds of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, as certain as we are in this House.</P>
    <P>If those people are not there to buy boots, to buy clothes, to require transport, then those who are producing these services and goods will feel the draught and feel it soon, because not only is the purchasing power of those people disappearing but the wealth produced from their holdings is going too.  One of the remedies for that, and it had better be faced&mdash;I think the Land Commission must face it&mdash;is to come to the West of Ireland and look at the derelict holdings.  They have an obligation now to pay the full market value for these holdings because I do not think we can afford to let them go unproductive.  There are too many of them.  Their present owners are getting a miserable conacre rent, whether they are in Birmingham or Newark, New Jersey, and of course living so far from home they get these rents very irregularly.</P>
    <P>I think there is a great deal to be said for at least acquiring as many of these holdings as we can get their owners to agree to sell to us, and divide them amongst the neighbours so that where we had a 30 acre holding in the past, and it is abandoned, we can buy it and add 10 acres to three neighbouring holdings of 30 acres and on them restore the people's ability to survive.  If we do that, I think we shall find sufficient people prepared to <Col N="1165" /> make the effort of holding on to their homes rather than accepting the alternative of emigration.</P>
    <P>I was in my own home not so long ago, within the past month, and a man of 70 years came in to me.  In fact, I wrote to the Land Commission in connection with the episode.  That man said to me: &ldquo;Mr. Dillon, could you get me four or five acres on to my holding?&rdquo;  I think he had a holding under 20 acres.  I asked him the circumstances of the neighbours around about him, and he had not the smallest holding in the area.  I said: &ldquo;You will find it hard to persuade the Land Commission to give you an enlargement, if there are smaller holdings in the area.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;This is the position.  It is hard for a man of 70 who has raised 10 children on a holding like mine when the tenth comes to him and tells him, in his seventieth year, that he wants to go away.&rdquo;  I asked him why the tenth wanted to go away; he was the last one left and would normally get the place.  He said: &ldquo;He does not want the place, Mr. Dillon.  It will not give him the kind of living the young fellows will accept now.&rdquo;  I could not deny that.</P>
    <P>I know where he comes from.  I know young lads who went from that area and they came home for a holiday from England; they were able to flaunt money; they were able to show new clothes; they were able to demonstrate that they were having a relatively good time.  The disparity had grown so wide that the fellow who was offered the home place&mdash;remember, 40 years ago, it was a matter of anxious inquiry amongst the members of the family as to who would get the place&mdash;did not want it.  His reaction was that he would sooner go away.</P>
    <P>I think the only solution for that situation is to face the fact that these holdings must be further enlarged, to face the same fact in respect of agricultural holders in the west of Ireland as we were forced to face in respect of civil servants, the Garda, the Army, the white collar workers and organised trade union workers: if you deliberately increase the cost of living, <Col N="1166" /> you must make corresponding adjustments in remuneration.  The only way you can do that in respect of the small farmers is by enlarging their holdings because their problem is further complicated by the fact that the average price they are getting for their output is going down.</P>
    <P>It is as simple as this: a man with 28 acres may have four, or maybe, five cows; two years ago, he would have had five calves, which were worth £100; this year, they are worth £50. I could go over each particular item, whether it be turkeys, pigs, or fowl, and demonstrate that, in respect of each item, there has been a substantial reduction in the money value of the same volume of output.  The small farmer just cannot carry on.  Certainly his children will not face the task of carrying on.  The only way you can meet that situation is to do for the small farmers what has already been done for the industrial workers, and every other section of the community, and the only way you can do it for the small farmer is by expanding his holding.</P>
    <P>I tried to do that through the Land Project.  I remember standing on the side of the road near Killala and looking over the hedge at a holding there, and asking myself: &ldquo;What can we do for these people?  We have not got the land to give the enlargement we should like to give them.&rdquo;  I remember thinking to myself: &ldquo;Well, if we cannot give them 30 acres where they had 20, the next best thing we can do is to try to make the 20 produce as much as the 30.&rdquo;  Remember, they are hardworking people.  There is a lot of trivial city talk in this country suggesting that farmers will not work hard and comparing them with the farmers of Denmark and elsewhere, to the disadvantage of our own.  That is all cod.  Any man who rears a family on 20 or 25 acres works hard. If he does not, he will starve.  The vast majority of our people, if they were sent down to live on these holdings, would be dead of starvation in six months.  Nobody could live on them without working hard.  You <Col N="1167" /> cannot make bricks without straw and, if you have not got the land, it does not matter how hard you work because you cannot produce more than the land is capable of producing.</P>
    <P>I tried to remedy that by simply helping them to make the land more productive than it was, thus increasing the return for their labour. Granted we do all that, and make the land as productive as we possibly can make it, we shall have to enlarge the holding.  I see no way out of it except by purchasing the abandoned holdings.  Mark you, this is an urgent matter because, if this haemorrhage of humanity from the west of Ireland continues, it will become an irreversible process.  If it is allowed to go on to the point where the towns and villages break down and begin to close up shop, then these areas will become uninhabitable.  The whole life of that part of the country is a parochial pattern and, if you disrupt that pattern, it will collapse and disappear.</P>
    <P>People will not live now out in a deserted area where there is no town and no centre to which they can come in from time to time to see a picture, go to a dance, meet the neighbours, attend a market, or do their shopping. If the towns and villages reach a certain stage, they will disintegrate.  To me, it is one of the most exasperating experiences that I see these things happening before other people are prepared to face them and, though you implore people to see what is coming into being, while there is still time, nobody wants to face problems of this kind; they turn their backs and let things drag on until the time comes when one can do nothing about them at all. <Col N="1168" /> I do not think we can calmly accept that the whole of our country west of the Shannon is to be virtually abandoned. I do not accept that.  It certainly is not necessary.  It can be prevented.  Quite possibly, this catastrophic development of the past three years is largely the result of inadvertence on the part of the Government. I do not think they realised what they were doing; I do not think they thought about it.  They thought that the traditional pattern of the small farmer in the west, tightening his belt and lowering his standard of living would meet the situation.  They forgot the pull of full employment in Great Britain and the United States of America.</P>
    <P>I heard some Deputy here&mdash;I think it was Deputy Giles&mdash;speak of people being given holdings which were a mass of rushes.  That shocks me.  I did not think that was possible.  I did not think the Land Commission would ever put a man into holding in that condition.  I know that cases may arise in which there is an economic holding of 28 acres and the Land Commission may throw in a couple of acres of bad land for the purpose of determining the viability of the holding, but I never heard of the Land Commission giving people land which was covered with rushes.  I shall suggest to the Minister, if we are all here alive and well on Tuesday of next week, that a far greater degree of collaboration between his Department and the Department of Agriculture is requisite, if this problem is to be effectively tackled.</P>
