      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 8, 9, 10 and 11.  If not already reached, it is proposed to interrupt business at 1 p.m. to take Nos. 10 and II and when completed to resume the order.  Questions will be taken at 3 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that if Motion No. 30 on the Order Paper is not brought before the House in this session, the Waterford-Tramore Railway, to which it refers, will be closed and the line taken up by C.I.E. before the House, re-assembles.  In view of that, I think the Taoiseach should be prepared to give some Government time to have that motion in the name of my colleague, Deputy Kyne, and myself discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies are desirous of bringing matters before the Dáil and if delay would result in irrevocable developments, I do urge upon the Taoiseach that the Government have an obligation to make it possible for these matters to be discussed here.  I understand the point the Taoiseach seeks to make in regard to the various transport legislation but I do submit, sir, that this House is entitled to discuss anything by way of motion which Deputies believe affects the public weal, subject to certain limitations in respect of attacks on individuals or matters of any kind which are excluded. I would strongly urge on the Taoiseach that in view of the feeling of Deputies in regard to these matters and with special reference to the possibility of irrevocable developments, Deputies ought to be allowed to present their constituents' views to the House before these decisions have become irrevocable by the actual removal of the railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are Deputies who think that the Transport Act, 1958, should be amended so as to make the decisions of C.I.E. in these matters subject to review by the Dáil, a motion to that effect would certainly be in order.  But we must not try to amend the legislation by implication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The line will be taken up.  If there are any delaying tactics by the Taoiseach and the Government, it is only to cover up C.I.E. and let them get away with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that, in addition to the motion on the Waterford-Tramore Railway, there are also motions on the West Clare Railway and the West Cork Railway, would the Taoiseach not consider giving time to take the three motions together?  We only want to protest to somebody about wrong being done and to point out certain things which we were not given an opportunity of discussing with C.I.E. or anybody else. We were permitted only to discuss alternatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and later on the Chair, that while it is in order for Deputies to move to amend the legislation or to submit a resolution to that end, we should not be discussing motions here to resume powers which we have deliberately given to the Board of C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make this proposal? If the matter is referred properly to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges arid the Committee on Procedure and Privileges determine that this motion is no breach of privilege, may we assume that the Government will then make time available for the discussion of the motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that if this House want to revoke these decisions of C.I.E., Deputies have to propose legislation to take back from C.I.E.  the powers the House deliberately gave them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that is not entirely true.  I think anybody has the right to raise the general question of transport policy in Dáil Éireann. Surely we have a right to come before the Dáil and say our constituents are suffering from certain lack and that it is the duty of the Government to remedy it?  Surely this is a reasonable proposal?  If the Committee on Procedure and Privileges agree that these motions are not a breach of privilege, will the Government provide time to discuss them together? That seems a reasonable suggestion. This is a very urgent matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it the Taoiseach and the Government will consider this matter and perhaps deal with it at the earliest time available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can think of nothing more stultifying than to have this House discussing motions that can have no effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would press on the Taoiseach not to consider it futile but to consider it important that we should get a modicum of time to discuss these motions.  If Parliament is to function properly, I suggest the Taoiseach has an obligation to meet us half-way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which I brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges some years ago.  It is a matter on which I have expressed views on many occasions. If a motion which I think would be the correct type of motion to submit to the Dáil&mdash;namely, one which recognises that the Dáil had already taken a decision in this matter when passing legislation and which called for a modification of that decision&mdash; is submitted, I would consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion was accepted by the Ceann Comhairle and by the Clerk and surely the Taoiseach has not the right to say what is to be discussed in this House?  He has not <Col N="771" /> the right to say that it cannot be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. What I said was that we are not prepared to give Government time for discussion of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do urge on the Taoiseach that the very test of democracy is not the size of the Government's majority but the consideration which the Government shows for the wishes of the Opposition.  The Taoiseach may hold strong views.  We hold equally strong views and surely we are entitled to express these views?  The Chair has accepted this motion.  If it is a breach of privilege, we are as anxious as the Taoiseach not to pursue a breach of privilege but if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges rules that it is not a breach, the damage may have been done before it comes up for discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill will be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that, in considering this Bill, Deputies will certainly have in the forefront of their minds its application to the action of the United Nations now proceeding in the Congo, but I should like, at the beginning of my remarks, to place the measure against the wider background of our attitude and obligations as a member of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second reading in July of the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1960, which was limited to six months, I <Col N="775" /> mentioned that, foreseeing the possibility that requests of the kind with which we were then concerned in relation to the Congo might be received from the United Nations, the Government had had legislation for this purpose under consideration for some time; and I indicated that it was proposed to ask the Oireachtas to pass a permanent Bill with a clause requiring approval of the Dáil by resolution before it could be given effect in any specific instance.  The Bill before us is of this character.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Dáil approved unanimously on 25th July, 1946, a motion recommending the Government to take steps to secure this country's admission to the United Nations.  On that occasion a very full debate took place in the House on the motion and on the United Nations generally.  It is true that the Dáil and the country were then less familiar than they are today with the United Nations Charter, and that, because of the situation existing in the Security Council, the United Nations has evolved in a somewhat different way from what was anticipated at that time.  In 1946 the Charter was little more than a year old and the Organisation had only just begun to function. Nevertheless, fourteen years later the debate which took place in July, 1946, can be held to have been extremely relevant to the implications of membership of the United Nations and, in particular, to the issues which arise in considering the present Bill.  Two things will, I think, strike anyone who reads that debate now.</P>
    <P>Firstly, there was a very proper insistence by all speakers on the obligations which membership of the United Nations would impose on this country.  Secondly, there was, not only on the vote but in the many speeches made, a striking unanimity of view that this country should become a member of the United Nations despite its possible defects and the uncertainties surrounding its future development.</P>
    <P>The Charter imposes on the members of the United Nations quite substantial obligations.  Among the <Col N="776" /> purposes set out in Article 1 is the taking of &ldquo;effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace and for the suppression of acts of aggression and other breaches of the peace&rdquo;; Article 2.5 provides that &ldquo;all members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter and shall refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action.&rdquo; Chapter VII of the Charter provides more specifically for members making available to the Security Council &ldquo;on its call and in accordance with a special agreement or agreements, armed force, assistance and facilities, including rights of passage, necessary for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.&rdquo; The obligations under this particular Chapter of the Charter received special attention in the debates here in July 1946.  The failure of the permanent members of the Security Council to agree on the implementation of these provisions has, however, meant that they have not been implemented, and hence that the particular requirements there laid down do not at present apply.  But the more general provisions to which I have referred concerning participation by members in action by the United Nations to maintain peace and to counter aggression are applicable; and they clearly indicate that such participation is required by the spirit of the Charter.</P>
    <P>Apart, however, from the formal obligations accepted under the Charter there are, in my view, additional reasons why members and in particular small countries like Ireland, should be prepared to contribute positively to the achievement of the objectives of the United Nations.  All countries suffer, to a greater or lesser degree, from the consequences of international conflicts and disturbances.  The smaller states are, however, in a particularly difficult position in such circumstances as, while they are inevitably affected by the results, their individual efforts can do little to influence world events.  This at once explains and justifies <Col N="777" /> that special interest they have traditionally taken in encouraging such courses of action as are calculated to avoid the danger of major conflicts which, in the present cold war situation, is inherently present in every international conflict or disturbance which arises in the world. Furthermore our own Constitution proclaims, as an aspiration of our people, concord with other nations, and, in Article 29, solemnly affirms Ireland's &ldquo;devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations, founded on international justice and morality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government are convinced, and I believe that this view is shared by all members of the House, that it is in the best interests not only of this country but of the world generally that we bend all our efforts to the attainment of these objectives and to the establishment of the rule of law in international affairs.  It will hardly be contested that the United Nations represents the best&mdash;indeed, the only available&mdash;instrument in existence for channelling such activities.  As we see it, therefore, it is not only our moral duty but in our national interests to support the growth of the influence and power of the United Nations, to acknowledge its right and function to act in any situation in any part of the world that may endanger peace, to encourage action under its auspices in such circumstances, and to be prepared where necessary to contribute from our resources to the fulfilment of these responsibilities by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>It is for these various reasons that the Government recommends to the Dáil the Bill now before the House. Under it the Government of the day will have power to answer a call from the United Nations to make contingents of the Defence Forces available abroad as part of an International United Nations Force for the performance of duties of a police character. The Bill provides however that, except in certain clearly defined cases, the exercise of this power will be subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann in each instance.</P>
    <P>While what is proposed is a permanent <Col N="778" /> law which would be desirable and necessary even if the present situation in the Congo had never arisen, it is that situation which is the immediate occasion of the Bill.  As Deputies know, we agreed last July, with the co-operation of the Oireachtas in enacting the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1960, to accede to a request from the Secretary-General of the United Nations to make a contingent of Irish troops available for the Congo in response to an appeal addressed to the United Nations by the Government of the Congo and endorsed by the Security Council.  We did this because the request seemed to us, in all the circumstances, a reasonable one by reference to our membership of the United Nations, and because we were satisfied that the action which the United Nations proposed to take was in the best interests of the Congo, of Africa and of world peace, and that our participation in the action could contribute to its success.</P>
    <P>In the intervening period the situation in the Congo has, unhappily, not improved as we had hoped.  Indeed, that country has been beset throughout the past five months with a state of unrest, confusion and dispersal of authority which are most unfortunate. Few Deputies will doubt, however, that the Congo situation would have been a great deal worse than it now is, if the United Nations had not intervened, or, indeed, that the peace of the world might have been gravely endangered if, in the absence of action by the United Nations, there had been rival interventions in any form by the great-power contestants of the cold war.  If the United Nations effort should fail there, the consequences could be very serious indeed, and not only in terms of damage to the effectiveness, power and prestige of the United Nations but also for the future of other new states now emerging into independence in the African continent, or hoping to achieve independence in the early future, and for the prospects of relaxing the world-wide tensions which threaten the general peace.  We have, of course, no guarantee that the United Nations operation will succeed. For the sake of international tranquillity, <Col N="779" /> we must sincerely hope that it will and that within a short time the Congo will be firmly set on the road of orderly government and internal stability.  Such a development would not only eliminate all the dangers for international peace inherent in the present situation but would also provide a fruitful and most encouraging example of the power for good in difficult situations of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the Defence (Amendment) Act of July the Government made available for the United Nations force in the Congo a contingent consisting of two battalions, of which the first went abroad in July and the second in August.  The original request from the Secretary-General had called for only one battalion.  A few weeks later, however, Mr. Hammarskjoeld advised us that the total forces available to the United Nations in the Congo were far from adequate for the needs of the situation, and he appealed for a second Irish battalion.  Notwithstanding the deterioration in the Congo situation which had then become apparent, the Government decided to accede to this request also, but in so doing declared that the two battalions could not be available for more than six months, i.e. the limit of the period covered by the Defence (Amendment) Act.  The Secretary-General was informed at the same time that any contingent this country might find it possible to send to the Congo thereafter could not exceed one battalion.</P>
    <P>Last month we initiated arrangements with the United Nations for withdrawal from the Congo by 25th January of the two battalions now there.  When we did so, the Secretary-General requested that we should make available one battalion after withdrawal of the existing contingent. The Government have been giving sympathetic consideration to this request.  The measures needed to give it effect, including the selection, equipment and inoculation of the personnel involved, are best taken over many weeks.  The Government have, therefore, thought it wise to put a battalion in readiness for service in the Congo so that it would be available to go <Col N="780" /> there in time should it be decided to send it.  Only soldiers who volunteer for the operation will be included in the unit.</P>
    <P>If, as I hope, the Oireachtas approves the present Bill, the legislative basis will exist for dispatching one battalion to replace the two now in the Congo when they have been withdrawn.  I wish to make it clear, however, that whether or not this new battalion will go to the Congo will depend on two conditions.  The first is that, in the judgment of the Government, the situation there requires the continued presence of a United Nations force and of European contingents in that force.  The second condition is that the objective of a United Nations force in the Congo will still be as it was when the first contingent was dispatched, that of helping to keep peace and order in the Congo while the Congolese people and leaders are getting themselves organised and able to carry that obligation themselves without United Nations help.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Taoiseach, but would he repeat the two conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first is that, in our view, the situation there should still be such as to require the continued presence of a United Nations force and of European contingents in that force.  The second is that the objectives of the United Nations in the Congo should still be as they were when the first contingent was despatched, that is to say, keeping peace and order while the Congolese people and their leaders are getting themselves in a position to carry that obligation themselves without the help of the United Nations.  If, when the time comes in a few weeks for definite action, these two conditions are fulfilled, the battalion will be placed at the disposal of the United Nations.  It will be understood, however, that, as in the case of the first contingent, the period during which the new battalion will be available in the Congo will not exceed six months.  This does not mean that we have reason to believe <Col N="781" /> that the presence of some United Nations forces in the Congo will not be required even after a further six months.  It is because we think that, in the prevailing tensions and climatic conditions of the Congo, it is not desirable to keep personnel there for longer periods than six months at a time and also because we think it is reasonable to limit our commitment in that way.</P>
      <P>Because of the tragic loss of Irish lives in the Congo operations of the United Nations, and because the preservation of order and protection of lives there have involved clashes with sections of the Congolese peoples whom we desire only to help, and the possibility that similar clashes may recur before order is finally restored under a functioning and representative Congo Government, it is understandable that we face the enactment of this measure, and the possible dispatch of another Irish contingent, after the battalions now serving there have been withdrawn, with greater anxiety, arising from clearer appreciation of the hazards attending the enterprise, than we may have had in July last.  I feel, however, that all Deputies, like the vast majority of our people, understand the importance to mankind of the task to which we have been committed, and that we could not, in conscience or in honour, withdraw from it so long as there is, in the judgment of the United Nations, a continuing need for our help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending the elaborations and details of this proposed legislation by the Minister for Defence, which I assume will follow, I think the carefully considered statement of the Taoiseach calls for some remark. I feel sure the Taoiseach will agree with me that the occasion of permanent legislation for the purpose of regularising the dispatch of Irish troops abroad, in the service of the United Nations, for the preservation of peace is one that all of us would wish to avail of to pay tribute not only to the performance of our regular Army in preparing the contingent called for last summer with quite dramatic despatch <Col N="782" /> and efficiency but also for taking their place in the Congo far earlier than might ordinarily be expected from what is a relatively young Army.  I think this is a suitable occasion to express here in the Oireachtas our admiration of the credit done to this country by our Army's performance in that regard.  Nor should this occasion pass without our mentioning again our sorrow and our admiration for the young men who gave their lives in the Congo in defence of a great principle, the preservation of peace far from our own shores but with the ultimate end of protecting this country from the possible consequences of a disruption of world peace.</P>
      <P>It is right that we, who are responsible for sending them there, should refresh our memories and recall what we had in mind when we took the decision to despatch our troops so far from home.  Here I make a certain reservation.  When the Taoiseach spoke of appreciating, perhaps today better than we did last July, the great hazards, I think on reflection he will agree that we did appreciate the hazards and the dangers into which our Army was going but in the full knowledge of that we felt that even though some of them had to die so far from home history would have it to tell that they really died in defence of this country in the preservation of world peace and in the protection of Ireland from the consequences of a conflagration which might immediately start there and spread to destroy both us and a great many more.  It should be a comfort even to those they left behind to realise that there can be no doubt whatever when they died in the Congo they were serving no illusory purpose but that of the ultimate defence of Ireland and the things for which Ireland stands in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say clearly that, in principle, we approve of providing Irish troops to assist United Nations action abroad for the preservation of peace. That being so, we approve the principle of this Bill.  The Congo situation must naturally be present to our minds in the consideration of legislation of this kind although, as the Taoiseach rightly points out, this legislation is of a permanent character and does not <Col N="783" /> relate exclusively to the Congo situation as it appears today.  I think we do realise, and should keep constantly in mind, the rigours of service and the climatic and health difficulties that exist for Irish troops in the Congo.</P>
    <P>I was a little surprised, therefore, to hear the Taoiseach say it was the Government's intention to accept as normal a six months' period of service in that area.  This area, certainly the coastal regions of it, approximate to the old Gold Coast, now Ghana, in climatic conditions and I have always been told that European personnel serving there, whether in the Army or the Civil Service, have usually served a three months' term.  That was considered as long as it was prudent to require people accustomed to our kind of climate actively to serve in conditions such as obtain in the Congo. It is true, of course, that in different parts of the Congo various climatic conditions prevail.  Perhaps the occasion would be availed of before we conclude our consideration of this Bill to advert to the question as to whether the period of service in the Congo for our troops could be abbreviated by providing that they would return every three or four months while others take their place.</P>
    <P>It is right for us to face the fact, which I believe to be true&mdash;and I do not believe there is any use mincing words about it&mdash;that if everybody decided they wanted the Congo situation to settle peaceably and the sovereignty of the Congolese people to be effectively implemented, there would be relatively little difficulty in achieving it.  Let us not minimise the problem of bringing so large a territory as the Congo under what we understand as ordered government. Let us not forget or appear to forget the tribal character of the population and the special problems which arise there and which are not familiar to a normal European in established society.</P>
    <P>I believe these difficulties could have been overcome, and could still be overcome, if outside nations were not concerned to keep the pot of dissension boiling in the Congo.  If outside <Col N="784" /> Powers make up their minds to frustrate the efforts of the United Nations to help the Congolese people to the achievement of ordered institutions, it will be a virtual impossiblity to bring about the developments we so earnestly desire, that is, that the people of the Congo should live in peace, freedom and ordered conditions under a Government of their own choosing.  Nor should we recoil from the responsibility of naming the powers responsible for preventing a happy solution of the Congo problem if and when it becomes clear that the possibility of a solution has receded from our grasp.  Let us continue to hope and to pray that the worst efforts of those concerned to maintain chaos will fail and that the purpose of the United Nations will succeed.  I think it will be the duty of our Government, whenever and in whatever circumstances that duty may arise, having taken our full part in proportion to our resources, in the effort to establish the sovereignty of the Congo people in their own country, to name emphatically any power which seeks to frustrate the common purpose of the United Nations in which we have played our part.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated that the mind of the Government was that before despatching the third battalion to replace the two battalions we are contemplating calling home after their period of service, two considerations will fall to be examined: one, whether the situation still requires United Nations forces in the Congo and whether those forces require European contingents, and two, whether the conditions continue to represent a true effort to enable the Congo leaders and people to prepare themselves to take over and maintain their own government.</P>
    <P>I see the force of the considerations mentioned by the Taoiseach but I think we have to clarify our minds so as not to constitute ourselves a court of appeal from the decision of the United Nations.  At an early stage of this matter, the Taoiseach said that he did not want Irish troops serving under the United Nations insignia to be serving as Irish troops in the field, <Col N="785" /> but to be recognised as serving as United Nations troops in the field.  I think he is right.  We are there only as participants with the United Nations, joining our common effort for a common cause.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if, at some stage, the Government would face this dilemma.  If we are to constitute ourselves a court of appeal from the decision of the United Nations that the situation still requires United Nations Forces in the Congo, and that force should contain European contingents, or as a court of appeal from the decision that conditions still continue in the Congo which require United Nations personnel there in order to facilitate the preparation and establishment of orderly government by the Congo leaders and people themselves, does that not carry us much further than the decision that we should send troops to the Congo?</P>
    <P>If we set ourselves up as a court of appeal from that decision and signify and express dissent from the decision of the United Nations by withdrawing all our troops, despite their request that we continue to participate, surely then, if we, acting as a court of appeal from the decision of the United Nations, determine that the United Nations are not in good faith in seeking to maintain forces in the Congo with European contingents, and are not in good faith in believing in maintaining such conditions as will enable the Congo leaders and people to establish free government institutions for themselves, we are arrogating to ourselves the right to judge the United Nations and, if that judgment be adverse, and we reach the conclusion that the United Nations are no longer acting in good faith, we could no longer participate in an organisation we believed were concerned to prevent the Congo people from establishing their own Government.  If United Nations forces, with European contingents, are maintained in the Congo for any purpose other than the purpose originally stated by the United Nations, I feel that our position would be extremely ambiguous.</P>
    <P>I mention that now only because I <Col N="786" /> think the Taoiseach understates the case by saying that he will review the two conditions he mentioned, and conceives the possibility of a situation arising, as a result of that review, in which the Government would determine to withdraw the two Irish battalions and despatch no battalion to take their place.  If such decisions were arrived at on high policy grounds, very much wider issues would require to be considered.  If the Taoiseach has any knowledge of such issues being in the offing, I suggest to him that, the sooner he lets us know about them, the better.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the difficulties of keeping accurate day to day contact with every development in connection with the events in the Congo.  I welcome and cordially approve the present visit of the Chief of Staff and the officers who accompanied him to visit the forces in the field.  Quite apart from their purely military function, I recognise that the Government are in some difficulty in getting reliable political appreciation of the situation from day to day and week to week as it develops in the Congo.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said, when the initial legislation was under consideration last summer, that he accepted the obligation to keep the Opposition as fully informed as he was in a position to do about the events in the Congo. I am bound to say that perhaps the Taoiseach did provide us with all the information that was available to him, but if he did, then I deeply sympathise with him in his responsibility as head of the Government, if the sum of the information which has reached him approximates to the sum of the information which has reached me from him, because, apart from some antediluvian resolutions passed from time to time in the United Nations Organisation in New York, faint duplicates of which were sent to me in envelopes from time to time, I have received virtually no information from the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I think it right on this occasion to say that I did not conceive it to be my duty to maintain a barrage of questions to the Taoiseach who has plenty to do and many responsibilities to <Col N="787" /> grapple with, or to clamour for information I felt that he might not be in a position to provide.  The Taoiseach rightly emphasised, opening here today, that the decision taken heretofore in regard to our action in the Congo and our participation in United Nations activities received the unanimous approval of Oireachtas Éireann&mdash;of Dáil Éireann, in any case.  I think he rightly attaches value to that unanimity.</P>
    <P>I do not allege against him that he concealed from Deputy Corish and myself anything we ought perhaps to have known, but I am bound to record the fact that if he has no more information than he has imparted to Deputy Corish and myself, he must have very little.  I am bound to record the fact also that if Deputy Corish and I have not appeared to be more exigent in our demand for information, it has been because we felt bound to regard the Taoiseach's undertaking as being one he would feel binding upon himself and that if he was not volunteering more information than he was, it was because it was not available to him.</P>
    <P>I suppose it will not produce much result to make this affirmation, and yet I make it.  I and any other Deputy could indulge in violent and inflammatory talk about the forces that all commonsense men who have knowledge of world politics know to be operating in the Congo at present. Anyone who knows anything of world politics at present realises that there are powerful forces seeking to insert themselves into the Congo situation and that the least interest of these forces is the welfare of the Congo people.  I could animadvert angrily and eloquently on the iniquities of those who would exploit the Congo situation to serve a remote world purpose.  I do not deny a temptation to do so, but it is atemptation I am going to withstand because I believe it would do nothing but cause embarrassment and difficulty, not only for our own Government but for our troops in the field.</P>
    <P>Yet, I do not want silence in respect of that aspect of the matter to be <Col N="788" /> taken as meaning that if other Deputies choose to get up and make wild and whirling allegations of what is proceeding in the Congo, these are the only voices being raised in defence of what they choose to describe as lofty ideals.  The silence I impose upon myself, and which perhaps the Taoiseach shares in respect to these complex issues, is a silence deliberately chosen in the knowledge that certain fundamental principles have guided our actions heretofore and that we are in support of troops whom we have sent to the field to serve certain clear and peaceful objectives&mdash;the preservation of peace and the defence of the ultimate right of the Congo people to determine their own form of Government and to establish it in peace and order in their own country&mdash;that we have no other interests, that we are concerned to defend those interests, but are not so foolish as not to realise that other influences are operating, too.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any exhortation from any part of this House to Deputies to refrain from reckless and partisan talk will avail of anything.  It is for that reason I desire to go on record as saying that, although whirling words may be spoken here, if they are not effectively and trenchantly rebutted in the course of this discussion, it is because we believe that higher interests, not least those of our own troops in the field, can best be served by watching these forces in discreet silence at this time and with the firm resolution that should they effectively frustrate the higher purpose of the United Nations, in which we have our small participation, it will then be time to take the appropriate steps.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we approve the permanent legislation on the grounds I have set forth.  Naturally, we shall expect to hear from the Minister for Defence in the course of the debate some amplification of the administrative details involved in this legislation, on which someone more competent than I in respect to the technical administration of defence will have some comment to make from this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to <Col N="789" /> the general principle embodied in this Bill.  In 1946, the House unanimously agreed that we should apply for membership of the United Nations and when we were ultimately accepted, there was no objection from any side of the House, or indeed from any section of the community.  The only thing I find peculiar is that, although we have been a member of the United Nations for a number of years, this is the first piece of legislation introduced to enable us to fulfil our obligations to the United Nations.  I do not blame anybody for that.  However, it seems strange that various Governments&mdash;and I suppose I must take my share of the responsibility&mdash;omitted to introduce such legislation.  It was only when the Congo affair, as it is sometimes described, arose this year that enabling legislation of a temporary nature was first introduced.</P>
      <P>We are told by the Taoiseach that this is the permanent Bill to enable us to send contingents abroad.  While approving the general principle, I should like to ask the Taoiseach some questions.  The word &ldquo;contingent&rdquo; is very loose.  I wonder would the Taoiseach consider having it defined in greater detail?  A &ldquo;contingent&rdquo; can mean anything.  I do not know the exact strength of the armed forces at present but I assume it is in the region of 10,000.</P>

      <P>In this Bill, we are giving permission to the Government to send up to 8,000 men to places such as the Congo.  Must we not have regard not alone to the population and resources of the country but to the size of our Army?  Any other country in the United Nations would, I think, agree that we should send forces to places such as the Congo in accordance not only with our population and financial resources but certainly the strength of our Army.  A situation could arise in which the United Nations might request us to send a contingent of 1,000, 5,000, 6,000 or even up to 7,000 men.  We should have an assurance from the Taoiseach that such contingents will always be <Col N="790" /> a fixed proportion or percentage of our total armed forces.</P>
      <P>Perhaps in present circumstances one would say that we need not worry about that but the world situation changes so rapidly that there might come a time in the near future when it would be necessary for us to maintain a pretty big proportion of our Army on active service in this country. So far as Section 2 is concerned, the Taoiseach should make quite clear what is meant by the word &ldquo;contingent&rdquo;. At the present time we have two battalions in the Congo, which amount to approximately 1,300 officers and men.  That is a pretty big contribution from an Army of approximately 8,000 serving soldiers.  I am not saying that we are more than filling our quota in making our contribution towards the policing of the Congo but it does seem to me to be a pretty big proportion in relation to the strength of our armed forces.</P>
      <P>In July of this year, great stress was laid on the nature of the work and the activities in which our soldiers in the Congo were to be engaged.  Their duties were described as being of a police character.  All of us are conversant with the duties of the ordinary policeman&mdash;he is expected to maintain law and order.  I know it is difficult for the Taoiseach to describe exactly the type of activities in which our soldiers are engaged in the Congo but it does seem to some people that they are engaged in duties that could not be described as being of a police character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I raise today is whether or not they are fully equipped to carry out the duties assigned to them.  Objection was taken in this House recently to questions being asked about the nature of their equipment and the plea was made that such questions were not fair to the relatives of the soldiers killed in the Congo recently.  I have no intention, and I am sure there was no intention in the minds of the people who raised those questions, to hurt in any way the relatives of those who died in the Congo in recent weeks, but that does not mean that we must not raise our voices in this House to ensure that <Col N="791" /> our soldiers in the Congo will have a reasonable chance of defending themselves and of survival in any conflict in which they may be engaged.</P>
    <P>When the temporary measure was introduced and discussed in the House in July last, I raised the very same questions.  I said that it would be too late afterwards to examine our consciences as to what should have been done in order to ensure that our soldiers in the Congo would be adequately equipped to look after themselves and ready to meet any situation that might arise.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Congo at present is not very clear to the majority of the people of this country. How far the Taoiseach can go in telling us the actual situation, I do not know.  The overall authority in the Congo rests with the United Nations and, in particular, with the Secretary General and some of his assistant secretaries.  There has been some concern, and there still is, as to the nature of the duties in which our soldiers are required to partake.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has already referred to this matter and has referred to the fact that the Taoiseach has kindly communicated to him and to me, and perhaps to some other members of the House, certain information which comes to him through the United Nations.  I should like to thank him for that information, but when I speak here this morning, I speak on behalf of the ordinary folk who would like to know a little more about the Congo and about the part the Irish soldiers are playing there.  There were allegations here last week which were answered by the Minister for Defence regarding the incident in which Irish soldiers lost their lives.  There did seem to me to have been quite a long delay between the time at which the ambush took place and the time at which word of it was sent back to the headquarters from which the patrol was operating.  It did seem to me that the patrol could have been better equipped.  That is not the fault of the Minister for Defence or the Government; it is the fault, if there is a fault, of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> I think our soldiers in the Congo should be given a fair chance.  We know that it is not their task to mow down the Congolese but they should have a fair chance to protect themselves and the best chance they could be given is to provide them with adequate equipment.  The Taoiseach should assure us that our soldiers are equipped as best they can be and that all measures will be taken to ensure that more lives will not be lost.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Defence also said that this particular patrol did not have a wireless transmitter.  I know that our soldiers were in a fairly primitive part of the world but surely it must be within the resources of the United Nations to provide such an elementary piece of equipment to a patrol in the year 1960.</P>
    <P>I could not follow the Taoiseach in all he said and it might have been a good thing if he had circulated at least a portion of his speech to the House. He said that we would send contingents in future to places like the Congo, if, in our view, the situation still required it.  He used the words &ldquo;if, in our view.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach should expand further on that matter of our sending further troops to the Congo.  I may have taken him up wrongly.</P>

I should like to have that point cleared up and perhaps the Taoiseach would refer to it when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Government are kept in the picture by reports from the United Nations but I should like to ask the Taoiseach if we have any reports from our own representatives in the Congo.  So far as I am aware, the only Irish people in the Congo are the soldiers serving there.  I advocated in July last that there ought to be <Col N="793" /> somebody sent from the Department of External Affairs who could send back reports to the Government from the point of view of the Irish people. I wonder if that is still possible, bearing in mind the present situation in the Congo.  I know that there was an incident last week when a diplomatic representative&mdash;I think, of Ghana&mdash;was molested in Leopoldville. I think it would be a tremendous advantage to the Government if they could communicate his reports to some degree to the Irish public and it would allay the undoubted fears that are in the minds of a number of people here.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach should also consider a Parliamentary delegation to the Congo.  I do not suggest a delegation of anything like 12 or 15 or 20 people, but I honestly think the Taoiseach should consider sending a Parliamentary delegation to the Congo to see conditions for themselves, to try to assess the political situation there and, in particular, to satisfy themselves, or otherwise, that the conditions under which the Irish soldiers are carrying out these police duties are satisfactory.  A delegation of three or four from the Seanad and Dáil would, I think, certainly help to allay the undoubted fears which many people here entertain at present.</P>
    <P>On Section 3, I should like the Taoiseach to say whether or not this is the fact in accordance with the proposals in the section: I take it that, as far as the present personnel of the Army are concerned, they would not be required to go in present circumstances to the Congo, unless they volunteered, but, on the other hand, is it a fact that as far as new recruits are concerned, it is obligatory on them to go abroad, if they are so directed?  As far as I can see from that section, that is what is meant&mdash; that future recruits, from the date of the passing of this Bill, will be required to go to any place abroad to which they are sent by the Army or by the Government, but as far as present personnel are concerned, they will be asked to volunteer and may refuse to go abroad.</P>
    <P>I approve of the general principle <Col N="794" /> of the Bill and I should be obliged if the Taoiseach would satisfy my mind on the questions I have raised.</P>

The Taoiseach moved the Second Reading but he has not given any explanation of the sections and I think, to put the matter in order, the proper procedure now would be for the Minister to explain the measure.  The questions Deputy Corish raised in the latter part of his speech could then be properly raised on the statement made by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give a general explanation of the Bill.  As the House knows, the Bill is necessary to permit of external service by our troops with international United Nations forces.  It is intended to cover the despatch of personnel to unarmed United Nations forces such as the Observation Group in the Lebanon or the Truce Supervision <Col N="795" /> Organisation in Palestine, as well as to armed forces such as that established for duty in the Congo.  It will be noted that only in the case of international forces engaged in the performance of duties of a police character will the question of sending Irish contingents arise.</P>
      <P>Under Section 2, it is provided that the prior approval by resolution of the Dáil will be required in any situation in which it is proposed to send a contingent consisting of more than 12 members of the Permanent Defence Force to an armed United Nations force.  This upper limit of 12 has been set to meet situations in which the United Nations might seek the services of only a small number of specialists or key personnel for an armed force and it would not be considered necessary to approach the House with a resolution of approval in the case of the despatch of such a small number or in connection with contribution of personnel to unarmed organisations such as those I mentioned earlier, those in the Lebanon and the Truce Supervision Organisation in Palestine.</P>
      <P>Section 3 deals with the question of liability for external service&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister deal with paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of Section 2?  It states: &ldquo;the contingent is intended to replace, in whole or in part, or reinforce a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force...&rdquo;  Does that mean the Government could send any force at all?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be a matter for us to decide naturally, bearing in mind the availability&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but is it the Dáil or the Government would decide it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In that respect, it <Col N="796" /> would be the Government.  If the resolution had already been passed to despatch a contingent in a certain instance, then the question of replacing them or reinforcing them would obviously be a matter for the Government to decide, in the light of the circumstances obtaining.</P>
      <P>I was dealing with Section 3&mdash;the question of liability for external service. This is the point Deputy Corish raised.  The liability for external service will apply in the case of existing members of the Permanent Defence Force only where they consent in writing to accept it, while personnel who join after the date of the enactment of the Bill will be liable for service abroad as part of their normal conditions of service.  In other words, anyone who is appointed or joins the Army after the Bill has been passed will accept, as part of his conditions of service, liability for service abroad with United Nations forces.</P>
      <P>Section 4 provides that troops serving with an armed United Nations force will be regarded as being on active service.  This will not apply in the case of personnel serving with unarmed United Nations forces.  The point there is that there are different disciplinary provisions in connection with personnel who are on active service as against normal peacetime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 also provides for some necessary amendments of the Defence Act, 1954, in the matters of a transfer of personnel between service corps, transfers to the Reserve, and discharge. Under the Defence Act, 1954, soldiers enjoy certain rights in these matters and experience has shown that in order to secure that flexibility and stability, without which it would not be practicable to assemble and maintain abroad in future a contingent such as that dispatched to the Congo, some curtailment of these rights is necessary during actual service abroad.  That is the experience we have gained in respect of the contingent that has been sent off already.  Experience has shown the necessity for this curtailment of these rights under the Defence Act, 1954.  The intention is, therefore, that as regard these matters a period <Col N="797" /> of service abroad will carry the same restrictions as are already laid down in the Defence Act, 1954, in connection with a period of emergency at home.  The position in these respects of personnel already serving abroad is safeguarded under subsection (7) of Section 4.</P>
    <P>The provision in subsection (5) of Section 4 is made for the purpose of removing a doubt as to the applicability of the regulations in question to courts-martial convened abroad for the trial of personnel of the Defence Forces on offences relating to the person or property of a person not subject to military law.  Under existing legislation, the convening of such courts-martial would depend on the consent of the Superintendent of the Garda Síochána within whose district the offence was committed.  This restriction has accordingly been removed in connection with external service.  These courts-martial will, of course, be convened by and consist of officers of the Defence Forces, and will be otherwise strictly in accordance with the provisions of our existing Defence Forces legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill is designed to grant facilities in the matter of the making of wills, facilities which it is customary to provide for soldiers on active service.  The main purpose is to provide that the will of a soldier on active service may consist of a document not attested and also that a mere verbal statement of his wishes will be sufficient, if such statement can be satisfactorily proved.</P>
    <P>Section 6 has been included in order to secure the formal registration here of the death of any member of an Irish contingent serving abroad and, in cases where families accompany members, a death or a birth in the family.  I should like to mention by way of explanation that in certain circumstances the United Nations authorise personnel to have their families with them.  Two of our officers serving with the Truce Supervision Organisation in Palestine were so facilitated.  This section is being given retrospective effect to 1st October, 1960, in order to cover the deaths <Col N="798" /> which have already occurred in the Irish contingent in the Congo.  The proposed arrangements will facilitate the procurement here at home of certificates in respect of births and deaths occurring abroad.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill do not appear to call for any comment, except to say, in connection with the repeal of the temporary measure, due to expire in January next in the ordinary course, that the position of personnel already serving abroad has been safeguarded in the preceding sections.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, it is the intention to have the troops at present in the Congo home by 25th January next and no member of that contingent will be on external service after that date, unless, perhaps, at his own written request and in accordance with the legislation now before the House.  When I say &ldquo;perhaps at his own written request,&rdquo; I want to make it clear that the mere fact of a person applying to stay on in the Congo after 25th January does not mean that his application to stay on will, in fact, be accepted.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered all the different sections in the Bill.  If, however, there is any point upon which Deputies are not clear, I shall be happy to deal with it before we pass on to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been clearly stated that we approve the principle of the Bill.  The Bill calls for very little comment.  I am glad the Minister has explained the various sections.  Sometimes, when sections are not explained, it is not clear what is intended.  However, that is not the situation with regard to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to any number over 12, a resolution will have to be passed before they can be sent abroad.  On the analogy of an illegal assembly, anything over three may be regarded as a contingent, but up to 12, no resolution will be necessary.  As far as the resolution is concerned, the Oireachtas will be fully informed of the future intentions of the Government in relation to action elsewhere than in the <Col N="799" /> Congo.  This is a permanent measure. Let us hope we shall not have any more situations like that in the Congo, but, should such situations arise, the Government will have authority to send any force that may be required after a resolution has been passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The power to send unarmed forces &mdash;observers, or whatever they may be &mdash;is very essential.  With regard to the question of liability for service, it is right that the Government should decide a matter of that kind after a resolution has been passed by both Houses.  We can be proud of the fact that this country has grown up and there is no longer any cavil at a proposition of this kind.  That is a welcome indication.  The definition of active service is essential.  I hope the Government will interpret it in its broadest connotation.</P>
    <P>On the question of transfers, as the Minister pointed out, serving personnel have certain rights in their particular units.  In a situation such as exists in the Congo at the moment, it is not possible, of course, to keep people in their respective units.  Therefore, it is only natural that the commanding officers would have authority to transfer them from one corps to another for the better administration of the unit.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I approve of the proposal in relation to court martial proceedings to enable them to take place abroad as well as at home and to be carried out in the most effective way. I am not clear as to whether United Nations personnel in other armies may be called.  I am anxious to have it confined to officers of the Irish Forces&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than that officers of other forces should participate.  Provision in relation to wills is something that has existed in respect of the British and American armed forces for a considerable time. It is a useful addition here but there is a danger of abuses in it.  I am not happy about the position in regard to verbal transmission but I suppose <Col N="800" /> in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is the best way out of the difficulty.  I am glad it is made retrospective to this year.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the Leader of the Opposition has stated our position on this matter.  With him, I want to pay a tribute to the work of the Army in their preparation for the sending out of these units and the speed with which the arrangements were carried out.  It is clear that a great effort was made to ensure that their health would be preserved while on active service; inoculation as far as humanly possible has been given.  Therefore, what Deputy Dillon said about the three or four months' period of service does not apply now as it did in the past.  Three or four months' service in Africa was previously regarded as a long time because there were no antibiotics or vaccines to protect the health of the troops.  Today there is a great improvement in that regard and the six months' period is safe enough because of the care the medical personnel in the Army has taken.</P>
      <P>I approve of the Bill and I trust that the nation will not be called upon to act on its provisions very often.  I trust also that the United Nations will succeed in their objective in establishing in the Congo an independent nation for the Congolese people and that we will have played our part in establishing the necessary form of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to make quite clear my attitude towards the United Nations.  I believe that if this attempted rescue action of the United Nations forces in the Congo fails, then not only will the situation be desperately serious from the point of view of the Congo itself and its unfortunate people, but the repercussions of its failure throughout the world must be positively calamitous for the future of civilsation.  Therefore, I, as much as anybody in this House, want the Congo action to succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of my anxiety in that regard, I have at times questioned the Taoiseach in order to see if there was anything we could do, small and all <Col N="801" /> as we are, to help the Secretary-General, Mr. Hammarskjoeld, in his formidable task in the Congo.  I do not wish to take advantage of the Government's difficult position in this matter but I believe their attitude since July could be described either as extraordinarily ingenuous, on the one hand, or extraordinarily irresponsible, on the other.  With the scantiest possible knowledge that any private Deputy in Parliament could have, it seems clear to myself and Deputy McQuillan, at any rate, that this Congo action was taken at a time when serious political developments were taking place, that is, of course, the proposed secession of Katanga, the proposed partition of the Congo.  It was clearly taken at the time when the military considerations were of certain importance and when the political considerations were of equal, if not of greater, importance.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, we suggested, so that Government would be <i>au fait</i> with the remarkably quick-changing situation in the Congo, that a personal political representative of the Taoiseach should be sent to the Congo with our forces thus enabling us to take any action we thought fit in the circumstances.  The Taoiseach refused to consider that suggestion.  It seems to me he attempted to establish the most remarkable situation conceivable.  He attempted to attribute to the United Nations, and to Mr. Hammarskjoeld in particular, the quality which we normally attribute to the Pope in the Vatican&mdash;the quality of infallibility.  According to the Taoiseach, we contributed this force to the United Nations forces in the Congo, and thereafter their actions were independent of any considerations we might have or the Government might have about developments in the Congo.</P>
    <P>I am glad to notice that the Taoiseach is now prepared to repudiate that doctrine of infallibility which he attributed to the United Nations, and has now admitted to us that there could be circumstances in which the Government might decide not to accept their obligations under the United Nations Charter or their <Col N="802" /> interpretation of their obligations under the United Nations Charter.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that on Wednesday, 23rd November, the Taoiseach answered a Question put down by Deputy McQuillan and myself.  In volume 185, column I, of the Official Report, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I there pointed out that the Irish contingent in the Congo would be subject to the orders of the United Nations Supreme Commander and not to the orders of the Irish Government and that, while it could be said that we were not sufficiently informed about the situation...</P>
    <P>A remarkable admission as I pointed out at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>...we should not, in my opinion, regard ourselves as being under any obligation to make that appreciation.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with that astonishing statement made by the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I still think that the attitude there defined is correct, despite the very confused and complicated political situation which still prevails in the Congo.  In my view, therefore, it would be a mistake to act in the manner suggested by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Taoiseach is now prepared to make a reappraisal of the situation in the Congo from our point of view.  He said circumstances are envisaged under which it might be necessary for us to recall our troops or not to send another battalion.</P>
    <P>I have not the advantage of the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Labour Party of being kept in close contact, as they have said, with developments as they are reported back to the Taoiseach.  I am completely dependent on what I read in the papers.  I read as extensively as I can in my attempts to assess the development of the situation in the Congo.  I am, I need hardly say, not only disturbed about that situation but also about our attitude during the months in which our troops have <Col N="803" /> been in the Congo.  In order to know whether my fears are unfounded, or my conclusions unwarranted, I should like to examine the position as I see it developing, and as I have seen it developing since last July when we sent our troops.</P>
    <P>This debate is being carried out in the shadow of a very threatening situation&mdash;civil war.  Ever since the 11th or 12th July last when Mr. Lumumba and Mr. Kasavubu asked for support&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is all I want to do.  We are discussing this decision in the shadow of a meeting which is taking place today in the United Nations in which it is understood that a number of nations&mdash;four of the 15 nations &mdash;who now have troops in the Congo are seriously considering the withdrawal of those troops.  The reason they are seriously thinking of withdrawing their troops from the Congo is that, in their opinion, they are being misused.  I want to put it to the Dáil that our troops have been misused, on the political side certainly, during their time in the Congo since July last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put to the Taoiseach once again the <Col N="805" /> desirability of sending a personal representative, a political representative, to the Congo in order to enable us here to assess the situation fully.  The position is that the United Nations are now divided on this whole Congolese operation. We ourselves, on Tuesday week last, voted against the Western alliance, if you can call them that, the Western powers, in their attempts to stop the Afro-Asian Conciliation Council going to the Congo to assess the position there.  Further, we abstained in the vote taken to decide as to whether the present so-called head of the central Congoless Government, Mr. Kasavubu, or his representative should be seated at the United Nations.  Therefore, it seems to me quite clear that there is considerable confusion at the United Nations and a considerable difference of opinion, and that our Government is not at all satisfied about the action of the United Nations forces in the Congo.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said in his opening statement, we were invited into the Congo by Mr. Lumumba and Mr. Kasavubu to try and restore order. The result of his invitation to the United Nations forces, of which we were a part, is that he, Mr. Lumumba, now finds himself in jail, a deposed Premier.  It has been said that our force was intended and will be intended to act as a police authority or a police force.  Nobody would quarrel with that suggestion, but on which side have we acted and on which side do the Government intend to act in the future?  During our time in the Congo we have stood by and watched the elected Premier of the Congolese people, Mr. Lumumba, who had the largest single party in the House of Representatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Our troops have been used in the Congo to establish a dictatorship under Mr. Mobuto, who has taken the Premier of the Congo, Mr. Lumumba, and imprisoned him, having beaten him up.  Our troops did not act as police in that situation. They acted as observers.  They stood by while it went on.  When I talk about &ldquo;our troops&rdquo; I am talking about the United Nations forces, but our troops could easily have been there.  Surely it was our responsibility to intervene in that case? The United Nations forces should have intervened in that case. Are our troops to continue to accept the position where Mr. Mobuto is now effectively a military dictator in the Congo, responsible to nobody?</P>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the United Nations have now little or no control in the Congo?  Is it not a fact that the United Nations have asked the present so-called head of the Congo, Mr. Kasavubu, for information about Mr. Lumumba and their request has been completely ignored?  Is it not a fact that the United Nations have asked Mr. Mobuto for information about Mr. Lumumba and have been told they will not be allowed to see him?  Is it not a fact that in the Congo at the moment a state of anarchy reigns and that our troops necessarily have been party to the development of that situation, or to the deterioration of that situation, and that our Government have stood by while the Belgium mining interests have reinforced the troops which existed in the Congo at the time of the alleged leaving of the Congo by the Belgians?  Instead of 1,000 Belgian troops, there are now 6,000 Belgian troops there as a result of a recruiting campaign carried on in Belgium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, as part of the United Nations force, have stood by.  That is not a police action.  It is simply a futile procedure.  Are we going to continue that policy?  It is quite clear now that <Col N="807" /> the situation has got completely out of hand and that if we send these troops to the Congo, we are sending them into a situation which is highly dangerous from their point of view because of the imminence of civil war. We are sending them into a situation in which it appears they have absolutely no powers whatever.  This is due primarily to the fact that the Belgians made no serious attempt to establish a position in the Congo wherein the Congolese people might take over Government.  Further, they took every possible precaution to ensure that Mr. Lumumba, who was the real elected leader of the Congolese people, would not become the effective Premier and they worked, from the time of the liberation of the Congo until the present day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach in his opening statement referred to two conditions which might arise in the near future and which might change the Government's attitude with regard to sending a further contingent to the Congo.  They were, first, if it were decided it would be more advisable to have a non-European contingent in the Congo and, second, if the objectives of the United Nations forces had changed in the meantime.  Surely Deputy Dr. Browne is entitled to a definition on these two particular aspects as pointed out by the Taoiseach?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much concerned that this United Nations action might fail.  It is a matter of great <Col N="810" /> seriousness from the point of view of this country and I want to know whether I am right or wrong.  If the Taoiseach does not agree with me then he can refute whatever points I make which may not be valid.  It seems to me that our troops in the Congo have been used and, if they are sent out again, will continue to be used to establish a military dictatorship in the Congo, to effect the deposition of the elected Parliament of the Congo, to secure the deposition and imprisonment under the most brutal conditions of the elected Premier of the Congo and to secure the partition of the Congo.</P>
      <P>Surely that is something against which any Deputy of this House must protest in the strongest possible terms. I believe that our troops are being used for these basic purposes, unconsciously, unwittingly and unwillingly, if you like.  I think that some protest should be made by somebody against that action in the past and such continued action in the future.</P>
      <P>There is the attempted secession of Katanga.  Are we to stand by that as we have stood by it up to the present? Are we to stand over the attempted secession by Mr. Tshombe of the most valuable part of the Congo, the Katanga province in which are situated the uranium mines and great deposits of cobalt and copper?  It is a financial disaster and we cannot be part of it.  Lord Brookeborough has insisted on the partition of our country; Mr. Tshombe has insisted on the partition of the Congo.  We are a party to Mr. Tshombe's action&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me, therefore, that some protest should be made against the Government's decision on this matter and the fact is that I am making the protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising directly out of the Bill, could I ask the Minister to explain paragraph (c) Section 2 (2)?  It speaks <Col N="811" /> about &ldquo;the contingent is intended to replace in whole or in part...&rdquo; while paragraph (b) of Section 2 (2) says that &ldquo;... not more than twelve members of the Permanent Defence Force&rdquo; may be sent out.  What I want to know is this: Is it possible for the Minister or the Government to send out under paragraph (b) Section 2 (2), 12 members anywhere without reference to the Dáil?  That seems to me perfectly permissible.  I do not see any objection to it but is it possible for the Government to reinforce the 12 men by any given number of troops?  I should like that point to be clarified&mdash;will it continue to be necessary for the Dáil to be consulted on any occasion that the Government may consider it desirable to send forces abroad where those forces number more than 12 under this subsection which permits the reinforcement of a contingent of the Defence Forces without saying what the size of that reinforcement might be?</P>
    <P>The next point I should like clarified is this question of the position of volunteers under Section 3.  This Bill makes a fundamental change in the position of serving soldiers in the Defence Force and I appreciate the Minister's problem that it would be impossible to send troops abroad until they volunteer.  I wonder is it necessary for the Minister, or why is it necessary for him, to hold the men who have already volunteered to their offer?  Is it possible for the Minister to answer that?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has had second thoughts on the whole question of the Congo in the light of developments and surely it should be permitted to humble members of the Defence Forces to have second thoughts also?  I wonder if it will be possible for the Minister to forgo that insistence on holding to their offer the soldiers who have volunteered and whose offer to volunteer has been accepted?  Why is it necessary for him?  Does he not feel that the volunteers will continue to come forward and make it possible for him to send a force abroad?</P>
    <P>I do not know&mdash;and I should like to know&mdash;what is the purpose of Section 6?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> The Minister may by regulations, made with the consent of the Minister for Health, provide for the keeping of a record of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the death of a member of the Permanent Defence Force,...</P>
    <P>I do not understand that.  It may be perfectly obvious and perfectly reasonable but I do not understand why that should be considered necessary. I believe that the Government, as I said earlier and said in July last, appear to have seriously misjudged the whole problem which faces us in the Congo.  I am glad that the Taoiseach now gives us an assurance that there are certain circumstances in which he might decide not to send a further contingent to the Congo.</P>
    <P>I wonder at what stage does he propose to tell the House and the people what these conditions might be?  Could the Taoiseach tell the House in his reply whether he approves of the developments that have taken place in the Congo? Would he also tell the House whether he has made any protest, as have so many of the Afro-Asian countries and the United Arab Republic, against the decision of Colonel Mobuto to imprison Mr. Lumumba? Does the Taoiseach accept the present status of Colonel Mobuto as effectively the head of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter relating to the internal position in the Congo and it does not relevantly arise in detail on the Bill. The Deputy is entitled to refer to these matters but not in the detail into which he is going.  Might I also point out to the Deputy that he has already asked this question on two occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question which the Leader of the Opposition has also asked.  If I were satisfied, or if the Taoiseach would satisfy us, that we would get an opportunity of discussing this matter&mdash;both the withdrawal of troops and the conditions under which troops would be withdrawn or not sent out again&mdash;then, of course, I should be satisfied even though I am reasonably satisfied at the moment that a good case can be made for <Col N="813" /> either protesting against the position which has developed in the Congo or for withdrawing our troops if those protests are ignored, or for refusing to send another contingent to the Congo. I think that the Taoiseach appears to have acted under the impression that all of us in the House were as fully conversant with the situation in the Congo as apparently the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Corish are because of the special information that has been made available to them. I think it would be advisable from the point of view of the public because there is a certain amount of public disquiet about the present position in the Congo, a certain amount of public concern as to whether our troops are being used in the right way, or coming down on the right side.  The Taoiseach would greatly clarify the situation if he would make it quite clear that we object to the situation which has developed, which is the appearance of the military dictator, Mr. Mobuto, and the effective partitioning of the Congo and the displacement of the Premier, Mr. Lumumba.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position under existing law is that houses with a poor law valuation exceeding £60 in Dublin and £40 elsewhere are not subject to rent control.  Whatever case might be made for amending the law as it stands, it should be obvious to anybody who has studied the matter that this Bill proposes to go too far in adjusting the upper limits.  This Bill proposes to reduce the upper limit from £60 to £30 in Dublin and from <Col N="814" /> £40 to £25 elsewhere.  Our amendment is designed on a compromise basis, admitting that perhaps a case can be made for amending the law.  We feel the furthest the Bill should go is to amend the upper limit for Dublin to £45 and elsewhere to £35.</P>
      <P>In the main, the tenants or prospective tenants affected by this Bill are people who for one reason or another seek rented accommodation and who would not in the ordinary way qualify for local authority housing.  That is particularly true of Dublin and Cork and the larger centres.  The House must know there is a shortage of that type of accommodation.  There are people who, because of their occupation or profession, are transferred from one centre to another&mdash;Civil Servants, bank clerks, C.I.E. and E.S.B. personnel.  They do not qualify for local authority houses.  The nature of their employment makes it unreasonable for them to build their own houses.  They are the house-hunters whom we seek to protect by amending this section.</P>
      <P>Very many of these people find that the only houses available for them for renting are houses up to £45 valuation in Dublin and up to £30 valuation elsewhere.  We feel that this section goes so far as to make the already scarce situation worse again for the type of people we have in mind.  Many of them would find that the only houses available to them would be at rents which would be exorbitant and completely outside their control.  Our amendments in that regard are reasonable. I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to accept them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept either of these amendments. I think I am on fairly safe grounds in rejecting them.  Here we are proposing only a very limited amount of decontrol, that is, to remove from control a house which has a valuation over £30 in Dublin city and £25 outside it and of which the landlord comes into possession subsequent to the passing of the Bill or is in possession at the date of the passing of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Casey is wrong in <Col N="815" /> thinking this section will reduce the amount of rented accommodation available.  I think it will increase it. Houses in this category which subsequently come into the possession of landlords will scarcely be let if the landlord cannot get for them a rent which he thinks fair and adequate.  If we remove these future lettings from control the houses are then likely to be let rather than sold.  By virtue of the provisions of the Bill we will prevent a number of houses from being withdrawn from the letting market.</P>
    <P>The number of houses with a valuation of over £30 in Dublin or £25 elsewhere which are let at the moment must be fairly small.  The £30 valuation upper limit covers the vast majority of houses which are let.  By fixing the ceiling at £30 and £25 we are achieving a very small amount of decontrol which will not inflict hardship on anybody but which will have the effect of increasing the amount of rented accommodation available.</P>
    <P>A house of over £30 valuation is a fairly good class house.  In most parts of the country the rates on such a house would be at least £50 or £60. That sort of house is not, properly speaking, a fit sort of house to be subject to Rent Restrictions Acts at all&mdash; at any rate so far as future lettings are concerned.  The amount of decontrol which will result from this provision of the Bill will, I am quite certain, be very small.  I appeal to Deputy Casey to recognise that the limits in the Bill are sensible and fair.</P>

      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 8 to 15 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) In determining pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection the notional rent of a dwelling&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the Court shall have regard to any amount expended on the improvement, structural alteration or repair of the dwelling which is an amount by reference to which a lawful addition within the meaning of the Act of 1946 has been obtained, and</P>

    <P>(ii)  In the case of a dwelling of which the rateable valuation does not exceed ten pounds and which is a dwelling to which Chapter I of Part II of the Act of 1946 <Col N="817" /> applied, &lsquo;(being dwellings to which Chapter I of Part II of the Act of 1946 applied)&rsquo; shall be regarded as being contained in subsection (2) of section, 9 of this Act after &lsquo;controlled dwellings&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Like the last amendment this amendment is to meet a point raised by Deputy Sweetman.  Deputy Sweetman was concerned about the application of the provisions of Section 9 in certain cases.  He instanced the case of a terrace of identical houses one of which had suffered storm damage or something of that nature and had been the subject of exceptional repairs.  The suggestion that Deputy Sweetman made was that the tenant of that house might apply under subsection (2) of Section 8 of the Bill to have the rent reduced on the ground that it exceeded by more than 12½ per cent. of the basic rent the rent which the Court would fix under Section 9 and that the Court would possibly reduce the rent because the basic rent of comparable dwellings in the terrace was considerably lower.  The amendment provides that in a case like that the Court would have regard to the special repairs which were carried out on the house and the amount spent on them.</P>

On that stage we introduced an amendment <Col N="818" /> which authorises a landlord who has done repairs to a multiple dwelling to apportion the exceptional lawful addition among the tenants of that dwelling.  This amendment makes it clear that this provision applies only in the case of a multiple house and not, for example, to a pair of semi-detached houses let by a landlord.  I do not think there is any difficulty in ascertaining the amount of repairs to a house.  That is a simple matter of fact.  If there is a dispute as to the amount, that can be dealt with by the court under the general powers conferred by Section 49 of the Bill.  The position with which we are concerned here relates entirely to dwellings inside a house.  That is the only case where the difficulty of apportioning the amount arises, and this amendment is to make it clear that the provisions of the Bill in this respect apply to dwellings inside a single house rather than to two semi-detached houses or to two attached houses in a row of houses.</P>

I am just a little worried that it might lead to some cases of vexatious litigation.  If the carrying forward of the amount of the deposit in the rent book was inadvertently omitted by a landlord, the tenant would have an immediate right to recover the deposit.  That would not be a good thing.  The intention of the original section was that the payment of the deposit would be noted somewhere, either in the agreement or in the rent book.  We feel that even one noting down of it would achieve the purpose we wanted.  I feel it might be safer to leave out this provision.</P>

      <P>In page 31, line 4, to add after the words &ldquo;vendor to give&rdquo; the words &ldquo;(by way of statutory declaration if so required)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This arises out of another discussion we had yesterday.  I seriously visualise difficulties where a vendor sells property subject to a deposit, the liability with the sale passing on to the purchaser who has got to refund that deposit.  If the vendor, having got the purchase money, decamps the purchaser is left in the position where he has to pay and has no practical remedy although he may have a theoretical remedy.  The effect of having the declaration would be that the vendor in such circumstances <Col N="820" /> would be committing a criminal offence and obviously would therefore be made far more amenable.  It is not likely to arise in many cases but there will be hardship in some cases and we have the precedent there already covering the Local Registration of Title Act.  I think the same thing could be usefully imported into this Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that he wanted this section on all fours with the section about basic rents.  While that perhaps is desirable from one aspect of uniformity, yet the Parliamentary Secretary will see that this is a clear way of doing something very different.  We are asking a person to pay out money that he has never seen and before we ask him to do that we should take every possible step to ensure that he knows about the liability he has to undertake.</P>

      <P>On Section 4 Deputy Carroll moved an amendment in my name.  Unfortunately, I could not be here to move it.  The gist of it was:</P>
      <P>Any tenant of a controlled dwelling shall be entitled at his option to a lease for a minimum period of twenty-one years at an open market rent where he or his family have been in occupation of the dwelling for thirty years or more.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in his reply stated he was opposing amendment No. 14.  He said in the first place that this House should be aware that under the Landlord and Tenant Act, on the termination of a tenancy, a tenant is entitled to a new lease of 21 years at an open market value where he or his predecessors have occupied the house for 30 years.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give me some assistance on this point.  As I understand it, that applies in the first instance only to business premises and, secondly, in the case of houses situated outside an urban area it applies only if the land attached to the house does not exceed one acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> Am I correct in saying that &ldquo;land&rdquo; is not designated more fully in the Landlord and Tenant Act?  In other words, the land could include gardens, pleasure and vegetable gardens.  That is not specified in the Act.  The Parliamentary Secretary is now withdrawing a certain further degree of protection for the tenant I have in mind under the 1946 Act in that he is reducing the rateable valuation of the site in the case of Dublin and Dun Laoghaire from £15 to £10 and outside those areas from £10 to £5.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what protection a tenant of a house situated outside an urban area on land exceeding one statute acre part of which would include gardens would have or a householder with land attached to his house the valuation of which exceeded £5?  Would he, in effect, have any protection?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Fifth Stage of the Bill as amended in Committee and on Report.  All I want to be placed clearly on the record is this.  So far as we are concerned, we recognise the legitimate claims of the owners of property and of the tenants but it does seem to us that in seeking to disentangle the long history of rent restrictions which goes back, as I said, to the first World War&mdash;close on 40 years or more&mdash;regard must be had to conditions as they are and not as we would wish them to be.  We believe the Government is making a mistake in making this transitionary measure much more difficult of acceptance by its decision authorising an arbitrary increase in the rent of sitting tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that this adjustment in rent restrictions could have been much more equitably carried into effect had we excluded the sitting tenant from the arbitrary rent increase, bearing in mind that under the whole code of rent restriction there is a provision which provides that the landlord, in the event of exceptional repairs being <Col N="824" /> carried out, is entitled to some adjustment in the rent of a sitting tenant on foot of those exceptional repairs.</P>
    <P>It is not a good thing that the legislation of this House should operate to make a large body of citizens feel that they are being deprived of rights that they believe themselves to enjoy unless some grave reason makes that course imperative.  It is right that this House should recall that landlords in the context of this legislation are by no means identical with landlords as that word is traditionally understood amongst our people.  Landlords as traditionally understood by our people were persons of wealth and circumstance, who owned large properties, lived in great affluence, and derived their incomes normally from tenants of very modest means.</P>
    <P>The landlords with whom we are dealing in this rent restriction code are quite a different category in our society and extend from the persons with considerable property all the way down to the people who are themselves in extremely straitened circumstances.  We should bear in mind constantly, when considering legislation of this kind, that many of the persons here described as landlords are widows and elderly women and old people who have been living on the income from some small property, consisting perhaps of two or three houses, and who have seen that income dwindle in real value over the years as a result of the maintenance of rent restriction.</P>
    <P>Bearing all that in mind, we have also got to look at the other side of the picture and to think of people with very exiguous incomes who have just been able to carry on because they have had the advantage of a low rent.  We have got to think of the little shopkeeper, who might be properly described as a huckster, who is keeping a small family together on a little vegetable business or a little sweet shop and who simply is not in a position to pay more.  If we authorise an increase in the rent we may create a situation in which such people's survival will be made impossible and they will be driven on to the <Col N="825" /> streets to seek other accommodation, accommodation in which, in turn, it may be impossible for them to carry on such little businesses because not infrequently such small businesses are in strict relation to the contacts that such people have with their immediate neighbours who give them their custom and it is on that limited custom that they depend for their survival.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is unreasonable that the House should also call to mind that in the legitimate category of the landlords that I have described and of the sitting tenant to whom an arbitrary increase in rent is an insufferable hardship, we have to remember, when considering the legitimate interest of the sitting tenant, that a great many large landlords and medium-sized landlords who will be affected by this legislation are not people who have inherited this property or purchased it 40 or 80 years ago and seen their real income dwindle through the depreciation of money.  A great many of the landlords affected by this legislation are persons who bought houses from owners who could not carry on and who sold their little properties for 10 or 11 years' purchase, related to the low rents operating on these houses.  These persons who quite legitimately entered the property market at a time when property values were standing at a low figure are going to get a wholly uncovenanted benefit through this arbitrary right to increase rents of sitting tenants by 12½ per cent. without regard to the repairs that they may carry out.</P>
    <P>If we weigh up all these complex matters, one against the other, to see how best we can equate to all, we would, I think, have been much better advised had we devised a Bill in the course of our discussion here which would have created three broad categories of cases: (1) the sitting tenant, (2) the incoming tenant to vacated controlled premises and (3) the post-1941 tenants who are free of all control. I am not saying, and we have never contended, that this represents some kind of abstract principle.  I do not think you can find in comprehensive <Col N="826" /> legislation of this kind an abstract principle to guide you.</P>
    <P>I am trying to depict an equitable, a human and a socially desirable method of dealing with this problem bearing in mind that this is not the last Rent Act this House will ever discuss and that the ideal position towards which we should all aspire is the creation in this country of a sufficient number of residences and premises so that the necessity for rent control will cease to exist, because, with surplus accommodation in existence, a true and fair position would arise in which there would be a free and equitable bargain made between a willing vendor and a willing purchaser to a tenant right in any premises.  We have not reached that stage and, pending the realisation of that desirable situation, I believe we are doing something which will put a great hardship on a lot of small people.  What troubles me&mdash;I think it should trouble the conscience of every Deputy&mdash;is that the people who will get hurt by this are unorganised; they are not vocal, and they never really know what it is that hits them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They will feel the results but, if they knew what had hit them, and knew and felt there was some means of redressing their grievance, it would be some consolation. What troubles me is that there will burst on the heads of a whole lot of defenceless people this sudden 12½ per cent. increase, which will not be a large sum in terms of money; in many cases it may be only 2/6d. or 3/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It may even be less. I know how hard it is for us sitting in this House to talk of a weekly impost of 2/- or 2/6d. as being something of substance.  I am not charging the Parliamentary Secretary with being indifferent, but it is very hard to put oneself in the position of a person to whom a half-crown means a great deal.  What troubles me particularly is that they are defenceless.  They do <Col N="827" /> not know what has happened but suddenly they find themselves bearing a burden that is harsh and an enduring grievance is created.  I do not think I am wrong in saying we should concern ourselves with avoiding that kind of development.  I do not think it is wrong to use the time of Oireachtas Éireann to inveigh against legislation which creates in the minds of individuals in our society that kind of obsessive resentment.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with the individual who has a grievance; I know of nothing more pathetic than the man or woman whom you meet and who says to you: &ldquo;Could I tell you this story?&rdquo; You wait to hear him out and at the end of it comes a thick wad of dog-eared correspondence and you know at once you are in the presence of somebody who has acquired a grievance which has been eating into his heart for years and years until he has become almost unbalanced.  We should not laugh at it. There are few more pathetic things in the world.  I often have had that correspondence presented to me and found in letter after letter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely rent restrictions have nothing to do with that sort of fixation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear me out.  I have seen on files letter after letter pointing out that there is no remedy under the law for the grievance under which that person is labouring, that in fact the provisions of the law have been complied with.  However, he does not understand it and when it goes on for a certain time he becomes incapable of absorbing explanations.  There will be many small hucksters and dwellers who will be legally and properly charged in accordance with our legislation with this sudden and arbitrary increase in rent.  I suppose the great majority of them, after their initial indignation has passed, will recognise what has happened but a considerable minority will feel that somebody got at them and imposed this burden on them, that they had a clear and surviving right to continue in the occupation of their little home at the rent they had been paying and that, somehow or another by some <Col N="828" /> mysterious method, they had been fined this extra 1/6, 2/- or 2/6d. and an enduring and bitter grievance remains.</P>
      <P>It is a mistake to do that bearing in mind that if we exempt the sitting tenant from this impost the effluxion of time will itself relieve the landlord in a large majority of cases.  Even where the landlord does not want to wait so long, there is always open to him the opportunity of going to the sitting tenant and saying: &ldquo;I can get 12½ per cent. more than the rent you are paying.  What is it worth to you to get out?&rdquo; The effluxion of time and the possibility of striking a bargain will remove, I imagine, 80 per cent.  of the cases of hardship that arise if we leave the sitting tenant immune from the arbitrary increase in rent.  I admit there would be the small residue of cases where the balance of hardship was on the property owner rather than on the tenant.  But we are creating a far larger balance of grievances among the sitting tenants.  Whatever sense of grievance landlords may have as a result of their inability to resolve this problem either by a bargain or the effluxion of time, it is much more likely they will understand and appreciate the situation than the huckster or the humble person living in a modest home.</P>
      <P>We are not serving any useful purpose by making this arbitrary increase lawful at this time.  I do not believe we are removing any substantial hardship which could not be removed by other means in the vast majority of cases and I do not believe that this is the last rent control Act this House will ever pass.  The time is not far distant when a sufficiency of houses will be created to make almost any measure of rent control a supererogation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances I say to the Parliamentary Secretary that his Minister is making a mistake in not exempting the sitting tenant from this arbitrary rent increase.  The rest of the legislation will be assured an infinitely better reception if that humane reform were adopted.  For the reason that the sitting tenant is subject to this rent <Col N="829" /> increase, I object to this Bill in its present form and I object most strenuously. I am not without hope that the Parliamentary Secretary's Minister may in another place reconsider this aspect of the Bill in which event, with all its imperfections, it will be very much less unacceptable than it is now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever justification there is for certain drafting alterations and for bringing rent restriction legislation up to date and incorporating it in a Bill of this nature, there has not been shown to our satisfaction or, I submit, to the satisfaction of those who will be affected by the Bill any justification for this decision to permit an increase of 12½ per cent. on the rent of controlled dwellings, particularly when this proposed permission to increase the rent by 12½ per cent. is not allied in any way with compulsion on the landlord to produce some evidence of expenditure on the dwellings concerned.</P>
      <P>The question as to whether or not in the course of time there would be sufficient dwellings available in order to bring to an end the necessity for a system of rent restriction must be considered in relation to the physical facts, in relation to the density of population, in relation to the necessity for so many working class people to live convenient to the centres of population, convenient to transport, convenient to work, etc.  Having regard to the development in our cities and towns over the years, I would hesitate to suggest any period, short of some decades, before the situation would be reached in which a free market for rents could operate to the reasonable advantage of the tenant.  Whether we like it or not, there is a very substantial demand for reasonable and proper accommodation at reasonable rentsnear the centre of the city in cities like Dublin.  The same demand exists, I am sure, in the case of other cities, and it will grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, in its past and in its present form, definitely confers on landlords engaged in the commercial exploitation of dwellings for the ordinary citizens and for the working <Col N="830" /> classes&mdash;and there is no doubt that the Fianna Fáil Party are strong enough to force this measure through the House&mdash;and on landlords who, as a breed have been notorious for many years, particularly in our cities, benefits to which we do not think they are entitled.</P>
    <P>In the course of his comments Deputy Dillon indicated that there are landlords and landlords.  We agree, of course, that there are numbers of people who became landlords incidentally. There is not, evidently, any method by which we can divide the wolves from the sheep in that regard. Perhaps if there were some such method the Parliamentary Secretary might have found it possible to bring in some form of division.  It is not the sheep among the landlords who will derive the main benefits but those who engage in the profession of landlords from a purely commercial professional point of view and who take every advantage of legislation of all kinds to increase the burdens on the tenant, as far as they can.</P>
    <P>The objectionable part of this Bill&mdash; and because it is included the Bill should be opposed and must be opposed&mdash;is the part which provides benefits for these people without making any provision whatsoever that they shall be required to undergo expenditure. Aside from that, there are also the difficulties of people who, as a result of this Bill, may be deprived of their dwellings.  The basis under which they may be deprived of their dwellings may be reasonable, but certainly, in present circumstances, it appears that the proposals in the Bill to compensate them for loss of their homes and other hardships and inconveniences, are inadequate.</P>
    <P>I want to finish by saying that this is a Bill which, in one major respect, is slanted to the benefit of the landlord and against the interest of the tenant. For that reason the Bill itself is objecttionable from our point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of one matter which I am about to bring to his attention.  Arising out of this debate he made a case for decontrolling <Col N="831" /> small business premises.  His point was that it was not the job of the landlord to subsidise the tenant.  His assumption was that if a business premises was not decontrolled, the landlord would not get his proper rent.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make is that the landlord bought his business premises at the controlled rent.  I do not know whether or not the Parliamentary Secretary is paying any attention to me but I want to point out to him that the landlord who is to have his premises decontrolled now, bought those premises at the controlled rent. Therefore, he is not subsidising the tenant.  Whatever the rent was&mdash;let it be £1, £2 to £3&mdash;it was on that basis that he bought the premises.</P>
      <P>This Bill will allow the landlord to get the present-day market value of the premises, in other words, what the premises is now worth, whereas he bought it at what it was worth before the Bill was enacted.  In what way then is the landlord subsidising the tenant?  In the past, when a landlord bought a premises he paid according to whether it was or was not controlled. I know of a case where a person wanted to buy a premises.  He offered so much for it if he could get vacant possession.  The seller bought out several of his tenants and in that way the purchaser gave a larger sum because he was gaining vacant possession, whereas property owners bought their property at controlled rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will now be made a present of 100 per cent. or 200 per cent. increase because if a small premises, a shop or a back room used for some purpose, was let 20 years ago at £1 a week&mdash; while agreeing it might now be worth £3 a week&mdash;the fact remains that it was not on the basis of £3 a week the landlord bought the premises but on the basis of £1 per week.  If he had to buy that premises after the passing of this Bill he would have to pay considerably more money on the grounds that he would now be buying a decontrolled business premises.  There is no point, therefore, in saying that the landlord is subsidising the tenant.  He bought the property at the controlled <Col N="832" /> rent and he knew that a certain amount of money would be required for certain repairs.  If there were any justification for any increase it could only be on the basis of future repairs.</P>
    <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary could add 12½ per cent. or something else in lieu of future repairs.  Would not that meet the landlords legitimate claims?  Surely decontrolling such property when, in fact, he bought it at considerably less, is making him a present of 100 per cent. or 200 per cent. more rent for no reason at all. If landlords knew the contents of this Bill in advance, they could become millionaires.  Talk about being tipped off about the Budget.  They could buy up all around them.  The Parliamentary Secretary should consider the thousands of people in Dublin and throughout the country who are enabled to live simply because their rents are low.  Now they are being asked to pay rents which will probably be increased by 100 per cent. or 200 per cent.  In other words, if they were earning a week's wages, it would be equal to a reduction of £1 or £2 a week.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's excuse is that they will get security of tenure and will not be interferred with for 21 years.  But the position is that these people will not be able to carry on and may have to vacate the premises. In that way the landlord is getting something for nothing.  Is it not normal practice that when a premises is decontrolled, it is bought out? But we are saving the landlord all that and he is getting it for nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to deal with the question which was raised about the 12½ per cent. increase in rent.  I want to emphasise again in this regard that the 12½ per cent. is a very reasonable compromise between all the conflicting interests involved in this difficult situation.  As I have already pointed out, the Conroy Commission which sat in 1950 recommended increases of 25 per cent. for landlords who are liable for all repairs and 12½ per cent. for landlords liable for part repairs.  Despite the fact that a 40 per cent. increase in the cost of repairs has taken place since then, we only gave 12½ per cent.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Dillon and the House are concerned so much with this type of tenant why have we not, in all the discussions and negotiations which have taken place in relation to this Bill, heard any volume of protest from tenants about this 12½ per cent.?  I want to assure the House I have not received any protests&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as we have talked about the matter and discussed it at all, there is a general recognition and acceptance of the fact that it is a fair increase.  As I told the House, I was particularly impressed in the negotiations which took place between the Dublin Artisans' Dwelling Company and their tenants by the reasonableness of the tenants in their approach to rent increases.  They are the largest single body of tenants in <Col N="836" /> Dublin who are organised, and they are organised very well in a very fine association.  As I say, I was very impressed with the reasonable manner in which that body of tenants, which I am sure we can regard as representative of tenants generally, accepted that it was fair that landlords were entitled to some increase.  It is insincere to try and manufacture this sort of thing in the House when it does not exist outside the House.</P>
      <P>We were faced with a difficult and complex situation, with conflicting interests and problems of social justice on all sides.  We came along with a fair and reasonable compromise, trying to do the best we could to keep the scales balanced as evenly as possible between all interests and it is less than honest to try to create this atmosphere of passion and to try to indicate that some grave hardship will ensue from what we are doing.</P>
      <P>The whole principle on which the Bill is based is that it will not cause hardship to sitting tenants in any way. The 12½ per cent. increase is given mainly to enable landlords to carry out the repairs for which they are liable. There is no element of bonus in it. Their net income will not be increased compared with pre-control days.  It is a good thing for the country as a whole and for tenants because it will help to keep the stock of houses which we have in repair.  When we compare generally the rents payable by tenants in controlled dwellings with the rents charged by local authorities everybody knows that the rents charged by the local authorities to their tenants are in many cases far in excess of those charged for rent restricted houses and they will still be far in excess even when we do give the increase of 12½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can remember when I was a member of Dublin Corporation the situation that faced us on the Finance Committee by reason of the increased cost of repair of our houses.  It was one of the largest single factors with which we had to cope when fixing the city rate and the cost was increasing all the time. Everybody was concerned about it at those meetings of the Committee and everybody was perturbed at the manner in which the cost of repairs was increasing <Col N="837" /> year after year.  If that is the position with regard to the comparatively modern dwellings of most local authorities, what must the position be with regard to the older buildings some of which are there for over 50 years?</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of small business premises we feel, and we are fully reinforced in this by the report of the Conroy Commission, that purely business premises properly belong to the sphere controlled by the Landlord and Tenant Acts and should not be within the scope of the Rent Restrictions Acts.  I have already indicated that the social principle underlying the Rent Acts is to see that justice is done with regard to one of the necessaries of life, the dwelling in which a man lives.  As a matter of social justice, we have laid down certain conditions as to what a landlord is entitled to charge and as to when he should be entitled to recover possession but that argument does not apply to a purely business premises.  If we were taking all control off these business premises we would certainly be justified in doing so but to be scrupulously fair we have given them immediate access to the Landlord and Tenant Act.  We are saying to business people that, from now on, they will have to pay a fair rent, and no more than a fair rent, for their premises.</P>
    <P>A business premises let with a residence will remain controlled but in the case of a purely business premises, where no residence is involved, we are asking that landlords should no longer <Col N="838" /> have to subsidise the business of their tenants.  We are asking that they should pay a fair rent to be fixed by the courts.  If it is a small business of the huckster nature and if the building is in bad repair or the business is doing badly the courts will surely take that into account.  Deputy Sherwin is utterly wrong when he talks about people buying up such premises within the last few years and now getting a bonus.  That did not happen.</P>
    <P>The main plea put by Deputy Dillon in his remarks was that we should drop the 12½ per cent. increase.  I cannot accept that.  I have already given all the arguments fully for our case in that regard.  We are only giving that increase in a case where a landlord is liable for repairs.  It is in the public interest that the landlords should be facilitated to enable them to keep houses in the best possible condition. It is in the national interest that they should do this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1) It shall be the duty of the Minister to arrange from time to time for such surveys as appear to him to be desirable to be made as respects the health, or any particular aspect of the health, of persons, or of particular classes of persons, in the functional area of a health authority in relation to whom regulations under Section 2 of this Act are in force.</P>
      <P>(2) A survey under this section may be arranged through the health authority or their officers or through such other organisation or body as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>(3) The Minister shall cause to be presented to each House of the Oireachtas a report on a survey made under this section but such report shall not include any information in respect of any identifiable person.</P>
      <P>(4) Any information in relation to the health of individuals which is obtained in the course of a survey under this section shall be treated in a confidential manner.</P>
      <P>(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any person to submit himself or any person for whom he is responsible to examination.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendment No. 9 on the Committee Stage I promised that I would see what I could do to meet the wishes of those responsible for the amendment. The amendment I have now moved gives effect to that undertaking. It represents the furthest I can find it <Col N="841" /> practicable to go.  I think it will be effective from the point of view of those who are anxious that the effects of fluoridation upon particular classes or upon the general health of the community will be kept under survey.  I am proceeding to do that by imposing on the Minister, who makes regulations under Section 2, the duty of arranging for surveys to be made from time to time in relation to the health, or particular aspects of the health, of persons, or classes of persons, in the area of a health authority upon whom has been imposed the duty of fluoridating its water supply.  This proposal will enable any Deputy who wishes to be informed in the matter, if he is dissatisfied with the manner in which the Minister is performing that duty, to call the attention of the House to the fact either by putting down a Parliamentary Question or, if he wishes to go further putting down a motion to censure the Minister for his failure to fulfil this duty.  It gives every Deputy, therefore, a Parliamentary right which will ensure that the House will be kept informed as to any untoward development which might take place in the functional area of a health authority, the water supply of which is being fluoridized.  In saying that I wish it to be quite clear that I have no apprehensions whatever on this score and I do not think that there is any reason to have, but I put the amendment down to meet the views expressed by some Deputies on the benches opposite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it was worth while suffering the horns, cloven hooves and tail with which the Minister adorned me on other stages of this Bill, seeing that he has now gone so far in meeting the reasonable objections of those of us who are opposed to fluoridation of water supplies.  I share with the Minister the hope that the medical examination of our people who have fluoridated water supplies imposed on them will not disclose any damaging consequences to the health of our people.  We all share that hope, and nobody more strongly than those who are opposed to this Bill in its totality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing that the Minister <Col N="842" /> will allow these surveys to take place. It occurs to me, however, that medical caution might have gone a little further.  A local survey, such as the Minister has in mind, might only disclose some infinitesimal fractional increase in a particular disease and it might be difficult to relate it to the intake of fluorine.  Would the Minister consider whether or not it would be desirable, to impose an obligation on medical men who discover damaging effects to report those to the Department of Health in the same way as they are obliged to disclose communicable and dangerous diseases?  It is only by building up case histories of fluorine poisoning that we shall be able to get the proper degree of caution in relation to this mass medication.</P>
    <P>The Minister's hopes and beliefs are not universally shared.  The Minister must be well aware of that.  I doubt if he has introduced this amendment merely for the purpose of obliging the members of the Opposition, for that would be contrary to his nature.  I believe he is well aware that a substantial body of reputable scientists and medical men have found cause for considerable anxiety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advancing arguments as to the desirability of accepting the Minister's amendment.  I repeat that there is a large body of medical opinion which believes fluorine intake may be damaging to the system.  I ask the Minister to go a little further than this amendment and provide for reports to be made in all cases in which there is evidence of damage to the human system by flourine intake.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a few questions on subsection (2). The subsection provides:</P>
      <P>A survey under this section may be arranged through the health authority or their officers or through such other organisation or body as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister give an example <Col N="843" /> of the type of body or organisation he has in mind?  If the Minister nominates a body to carry out this survey will he give an assurance now to the House that he will consult the health authority?  I presume it is the health authority which will have to pay for the survey if it is undertaken by an outside body or organisation.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to wait and see.  In view of the gesture which the Minister has made, as a result of the discussion that has taken place, that this business be left to local option, it fills me with alarm when Deputy Dr. Browne enters into the fray to tell us that our teeth are now to be examined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon </NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health is bringing in a most elaborate amendment for which Deputy Ryan has expressed appreciation and which extends the power for carrying out a service on our unfortunate fangs not only to the local authorities but to anybody else whom the Minister agrees to authorise.  Deputy Dr. Browne says that not only are the fangs to be examined for the incidence of caries or of fluoride but also molybdenum. This gift of the possession of teeth will soon become a public liability and anybody who has a tooth is liable to be subjected by the local authority <Col N="844" /> or anybody the Minister authorises to a general inquisition as to whether he has molybdenum in his teeth, fluoride, calcium and I suppose enamel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A mining engineer would probably be required to survey for the molybdenum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest there are dangers here inherent.  Deputy Ryan was quite astonished to discover the Minister in this conciliatory mood in meeting suggestions made by Deputy Ryan in connection with certain proposals originally enshrined in the Bill. It is a tribute to commonsense that people try to meet one another half way and I postpone to the Fifth Stage of the Bill a more ample reference to the fundamental principle which divides us in regard to this Bill.</P>
      <P>While this amendment goes some way to meet the points raised by Deputy Ryan and others, it does not of course meet the fundamental issue as to whether we should have fluoridation at ail.  While acknowledging that this amendment goes some way to meet the points raised, we shall reserve for the Fifth Stage elaboration of the fundamental question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition should have misunderstood the purport of the amendment.  This amendment does not propose, and will not enable the Minister, to institute a survey to see whether the teeth of the people of this country are rich in fluorine, calcium, molybdenum or any other mineral. Deputy Norton may rest assured, therefore, that it will not be necessary for any local authority to engage a mining engineer to ascertain that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is related to one thing only.  It imposes a duty on the Minister to arrange from time to time for such services as appear to him to be desirable for the health of the people in any area where the water supply is being fluoridated. The amendment is, I think&mdash;I am going to throw a bouquet at myself&mdash;a tribute to my desire to approach this <Col N="845" /> question objectively and, since we are fluoridating the water supply here, to institute such an examination of the effects of that fluoridation upon the health of our people as may succeed in convincing the world at large, at least the civilised world, that the apprehensions which Deputy Ryan has voiced here are without foundation, and so that other people may be enabled to share the benefit of this great inhibitor of what is one of the fundamental causes of ill health.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for the Leader of the Opposition to talk about aching teeth, but if the Leader of the Opposition would throw his mind back, say, to 40 years ago and remember the suffering which he endured at that time he will appreciate the position of hundreds of thousands of children in this country who are suffering similarly.</P>
      <P>That is only the lightest aspect of this matter.  There is the established fact that much of the ill-health from which our people suffer is due to dental caries and if we can protect the children of this nation, against the effects of dental decay we are introducing what will be the fundamental element in building up the health of future generations.  That is why I attach so much importance to this Bill. It is not a fad of mine.  I gave the matter exhaustive study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I am sure the Minister would like a fair debate and I would respectfully suggest that his remarks are not related to the amendment before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to reply to the debate on this amendment and there is no time limit.  I was saying it was because I recognise the importance of fluoridation as an inhibitor of dental decay, as a protective measure for the future health of this generation, that I am bringing in the amendment.  It is not because Deputy <Col N="846" /> Ryan described fluoridation as poisoning the water.  It is not because of the absurd arguments he used here that this is being brought in.  It is because I feel it will serve a great public purpose here and that it will be of great advantage as well to people elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I hope that, having now made the Minister for Health of the day, whoever he may be, amenable to this House in a particular way for the discharge of the particular duties to be carried out under the Bill the public mind will be at rest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry.  The purpose of that subsection is clear on the face of it.  In my view the most appropriate authority in this country would be the Medical Research Council. If we were to employ the officers of health authorities, we might have the same sort of allegation that they were not impartial and were subject to Ministerial control.  If the Medical Research Council cannot undertake it and if it is felt that an organisation with less immediate contacts with this State should be employed for the purpose, we can go to the World Health Organisation or whatever organisation is likely, in my view, to produce an impartial, objective, scientific survey of this problem.</P>

I wonder if the Taoiseach is really serious about this suggestion? Let us see what is the present position in the Congo of which the Taoiseach is so proud.  As Leader of the Government he is responsible for the part our contingent has played there.  He has been a silent partner, especially since July, in the activities of that contingent.

Surely it was incumbent on the Government, throughout the period that the U.N. contingent has been in the Congo since July, to examine and analyse the political situation as it changed from time to time, and make their views clearly understood in the United Nations that we felt that the <Col N="849" /> U.N. contingent, and certainly our part of it, was not being effectively used?</P>
      <P>I see now that it is being suggested in the United Nations that the present Commander of the force.  General van Horn, should be displaced in view of the imminence of civil war and that his place should be taken by a man with more personal detailed knowledge of jungle or bush warfare.  I wonder if the Taoiseach has considered the implications of that situation?  What experience of bush or jungle warfare have our unfortunate men?  They are very highly skilled in their own particular form of conventional warfare which they expected they would meet when joining the Defence Forces and presumably fighting in their own country.  In view of the possibility that civil war will break out and that troops with special knowledge of jungle and bush warfare will be required, surely it is very questionable that we should seriously consider sending a further contingent of our troops into the Congo in a virtually untrained condition, untrained in that particular type of jungle warfare?</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputies are seeking information relating to the total number of persons engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing.  These include farmers and farmers' relatives assisting on home farm, whether or not employed in the sense of receiving regular wages for their work.  The Censuses of Population are the basic sources of these data.  Annual estimates have been prepared, for recent intercensal years but similar estimates for the years prior to 1946 are not available.  It is not, therefore, possible to give the information required by the Deputies for each of the periods specified.</P>
      <P>It can, however, be stated that during the ten years between 1926 and 1936 the total number of persons at work in agriculture, forestry and fishing declined by 6.0 per cent., while between 1936 and 1946 there was a reduction of 7.5 per cent. and for the succeeding ten year period (1946-56) an estimated fall of 21.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>For the period 1952-1959 (covering seven years), which is the latest period for which information is available, the estimated percentage decline in the relevant total was 13.0 per cent., while for the whole period 1926-59 the fall amounted to 35.6 per cent.</P>

Between 1936/37 and 1946 there was a decline of 5.9 per cent., while in the ten year period 1946 to 1956 the volume of output increased by 17.0 per cent.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that dental services for school children are already being provided by Kerry County Council in the county generally by means of three whole-time dental officers who examine and treat children in schools and local authority centres. For some time past, however, the Council have operated, under their school health service, a scheme by which dental treatment for school children in the urban areas of Tralee, Killarney and Listowel is provided by local dentists in their own surgeries under special arrangements made by the Council.  On the 7th May last the Council wrote to my Department enquiring if I would agree, in principle, to the extension of this scheme to a number of other towns in the county and, presumably, this is the proposal referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The scheme based on the special arrangements with private dentists in the three towns above named, is of an experimental character, however, and before I would be prepared to approve of its extension to any other part of the county, I would require to be satisfied that the arrangements proposed would be a suitable alternative to the provision of services by whole-time dental officers.  The matter is being examined by my Department in this light and I shall convey my decision to the Council as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="856" /> for Health whether in view of the findings reported from a survey carried out in New Zealand that dental caries is less prevalent in areas where soils and drinking water have a high content of molybdenum he proposes to amend the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Bill in the light of those findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct that a research project carried out in New Zealand suggests that molybdenum may have an inhibiting effect on dental caries.  The research in question was commenced in 1954-55 in the two towns of Napier and Hastings which are situated within twelve miles of each other.  Each town has a population of approximately 20,000.  They are closely comparable in regard to rainfall, hours of sunshine, socio-economic conditions and racial composition of their population. Moreover their water supplies, which were drawn from the same artesian strata, were found to have a marked deficiency in fluoride content, which in fact was only 0.15 parts per million.</P>
      <P>It having been decided to fluoridate the water supply to one of these towns, Hastings, dental examinations were undertaken of children in both towns who had always lived in them.  The results of this initial survey were in one respect surprising.  It showed that the incidence of dental caries in one of the towns, Napier was much lower than in Hastings, the water supply of which latter it was proposed to fluoridate.  In Napier the survey established that children aged 6, 7 and 8 years respectively, had had 57, 46 and 21 per cent. fewer permanent teeth attacked by caries than in the case of Hastings.  Notwithstanding this, it was decided to proceed with the fluoridation of the water supply to the latter town Where those children lived whose teeth had been found to be so much more vulnerable to the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1957 dental surveys were again made in the same two towns.  This second survey demonstrated that in 2½ years the incidence of dental caries in Hastings, the town with the fluoridated water supply had been reduced to approximately the same level as <Col N="857" /> in 1954-55 and in 1957 in Napier.  I am sure the Deputy will concede that this was a striking manifestation of the effectiveness of fluoride as an inhibitor of dental decay.</P>
    <P>The unexpected result of the first survey showing a striking difference in the incidence of dental caries in two towns the water supplies of which were equally deficient in fiuorides, initiated further research into the cause.  As a result it was found that, though the soils from the two areas showed little difference in the total content of some twenty elements, vegetables grown in the district of Napier, the town supplied with unfluoridated water, were higher in molybdenum, aluminium and titanium, and lower in copper, manganese, barium and strontium than in the area around Hastings.  The research is being continued and the research workers engaged in it have stated that additional studies must be undertaken before definite findings can be established.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the research suggesting a possible association between molybdenum and a lower incidence of dental caries has been of short duration and is far from conclusive, and in view of the further proof yielded by the New Zealand experiment that fluoridation is a strong inhibitor of dental caries and thus affords a large measure of protection to the teeth of children, it is not proposed to amend the Bill as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare what are the terms of the reciprocal agreement between the British and Irish Governments relating to national health service contributions; and whether it is a fact that a person who had paid the full weekly contributions in Britain would, on his return to Ireland, receive £1-10-0 benefit instead of the £2-10-0 payable to him had he remained in Britain and become eligible for payments under the scheme there.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy in referring to the &ldquo;reciprocal agreement between the British and Irish Governments relating to national health service contributions&rdquo; means the reciprocal agreement in relation to social welfare benefits and has in mind the provision for sickness benefit.</P>
      <P>The terms of this Agreement are contained in the Schedule to the Social Welfare (Great Britain Reciprocal Arrangements) Order, 1960 (S.I. No. 96 of 1960).  Article 7 of the Agreement deals with the treatment of insurance in one country for the purpose of title to sickness benefit in the other country.  It enables sickness benefit to be paid to insured persons in one country on foot of contributions of the other country.  An insured person, who moves from one country to the other, is entitled to have his insurance (including contributions paid and credited) in one country treated as insurance in the other country, if, following his arrival in the new country, he claims sickness benefit and the counting of his insurance in the old country would confer title to benefit or to benefit at a higher rate than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of reciprocal arrangements a person claiming sickness benefit in this country could not have contributions <Col N="860" /> under the British scheme taken into account in determining his title to benefit; nor could he be paid benefit under the British scheme while in this country.</P>
    <P>Since the maximum personal rate at which sickness benefit can be paid under the Social Welfare Acts is at present £1-10-0 a week, it follows that a person returning here from Great Britain could not be paid at a higher rate.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960, the personal rate of benefit will be increased as from the 2nd January, 1961, to £1-12-6.  Payment for an adult de pendant will then be increased from 15/- to £1 a week; for each of two qualified children from 8/- to 10/- a week and in the case of each subsequent child 5/- a week will be paid where formerly no payment was made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An Irish citizen who is resident in Britain would not be liable to Irish Income Tax unless he were also resident in this country.  If he were so resident and thus liable to Irish tax, compulsory contributions made by him under the British National Insurance Acts would be allowed as expenses in arriving at his liability to tax in so far as they relate <Col N="863" /> to the provision of certain, income benefits, i.e. widows' benefit, retirement pension and guardians' allowance.</P>

      <P>An allocation of £5,000, subject to a local contribution of £1,250, total £6,250, has been made from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote, 1960/61 for winter employment schemes in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire.  In addition, savings on the 1959/60 schemes, amounting to £1,902 grant, £476 local contribution, total £2,378, are available for expenditure this year.  No allocation <Col N="864" /> has been made for Rathdown as such, but allocations have been made for two built up areas in that part of County Dublin, as follows: Dún Laoghaire suburbs, grant £400, local contribution £135, total £535; Sandyford, grant £200, local contribution £70, total £270.</P>
      <P>Three schemes have been approved for Dun Laoghaire County Borough, located at Williamstown, at Dunedin, Monkstown Avenue, and at Sandycove. Schemes have been approved at Sandyford and at Newtownpark in Dún Laoghaire suburbs.</P>
      <P>It is calculated that the Dún Laoghaire Borough allocation, amounting to a total of £8,628, will give approximately 700 man-weeks employment, equivalent to employing, say, 40 men over a period of 4 months.

      <P>I understand that the action by Mr. Kasavubu to which the Deputy refers was taken under Articles 17 and 22 of the &ldquo;Fundamental Law relating to the Structure of the Congo&rdquo; which is regarded as governing these matters pending the enactment of a Constitution.</P>
      <P>I would not consider it proper for the Government to express an opinion on the interpretation placed on the relevant provisions of the Congolese &ldquo;Fundamental Law&rdquo; by those powers which voted in favour of Mr. Kasavubu and the delegation nominated by him being accepted to represent the Congo in the United Nations.  I might point out, however, that the vote in the General Assembly which the Deputy appears to have in mind did not bear on a choice between Mr. Kasavubu and Mr. Lumumba but on the Report of the Credentials Committee, which, by a majority, recommended acceptance of Mr. Kasavubu's delegation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture if in view of the perennial conflict of views between the farmers' representatives, his Department and the millers on the subject of the millability of native wheat, he will consider setting up a joint board representative of all three interests for the purpose of investigating the possibility of establishing a more precise definition or test for native wheat millability and to ensure that the growers will have a more authoritative say in the determination of any such definition or test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of millable wheat has been a bone of contention for many years.  When the harvest is good there is no problem, but seasons such as 1958 and 1960 underline the differences between the views of the millers and the growers.  The millability of native wheat in such years turns very largely on the proportion which is included in the grist.  The fact of the matter is that wheat can be regarded as millable only if the quality of the flour and bread it produces is acceptable to the consumers. In these circumstances I do not think that any useful purpose would be served in setting up a joint board as suggested by the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that when wheat is brought to X mill very often it is rejected and when the same wheat is brought to Y mill it is <Col N="871" /> accepted as millable there?  Can the Minister reconcile that for the farming community who are being sent from Billy to Jack with that wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In both the years I have mentioned the growers of wheat suffered no loss because of the quality of the wheat produced but the question of determining that matter for the purpose of paying the growers of wheat and using the wheat so purchased is an entirely different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that what I am saying is correct.  The growers of wheat have been paid for their crop on the basis of the Wheat Orders.  I have said in reply to the Deputy's question that the millability of the wheat depends largely upon the percentage which is used in the grist. No matter what body you set up and no matter how you determine in advance the question of what is millable and what is not millable, everything depends on the acceptability of the end product to the consuming public.</P>

      <P>When there is ample water at the hydro stations, all hydro generating units are run at full output and full capacity for such period as is necessary to ensure the use of the water available.  When there is ample turf available for the turf stations, all turf-fired generating units are run at full output and capacity for such period as is necessary to use the annual production of turf.  When there is ample supply of water and turf, the coal/oil fired stations operate to meet the balance of the system load.  Some of these may be at full capacity and others may not.</P>
      <P>When there is shortage of water for the hydro stations, which usually occurs in the Autumn, the steam stations must make good the deficiency and in the last two years when water supplies were at lowest, all the steam stations including both turf and coal/oil stations had to be used at times to maximum output capacity.</P>

    <Title>Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1960&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There has already been a request that the Government should send a personal representative to the <Col N="890" /> Congo to keep the Government here informed of political developments.  I should like to make that request again. The Taoiseach has made very considerable adaptations in his original attitude as to the sacrosanctity of the decisions of the United Nations.  He is now prepared to question them.  I wonder would he now reconsider this question of the personal representative and if he is sending out a further contingent, see that they are protected by such a representative?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach suggested that the danger of the personal representative is that his appearance might be resented in the Congo.  That, of course, is what happened in regard to the Ghana delegate but we are most anxious that no interference should take place at all if such a personal representative were sent out and that his sole function should be to keep the Taoiseach and the Government in contact with the day-to-day and week-to-week political developments in the Congo so that he will have first hand information upon which to make his decisions.  The general principle of the personal representative is established as long as States exist.  Every major city in Europe has a representative of the Government and it is just rubbish for the Taoiseach to suggest that a personal representative might get us into trouble.  We have our ambassadors and our personal representatives in every major city and their main function is to refer back the details of political activities in the countries to which they are attached.  That is the sort of function that I had in mind in suggesting that a personal representative should be sent to the Congo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to make the statement that certain conditions could arise in which the Government might decide not to send out a further contingent. I welcome that in so far as it is almost a clear decision by the Taoiseach to take positive action, if he decides that the situation requires action in any particular way in relation to our contingent, and will refuse to send them out if he considers it undesirable to do so.  I should like the conditions under which he would <Col N="891" /> refuse to send out troops to be that the Parliament of the Congo be reconvened; that Mr. Lumumba be freed from jail; that Colonel Mobuto be tried as a rebellious general&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not quite as heated about this as Deputy Dr. Browne.  I am not a Party man and so I am not concerned about any request.  I am just concerned about facts but, to some extent like Deputy Dr. Browne, I want information.  I know <Col N="893" /> it is difficult to discuss this Bill without in some way touching on the Congo but I shall do no more than that if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle permits.</P>
      <P>The questions that I have been asked by members of the community are on those lines.  We do not recognise any existing authority in the Congo.  We are there only to keep the peace until some decision is taken as to who is the authority.  That being the case it happens that it was reported in the Press that the Katanga forces did, in fact, attack tribes and massacre them, namely, the Balubas.  I think, therefore, that it would be our duty in recognising any particular body to prevent any such body as the alleged Katanga Government or any other body from taking any action pending the settlement of the whole question.  But it has happened that tribes were massacred for some time before the attack was made on the Irish troops.  The question has been put: if this body, the Katanga force which is not a Government but some junta or other, have the right to attack other tribes, are not the Balubas who were attacked entitled in turn to throw up some barrier to prevent further attacks?  Were we going a little too far then in removing these barriers? Were we, on the one hand, preventing the Balubas from attacking the Katanga group and, on the other hand, were we preventing the Katanga group from attacking the Balubas?  That is a fair question.  It was posed in an editorial in one of our own newspapers.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to delve into Congolese politics, but the point is where does our police action begin and end? Should we, or should we not, have removed these barricades?  Should we have prevented the alleged Government of Katanga from taking action against the Balubas?  We should, I think, do all these things pending some settlement recognised by the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am on this attack on the Balubas, I should like to state that I am not satisfied that the Irish Forces under the authority of the United Nations are properly armed.  Judging <Col N="894" /> by the reply given by the Minister to a question I tabled that would appear to be the position.  The Minister said that the patrol that was attacked had two Bren guns, four sub-machine guns and four rifles.  There was no mention at all of side arms.  Not even the officer carried side arms.  All the evidence goes to show that while these men were removing the obstacles none of them was armed.  They were completely defenceless.  That is common knowledge.  That information was conveyed in a letter from one of the soldiers serving in the Congo.  The men were not properly armed.  I assert that any new Force sent to the Congo should be supplied with side arms so that, if it is any part of their duty to remove obstacles, or carry out the work of a construction corps, they will not suffer a surprise attack and be completely helpless in the face of it as they were on the last tragic occasion.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to sending a Force to the Congo.  I recognise that were it not for the action of the United Nations there would have been largescale massacres in the Congo.  They are a primitive people &ldquo;rarin' to go&rdquo; and to some extent we put a brake on them.  I know that we shall be misrepresented. We may take sides but I believe that in the long run we shall do good, much as our efforts may be misrepresented at this stage.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with Congolese politics.  I am concerned with our soldiers in the Congo.  Suppose civil war breaks out and it becomes a case of every man for himself, and suppose the United Nations cannot help in the withdrawal of our troops, are there plans to withdraw our Forces independently of any United Nations help? Could this Force become a sort of lost battalion?</P>
    <P>This Bill gives the Government power to send our Forces outside the State.  Is it not possible that a situation similar to that which exists in the Congo might arise in Northern Ireland?  Would this Bill cover that? The area would not be outside the State.  I just mention the possibility.</P>
    <P>Service in the Congo will be recognised <Col N="895" /> as active service under this measure.  I approve of that.  If a man gets a &ldquo;belt&rdquo; of a feather, that will be accepted as active service.  What a shame, remembering that the I.R.A. were not regarded as being on active service although they were subject to arrest, imprisonment, and everything else.  Our Forces in the Congo are a police force.  They may not even be hit with a feather, but their service is recognised as active service.  It was disputed that the service given by the I.R.A.  was active service.  I mention the point for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>With regard to compulsion, I do not agree that a man should be compelled to serve overseas.  I know that compulsion will refer only to those who join after this Bill becomes law.  Is there not a possibility that that provision may have an adverse effect upon recruiting?  Will men refuse to join because they realise they may be sent to the Congo, or elsewhere?  Is there not a possibility that future crises may be of an ideological nature and men may hold opinions &ldquo;for&rdquo; or &ldquo;against&rdquo;?  Is it not possible some men may be sent overseas in an ideological clash between Russia and the West and, holding certain opinions, might desert?  I do not think that men should be compelled.  One can rely on volunteers.  One cannot rely on those who are compelled.  Apart from that, many young men join the Army for economic reasons.  I do not suppose they carefully study the terms of enlistment any more than tenants study the leases of the houses in which they live.  They may resent being sent to the Congo, or their parents may resent it.  I think all service overseas should be voluntary.</P>
    <P>I could discuss this question in the same way as Deputy Dr. Browne discussed it because I know a little about international politics.  I have made a study of them.  I believe we are doing the right thing now, though time may show that we are doing the wrong thing.  It is stipulated in the Bill that the matter will be reconsidered from time to time.  I just want to mention one case in which grave mistakes were made.  During the struggle for Italian <Col N="896" /> independence it was a very laudable thing for people to enlist to help the Pope.  Events have proved that that was wrong because it is in the Pope's own interest not to have temporal power.  At the time it seemed to be right.  History has proved that it was wrong.</P>
    <P>As I said on an earlier occasion, we may have the best intentions, but that will not save us from being beaten up by both sides.  That has already happened. Members of the Irish Brigade fighting with the French forces were butchered when the revolution broke out because it was held that they had no business being in France and no business interfering.  I think one of Deputy Dillon's forebears was in charge of the force that was guillotined.</P>
    <P>I endorse fully the proposal to send these forces but I want to ensure that in future they will be adequately armed and able to protect themselves.  I also want to ensure that if it comes to withdrawal, the method of withdrawing is carefully planned in case at some stage it is &ldquo;every man for himself&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to open the wide question as to what is the solution to the problems in the Congo because it seems to me that that is a very deep and muddy stream in which to fish at the moment.  It is quite clear our troops in the Congo are very largely in the role of endeavouring to keep the peace&mdash;of endeavouring, in fact, to hold the reins in the hope that the good sense of the Congolese will ultimately assert itself and triumph over the disunity and chaos which exist there at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only hope of solving the Congo problem is on the basis that it will give satisfaction to the Congolese. Settling the Congo problem on whatever basis Belgium or Russia desires will provide no enduring solution.  The Congo problem must be settled by the Congolese people themselves.  The task of our troops, and of the United Nations forces as a whole there, must be to create such conditions as will enable the wisdom of the Congolese people to exert itself, and to endeavour <Col N="897" /> to set up a homogeneous Congolese State, taking cognisance of the tribal pecularities of that part of the world but ultimately giving that vast region which is about 34 or 35 times the size of Ireland some kind of stable Government.</P>
    <P>The danger in relation to the Congo is that, like Berlin and like East Germany, it will provide another bone of contention for the continuance of the cold, and sometimes nearly hot, war between the East and the West.  It would be a tragedy and a disaster not only for Africa but for the world if the cold war were extended to that overheated cauldron of the Continent of Africa.  If the East-West dispute is carried into Africa there is no knowing where it will end and there is no knowing what harm it will do the world.  The biggest sufferers will be those emergent nations in Africa who will find, no matter in what guise their liberators arrive, the ultimate result will be a bad one from their point of view.</P>
    <P>Nobody will question the fact that the presence of the United Nations troops in the Congo has averted a large-scale civil war and in the Congo the tinder of civil war lights easier than it does in Europe and many other places throughout the world.  The presence of the United Nations troops has not averted the creation of chaos in many parts of the Congo but it has at least kept the trouble so far within manageable proportions.  I hope that ultimately the Congolese people themselves will recognise the futility of fratricidal strife which is only weakening their own country and perhaps creating conditions which will continue to worsen and make an ultimate peaceful settlement impossible.</P>
    <P>The line of our people in the Congo has been a noble line which thoughtful people throughout the world will applaud.  Whether it was wise or unwise to have sent troops to the Congo, we need not stop now to assess that. The whole nation has shown its gratitude to those who have gone there and, no doubt, the whole nation will applaud them on their return home.</P>
    <P>Nobody who has not seen the bush <Col N="898" /> and the desert of Africa has the slightest notion of the terrain in which troops from Western Europe are compelled to live and to fight; millions of acres practically unoccupied where the foot of civilisation has not yet made its impression on the ground, places where there are no roads, streets or paths, no water, no electric light, no sanitation, no medical supplies or hospitals, and no protection from the burning, blistering heat.  That is the kind of atmosphere and the kind of climate under which our troops must operate.  One person there of some rank has described it to me as a living hell out of which, he says, he cannot get quickly enough.  I can well imagine how troops, used to Irish climatic conditions, not having had the slightest notion of what Africa looks like, feel in a country so friendless and inhospitable as the African bush and the African desert.</P>
    <P>There is in Africa, stemming from colonialism under which the African people were frequently exploited, a deep prejudice against the white man and it is open to discussion as to whether white troops should be sent to Africa in these circumstances. There are now so many Afro-Asian nations in affiliation with the United Nations that it might be well to try to find a police force for the Congo from the Afro-Asian nations.  It is said that climatically it is no place for white troops, for a long period certainly and, even when it was staffed by Colonial Powers with white troops, they were never left there very long. It is a matter for careful consideration whether, in view of the climatic conditions, the inhospitable country and the prejudice against the white man on the part of even countries which are in affiliation with the United Nations, it is desirable to send further troops there.</P>
    <P>We must, when requested by the United Nations, discharge our responsibility under the Charter.  We have done that and we have shown our willingness to do it and I think that it redounds to our credit as an independent affiliate of the United Nations. However, on the grounds of sheer practicability, some consideration <Col N="899" /> ought to be given to the question of using Afro-Asian troops instead of white troops.</P>
    <P>In regard to the sending of a further contingent to the Congo I take it nobody will be asked to go unless he is a volunteer.  I believe, however, that those who are being asked to go in the future should be permitted the opportunity of hearing from those who have been there what life out there is like. If they are told the real facts of the situation and if they have to encounter all the difficulties which our first two contingents have experienced there in that extremely difficult country, there may not be so many willing to go.  It is very easy in a case like this to appear to be wise after the event and I do not want to adopt that role.</P>
    <P>However, bearing in mind all the difficulties which must be encountered in that vast, almost tractless country, I want to ask the Government is it desirable that we should send more troops there.  It may very well be found that an equally fruitful job may be done by the utilisation of Afro-Asian troops.  If they continue to play the part, as the present contingents are playing, of trying to keep the reins and hoping for the emergence of a uniform Congo administration, in the long run we shall all be glad to acclaim the splendid part the U.N. is playing and its ultimate triumph.</P>
    <P>Our concern must not be with Kasavubu and all these transitory characters moving across the stage.  It is unwise for any of us to believe that any of them has a Heaven-sent solution for the Congo problem.  What the United Nations must do, and what our troops must do, is everything they can to maintain what we believe in, namely.  Parliamentary Government.  It does not matter who drops by the wayside so long as, in the long run, Parliamentary Government is maintained so that the people of the Congo may be able, so far as their standard of democracy permits, to select a Government and form their institutions in accordance with the democratic code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the House and the country welcome <Col N="900" /> the part that our nation is playing in the United Nations generally and the part played by our troops in the Congo for the purpose of preserving peace and establishing democratic Government.  I should like to point out that when the first Bill came before the House prior to the Recess, a Bill which when enacted enabled the Government to send two battalions for service in the Congo, some of us here, while welcoming the part about to be played, pointed out that we had the responsibility to ensure that our troops would be used for the purposes for which they were meant to be used. I do not intend to deal at any length with the internal fluid political situation in the Congo, but I want to repeat this.  The United Nations Organisation was asked by the Government, Premier and President of the Congo to send troops into the Congo.  The Irish Government were asked by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to allow Irish troops to be part of the United Nations contingent in the Congo.  The duty of the U.N. troops in the Congo was to establish order and to ensure that the Belgian troops in Katanga were sent about their business.</P>
      <P>That was the purpose of the invitation issued by the Government of the Congo to the United Nations.  Nobody can deny that.  Some months ago we pointed out here the danger of trouble in Katanga, due to the fact that the Belgian mining interests controlled the political situation there.  Regretfully, I have to say that our analysis of the situation at that time and our forecast has proved to be completely and absolutely accurate.  Therefore, because of that, we may find ourselves criticising the Government for their apparent lack of interest in establishing to their own satisfaction that our troops were being used for the original purposes for which they were invited to the Congo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation since last June is that the duly elected Premier of the Congo, the man with the largest single Party in the Government and with the assent of both Houses of Parliament at that time, has now been removed from office and is in jail.  His place has <Col N="901" /> been taken&mdash;for the time being, I hope &mdash;by a military dictator.  I shall not go into the situation concerning that dictator, but I want to put this on the records of the House.  Democracy was one of the things we were anxious to establish, not a military dictatorship. We must ensure while we have troops in the Congo, and if we are sending a further contingent in the future, through our contacts with the United Nations or otherwise, that our troops do not become the instruments of imperialism and colonialism and are not used for the partition of the Congo.  I think no Deputy should deny the right of any other Deputy to put that point of view when we are making a decision in regard to the lives and welfare of the fine young men we have in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>It was in order to ensure that every possible action would be taken by our Government to ensure that our troops would not be misused in the Congo that we suggested the idea of the appointment of at least one political observer, or perhaps one in each of the areas concerned.  Without in any way being critical of the Army officers and those in the higher command of the Army, I say emphatically that military men are not the best judges of the delicate points in a political crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the case that we must have some liaison with our troops outside the actual military in order to ensure they are used for the purpose for which they were sent to the Congo.  I shall pass from that.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise again to the Taoiseach the absolute necessity of establishing a political contact apart altogether from the military contacts. I welcome the action of the Chief of Staff and other members of the Defence Forces in touring the various localities in the Congo where our troops are stationed in order to see the conditions there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to impress on the Taoiseach that he seems to my mind over a long period to have had no interest in the <Col N="902" /> idea of keeping close contact with our troops in the Congo.  On the 23rd November he was asked in this House about that problem and his reply to the Dáil was:</P>
    <P>I pointed out that the Irish contingent in the Congo would be subject to the orders of the United Nations Supreme Commander and not to the orders of the Irish Government and that, while it could be said that we were not sufficiently informed about the situation in the Congo to make a proper appreciation of it, we should not, in my opinion, regard ourselves as being under any obligation to make that appreciation.</P>
    <P>I regard that as a most damning statement for the Taoiseach to have made.  It infers that it is not our business as a Parliament and as a nation to establish to our satisfaction that our troops in the Congo are not being used for purposes which we never envisaged.  I maintain that it is our duty to do so and I am glad to-day that the Taoiseach has altered his opinion and has decided, according to his own statement, that the question of a further contingent or replacement depends on two points.</P>
    <P>One of these points is whether, in January next, it will then be considered more advisable that only non-white troops should be there solely for the purpose of establishing peace and order.  The second point he made was that there may be a change in the objectives of the United Nations forces in the Congo between now and next January.  We know that the Taoiseach has now decided that it is our business and in our own interests to make sure of the situation under which our troops are likely to be used.</P>
    <P>He has now decided that we have an obligation to make an appreciation of the situation in the Congo and he has stated that if we are not satisfied on the two points he mentioned we may not send replacements to the Congo.  Therefore, I think it was a disgraceful attitude on the part of the Taoiseach to launch an attack on Deputy Dr. Browne when he said that he had no shame in his bones.  I think <Col N="903" /> the Taoiseach should make an apology to Deputy Dr. Browne for his disgraceful and unreasonable attack on a Deputy of this House for saying what he did say with regard to a situation on which the Taoiseach himself has now altered his view.</P>
    <P>The point made by the Taoiseach up to this is that we have handed over our troops to the United Nations and that, once we have done that, that is the end of it.  Is this country going to be out on a limb in the United Nations in this respect?  Are we going to take up a different line from that of other countries?  The day after Deputy Dr. Browne suggested that a political observer should be sent to the Congo the Premier of India, a man for whom we all have a great regard, protested to the United Nations at the way in which Indian troops and officials were treated by the Congolese.  He pointed out also the alleged military dictatorship that had been set up under Mobuto.  There could be nothing wrong in our following the example of a statesman of that calibre.  The Premiers of Ghana and Egypt also protested at the way their troops were being used and surely we are not going to take up a different stand on that so far as Irish troops are concerned, and say that we are handing them over to the United Nations and that we have no further responsibility?</P>
    <P>While I am proud of the fact that we are members of the United Nations, I know that the United Nations are not infallible and therefore there is nothing wrong in our pointing out where we may feel that they are wrong.  Even a former Taoiseach mentioned in this House, when I suggested that we should bring up the question of Partition in the United Nations, that we might not get the answer that we would wish for.  Even the former Taoiseach of the country realised that fair play might not be given at all times.  Even members of the Fianna Fáil Party have no great confidence that every action taken by the United Nations is a proper one.  If they feel in that way, they should do something to protect the good name of this <Col N="904" /> country and make sure that it will not be associated with imperialism or colonialism, or, worse still, associated with the idea of securing the partition of any country.  We should take every possible step to protect our good name in that regard.</P>
    <P>The great majority of our troops in the Congo have been stationed in the Province of Katanga.  I want to know if it is the intention under this Bill that this replacement of our troops will be going to Katanga, or perhaps to Niemba and other places where tragedies took place in November? Let us remember clearly that our idea was that the Congolese should be allowed to settle their own affairs, and that the Belgian or Russian solution was not to be the solution for the Congolese.  We find that our troops, who were sent to the Congo for the purpose of giving police protection to the people there, are actually being used in Katanga to strengthen the position there.  If that is so it is not going to be much help to the Congolese as a nation.  It is in Katanga that our troops are and it is there that the new contingent is likely to go.</P>
    <P>Last July in the Security Council of the United Nations there was a motion on the question of the Congo by Ceylon and Tunisia which called on the Belgians to withdraw their troops immediately.  That resolution was passed unanimously by the Security Council of the United Nations.  What did we find?  At that time, and afterwards, the Belgians, instead of withdrawing their troops, strengthened their armed forces there. They sent in over 4,000 troops, mostly paratroops, from last July up to the present.  In addition they have 2,000 seasoned troops stationed in four garrisons in Katanga at four permanent bases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in Katanga that our troops are likely to be used and I want to point out what a dangerous situation there is likely to be in the province of Katanga where the Belgians, instead of getting out, have re-established themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> On Radio Éireann on the 21st October, 1960 there was a news item about Katanga and it was reported that the Belgians refused point blank to withdraw their troops at the request of the United Nations.  We were then coming very near November 2nd, the time of the tragedy of the Irish troops in Katanga.  There is no doubt that in spite of repeated requests by the United Nations the Belgians failed to remove one solitary member of their forces from Katanga.  Instead, in addition to the troops I have mentioned, over 500 officers have been attached under various disguises to the gendarmerie and other forces in Katanga, all Belgian officers to lead the troops and police who are under the control of the breakaway Premier, Mr. Tshombe.</P>
    <P>Tragedy struck portion of the Irish contingent at the beginning of November and two days after that happened Mr. Dayal, the personal representative of Mr. Hammarskjoeld reported to the United Nations that the recent influx of Belgian nationals was responsible for part of the difficulty in Katanga and in the Congo.  What was the position?  We found that our men were sent out to lift a road block and they were attacked.  I do not know the actual military situation; I have not been in contact with any soldier but I have an idea of the complete unpreparedness of these young men in regard to what they were likely to meet.  They went out to remove this road block.  That road block was put down by Baluba tribesmen and the Balubas are part and parcel of the Congo in the sense that they want Katanga re-united with the Congo.</P>
    <P>The Balubas hate the sight of the Belgians because we know from history that Belgian colonialism is probably the worst type&mdash;even worse than the British.  Every white man they saw was to them a Belgian and this Irish contingent was slaughtered because, in the belief of the Balubas, they were there to protect the Belgians. After the tragic event, we had the Chief of the Balubas apologising and pointing out that it was a tragic mistake that our troops were <Col N="906" /> slaughtered because these tribes, uneducated as they are and far away from civilisation, were in the position that to them every white man that they saw was a Belgian and they took what they considered was the necessary action.  At that time all through Katanga Belgian forces were in occupation, either as officers, paratroops or some sort of police under the control of Katanga and the Irish troops got mixed up in this.  Can it be denied that under the circumstances our position was a most unfortunate one in Katanga?  Was it unfair for us to suggest that political observers should have been sent to the Congo in order to know, before our troops were sent in there, whether this danger of mistake would arise, whether United Nations troops would be mistaken for Belgians by the warring forces in Katanga?</P>
    <P>I think it was a very fair suggestion to make and at this stage I think we cannot tolerate the idea of troops being sent from Ireland to the province of Katanga to act for the purpose of protecting Belgian property.  The richest area in the entire Congo is the province of Katanga and we know that the key to the successful formation of a national Government in the Congo, a truly democratic Government, lies in the Province of Katanga. Whatever group possess political or economic control of Katanga will control the lifeblood of the entire Congo.</P>
    <P>We know what the Belgians did. From the time of Casement, right up to the present, their history was anything but good.  Admittedly, they saw their mistake in recent years; admittedly, they decided to give freedom to the Congo but we must remember that freedom was given overnight.  It came when there were no more than 16 University graduates of Congolese extraction from that entire vast territory, which had no trained administrators, no army, no native civil servants, no navy and no police drawn from the ranks of the Congolese.</P>
    <P>Overnight, the Belgians withdrew, but they left their Trojan horse in the Province of Katanga because their idea in going was that things would collapse and that they would then return.  That is the position.  That is <Col N="907" /> precisely what has happened, and behind all the trouble taking place in the Congo to day are the Belgians. It is not because the Congolese as such are not able to negotiate with one another if they were let alone.</P>
