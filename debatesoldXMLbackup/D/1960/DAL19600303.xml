    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,133,500 be granted to <Col N="1158" /> defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.&mdash;(Minister for Agriculture.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I covered most of the points I had to make on this Vote last night, but after leaving the House I had a discussion with several people who attended the Dublin market this week.  They informed me of what I would call a rumour that was current there and I would ask the Minister to deal with this rumour because our line so far as this Estimate is concerned is one of co-operation.  We are not endeavouring to sabotage the T.T. scheme.  We do not consider it is a laughing matter; it is a most serious matter.  Only a short time ago I am sure that the Minister's colleagues would have liked to have sabotaged the whole scheme and would have liked something like this to have arisen.  I shall not go into that now except that I want to say that it was rumoured yesterday in Dublin that the Minister had given instruction to his buyers to offer considerably lower prices for reactors.  Without asking anybody, I regarded that as a rumour and I believe there is no foundation for it.  I should like the Minister when replying to tell the country that is the case and to assure the farmers that there is no foundation for such a rumour.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will be able to bring this T.B. eradication campaign to a successful conclusion in the shortest possible time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points on which I wish to comment. The first is in connection with the land project.  I merely wish to point out to the Minister that in my constituency a great deal of very necessary work on the project is held up indefinitely due to the fact that outgoing drains are not attended to.  This arises as a result of Government action in suspending the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I would urge the Minister even at this <Col N="1159" /> late stage to use his influence to have grants made available under the Act so that the work can continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Minister carries great weight in the councils and it is on that basis that I am urging him to do this.</P>
      <P>There is one other point I want to comment on very briefly.  I hope it will not be suggested that I am committing heresy when I suggest to the Government that the time has arrived to examine very seriously the question of the dead meat trade in all its aspects.  While we all welcome the urgent measures being taken in connection with the T.B. eradication scheme we should at the same time realise that one beast slaughtered here and processed here is of far greater benefit to the community than three beasts exported on the hoof.  I should like to emphasise this point that for the small farmers of under £12 valuation&mdash;we have many of them in the west of Ireland&mdash;the store cattle trade, as we have had it for the past 40 years, in my humble opinion, is not good sound economics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem that is a matter for the main Estimate rather than for this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the dead meat trade has been mentioned and we are giving extra money in connection with the cattle business and surely I am entitled to comment briefly on the desirability of putting more emphasis on that aspect of the cattle industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy relates his remarks to the bovine tuberculosis scheme he would be in order but otherwise it would not arise on this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be in <Col N="1160" /> order in suggesting that quite a considerable amount of money might be devoted to the setting up of proper State-controlled concerns to deal with the processing of meat in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A debate on a Supplementary Estimate is confined to the various subheads and there is nothing in the subheads to which to relate the Deputy's remarks on the point he is making.  It would be a matter for the main Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take it that it is not within the rules of procedure to comment on a very important aspect of our agricultural programme, namely our cattle trade, I bow to your ruling in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no question about passing this Supplementary Estimate, but my worry is on account of the slow progress in eradicating this disease.  I wonder if we have missed the boat completely.  Take the West of Ireland at the moment.  I am told by some of the officials of the Minister's Department that in County Galway we are as clear of the disease to-day as they are in any part of England.  The trouble as far as I see it is that while we can claim to be in that happy position reactors come in from outside.  The Minister himself referred to that matter here last week.</P>
      <P>I think there should be some tightening up.  This matter has cost the State a large amount of money and it will cost more.  When you have an area in a condition such as Galway is in at present, something should be done so that outside reactors cannot be brought in because the result of bringing in reactors would be to start the whole thing all over again.  I would appeal to the Minister to look into the matter to see if there is any hope of tightening things up so that this would not occur.  I am afraid it is happening in County Galway.  If the whole country had been taken as a unit early in the scheme, that would not have happened and could not have happened. I feel that was the great mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other appeal I must make to the Minister.  As far as the West of Ireland is concerned, we are <Col N="1161" /> practically a clear area and we would be completely clear if it were not for the matter I have just mentioned.  For the export of our tested cattle in the West I think it is very important that they should be exported from the West rather than brought to Dublin or some other place.  In connection with that I would appeal to the Minister to whisper to his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Department that in the near future his Department would do whatever work is necessary so that the port of Galway would be brought into condition to take these cattle.  Then we would not have to go through any other part of Ireland with our livestock.</P>
    <P>These are the two points I have to make.  Some people who have no consciences are bringing reactors into an area that has been cleared.  I would appeal to the Minister to have a further tightening up in that regard. I would also ask him to see that the port of Galway be put into condition so that, when the area is clear, our livestock can be exported through that port.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can very truthfully say in relation to the discussion which has taken place on this Supplementary Estimate and in particular in relation to that part of it relating to cost, which is the great bulk of the requirement that is being asked for here, that my Department has given everything that we have to give to get some life into the scheme, to bring home to everybody an appreciation of the importance of it, to bring home to all concerned how much they themselves can do to help us in this and to bring home to our people the ineffectiveness of any effort that we may make without their understanding and co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thought has often arisen in my own mind, and I have from time to time discussed it with my officials, as to the best means of putting over to the people mostly concerned in this its importance, and the importance of securing from them the fullest that they can give in the way of co-operation. Some people will say to you: <Col N="1162" />&ldquo;Your publicity should take a definite from, you should have more meetings, you should make more speeches, you should print more literature.&rdquo;  Dozens of suggestions can be made in every matter of this nature that can arise.  I always find it hard to decide what sort of steps, what sort of action, is likely to secure the best results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>An adequate advisory service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that too.  As I have said, different people have different ideas and I suppose members of this House, and people everywhere, have the belief that they know and that they understand the mentality of those with whom they are dealing better than the other fellow.  I do not want to claim I know it better than anybody else but I would like to think that I know it as well.  I often thought that too much official exhortation, too much &ldquo;speechifying&rdquo;, if I might put it that way, too much printed paper such as leaflets and so on, do not automatically ring the bell you want to ring.  I often suspected that instead of securing that end it had the very opposite result.</P>
      <P>Since I came into this Department there has been no suggestion from any source, either inside or outside the country, that has not been carefully examined.  In everything we have done, in every scheme we have devised and in every change we have made in our endeavours to improve matters and give the work the impetus we wish to give it, the ideas of many people are reflected.  Maybe we could have had more publicity and more direct contact by the distribution of leaflets and so on, but whatever changes we may make in the years ahead, up to now all the advice we could secure as to the best means of reaching the public mind and securing public co-operation has been carefully considered by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to blame our people for possessing, maybe, characteristics that are peculiar to us.  I do not know enough about the people of the outside world to be sure whether we are any <Col N="1163" /> worse in that regard than they are. But I certainly would be prepared to take the risk, even with my limited knowledge, of saying that we are no better.  There was mention of the markets.  I was in the market on Tuesday and what took place there for everyone present to see was something a thousand times more effective than all any Minister for Agriculture could say since we started on this major campaign to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.  It was the price that spoke.  It was the 15/- to 20/- per cwt. extra that spoke there.  What took place there, perhaps belatedly, can be of considerable assistance and encouragement for the people in the Department who have been concentrating on the clearance area and, as I have said, may be more effective than all we have said in the past.  If we could really get the whole-hearted support and co-operation of the people living in the western clearance area, the question put to me by a number of Deputies yesterday could be answered fairly accurately.  By that I mean it could be answered to within a couple of months.</P>
    <P>What absolutely puzzles me is this. You go out amongst the people, to a show maybe, and you meet somebody you know.  Before 60 seconds have passed, if he comes from the clearance area, he is probably telling you of all the things that are wrong there.  He tells you about the rascality of some people trucking in green tag cattle, about the scoundrels breaking the barrier over the Shannon, in so far as it is possible to have a barrier of this kind.  He tells you of the people bringing in untested stock without a permit.  After he has built up this wonderful tale of woe he seems surprised when you remind him that these scoundrels would make no progress at all and could not benefit in any way if the farmers in the clearance area to whom they hope to sell would ask the simple question &ldquo;Have these stock been tested?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When you ask the individual who comes along with all these tales of woe: &ldquo;Do you expect the Department <Col N="1164" /> of Agriculture to erect a Maginot Line around the clearance area?&rdquo; would it not be more natural to expect the people in it, who have the substantial advantage of having been selected as the first area in which an attempt is made to clear it of all reactor stock&mdash; which are being purchased on the basis of a very generous valuation&mdash;and who will have the further advantage of higher prices that will obtain when the stage of accreditation or attestation is reached, that they would form themselves into a Maginot Line of their own?  Would it not be natural to expect them, when they go to a fair or mart, to enquire whether the animals offered to them have been tested in the area itself or, if they have been brought in from outside, whether they have come in covered by a permit having successfully passed the 14-day test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Minister?  I think he knows as well as I do the mind of the ordinary small farmer in rural Ireland.  Can he imagine any 12-acre farmer saying: &ldquo;Have these cattle been tested within the area, or have they come into the area under the appropriate licence showing they have been tested elsewhere?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>To me it sounds fantastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not know them but it would be somewhat strange if I did not.  It would be very strange, and I am quite convinced in my own mind that they know the questions they should ask and they know how to put them, just as well as anyone here in this House would.  I am trying to demonstrate how they can at this belated stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister allow me to interrupt him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not usual to interrupt the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to demonstrate how at this belated stage they can take the type of action that will mean more to us, that will mean to themselves personally, and will mean <Col N="1165" /> more to the country as a whole than anything I can say, or anything we can publish, or any resolutions we can pass through our public bodies or otherwise.  Officially the Department must give the lead.  The Department must be alert.  The Department must listen to the complaints that reach it and then try to smooth things out as best it can but again I come back to the point I made at the outset, that we cannot effectively bring this to a speedy and successful conclusion unless we secure a full blooded appreciation on the part of individual farmers of the facts.  I do not mind whether they have nine, ten, 12, 15 or 50 acres.  As I said in reply to Deputy Dillon, neither do I believe that they are not sufficiently intelligent to know how to put the questions which I say they can put. Not only that, when they go into fairs or marts, if they find stock being exhibited there for sale about which they are suspicious there is an obvious course for them to take also.</P>
      <P>I have often thought what we could do in the way of taking other measures against those who, because they can sell or dispose of reactor stock and maybe reactor calves of 14 days, then carelessly purchase new stock which is not tested.  I imagine it might be difficult but it should not be impossible to devise means by which if the stock on a man's farm has been tested and on a further test is found to contain other animals that were not tested on the previous occasion and which, because of their appearance would be likely to be of an age that they should have been tested, that man could be penalised for taking such animals into his herd without making the necessary inquiries, or refusing to make these inquiries, perhaps because he felt that even if they did not pass the required test he would be compensated for them anyway.  As I say, there are so many simple means of evasion.  I am not saying that is the type of evasion that might not be regarded by many people as quite a simple matter but I am making this statement because yesterday I was invited to say when I thought we were likely to declare the Western area an attested area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nobody who would like to <Col N="1166" /> be able to fix a firm date for that better than I would but, however, I cannot do it.  I would like to be fairly sure of my ground before I would even moot a date.  I admit there has been a departure in the declaration of County Sligo as a clearance area as against a larger area.  I admit that it is natural that we must, when making a decision on such matters as these, take into consultation those who have to be satisfied as well as ourselves because these are the people who will probably buy the stock from us, stock which they will release into their own attested herds.  Therefore they must have a say and must be free to express an opinion.  Apart altogether from any opinions that they may have or may express on the subject, looking at the proposition now and looking at the question of controls and the difficulty of controls&mdash;I am referring to controls of movement&mdash;and seeing that some of the other counties there are very well advanced too, I would really be inclined to think that the best idea is to wait a little while so as to be able to declare for the larger area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the west of the Shannon area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is the best that I can do in the way of giving information.  The disease incidence over practically the entire area is obviously very, very, very low indeed but our problem will be this matter of effective control of movement.  I am dealing with that at length so as to bring home, if I can, the importance of public co-operation in that regard. We are considering at the moment also what steps we could take to publicise the fact more clearly on the spot.  We were thinking in terms of holding a series of consultations along the frontier, if I may put it that way, to which we would bring all types of public officials from the Garda down, have these consultations at certain points and, if possible, I should like to attend them.  In fact, we are just thirsting for some effective means of putting over on the people of the clearance area the onus that is upon them, now especially, to stand in with us and co-operate with us fully.  If they do that, I do not think it should <Col N="1167" /> be very long at all until we would be able to make a very important pronouncement for the country and a very useful one for those people who would enjoy the benefits in the way of price advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister departs from that, what is the difficulty about stopping the ingress of untested cattle?  Is it not a fact that the boundary is the Shannon River?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a way in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a very resourceful man who would drive cattle all around the country to get in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a form of control there but one can never be <Col N="1168" /> sure that it is sufficient to guarantee 100 per cent. effectiveness.  We are, of course, thinking of the transport arrangements which must be made for the disposal of attested stock there when the area becomes attested.  These matters are at present being discussed with C.I.E. and, of course, the shipping companies also.  That matter is being attended to.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that he was not getting co-operation from the farmers in the west of Ireland.  As a farmer in the west of Ireland I fail to see how he can make that statement.  In County Galway all the farmers have submitted to the scheme.  Their stock has been tested again and again.  The Minister says that some of these farmers put out cattle that are reactors.  They would be fools if they did because they can get a better price by selling them to the Minister's Department without bringing them to the fairs.  The Minister is wrong in making that statement about reactors because it is illegal in the attested or nearly attested area to expose reactors for sale at all.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about the sale of reactor stock that arrives on a man's farm.  Of course, I know that it would not be wise for him&mdash;as an Ulster man or a Connaught man would know&mdash;to attempt to sell a reactor beast in a clearance area knowing that he would get substantially more for the beast from the Department. It was a disappointment to me, as it would be to any Minister&mdash; this is a human thing and we cannot <Col N="1169" /> complain too much&mdash;that on the price of store cattle falling, say from May onwards, it was really then that the pressure came on in the clearance area to take up small store cattle. There are many ways of killing a cat without choking him with butter. There are many ways in which co-operation can be given or withheld. I move about a little when I get half a chance and I see things.  I know that what I have been complaining of has happened to some extent, in some places more than in others, and I am merely showing the way in which farmers can co-operate, if they want to be co-operative.  I am showing the steps they can take in co-operation with us.  If they take those steps and throw themselves into this effort for a matter of a few months, if the farmers and the veterinary surgeons who are private practitioners in the area combine, we should perhaps be able to make a pleasant announcement in regard to that fairly large area before too long.</P>
      <P>The same applies to County Monaghan and County Cavan. Although these two counties are not as far advanced as they could be, the incidence there is very low.  We had a formidable problem up to the 1st January last in that these counties border the Six-County area and that free testing was going on on the Six-County side.  Their scheme is different from ours.  The British scheme was different from ours inasmuch as they did not buy reactors of any kind until a particular area was declared an eradication area.  It was so up to the 1st January last in four of the Six Counties nearest to the border.  The result was that the farmers were testing there.  There was no purchase scheme there either for cows or other stock and because of our agreement with the British they were being moved across into Cavan and Monaghan and being sold there every day of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in Belfast some time ago.  I was not looking for press men but they do make their appearance when you are not looking for them.  Not that I have any objection to them; I would be in dread of saying anything in that way in relation to them.  However, I was cornered by 10 or 12 press men <Col N="1170" /> and most of the questions they had to ask me were questions dealing with bovine T.B. I thought I got over all the hurdles, knowing my subject fairly well, as I think I do, but there was one gentleman who thought there was one tough hurdle to be met.  He asked: &ldquo;Perhaps you are making fairly good progress now but are you people not sorry that you did not take more serious notice of what was happening in Great Britain over the last 30 years?&rdquo; I was satisfied that question was directed towards me to put us in a spot.  Perhaps we were entitled to be put in that spot but I did not want to be driven into it without taking my neighbours with me.  Although in the course of all my public announcements I had never once mentioned the difficulties that the Six-County problem had been creating for us in the clearance area in Cavan, Monaghan and I suppose, Donegal, I felt that when I was being put in a spot by a press man in this way I was entitled to bring him in along with me.  I said: &ldquo;That may be so&rdquo; and went on to explain that if it was so in our case it was also so in theirs and that much of our problem up to the 1st January as far as these clearance counties were concerned was created by our inability to control the movement of reactor stock coming across from the Six Counties, being sold at our fairs or markets, being tested on our land, found to be reactors and paid for at generous rates such as those being provided under our scheme.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies mentioned last night that the fact we were not taking up reactors in all parts of the country was a great hindrance.  I think it was Deputy Corry who laid most emphasis on this.  As I have briefly explained, even in Great Britain and the Six Counties all testing done up to 50 or 60 per cent. in any county or shire was done on the basis of the farmer disposing of his reactor cow, reactor store heifer or store bullock any way he liked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should like to be able to take up all animals in every area.  Deputy Corry complained that we did not <Col N="1171" /> extend our clearance area scheme to the whole of the twenty-six counties and went on to declare there was no purpose in taking out cows if young stock were not also taken out.  He did not comment on the fact that in many cases notwithstanding the advantageous prices being offered for cows, no attempt is being made to remove these.  Many of the farmers have been doing very well in that regard but some of them have had their tests, know the results but have not taken any action.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the practicability of undertaking such a task in relation to the whole country, where is the point in complaining about the ill effects on some young stock from the point of view of the distribution of the disease if a plan is not made by the owner to rid himself of reactor cows, which are the major factor, as quickly as he can.  I realise it is a problem for some people.  Where the incidence is high it would be a great problem but if these people make plans which will ensure success over a fairly extended period, the hardship is minimised.  The veterinary surgeon who is the man chosen by themselves to test their stock will give them advice as to what these plans should be and as to how and when they should be executed.</P>
    <P>The major reason for inability to take the steps which are suggested should be applied not only to the clearance area but to the whole country is a practical difficulty, but a tremendous amount can be done outside the clearance area&mdash;the pasteurisation of milk and the planned removal of cow reactors.  I admit that in the major portion of the six counties in which the scheme came into operation on the 1st October of last year they are doing very well and making a very good effort.  Anything I have to say about them is to give them further encouragement in regard to the pasteurisation of milk.  If that work is properly supervised the effect it must surely have on the cows being reared there is the speedy and planned removal of all cow reactors.  It is bound to have a softening up effect upon the <Col N="1172" /> tremendous problem that the milk area of the south presents when it comes to the point that it too can be declared a clearance area.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt in my mind that the plan that is being followed is the right one because if it were possible for us to have in this year an accredited or attested area of seven counties with two more to be added in a very short space of time, the very fact that you had reached that stage in such a wide area would give tremendous encouragement to the other counties which would be taken on by degrees and from which you could build up against that other substantial area which was already free.  It is to encourage other areas to come along and bring their counties to the most finished stage possible that we are really enthusiastic about giving the finishing touches to the area that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I know it is not a matter on which there could possibly be any difference of opinion.  I knew that from the beginning, and the idea of any public man or any Deputy saying that at any time we had been foolish enough to try to sabotage this scheme because somebody did something before us, or somebody would do something after us, is the greatest nonsense.  I know that this fact is appreciated by everybody but while lip service is paid to that fact and words spoken to reiterate its truth something is dragged in to the effect that &ldquo;It is only a short time ago that you people over there were trying to sabotage it.&rdquo;  That is not true.</P>
    <P>There is no credit being sought by anybody.  We feel that having made the decision that this is the proper course of action for us to take, if we have decided as to the importance of the store cattle trade and decided that we must save it, then these are the steps which we all agree then the greatest If that is agreed then the greatest degree of co-operation and understanding that we have and the more people we can get to understand these facts, the greater the work that will be done.</P>

      <P>I did not understand what the Deputy was saying to me. It had no meaning the way it was put.  I have never given instructions to buyers to reduce prices.  I will say this, although I suppose it has not arisen half a dozen times, I do not believe that an instruction, or that any encouragement should be given to our valuers in the clearance area to be forced into outrageous prices by a few individuals simply because these individuals feel that they can just get what they like, what they ask and what they insist upon so as to be taken out of the way of preventing the clean sheet story to materialise.  I do not believe in that at all.  I believe in justice.  I believe in giving generous treatment in the way of prices to such people but I have told the officials of my Department&mdash;although it has not arisen recently&mdash;that where it was suspected that an attempt was being made to intimidate us along these <Col N="1174" /> lines that I have legal powers in such cases, powers that I would not want to use but powers that I would use.</P>

      <P>That is the only question as to price that arises but let me say that we have to keep an eye on these matters.  It is not right to say that a Minister can be entirely indifferent. I like to see, if it can be produced, a degree of uniformity in valuation.  I know that is hard to get. There are some very excellent young men who have not had much training but who have adapted themselves to their job in a most excellent way and I confess that the checks I have made, and I have made them, have gone to establish that the degree of uniformity as between the counties is surprising. There are some cases which I have come across where that sort of degree of uniformity does not appear to exist and if I find that the average loss for a cow is £15 in Kerry, Cavan or Donegal and £25 somewhere else I am going to ask myself how that has arisen.</P>
      <P>I have not attempted to do more than to follow up a policy of being generous and fair in every case and trying to produce the greatest degree of uniformity which every Deputy and every fair-minded person will admit is the course that should be followed. There were a lot of points raised on this Estimate which I thought would be given to me in about half an hour or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody mentioned the fact that we made the owner of the animal responsible for its safety until it is collected.  I do not know if we could possibly do any better than that.  We all know what can happen.  We know there are some instances where an animal is lost through no fault of the owner.  In that case it is a bit of a hardship, but if there is anything of a border-line nature, of course, we would not stand on ceremony, but we have to insist that the owner should be responsible for the animal until it is taken away.  We fully appreciate the hardship <Col N="1175" /> that could bring to many persons in a number of cases.</P>

      <P>I was told by Deputy Dillon that the way in which I could improve on this question of public relations between the Department and the farmers was to appoint more agricultural graduates on the basis of the parish plan.  If I am to be invited to cover that field on every question which arises while I am in the Department of Agriculture, whether on a supplementary estimate or the principal Estimate, I am quite prepared to repeat myself one thousand and one times, or two thousand and one times. I do not like repetition.  Deputy Dillon has a thorough-going flare for it.  That is his own business and his own technique and perhaps he is right, but I have no flare for it at all.  However, in this case as in other cases, I shall not refuse to meet that challenge, even though I was not fully prepared to deal with it.  I shall cover roughly the reasoning behind my approach to this matter.  In dealing with questions like this I suppose the decision rests with me, in consultation with my colleagues, but we have not the final word.  There is the far wider field of public opinion outside and we, as public men, whether as Ministers or as Deputies of the Opposition Party, must keep in mind, if we are wise, the workings of the public mind to whatever extent we understand it.</P>
      <P>Here is how I approach the parish plan.  Let me say again&mdash;and I shall say it in regard to another matter to which I shall refer later &mdash; that there are people who will try, and I suppose it could be regarded as good political tactics, to accuse their opponents of making a change for change's sake. Perhaps in a limited field of public opinion that is a good approach because one can steam up the enthusiasm of one's supporters and lead them to believe that the other fellow is making a change purely to get, if I may use the expression, a political wallop at his opponent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> I am not here to give myself a character because, even if I did give myself the best character in the world, it would be from myself and would be of no use, unless I did something to justify it.  I claim for myself that in any major question of public policy, as a Minister, the one thing I have always had regard to before making a change, is the fact that it may cause dislocation and sometimes hardship of grave disappointment to some people. The final commitments of a Government should not be repudiated by their successors and I would say not to the same extent, but to some extent, the serious acts of your predecessors should be kept very, very carefully, and very genuinely in mind, and the implications of the effects of making a change should be looked into.  I do not want anybody to believe me when I say that, but it is my mental approach to this matter I want to discuss now: the introduction of more agricultural graduates.</P>
    <P>This idea of a parish plan came along somewhere in Deputy Dillon's time.  I do not want to be in any way scathing about this, but I was told that it arose in a most frivolous way.  Somebody made the suggestion and it was quickly put into operation. I do not know if that is correct. Maybe that was not so.  Maybe it was thought about for years.  I do not know, I am only saying what I heard.  The plan was put into effect and it meant that we would have two advisory services and that either the Department of Agriculture would take over the whole structure of the county committees of agriculture, or that the county committees, of agriculture would operate an advisory service and the Department would run another advisory service alongside.</P>
    <P>I can say to Deputy Dillon and every other Deputy in the House, and I shall say it outside&mdash;I shall meet any group of farmers, or go before any body of people picked at random. and take their decision as to whether or not my reasoning is right&mdash;that I will not accept, in a small, poor country a scheme with two advisory services operating on the basis of the County Committee of Agriculture <Col N="1177" /> operating a service in Cavan, and another service being operated in the very same area by fully-fledged civil servants responsible only to the Department of Agriculture in Merrion Street, Dublin.  I will not accept that scheme because it does not make sense to me.  When I say it does not make sense I am not talking about the importance of agricultural research.</P>
    <P>Not only do I say that that has been, and is, and I am sure will continue to be, my mind on that matter, but if any Deputy wants to get proof of the impracticability and foolishness of having two schemes running alongside each other, even for a limited period, they can come over to my office for an hour and I shall show them a couple of files.  That does not mean that I am hostile to the idea of generating enthusiasm for more agricultural scientists.  I am not, but as I say, in relation to that matter, since one is not faulted for repetition in this House I shall say again I believe in increasing advisory services under the county committees of agriculture to the fullest possible extent that there is or is likely to be a demand for their training and knowledge amongst the people with whom they work.  I would warn those who have an unbalanced enthusiasm in this regard, just as in the case of over-propagandisation, as I said in the beginning of my speech when I referred to my hesitancy about warning farmers in relation to bovine tuberculosis, whether we should have more literature, whether we should have this, that or the other, that I would be afraid of the effect of applying too many technicians if there was not enough work for them.  Instead of being an asset, they would be regarded as a demoralising influence moving about and maybe not as active as they should be.</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to realise that I know something about the practical side of this question.  Let me repeat, and it can be reasoned out more closely at a later stage if there is any desire to discuss this matter here, that I had made up my mind and even before I came in here.  The decision <Col N="1178" /> was made by the Government, by my predecessor in our Government, in this matter.  That decision had my full approval.  The questions that arose with me were: Are we to maintain the system of advisory services controlled by the county committees of agriculture?  Are we to abolish the county committees of agriculture and take over all the employees of those bodies and have the advisory services controlled from Merrion Street because it would be foolish to allow the two systems to grow up, one alongside the other?  As regards decision on that matter to take over the county committees of agriculture, I certainly would not be one to approve of it but there would be some sense at least in bringing the whole of the advisory services under one control, whatever that control was to be.</P>
    <P>My predecessor decided, and I agree with the decision, that the control that was there was to remain.  That was the control of the advisory services of the county committees of agriculture.  Inside that framework, we will encourage the county committees to employ all the agricultural scientists and all the agricultural people they feel there is a demand for and whose services can beneficially be used in the respective areas.</P>
    <P>Another matter that was mentioned was the land project.  I thought I dealt fully with that matter, too.  Again, in this regard, let me say that&mdash;I am not protesting in any sense that I feel sensitive about the accusations&mdash;it is not true that I was anxious to sabotage Section B. of the Land Project.  I may tell this House that I never believed in it and not only can I make that statement but the records of this House prove that I did not believe in it.</P>
    <P>In this matter, it is not a question of being wise after the event.  My speech on the 1949 Act is in this volume here. While I say that, just as I pointed out in 1949, nobody could be a more enthusiastic believer in land reclamation than I am.  You dare not or you should not, anyhow, pretend to be interested in land whether as an individual farmer or as a Deputy or as a Minister for Agriculture unless <Col N="1179" /> you come from the county from which I come.  Land reclamation on a much more moderate and inexpensive form has been carried on here from 1934&mdash; I think Deputy Dr. Ryan's time.  It may be said that times were different. Money was scarce then.  We need not discuss these aspects now.  They can be discussed, if necessary.</P>

      <P>I am proud of them. Do not think I am passing over them because of any reluctance on my part. Times were different but land reclamation was then in operation and a tremendous lot of good work was done in a very simple way.  The Farm Improvements man came to you.  You showed him what you intended to do. His deputy came and examined it.  He gave you a simple specification.  In a short time, you got that sheet of paper from him.  He gave you an estimated cost of the work and he told you what you would get by way of grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>1934-35.  When the 1949 Act came before this House, my whole attitude was as follows: If you have money to spend, why not reconstruct the framework that is there? Pour more money into it.  Make the grants more attractive.  You have a staff of officials there.  They had not the big elaborate headquarters that they now have in every county but they were in every district and they had the inspectors and they did their work direct with headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going over this ground in order to convince anybody here because apparently you do not succeed in convincing people in this House. However, for the sake of the record, I should like to establish, because the records contain the truth, that what is charged against me in this record is not true.  I am definitely hostile to Section B. of the Land Reclamation Act but I was hostile to it the day it first came into this House.  If you follow me, it was not an unreasonable line of action that I took.  Not a word was spoken that I would not repeat and <Col N="1180" /> that I would not love to see blazoned over the countryside.  I have always taken the line not only in relation to land improvement but to other matters that the man who owns the land is the man who should love it, is that man who should try to improve it, is that man whom the State should help, if it can afford to help him, to improve it.</P>
    <P>After that, devise the machinery by which the State can help and decide the extent to which it will help.  Let the man put up his proposals; let these be examined.  Give him the signal to go ahead, and tell him the amount of money you are going to give him when he does his work.  That is my idea of land reclamation.  It was my idea in 1949 and it is my idea since then.  That is why I, with the full approval of my colleagues, abandoned section B of this scheme.  I can go further and say that the records of the estimates of the provision for this service for the last four or five years show that the people themselves were abandoning it.  While there was an increasing provision for a number of years, from 1949 to 1954 or 1955, for section B and a decreasing provision for Section A, since 1955 or 1956 the provision for section B started to decline while the provision for section A has been going up, proving, of course, that by a process of trial and error, even the people came to the conclusion that my reasoning on this matter was 100 per cent. right.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion in 1949 when Deputy Dillon was Minister he questioned me when I asked if he had this £40,000,000 to spend why spend it all on land reclamation; why not give a subsidy on phosphates?  He asked me: why not give it to them free?  A subsidy on phosphates, if these millions were available, did not seem to be such a nonsensical proposal. Not only do I venture to say now, but I am quite sure in saying, that if some of the money that was not too wisely spent under section B was spent instead on subsidising the application of superphosphate to the land we would have got, as a community, better results.</P>

      <P>Nonsense.  The question has been raised that this decision of ours was made without due regard to the fact that the previous Government had done certain things.  Policy can be changed.  That is the point. Surely a Minister and a Government have the right when they have a conviction about a matter to make a change.  I claim that right very energetically, but I would not abuse it. I have never abused it and I did not do so in this case because I gave those to whom we had contractual obligations assurances that any work that we were committed to would be completed. In fact, some of that work has not yet been completed.  During the discussion in 1949, I pleaded with the then Minister to insert a ceiling in the Bill beyond which the expenditure would not go.  I had in mind £40 or £45 at the very most.  I think it was about £40 I had in mind but Deputy Dillon in his wisdom or otherwise resisted that.  In resisting that, we arrived at the point where, as the Deputy himself admitted, certain cases had passed through which nobody could justify.  They were not &ldquo;certain cases&rdquo;; there were dozens of them, cases in which money was absolutely burned or drowned, because where the money was being spent it would not really burn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only that, but a crop of legal actions had arisen from the scheme in cases where when the work was completed and the owner of the land refused to sign the documents consolidating the £12 per acre with the outstanding portion of the advance for the purchase of his holding, or where he refused to sign on the grounds that the work was not properly executed.  The engineers were employed and the lawyers came on the job and my Department officials were running up and down to Laois and Kerry, appearing <Col N="1182" /> in courts all over the country.  You know the attitude of judges and justices in these cases&mdash;unless the Department of State has a water-tight case&mdash; in fact, sometimes when they appear to have a water-tight case &mdash; the decision is given against them.  Does anybody seriously contend that my conception of land improvement which is done on the basis that I have described with the farmer himself applying and of our having, as quickly as we can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, as quickly as we can.  Our officials cannot be on a man's doorstep immediately or within a matter of a couple of hours.  It might take three or four months.  A huge amount of arrears of work was piled up since 1949, applications that were never examined. I have a scheme in mind, and in fact in action, that will bring that state of affairs to an end.  The fact that I am looking for an additional £200,000 on the original Estimate, for the additional work done under Section A in the year that has passed is proof that I mean business on a practical basis and on lines that will be understood by the people of the country, who are not so simple.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1949 this grandiose scheme came along and we had the whole place full of county officers and this tremendous build up of staff.  Many of those civil servants are very excellent people, some of them men of fine intelligence and some of them tremendous workers, men for whom I have the greatest respect but I would not like to hand over to them and I am afraid that when the 1949 Act was passed and the decision made to establish the county officers there was a lot handed over to these gentlemen.  They built up their wonderful schemes, with all their planning and their mapping and they proceeded on the basis of encouraging those under the section B scheme to a completely unjustifiable extent, so much so that every time you <Col N="1184" /> drove past such a place where this work was being carried out you found about 25 State officers with their cars parked along the road, all inspecting the work.</P>

      <P>In 1949, 1950 and 1951 when you went past one of these places you found the cars parked along the roadside.  The scheme was prepared in the county office and the contract was let out by officials.  The farmer did not come into it until he had to sign the consolidating documents and he went about his business.  The boys were standing about watching the bulldozers, the machines and the pipes being thrown down in the cold earth.</P>
      <P>I know a bit about this country. I travelled it as much as anybody else and I could take you to a farm of land on which such an enormous expenditure was made and the people in whose name the work was carried out are now in all parts of the world, having sold out their property because it was property on which such sums of money should never have been spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know whether they did or not.  Let me say again that for any decision which is made by me as Minister for Agriculture or by the Government of which I am a member, will have to be justified by us.  If I was to exercise myself to the extent of reading the records of this House ten or eleven years ago when this Bill was going through you would find that my thoughts and my mind are in those records and I can and I will go before public opinion on them at any time.  That is the only way in which these matters can be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> Deputy Dillon will not accept the wisdom of my judgment on these matters but when he says that Governments should not make decisions which would bring hardship on people who invest money as a result of these decisions I hereby agree with him. Governments should not embark on schemes that are wildcat or grandiose but they should start in accordance with their means, in a simple way.  If the scheme is to be a success, and if there is more money then available increase the provision as you find yourself equal to the task of meeting the increase.  Just as it is a hard and chastening experience for a man who enjoys carrying substantial sums of money in his purse and finds that his money has disappeared so it is in the expenditure of public money.</P>
    <P>It is all right to shout about A and B schemes with all the hullabaloo about the expenditure of £40,000,000 but my approach to the matter would be to start in a small way, pay your way, see what the results are and if the results appear to be good then, as money becomes available, press more and more of it into the scheme.  If you do that you will not find people investing money and then finding that policy has changed.  I have not been listening to the discussion on the amendments to the licensing laws but I found myself, as a member of the Commission for some time, in great sympathy with those who complained that this house amended the law some years ago and encouraged people to expend money on improving their property in different parts of the country and that these people now find themselves adversely affected because the law is being changed again without warning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about this only as an indication of the unwisdom of taking action that will induce people to put money into a certain project development when there is some uncertainty or uneasiness about it which may result in a succeeding Government having to make a change. I have never failed to be conscious of <Col N="1186" /> that side of the problem.  Again, in these matters it is impossible to safeguard our people from hardship in the event of such change.  If we have to go over this argument every time an agricultural estimate is introduced I do not mind in the least.  I have more material to establish the wisdom of my point of view and I would be willing to cover this ground, or more, at any other time.  But I do not think it would be a very rewarding occupation in the long run.  We all have to present ourselves to a higher court and abide by their conclusions as to our capacity and judgment.</P>
      <P>Another matter was mentioned when I was asking for a sum of money to meet the losses incurred on the purchase of artificial fertilisers.  I can truthfully say that I did not know which year nor did I consider the price in 1951 as against 1952.  All I knew was that there had been a substantial loss.  I had not the slightest intention, even if the whole amount were attributable to the year in which Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, of making any comment upon it.  Indeed if I could have got the money without coming to the House, although that would not be reasonable, I would have been glad to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances that existed at the time the judgment of a man could have been at fault.  Many people can be tremendously wise after the event, but if you sit down with them to plan anything you find they have very little to contribute.  It has been said that this will be a lesson to us in the future, but I do not think it will.  It is possible to conceive a set of circumstances in which there may be only a limited time to get at a very high price something that is badly needed.  In that case I would be on the side of those who would take the risk of getting it. When mention, was made yesterday of the way in which this item was presented, I must say that aspect never occurred to me.  I do not expect members of the Opposition to give one credit for having a more specious mind than is sometimes suggested by them.  Maybe they feel it is desirable to put over something on the public, because the public cannot possibly <Col N="1187" /> have the contacts that would be helpful in the political sense.  Whatever the objective, I do not fully understand it.  The decisions taken by two Ministers of two different Parties, whatever the losses were in one year as against another, were based on the same reasoning.  I had no intention in the world of presenting this in a way that would either do credit to one decision or discredit another.  I would be prepared in the most deliberate way to defend both decisions whatever the outcome may have been.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a supplementary sum not exceeding £195,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, and Miscellaneous Grants.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sum voted for these grants for the year 1959/60 was £1,700,000.  Of this sum, £1,690,328 had been expended at the 29th February, 1960 (allowing for credits by way of refunds etc.) leaving a balance of £9,672 to meet commitments arising before the end of the financial year.  When this sum is added to the amount of the Supplementary Estimate it will be seen that actual requirements for the remainder of the year are now estimated to exceed £200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deficiency arising in the year is due almost entirely to the greatly increased activities in new house building which developed within the last eleven months.  On the basis of our experience of the trend of new house grant allocations in the year 1958/59, it was estimated last year that 3,000 allocations of new house grants would be made for the year 1959/60.  In fact, new house grant allocations in the period from 1st April, 1959 to the 29th February, 1960, amounted to 3,472, <Col N="1188" /> representing an estimated figure of 3,800, approximately, for the full financial year.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increased in allocations it also became evident that the payments for new house grants were tending to mature more quickly during recent months.  In fact, the amount of payments on all grants maturing during the month of February was by far the highest February total in any year and one of the highest monthly totals ever.  This is the direct result of the increased building activity in both new houses and reconstruction which was stimulated by the Act of 1958 and by a general improvement in the economic conditions encouraging that activity.  The more rapid maturing of payments of grants was also stimulated by the very favourable weather conditions obtaining during the summer and autumn.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that I welcome this distinctly encouraging evidence of a further growth in the tempo of housing and that I have the utmost satisfaction in coming to this House to ask that the necessary additional funds be provided in advance of the provision which will be available on foot of the Vote on Account as from 1st April next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister to-day has again repeated in slightly more moderate language the dishonest implication to which he committed himself yesterday in extreme language.  I want to characterise that implication yesterday and to-day as being a disgrace to the high office he holds.  The Minister yesterday brought to this House certain selected information. He selected it quite deliberately and put it accross to attempt to show that the present housing activity, whatever it may be, was higher than the housing activity that operated during the régime of the Government that preceded his.  The House will remember that yesterday, in relation to this matter, he was asked to produce certain figures for the year ending 31st March, 1957.  He said he had not got them with him.  I shall oblige him by giving these figures for these Estimates today.  Another member of the Fianna <Col N="1189" /> Fáil Party&mdash;the member whose function apparently it is to throw dirt on every possible occasion, Deputy O'Malley&mdash;then proceeded to say there had been a Supplementary Estimate for £2 million in 1957, which Deputy Smith, as Minister for Local Government, brought in for the purpose of paying arrears of housing grants.  That again is a complete falsehood and if any Deputy is interested there are the Appropriation Accounts, the Supplementary Estimates that were brought in, and there was no Supplementary Estimate introduced in the period from the 20th February, when Fianna Fáil came into power, and the 31st March, 1957.</P>
      <P>What are the facts in relation to housing, the facts which the Minister is deliberately trying to conceal by taking figures for certain months, figures which have been increased because of the fact that during the earlier part of the year grants were not paid?  I am sure the Minister is telling the truth when he shows favourable grant figures for one month such as these.  I do not challenge that at all but the fact is that during this current financial year there are fewer houses to be built.  There is less money being paid by the Minister under this sub-heading than was paid in either of the two years for which we were responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the records.  First of all remember that the figures were announced in the Book of Estimates each year.  In the year ending 31st March, 1955, when we were responsible, the allocation then given, as set out in the Book of Estimates for this type of housing grant, was £2,000,000.  For the year ending 31st March, 1956, the amount set out in the Book of Estimates was £2,250,000 and an additional Supplementary Estimate was taken in that year for £50,000.  For the year ending 31st March, 1957, the period for which I asked the Minister for figures yesterday, the amount provided in the Book of Estimates was £2,250,000.  Then Fianna Fáil came in and in the year ending 31st March, 1958, the sum was £2,000,000.  In the year ending 31st March, 1959, for which Fianna Fáil must take the full <Col N="1190" /> responsibility as the Book of Estimates was entirely prepared by them the figure was £1,300,000 compared with the previous sum of £2,250,000.  In the year ending 31st March, 1960, the current year, the amount provided was £1,700,000 and the Minister is now providing a further £200,000 to make a total of £1,900,000.  In the new Book of Estimates, published this morning for the next financial year, what do we find?  We find the provision is less than the provision that was made in either of the years ending 31st March, 1956, and 31st March, 1957.</P>
    <P>If we want to pass from the Estimates to the actual amounts paid, let us take the figures in the Appropriation Accounts of the moneys actually spent. In 1954/55 £1,995,000 was spent, in 1955/56 £2,247,000 and in 1956/57 £2,167,000.  Then Fianna Fáil came in and in 1957/58 it was £1,526,000. That figure actually differs slightly&mdash; it is £20,000 more than the figure the Minister gave yesterday&mdash;but I am giving the larger of the two figures so that he cannot have any complaint. Apparently there may have been some adjustment at a later stage.  In 1958/59 £1,329,000 was spent.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of houses that were built the information is to be got from the Statistical Abstract for 1959, at page 190, and what do we find there?  We find that in each year ending 31st March, the financial year, the figures were as follows: In 1955 10,490 new houses were built with State aid; in 1956, 9,837; in 1957, 10,969, and the Minister cannot suggest that any single one of these houses built in those years was in any way the result of anything he, or his Fianna Fáil predecessor in office, might have done.  Then Fianna Fáil came back to power and in 1958, 7,480 houses were built, and in 1959, 4,893&mdash;fewer than half of those that were built in the year for which I asked him for the figures yesterday.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to take the figure of new houses that were built other than by local authorities, he will find exactly the same thing.  In 1955, in rural areas, the figure was 3,522; in 1956 it was 3,587; in 1957 it was <Col N="1191" /> 4,066 and in 1958, after Fianna Fáil came in&mdash;and I might add that these are privately built houses, not local authority houses&mdash;the figure went down to 2,473 and in 1959 it went down to 1,651, fewer than half the figure when we were in office, yet the Minister had the audacity and effrontery to come into this House and try to suggest that he has stimulated a wonderful new housing drive.</P>
    <P>If we want to go from new houses to reconstructed houses we can look for the same figures and we shall find, on the same page of the Statistical Abstract, that the number reconstructed in 1957 was 8,147 and in the last year for which I have the figures it had dropped to 6,909.  As I said already, the evidence of what he anticipates the situation is going to be is in the Book of Estimates that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, issued this morning.  The amount provided in that Book of Estimates is less than the provision and the amount that was paid in either of the last two financial years for which I was responsible.</P>
    <P>As I said, Deputy O'Malley apparently had been trained by his colleague, Deputy Smith, to try to put over in this House what are not the facts.  I am not accusing Deputy O'Malley of doing it deliberately.  No doubt he has been misled but he suggested yesterday that in 1957 Deputy Smith, as Minister for Local Government, had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for £2,000,000 to pay housing grants that had not been paid. Here is the bound volume of the Estimates, Financial Accounts, Supplementary Estimates and Appropriation Accounts and there was no Supplementary Estimate whatever of that sort introduced by Fianna Fáil in respect of these housing grants.  In fact there was no necessity for one because, as I told the House a minute ago, the provision was £2,250,000 and the payments in that year were £2,167,477.</P>
    <P>It is not as if all these things were new and that the Minister could make the excuse that he was caught yesterday without information on something <Col N="1192" /> of which he had no previous knowledge. Housing questions have been put down by me to the Minister which he has answered.  Let me refer to one of them.  On 11th February, 1960, &mdash;col. 337, Vol. 179&mdash;I asked in relation, for example, to Dublin Corporation, what was the amount expended by means of advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  It is the person who builds with help under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts who requires grants of the type we are discussing this morning.</P>
    <P>In 1956, when certain members of Fianna Fáil, notably Deputy Briscoe, were screaming here about the allocation being made, £1,536,000 was available and spent by Dublin Corporation on small dwellings loans for this type of house; in 1957, £936,000; but, in 1958, under Fianna Fáil, that had dropped to £533,000 and again, in 1959, though it had recovered somewhat, it had not recovered to the previous level and was only £711,000. Similar questions appear in relation to Cork and to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister, therefore, could not possibly have been in ignorance when he was deliberately selecting his figures yesterday.  He was doing it in an endeavour to put over a politically dishonest trick.  What has happened not is, and thank goodness it has happened, that some of the leeway that was lost by Fianna Fáil, and deliberately lost by Fianna Fáil, in relation to housing, is now being made up and the Minister is counting that as a great advance.  When he gets back to the situation that there was in those two years, when he gets back to the figures of which I have spoken, figures that are on the records, figures that tell their own story, figures that show that the number of houses built with this type of grant under Fianna Fáil dropped from 9,800 to 4,800 in three years, and when he is able to make up that backlog and is in a position to tell the House truthfully and honestly that that backlog has been caught up and that he has reached the figures that were obtained before, it will be time enough for him to boast.</P>
    <P>Meantime, let him keep to the truth <Col N="1193" /> and not try to paint a picture as untruthful and as politically dishonest as he endeavoured to paint yesterday and as he tried this morning to paint slightly differently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat what Deputy Sweetman has just said but there are a few salient points which I should refer to.  Estimates sometimes are misleading. There are in Estimates commitments which sometimes never materialise and I would prefer to take figures, as Deputy Sweetman has done, of the actual expenditure over the past years and the actual number of houses built or reconstructed.  Deputy Sweetman quoted the figures from 1956 or 1957. I should like to go slightly further back, to the days of the first inter-Party Government, the days of the last Fianna Fáil Government, the days of the second inter-Party Government, right down to the present time and to give the figures of the actual number of new houses built in the State.  In the year ended 31st March, 1952, the number was 12,644; year ended 31st March, 1953, 14,060; year ended 31st March, 1954, 11,179; 1955, 10,490; 1956, 9,837.  In the last year of office of the inter-Party Government the number of new houses erected was 10,969.  Then we had the first year of Fianna Fáil and the present Government, and the figure fell from 10,969 to 7,480 and in the year ended 31st March, 1959, it again fell to 4,893, to more than 50 per cent. less than the number of houses built by the inter-Party Government during their last year of office.</P>
      <P>The Minister has boosted reconstruction. I heartily endorse everything he says about reconstruction. More attention should be paid to it. On the occasion that the Minister mentioned that matter in his Estimate, Deputy Corry informed the House that, in opening a housing scheme in Bandon in 1955, I advocated the reconstruction of houses and said that more attention should be given to it, not only by individuals but by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to quote the figures for reconstruction of houses from 1952. In the year ended 31st March, 1952, <Col N="1194" /> the number of houses reconstructed was 2,292; year ended March, 1953, 2,573; year ended March, 1954, 4,224; 1955, 4,889&mdash;that is the year in which I appealed to individuals to apply for reconstruction grants.  As a result, in the year ended 31st March, 1956, the number was 6,494; and, in the last year in which we were in office, the year ended 31st March, 1957, the number was 8,147.  In other words, the number of houses being reconstructed had gone up by approximately 75 per cent. from 1952.  Then we had the first year of Fianna Fáil and in March, 1958 the number had fallen from 8,147 by 1,000, to 7,162.  In the year ended 31st March, 1959 it fell to 6,909.  In other words, the peak year was our last year of office and now the number has gradually tapered off again.</P>
    <P>When considering the money spent on the building of new houses or the reconstruction of houses, ignore Estimates and commitments and consider the actual money paid out, which is much more factual than commitments. For the year ended 31st March, 1955, actual money paid out was £1,995,000; year ended 31st March, 1956, £2,247,500 and then, in our last year in office, £2,167,000.  Then in the first year of Fianna Fáil it fell to £1,527,000 and last year to £1,330,000, in other words, last year there was £600,000 less spent on houses than there was in 1955.  These are actual figures which may be obtained from the Appropriation Accounts and which are vouched and certified.  These are the figures on which we must go.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very wrong in his policy in abolishing what is known as appointed officers.  In the country there were appointed officers, local architects or engineers, who did the preliminary examination on all projects for the building of new houses or the reconstruction of houses and a sum of two guineas was paid in respect of each applicant or each house.  These men were living in the locality.  They knew the type of houses the applicant was going to build, with the result that, once an application came in, sanction was forthcoming because these men would often prepare the plans themselves; they were there on the spot <Col N="1195" /> and were able to give sanction to applicants.</P>
    <P>The Minister abolished these appointed officers and appointed his own inspectors to do their duty, at the same cost, but the two guineas is now collected by the Department.  We now find that these officers have so much work to do that there is a delay in getting around to the various applicants and getting sanction for building. This current year these men have substantial arrears and they are anxious to sanction as many grants as possible for new houses or for reconstruction before the end of the financial year.  We find this backlog to which the Minister referred, the number of housing grants being sanctioned during the month of February and an endeavour being made by these civil servants to keep up with this backlog which has accumulated over the past 12 months.  They are anxious to get these grants out before the beginning of the financial year and the Minister has to come in with this estimated commitment of approximately £195,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed the House on his Estimate last year that he proposed increasing grants for private water supply and sanitary services.  Have Deputies had the experience of endeavouring to get this grant for their constituents?  Have they found delay, first of all, in the sanction of grants and then the delay in payment?  It is payments we must base our figures on, not on allocations.  When the Minister is able to give us facts on payments, then and then only will his boast be accepted that he is doing more than his predecessors in the housing of this State.</P>

      <P>After the last general election there was a photograph of the former Taoiseach in the newspapers surrounded by British journalists.  They asked him what he intended to do to relieve unemployment. The then Head of the Government replied that he would extend housing.  The scathing indictment we have heard from Deputy Sweetman, with incontrovertible facts and figures he produced to prove this Government <Col N="1196" /> has cut down on reconstruction and the building of houses, has not been replied to by any Fianna Fáil Deputies, although there are quite a few of them in the House at the moment.  The reason it has not been replied to is that the facts Deputy Sweetman has produced are true as every Deputy knows.</P>
      <P>I personally have had nothing but the greatest courtesy from the officials in the Custom House in relation to housing.  However, every time I come to Dublin I have to go to the Custom House looking for three or four grants which are unpaid.  That is not only my experience but that of every other Deputy.  It is a known fact that there is a go-slow on the housing programme and on the payment of grants and that no one has any chance of getting a grant unless he goes to his elected representative and asks him to go to the Custom House to look the matter up.  I am not making any charge against the officials in this respect.  It is a deliberate act on the part of this Government or the Minister for Local Government.  I presume it is a Government decision.</P>
      <P>This morning I was in touch with the Department of Local Government with reference to a grant for a constituent of mine.  The work was completed six weeks ago.  It was inspected months ago and he did not receive the preliminary grant, the first half, to which he was entitled.  I was told by the official that he was telling me only what he was directed to tell me, that he could not say when the first half would be paid.  We were told yesterday in the House that when the Supplementary Estimate was passed all the grants were to be paid.  That may be so and it may not, but I want to support what Deputy Sweetman and Deputy O'Donnell have said, that there is a definite whittling down of housing grants and the money generally supplied for them.  The fact that no Deputy has risen from the other side to try to controvert these incontestable facts makes it more conclusive that what the two members of the Front Bench Opposition have said is true, and there is no argument the Minister can produce that can satisfy us that such is not the case.</P>

Houses can be built and workers can be put back immediately but we have to build up our population again.  The Corporation is now concentrating on the clearance of slums in the centre of the city.  The cost of construction is a little more expensive and unfortunately the labour content is less.  Many Deputies, and some former Ministers, have a cheek to come in here and say &ldquo;It is your responsibility because you took office when this was taking place.&rdquo;  If it had not been taking place, we might not have got into office.</P>

      <P>It is very diffcult to know whether the Minister for Local Government or Deputy Lemass would get first prize in this House as the greatest bluffer.  Any Deputy who has the courage to get up to make a speech such as Deputy Lemass has made should be entitled to a prize of some kind or other.  It takes an extraordinary hard neck to be sufficiently brazen to make the type of speech that we have heard from Deputy Lemass.</P>
      <P>Everybody realises, particularly those having close contact with the people, that today there is less being spent on housing than there was when the inter-Party Government were in office and Deputy O'Donnell was the Minister for Local Government.  There is no use trying to paint a rosy picture if you have not got a good sound canvas on which to paint it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, <Col N="1200" /> or any of the Deputies behind him, may quote figures until the cows come home but figures are no consolation to the unfortunate person in the country who cannot be paid for work done.  The fact of saying that we are participating in a great housing drive and that you have the money to pay out is no consolation to the unfortunate people who have carried out reconstruction work which was approved and passed and the work completed satisfactorily.  They cannot get one penny piece from the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Those are the people in whom we are interested, the people who, we want to make sure, are not misled by an Act which the Minister for Local Government is putting into effect, and that is to turn housing grants completely and entirely into a political matter.  I want to put it to Deputies that the aim behind the hold-up of reconstruction grants and grants for new houses is to try to build up a political movement in each area.  A state of affairs is being created that an applicant who cannot be paid his grant will be forced to go and see the local Fianna Fáil Deputy and, when he does that, the claim will be paid forthwith.</P>
    <P>I feel this is a matter in which the Minister for Local Government himself must take the responsibility for trying to make politics and trying to boost the low standing of Fianna Fáil Deputies, the very low standing which they have in every constituency throughout the country.  The only way he can do that is to try deliberately to create difficulties in various constituencies so that it will be a means of bringing the local Deputy to him with representations about which he may be able to do something to remedy the position in particular cases.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the present Government have any housing policy at all or what is their policy on housing?  It is amusing to hear Deputy Lemass state, as he did a few minutes ago, that a few years ago there was such an extraordinary flight from the land and from our large towns and cities that there were not sufficient tenants to occupy the houses.  The position now <Col N="1201" /> is that many a man then engaged in the construction business is at present out of business.  There were many contractors, particularly in rural Ireland, who were engaged in the reconstruction and erection of houses who have gone out of business completely. There are contractors who have erected houses this year and are forced to the pin of their collar to stay in business because of the failure of the Department of Local Government to pay the grant to the architects.</P>
    <P>Surely some consideration must be given to the traders who supply timber, paints, glass and cement and who have all the materials ready?  Those traders are not in the position they were in years ago when they could get substantial credit.  In most cases now, it is cash down for what you want; the time when substantial discount was allowed is also gone.  To my own knowledge traders in the midlands are putting pressure on people who obtained materials from them for the erection of new houses and for the important work of reconstructing houses.  Everybody in this House knows quite well from his own experience that the whole position of housing has not alone been slowed up but has been brought virtually to a standstill by the present Government.</P>
    <P>We know that this Estimate deals entirely with grants for new houses and with reconstruction grants but on the main Estimate this House will be in a position to give the Minister for Local Government information to prove that proposals from local authorities for housing schemes have been deliberately held up and faults found in the plans so that sanction will not be given to proceed with the houses.</P>
    <P>I respectfully say that it is the deliberate policy of the Minister for Local Government to slow up housing and to stop housing.  The importance of reconstruction was stressed by Deputy O'Donnell when he was Minister for Local Government and every Deputy must place the greatest importance on the reconstruction of old houses.  Very many old houses throughout the country are occupied <Col N="1202" /> by people not in a position to erect new houses.  In view of the large number of requests from people who have applied for reconstruction grants and whose applications are now under consideration, I feel it should be the duty of the Government to reconsider their entire housing policy in so far as reconstruction grants are concerned. In respect of grants for new houses, I think it was most unfortunate and unreasonable of the Minister for Local Government to dispense with the services of the appointed officers because, as has been clearly pointed out, the appointed officer in a particular area knew the conditions and the circumstances of the countryside, and was in a position to give his approval there and then.  He had all the facts concerning the applicant before him. When the appointed officers were there, approval could be given with the least possible delay.  Now the position is that since the Minister's Department has undertaken this work &mdash;the cost is the same; it is still £2 2s. &mdash;there is unreasonable delay and there is such a volume of work to be done by these men that it is impossible for them to cope with it.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Esmonde, I have had occasion, not to call at the Custom House, but to make very frequent representations to the Department of Local Government and I was always treated with the greatest possible courtesy, but no matter what courtesy is extended by the Minister or his Department, if he has given instructions for the non-payment of the grants, they cannot be paid.  I am not prepared, for one moment, to say that the Minister has not given these instructions.  The payment of grants has been held up; grants have not been forthcoming and considerable anxiety overshadows most of those people who have been expecting their money for months past.  The only conclusion we can come to is the conclusion that has been stressed.  I am sure, by Deputies here this morning. There is a slowing down in the payment of these grants and the Minister and the Government would prefer that people did not avail of these schemes.</P>
    <P>I should not be surprised if within <Col N="1203" /> the next year or two or three, if the Government should remain in office so long, steps will be taken drastically to curtail reconstruction grants.  I am quite satisfied that it is being made more difficult every day to qualify for those grants.  The only hope people who are anxious to avail of the reconstruction grant scheme have is to assist in bringing about a change of Government in order that the Government may be replaced by a Government with a more active and efficient housing policy.  The time has come when the present housing policy has proved to be unsuccessful and unsatisfactory, and most unsatisfactory so far as the reconstruction of houses throughout the State is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared for one moment to accept the statement of the Minister because the figures given this morning by Deputy Sweetman, and echoed by Deputy O'Donnell, speak for themselves. No matter what figures the Minister presents to the House, or what kind of case he may try to make to bolster up his argument, the facts are that the people have not been getting the grants.  If the Minister carries on as he has carried on for the past 12 months in regard to housing grants, it will be most unfortunate for the people who have been expecting payments and grants and for those who have been expecting State assistance for the construction of new houses and the reconstruction of old houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing which is evident from the Supplementary Estimate before us is that there must have been an impetus in building of all kinds during the past year by reason of the fact that the Estimate has been exceeded and a substantial Supplementary Estimate has been found necessary to complete the work now in hand.  I have had experience of building in the municipalities and the rural areas and I can say that members of all Parties have always co-operated in what was called the housing drive.  I am glad to say that the contention which has arisen here today on the Supplementary Estimate and which would be more appropriate <Col N="1204" /> to the main Estimate, has never arisen locally.</P>
      <P>I was Lord Mayor of Cork and in that city various surveys were made. The medical officer was asked to present figures as to his conception of the needs for houses in that area.  That programme has been going on for years under the various Governments and the need for houses is now tapering off.  We all know that the needs of various urban areas have been satisfied in recent years.  That is generally admitted.  The time has now arrived for a new survey of some of the districts owing to the fact that new industries have come our way and have been established in various places.  In consequence, the need for more houses is now an urgent matter. Surveys are being carried out and I believe the figures will be a tribute to the success of various Governments in their housing drive over past years by reason of work well done.</P>
      <P>No doubt, there are problems to be met.  I agree with some of the criticism.  As a matter of fact, on the question of the appointed officers, it has come to my knowledge that at times the officer was sent down to compute figures in areas where trade union conditions prevailed.  People have come to me, and, I feel sure, to other Deputies, saying they cannot possibly reconstruct houses on the approved estimates presented to them, whereas the local officer knew the local conditions and consequently when figures were being made out, they were made out on such a scale as to be in conformity with experience and working conditions.</P>

      <P>I hope that anything I say in a public assembly is true, but I would not have said that if the matter had not come to my personal knowledge.  There have been delays in schemes because these figures have to be sent back for review and in some cases, the people concerned do not go ahead with the building by reason of those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, at the present time, fewer people building houses for themselves. <Col N="1205" /> We had sites in Cork city and, as the Minister knows, he had to give permission to the Corporation to build on those sites under the ordinary municipal schemes.  Special permission was given.  The causes of these trends are various.  In some cases, it is a change in the value of money.  In certain years, money could be got perhaps at 4 or 4½ per cent. interest.  Now the rate is higher and the policy of the various Governments was directed, to the best of their ability, sometimes to what the people were able to pay but also to the rising value of loans and the costs of building deterred people from taking these responsibilities and obligations on themselves.  The thing for us to do is to appoint assessors so that money outstanding or for works on hand may be promptly paid.</P>
    <P>The programme of the Government and of the local authorities could be discussed more appropriately on the main Estimate.  It is no argument for any Government to show figures about housing because they fluctuate for various reasons, irrespective of the goodwill and the policy of the Government.</P>

      <P>I think this Estimate would have gone through very quickly if the Minister had been&mdash;I shall not say &ldquo;more careful&rdquo;&mdash; a little more courteous in his answers about housing to various Deputies from this side of the House for some time past.  Shortly after Deputy Blaney became Minister for Local Government, he sent a circular to local authorities and to the members of local authorities.  I am on record in the Waterford papers as welcoming the Minister's circular and calling on the people of Waterford to avail of it.  We do not try to blow down the Custom House or to blow down the Minister for Local Government, no matter who he is.  I am very grateful to a former Lord Mayor of Cork, Deputy MacCarthy, for giving the reflection of the manner in which local authorities go about their business, as far as housing schemes are concerned.  I respectfully suggest that if the Minister were to follow that line in dealing with the members of this House, we might make more progress.</P>

      <P>I find it hard to know where I am as to the numbers of the houses.  I can quote the figures that are here.  On the 11th February, 1960, in a reply by the Minister to Deputy Sweetman, as reported at Column 337 of the Official Report, the number of houses completed in 1956 was 4,218.  In 1957, the number was 4,123; in 1958, the number was 2,033; and in 1959 the number was 2,399.  I should like to know if they are all new houses.  I want the Minister to make a note of that and to let me know if they are all new houses, because, on 10th February, in reply to a question by Deputy O'Malley, the Minister provided a tabular statement. Deputy O'Malley asked the Minister if he will state (a) the estimated housing requirements of each housing authority at the latest available date, (b) the number of houses under construction by each local authority, and (c) the number for which tenders are being sought.  In reply, the Minister gave figures for each county and each county borough in respect of the number of houses under construction.  It showed that on 31st December, 1959, the number of houses under construction in the borough of Waterford was 25.</P>

      <P>Columns 69 to 72, Volume 179 of the Official Report of 10th February, 1960.  That reply was intriguing to me because I am a member of Waterford Corporation and as far as I knew, we were not building any houses in Waterford.  I put down a question to the Minister for answer on 24th February.  It is recorded at Column 720 of Volume 179.  I asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state the number of houses (1) at present being constructed by the Waterford Corporation, and (2) under construction on 31st December, 1959. The Minister replied; &ldquo;Twenty-five unfit houses which were acquired by Waterford Corporation are being reconditioned at present, and work on these houses was in progress on 31st December, 1959.  As the effect of this work is to provide fit units of housing accommodation, the dwellings are recorded for statistical purposes as houses under construction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to know if the tabular statement as supplied and put on the records of this House in answer to Deputy O'Malley's question is to be taken as meaning that the number of houses under construction includes the number of houses under construction and the number of houses under reconstruction in each county and county borough.  If that is so, I would say that the reply is misleading.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister on that date, as reported at column 721, Volume 179: &ldquo;Is the Minister aware that there are people living in these houses?  If there are people living in these houses, how can they be available for applicants when they apply for houses?&rdquo;  The Minister said: &ldquo;The only answer I can find to this riddle is that they are occupied at the moment and they are occupied as unfit houses; the result of reconstruction will be that they will then be occupied as fit dwellings.&rdquo; The people never left these houses at all.  By putting these two classes of figures together, the figure given by the Minister for Waterford county borough is misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> The Minister was annoyed yesterday when a Deputy stated there was delay in paying housing grants.  He pointed out what happened in 1956. That is no good to us.  We are here in 1960.  There are many builders' suppliers in the country.  We are indebted to them.  They have practically been financing the schemes, as far as I know.  They give the materials to the builders in these cases.  There is small builders in these cases.  There is great delay in the issue of grants.  I would say that the great majority of people doing this work would not have the money themselves and they are dependent on the grant to pay the contractor.</P>
    <P>I hope this Estimate will go through today and that the matter of the payments will be speeded up.  It will be welcome news to contractors and to people who own these houses.  It is not right to come into this House and to say that the business is going well under this Government.  It is not.  As far as my constituency is concerned, I could say that 65 per cent. of the tradesmen have emigrated.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that Deputy Lemass would withdraw his statement which was untrue and without foundation. It is the kind of statement that undermines the credit of the country, the kind of statement that will not come from this side of the House.  When we are in Opposition, we shall not make statements that will cry down the credit of the Department of Finance or the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he could send me the figures I request. Would it be necessary for me actually to put down a Parliamentary Question? It would save trouble if he would send me the figures in regard to Mr. O'Malley's questions of February 10th and if he would show in the answers he gave how many of these houses were new houses in the course of reconstruction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It comes very strangely to hear members of the Fine Gael Party criticising the Government for delay in paying housing grants.  I think one of the main factors in <Col N="1209" /> defeating the previous Government was the appalling plight in which the building industry found itself as a result of that Government's mismanagement. In December, 1956, as we know, a motion was put down by Deputy Smith, who moved it on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, criticising the Government's action.  That carried very great weight with other members supporting the Coalition at that time.</P>
      <P>The criticism made now evidently is that there are delays in the payment of grants.  Some of the Opposition speakers are evidently not very conversant with the position, at least not sufficiently to differentiate between new houses and old houses.  In regard to the payment of new housing grants, there is not, nor could there be, any unreasonable delay.  I have not come across any delay in the Department of Local Government in the issue of a grant for a completed new house. There may be cases where, due to defective workmanship, the amount of the Government grant might be cut by £2 or £3.  That might entail a certain amount of correspondence between the Department and the applicant, but if the applicant replies promptly to the queries, I cannot see where the undue delay would arise.</P>
      <P>In regard to reconstruction grants, I can see delays arising.  In the first place, possibly the applicant, perhaps through no fault of his own, is mainly to blame.  If I might make a criticism of the Department of Local Government, the forms issued for reconstruction grants are not sufficiently comprehensive. There are only 7 or 8 different headings to be completed, so many square yards of plaster and so many linear feet of timber and so on. I think there should be space on that form for a more detailed résumû of the work to be done.  The applicant, unless he employs an architect or an engineer or building contractor is not competent to price the work and it is there, initially, that these delays arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not come across any cases of undue hardship due to a hold-up in the payment of grants.  If that happens in certain constituencies, it certainly <Col N="1210" /> does not apply in the Limerick area. I understand also in regard to the questions that were asked here yesterday that criticism was made by Deputy Sweetman of my intervention in the heat of the moment.  There were, of course, very substantial commitments left to the Government when the Coalition departed in March, 1957&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Since assuming office I have recommended the issue of £1,340,000 to liquidate the obligations of local authorities outside the cities of Dublin and Cork, to banks, to contractors and to persons awaiting payment of approved grants and advances for private housing.</P>

      <P>I have already given it but I shall give it again.  It is Vol. 161, column 896.  I should like <Col N="1212" /> to remind Deputy Sweetman when he spoke of issues from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities that he was quite wrong in suggesting it has nothing to do with private housing.</P>
      <P>He must be aware that quite a substantial sum of money is paid from the Local Loans Fund to enable the local authorities to issue loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts. He must also be aware that a substantial amount is issued from the Local Loans Fund to enable the local authorities to pay supplementary grants.  The amount that Deputy Smith, the then Minister, had to pay to meet the Coalition's liabilities was £1,340,000.  He went on to say:</P>
      <P>The position in this regard is that the local authorities may now apply in the normal course for installments of approved loans to meet the firm commitments already entered into by them, according as these commitments become due to be discharged.</P>
      <P>As regards new works it will be necessary to control the time of their commencement so that approvals to essential proposals now in hands and others accruing in the course of the year can be undertaken in progressive stages.  I have already approved the undertaking of new works to the value of £300,000.</P>

    <P>The outstanding liabilities of the Road Fund at 31st March, 1957, in respect of road maintenance and improved grants and other liabilities amounted to £4,212,000.  These liabilities were left at that unduly high figure on the date in question <Col N="1213" /> owing to the abnormally low proportion of the grants which had been paid in respect of the allocations for the preceding financial years.</P>

I cited one example where we had a scheme in Limerick costing £330,000 and stated that we could not get the sanction of the Minister.  The only satisfaction I could get was that on the 29th November, the Minister for Finance, then Deputy Sweetman, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Proposals in relation to Limerick Corporation for loans from the Local Loans Fund amounting to £410,200 under the housing of the Working Classes Act and £26,500 under the Sanitary Services Acts are at present before me and are being examined Departmentally.

There is no Deputy in this House who can suggest that for reasons of lack of finance a housing scheme is being held up.  That cannot be suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the former Lord Mayor of Cork say that housing in Cork was held up because of lack of finance but I now challenge anyone to say that a housing scheme is being held up anywhere in this country today for lack of finance.  I defy anyone to say that supplementary grants or Government housing grants are being held up for lack of finance; I defy anyone to give me an instance of a person being refused a loan under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts due to lack of finance.  The position is that money is available today.</P>
      <P>In the time of the Coalition our objection was that local authorities and private individuals were being misled and that the money was not there.  The suggestion was that people should go to the insurance companies and to the bank but there was a limitation on the amount that could be obtained according to the income of the buyer.  The first preference was to be given to the lower income groups. But when that group went to the local authorities the loans were denied on the grounds that they would be unable to meet them.</P>

    <P>I have given an undertaking to this House, and I now repeat it, <Col N="1217" /> that any applicant of modest means who requires a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts will get it from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>Then we had a dissertation as to what was meant by &ldquo;a man of modest means&rdquo;.  Previously we had Deputy Everett at a meeting of the Congress of Irish Unions making a speech in which he stated there was no scarcity of money for housing but that money would not be given to the wealthy civil servants and the teachers, who, I suppose, are civil servants too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Put down a few more d<Col N="1218" /> questions and more grants will be paid.  That is a very good idea.  However, I put down a lot of questions on behalf of Limerick Corporation for payment of £403,000 and, unfortunately, when the question was answered the £403,000 was not paid.  In fact, it was not paid until Deputy Smith became Minister for Local Government and had to put another £1,000,000 to the £6,000,000 deficit Deputy Sweetman left us.  I think they have a hell of a cheek to criticise the Department of Local Government for delay in the payment of grants.  As I say, it now hinges around a few weeks.  It is a great compliment to the Government to think that there should not even be a delay of a few weeks, that when an approval certificate is obtained from the local officers payment should issue forthwith or at least within a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been present for the past two hours and the debate has been very amusing, but I wonder what the public would think if they were here listening.  Unlike the public, I have experience of all this sort of business and I can see through it.  I am concerned with Dublin.  I am a member of the Housing Committee and I know what our problem is.  I admit that we have no difficulty about getting money for new dwellings, but there have been complaints from people of delay in receiving money for the reconstruction of old houses and repair grants.  Our big problem in the future in Dublin will be the repair and reconstruction of old houses and I believe that increased grants for this work would help to solve it.</P>
      <P>There was a time when we built as many as 2,000 houses a year but now we are not building any houses at all. We are building only flats and we are limited to about 300 a year and it is not likely that we shall build any more than 300 a year for the next 10 or 12 years.  We have not got sufficient sites and, therefore, are compelled to work on whatever sites are available.  It is because of that that no building is going on in the outskirts of the city and that is one of the reasons, the main reason, why employment in building has been reduced to as low as 300 persons.  Last year, there were 600 employed in Dublin on the building of houses but now there are only 300 so employed and, in that regard, I should like to comment on remarks made by Deputy Briscoe and Deputy N. Lemass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About a year ago, a by-election was pending in the South City constituency. There was a housing Estimate before this House and Deputy Briscoe stated that they hoped to build 6,000 flats in a few years. That was given headlines in the <i>Irish Press</i> and there were even pictures of workers at work.  I stood up and said that was not correct and that 6,000 flats could not be built inside 10 or 12 years.  My statement was correct.  It <Col N="1224" /> was also stated that because of the flat building scheme, it was hoped to employ more people but I was satisfied that fewer people would be put to work.  Last year, 600 men were employed when that statement was made by Deputy Briscoe.  Now there are only 300 and the official view is that there are not likely to be more than 300 employed inside the next 12 years, and there may even be less.</P>
    <P>As far as employment is concerned, we cannot expect a lot from the building of new dwellings.  As I said already, only a limited number of flats can be built and as there is no building taking place on the outskirts of the city, we are confined to the work given in flat building.  However, there is another solution, and it is the main point I want to get across to the Minister, that there should be no delay in the sanctioning of repair grants and grants for the reconstruction of old houses because that kind of work can provide employment for unemployed building workers.  Apart from that, there is the problem that we have at least 5,000 persons on our waiting list looking for dwellings. At the rate of 300 flats a year it will be a long time before they are all housed.  However, 2,000 of these 5,000 are not eligible, under present conditions, for houses.  They are single people and couples living in one or two rooms.  Some of the rooms are in a bad condition but not sufficiently bad to be condemned.  Therefore, there are at least 2,000 persons on our list who are not likely to be housed by Dublin Corporation but who require houses.  We cannot help them and, therefore, repair grants and reconstruction grants come into the picture. The Minister should ensure that there will be no delay in sanctioning and paying such grants.</P>
    <P>There is another point that I should like to mention.  I do not know that it is relevant to the Estimate but it has been referred to.  Deputy Lemass, in trying to score over the Opposition, stated that during the period when the Opposition were in power, 2,000 persons had to leave their homes annually. That is not true.  The highest number of persons who had to leave their <Col N="1225" /> homes was the number who left their homes last year.  The number for the previous year was the highest on record.  As a member of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation, I never miss a meeting and, therefore, I have my finger on the problem.  We had a deputation from the Chairman of C.I.E. last week.  One of the points raised was that many houses were vacated because of the increase in bus fares.  It was up to me to get all the facts as to the numbers leaving their houses and the year in which they left.  We got a factual statement from the Housing Section from which it appeared that the highest number vacated their homes last year and the previous year and not during the term of office of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>There were difficulties about obtaining money for housing purposes during the period of office of the inter-Party Government but I do not agree that the then Taoiseach's guarantee was refused by the banks.  I am not aware of that.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that there should be no delay in the payment of grants for the repair or reconstruction of old houses because there are 2,000 persons requiring houses, whose dwellings are not sufficiently bad to be condemned and who are not likely to be housed by Dublin Corporation within the next seven or eight years.  Unless grants are forthcoming quickly for the repair and reconstruction of old houses, the occupants will continue to suffer because in many cases the landlords refuse to spend money on them.  Speed in the sanction and payment of the money may solve the problem.  It may also solve the housing problem of Dublin.  If all the houses requiring reconstruction or repair were dealt with, those houses plus the flats would solve the Dublin housing problem.</P>

      <P>I only want to put a question to the Minister.  When this Supplementary Estimate is passed will the arrears of grants, particularly the second instalments of housing grants, which are long overdue, be paid?  I would ask the Minister to insist on their being paid at once.  I am sure <Col N="1226" /> the Minister, who comes from a country constituency, knows the difficulties. In some cases people are being pestered by the building contractor who supplied the material.  I do not blame the contractors.  They want their money.  They have provided material.  I would ask the Minister to clear up the situation as soon as possible.  I do not wish to give a list of cases.  I shall quote one, where completion of a house was notified to the Department by the Inspector in August, 1957, and the second instalment of the grant was not paid until December last, 16 or 17 months after the completion of the house.</P>

      <P>Every little tuppencehalfpenny excuse is made by the visiting inspectors when a house is completed in order to delay payment or to have the grant reduced.  I do not agree with that kind of thing.  In one case a concrete footpath 2' 6&rdquo; wide was constructed around a bungalow type house and the owner was compelled to take it up simply because it was 1/4&rdquo; or 3/8&rdquo; too high.  These are ridiculous and petty points.  The people in the country may appear very stupid, perhaps, to the Minister or his inspectors but they are not stupid.  They know that these petty things do not count where a good job of work has been done.  I am not being too harsh when I say that it is little short of blackguardism to make excuses like that simply for the purpose of reducing the grant by £5 or £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley amused me.  He gave a misleading slant to the whole picture of housing.  In 1952, I want to tell Deputy O'Malley, there were <Col N="1227" /> 12,644 new houses built; in 1953, 14,000; 1954, 11,000; 1955, 10,490; 1956&mdash;the first year in which we took office again after Fianna Fáil were in for three years&mdash;there were only 9,837 houses built.  In the following year, the second inter-Party Government were in office and the figure went to 10,969.  Fianna Fáil were back in 1958.  In our last year we built 11,000 houses.  Fianna Fáil cut that down to 7,480.  Last year there were 4,893 houses built.  Reconstructions in the same period were: 1952, 22,092; 1953, 22,573; 1954, 4,200; 1955, 4,900; 1956, 6,400; 1957, 8,157; 1958, 7,162; 1959, 6,109.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, at Question Time, on a question relating to this Estimate the Minister was very anxious to tell the House the good job of work the present Government are doing in regard to housing.  In 1955 we spent £1,995,000 on housing.  In 1956, we spent £2,247,000; in 1957 practically the same figure&mdash;£2,167,000.  In 1958, the year in which Fianna Fáil brought in a Budget after coming back to office, they cut it down from £2,167,000 to £1,527,000; and last year it fell still further to £330,000.  These figures of expenditure I have given are the certified figures from the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office and they cannot be refuted.  That is a deplorable state of affairs.  We know that through conquest over the years, by reason of poverty and various other causes, the housing conditions of our people 20 or 30 years ago were wretched.  I suppose we were one of the most backward countries in Europe at the time.  It is essential that we should have proper housing for those of our people who are left. Whatever other way the Government may effect savings, the worst possible way would be to try to effect such savings by cutting down on housing grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall bring in the reference on another occasion.  In my estimation, the Minister for Local Government is doing a very good job. He is encouraging people to reconstruct their houses.  As far as my constituency is concerned, if there is any delay, it is between the inspector from the Department and the inspector from Dublin County Council.  There should be a little more co-operation between these inspectors.  The Local Government inspector may agree to give the full grant but then the Dublin County Council inspector goes out and finds some fault in respect of bye-laws, and so on.  Therefore, we have had delays in getting the second part of the grant paid by the Dublin County Council.  I suggest that one examination should be sufficient and that if it is necessary to have two inspectors they should both do the inspection together, so that people will get the grant without delay.  I have two or three cases in mind with which I have been dealing during the week, and that is the only difficulty I see in relation to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statements have been made here by the Opposition this morning which cannot be sustained in the light of the evidence of the past few years.  We cannot get away from the facts.  When Deputy O'Donnell was Minister for Local Government, I put more questions to him than, perhaps, any other Deputy.  They were not personal because I have nothing against the Deputy personally&mdash;he is a very likeable <Col N="1230" /> character&mdash;but at that time I was trying to get information for a number of contractors who were in a very bad way.  It would have been all right to tell them there was no money for them but to tell them there was plenty of money and that they should go ahead on that basis was a very serious matter which affected applicants for grants, builders and providers.</P>
    <P>When we took over the Government in March, 1957, the housing position was chaotic and I suppose the confidence of the people came back when the new Government assumed office and when more money became available. The then Minister for Local Government was able to pay £1,300,000 to clear up some of the outstanding debts that had accrued over the years before that.  I do not think the Opposition have any right to criticise the Minister.  He is doing a good job and there is no necessity to create panic.  I have every confidence that anybody who has applied for a reconstruction grant, provided the work is approved, will be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most interesting to listen to some of the Deputies on the other side of the House speaking on this Estimate.  I think everybody will agree that this Estimate should be approved because nobody would like to see any delay in the housing programme. Deputy Burke has said there is some serious trouble in the housing situation.  He has even admitted that he had two or three cases last week of building contractors in county Dublin approaching him to help to solve their problems and give them alleviation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out that he is a Deputy for County Dublin.  With the recent extension of the city boundary there is not a lot of building development being carried out in County Dublin and two or three cases a week is quite a sizeable average for any Deputy to deal with.  I can ask any Deputy who is a member of the Dublin Corporation if he has had any complaints within the last six or seven months in regard to the delay in the payment particularly of loans and to a lesser degree of grants.  I myself have been <Col N="1231" /> almost living in the small dwellings section of the Dublin Corporation since last October with the valuer of the Dublin Corporation to enable some builders to be paid money.</P>
    <P>Some of these builders have had to cease operations; the bank manager was on one side of them breathing down their necks and the builders' providers were on the other side.  Money legitimately due to them on houses completed and passed has not been forthcoming from the local authorities. The housing situation in 1956 was not very good.  It was not rosy but bear in mind that this country had carried out a most extensive housing programme over the previous ten years.  As has been pointed out by Ministers of the previous Government, and by Ministers of the present Government, the housing position had to reach saturation point at some time.  I agree with that viewpoint but the Fianna Fáil Party during the 1957 general election paraded the country and criticised the previous Government because of the housing position.  They said if they were elected as Government they would improve the position considerably. I suggest that the position now is worse than it was in 1956-57.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about the reduction of a small sum of money in the payment of a grant.  That system is completely wrong.  The grant should be paid in full or not at all. If the inspector who goes out to inspect a house decides that there are a few minor faults and that in view of those faults he cannot, in his report, agree that the full grant should be paid, then the builder should be instructed to remedy those faults.  If he does not remedy them, the grant should be withheld.  It is ridiculous to my mind that where a grant of a certain sum of money is due to be paid on a house a trivial sum like £5 or £10 is retained.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to stress with local authorities the importance of clearing up some of the rivers, streams and water ways going through new housing schemes.  I see the occupant of the Chair looking at me, <Col N="1232" /> as if I were not keeping to the terms of the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Money is provided for the building of private houses.  I suggest that in the development of private schemes one of the most important things is to have proper facilities and amenities.  If uncontrolled water ways are flowing through them, as occurs in the city of Dublin, the position should be remedied.  I could refer to Artane and Donnycarney where there are two rivers flowing through housing schemes.  The Dublin Corporation applied to the Department of Local Government for a grant to culvert these streams but that permission has not been given to the Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Sheldon) Acting Chairman (Mr. Sheldon)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Sheldon)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing further to say on that matter.  I would urge the Minister for Local Government to inquire from the Dublin Corporation if there have been any complaints about delays in the payment of small dwelling loans.  There have been very serious delays.  I can give details to the Minister about the houses and people in question, if he desires.  To my mind one department in the Corporation is blaming the other department.  In one case I paid two visits to two separate departments&mdash;four visits in one day&mdash; and I got a contradictory answer each time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke also suggested that, in 1956, 350 applicants for small dwelling loans were turned down.  I suppose that is understandable.  Many people apply for loans whom the local authorities in their wisdom or otherwise, feel could not meet their commitments. There are people who apply for small dwelling loans whose incomes <Col N="1233" /> are not sufficient and there are people who apply and who do not qualify for them in the area in which they have applied.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here that Deputy Smith, as Minister for Local Government, made £1,300,000 available in May, 1957, to meet the debts left by the previous Government.  That £1,300,000 was a sum of money that would have had to be provided by any Government in office, by the inter-Party Government or the Fianna Fáil Government, because it was a commitment that the inter-Party Government entered into with the local authorities.  It was when the local authorities asked for these moneys that the payments were made.  It happened to be an accident of time that Deputy Smith was Minister for Local Government in May, 1957.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little to say regarding the general position of housing with the exception of the fact that I do know, further to my representations within the last week to the Minister, that some six weeks elapsed before an inspection took place on a certain scheme.  I made representations a week ago but it is a month since a builder said that he would have to disemploy some 16 to 18 operatives by virtue of a delay in the completion of the loans.</P>
      <P>I shall pass on from that question to the reconstruction grants.  When the Minister was amending the Housing Bill I was very interested and I pointed out that I did not think the intention, behind the Bill, of creating greater employment would work out. The reconstruction of houses and the grants for that work as presently administered are a complete failure. I could give details of one case which involved four years, and another, three years.  I am not suggesting, as others have suggested, that there is any question of a lack of money, but the administration is pathetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke mentioned the local government inspectors.  It sometimes looked as if work of the local authorities was to be followed up by the inspectors.  I believe that is unnecessary expenditure.  I do not know <Col N="1234" /> what qualifications are required of those inspectors.  Lest I be misunderstood as being in any way attacking the inspectors individually, let me give a concrete case.  A person makes an application for a reconstruction grant.  He submits an estimate and an inspection takes place.  The work proceeds and is completed eventually, the work to be done having been specified in detail.</P>
    <P>Finally, when one or other of the inspectors comes along, he may look up and see a chimney which was built 50 or 60 years before with flashing slates.  Despite the fact that work necessitating the expenditure of a sum of £400 or £500 has been completed, work which qualified for the complete grant, that grant will be held up because the inspector decides against the slate flashing which has given good service, and has been perfectly satisfactory for that house and the adjoining houses, say in a terrace block. The grant will not be paid until the slate flashing is removed and copper flashing installed.  There is no doubt about that.  In fact, I was the victim myself.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider the fact that the applications for this reconstruction work are made lest the houses fall into complete disrepair, and, because of the fact that the persons concerned have not the money to make the necessary alterations, we subsequently may have to build a house to accommodate them.  A condition should be made that this work should be executed by contractors or at least tradesmen.  My experience is that these grants and the work they entail have not resulted in any increase in employment.  The work is being done at night by individuals who are holding down a job in the daytime.  I hope the Minister will take the necessary steps to see that this work will be executed in the manner envisaged by most of us and I am sure by himself in particular when the Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>After a contractor has completed work for which he tendered, and submitted a detailed itemised estimate, an inspector from the Department can <Col N="1235" /> say: &ldquo;Oh, you must remove that slate flashing before we can pass this.&rdquo; Time will go on and there will be unnecessary work which will hold up the payment of such moneys as are due. That creates embarrassment for those concerned so I feel that the administration of this Act should be completely revised and overhauled, so that the intention originally behind it may some day be implemented.</P>
    <P>On the question of the loans to which I referred I had only one complaint but I felt justified in mentioning it because others had made complaints. I am not making sweeping statements; it is only fair to say that I had an assurance from the Minister's Department that the matter would be expedited and that the delay was not caused by the Department but by the local authorities.  It is only fair to say that, but the delays in grants and payments in regard to reconstruction must lie entirely with the Minister's Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has now practically exhausted the criticism we had to offer in relation to the attitude of the Minister at Question Time yesterday, and in his introduction of the Supplementary Estimate this morning.  This Estimate must be passed in order that the people who have waited so long for grants may receive them.  It is unfortunate that the Minister attempted to put something across, both yesterday and today, which cannot be substantiated by facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was regrettable, and I am sure nobody regretted it more than the Minister, that Deputy N. Lemass should make the contribution he made this morning.  He was, of course, forced to his feet by the fact that the chorus of approval present at Question Time yesterday was noticeably absent this morning.  Deputy N. Lemass made a very extraordinary statement. He said it was the Dublin housing situation that brought down the previous Government and that this Government actually got in on the undertakings they gave in relation to housing.  If that was the foundation, upon which the Government were <Col N="1236" /> elected, and continue in office, they certainly must be quaking to their foundations.  If it is on that point they are going to establish a record in office, incontrovertible figures have been presented by many Deputies&mdash;I shall not weary the House by repeating them&mdash; in relation to the fall-off in the building of new houses since this Government came into office.  The record of the previous Government in this regard is also there and cannot be controverted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass was speaking in a political sense and he said that, in his opinion, there was such a resurgence, and an improvement generally in the economy of the country, that we could look forward to the housing of a greater population.  He must have come into the House this morning without having read the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Government in their published Estimates indicate a reduction of £17,000 for next year for children's allowances which would seem to indicate that the falling-off in housing is synonymous with an expected falling off in population.  Consequently, it is hard to reconcile the Estimates with the remarks of Deputy N. Lemass. There is no doubt that the situation he described of the frequency and the vehemence with which members of the Dublin Corporation had to attend the Custom House and barrage the previous Minister for Local Government is a fact.  There is no doubt that that occurred.  However, it would now appear, from the absence of Deputy Briscoe from this House and from his lack of any interest whatsoever in housing problems in Dublin since the change of Government, that that was a politically-inspired campaign conducted for no reason other than to bring down the previous Government. Deputy N. Lemass confirms us in that view by his remarks in this debate.</P>
    <P>I am at one with several Deputies on both sides of the House who, over the past month or two, have been barraged by constituents who have been held up by all these niggling requirements to cover up the fact that the Government were not in a position to pay these grants, not even in relation to local and private grants.  I know contractors who have been waiting since <Col N="1237" /> 1955 for moneys due to them for work performed on housing schemes in North Cork.  That must be dealt with. Consequently, we cannot delay the passage of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>It is very regretable that the Minister should have been condescending to Deputies yesterday and this morning and should have consequently sparked off this protracted discussion on this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult to sit here and appreciate to the full that the members of the Opposition who led off this morning, notably the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, and Deputy O'Donnell, my predecessor in the Department of Local Government, should come into this House on a matter of the provision of moneys for housing and blandly make any accusations whatsoever against any Minister or any Government, for, as they say, the withholding of moneys, the suppression of housing and the holding back of payments. What is hard to understand is that no two members of this House would have had the same humiliating experience as they themselves would have gone through in bringing about just such a situation as they are now trying to accuse me, my Department and the Government of.  In trying to get across the case they have been rather lamely making this morning, they quote a welter of figures in regard to allocations of new houses, reconstruction, repair grants.  Then we get the payments made, which are other figures which cannot be compared with the first lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, a fairly decent effort was made by them to create a smokescreen with figures that cannot readily be assimilated and compared in order that an answer to their unfounded charges cannot be made readily, quickly and in an understandable manner now.  They made great play with the fact that figures for housing, as they would point out, were higher in 1957 than in subsequent years. They would lead us to believe, from the manner in which they dealt with that matter, that house-building and houses in course of construction are something that, by pressing a button, <Col N="1238" /> you can get to go ahead and, by pressing another button, can be stopped.</P>
    <P>Some Opposition Deputies quoted a number of figures and totals a few times, starting back in 1952.  They gave a figure of 14,000, followed the following year by 12,000 in respect of houses erected or completed, followed by a figure of 10,000, followed by a figure of 9,000.  They take us to task because, as they say, in the first year we came back into office, the figure became 7,000.  During the three glorious years of their occupation of the Government benches, there was a declining trend in these figures which they themselves have quoted here to-day.</P>

It was stated, again by those same Deputies, to have dropped to 10,000 after the three glorious years of the occupation of this House by the Coalition Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> I want to draw the attention of the House in relation to these same figures they are making play with, to the fact that during their term in office the figure established in 1952 or 1953 dropped by a very appreciable number by the time they vacated office and that a further drop which took place thereafter cannot surely be attributed immediately to the change of Government.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so that we can pay <Col N="1240" /> for the increasing number of houses being built and reconstructed this year. The dead hand of the Coalition was evident in 1956.  In 1957, because the dead hand was seen by the public and because of public unrest and demand, we had a general election which brought about a change of Government. The first job of the new Government then was, as has already been said in this House today, to start off by paying the debts and commitments already entered into in regard to housing and related matters by the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>To give only a very few figures, and not to confuse the position, taking money issued from the Local Loans Fund for the payment of supplementary grants by our local authorities, excluding Dublin and Cork, the figure in 1955-56 was £400,000 under that heading.  In 1956-57, it was £340,000.  In 1957-58, £1,000,000 was drawn from that fund to pay those supplementary grants through our local authorities.  In 1958-59, the level of the draw had come back to a normal figure and £300,000 only had then to be drawn.</P>
      <P>I want to show that the gap between the falls, as we have seen them&mdash; £400,000, £340,000 and £300,000 as against £1,000,000&mdash;was brought about by the fact that in April, 1957&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In fact, the packeting of foodstuffs contributes to their reaching the consumer in a fresher and more hygienic state than would otherwise be possible and the labelling of the containers would not improve the position in this respect.  In these circumstances, I think it is of greater importance that the moneys available and the time and energies of the limited staff of my Department and of health authorities should be devoted to more important matters, e.g., the improvement of the effectiveness and economy of the health organisation and of the facilities for the prevention and cure of illness and disease.</P>

Neighbouring counties, however, have not as yet quite reached the same standard and, because of the problem of effective movement control, I have come to the conclusion, after very careful consideration, that it would be better to accredit a large area in the West, including County Sligo, later this year, than to accredit County Sligo alone in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The information available to me does not suggest the existence of a serious position in the Arigna area and I am not satisfied that any steps beyond the existing policy of giving preference to Arigna coal and other native fuels for use in State, semi-State and local authority institutions are either necessary or practicable.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware a substantial portion (45,000 tons per year) of the output of Arigna coal is consumed in the local electricity generating station which was commissioned in October 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that since Christmas from one mine alone over 23 men have been dismissed and that 20 of these have gone to England?  Is he also aware that a major company in the Arigna area producing coal and employing 300 men, for some time back has had men working on a five-day week basis?  In <Col N="1246" /> view of the fact that one company alone in the Arigna area is capable of supplying the power station with all the fuel it needs&mdash;50,000 tons&mdash;will the Minister in these circumstances say what steps he proposes to take to safeguard the livelihoods of the majority of the miners in the area rather than that they should be forced to emigrate?</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot comment on the accuracy of the figures just given by the Deputy, but I should like to refer him to the fact that, in 1959, the total production of coal in the Arigna area was 64,309 tons.  Of that amount, as I have already stated, the local electricity generating station consumed 45,000 tons, which is just short of 75 per cent. of the total consumption.  I am also informed that the unemployment figure related to mine workers in the local office&mdash;which is Carrick-on-Shannon&mdash; supplied by the Department of Social Welfare at the end of February, 1960, was 19, which was 10 less than in the corresponding period last year.</P>

I asked the Minister if he is aware that 20 men have gone from the locality since Christmas, due to the fact that the demand for their services is not there?  May I put it this way?  Will the Minister not consider giving protection to this extent, that where the raw material is produced within the country, the people who produce that raw material are at least equally entitled to protection as the people who are in assembly industry elsewhere?  First class employment was being given in this industry and if, as a result of State and semi-State companies turning over to oil, they lose their employment, is there not a case to be made to prohibit these bodies using oil when native fuel is available?</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain representations have been received in this matter from time to time.  The position is that pension rates are related to the contributions previously made to the pension fund <Col N="1248" /> by the pensioners concerned and by C.I.E.  The full cost of any increase in pensions to existing C.I.E. pensioners, as in the case of one such increase already granted, would fall to be met by C.I.E. in the form of <i>ex-gratia</i> payments.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. superannuation schemes may be amended under existing legislation on the initiative of C.I.E.  The extent to which C.I.E. would, however, be prepared to add to their already substantial commitments for pension purposes is a matter falling entirely within the discretion of the Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the number of elderly pensioners who retired prior to 1956 is inevitably on the decline?  The number of persons affected is very small and they are not in a position to wield any effective bargaining power.  Would the Minister not agree that he has a public duty to take up the case of these people and to convey to the board of C.I.E. the representations made to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>C.I.E. did in fact increase the pensions of the lower group recently at a cost of £17,000 per annum.  These were men who opted for the five years scheme and who received the higher pension for that time and then reverted to the lower pension.  They now have had that lower pension doubled <i>ex gratia</i> by C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that an increase such as he mentions, which has cost only £17,000 out of £2,750,000, is very small indeed? In view of this, would the Minister not agree that he should convey the representations made to him to the board?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase in the price of bread in May, 1957 followed the removal of the subsidy on flour. Bread prices were freed from control in August, 1957 and I am, therefore, not in a position to give the precise reasons for increases since then but I understand that they were due to increased costs of production.  The decrease in the price of bread which took place in November, 1958 was I understand due to the increased use in that year of imported wheat for flour milling.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he will take steps to compel all schools with fifty or more pupils to install adequate fire fighting equipment; and if he will prescribe regular fire drill for pupils and staff in such schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations for the recognition or continued recognition of National Schools require that a suitable fireguard be provided therein for each open fireplace and that adequate protection against burning or scalding be afforded in cases where stoves or other heating apparatus are used.</P>
      <P>Grants are made by my Department towards the cost of the provision of such fireguards in vested schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A circular was issued in October, 1953, to all Managers of national schools requesting them to make arrangements to ensure that all fires in schools are properly extinguished before the premises are vacated for the <Col N="1255" /> day.  Attention was also called to the danger of leaving articles of clothing, stationery or other materials on electric storage heaters.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances the need for special fire-fighting equipment or for formal fire drill for the pupils of national schools does not arise.</P>
    <P>Vocational schools, which are also non-residential, are the property of the Local Authorities and the responsibility for the safety of the pupils in attendance rests with these Authorities.</P>
    <P>Secondary schools, which may be either residential or day schools, are privately owned institutions and the responsibility for the safety of the pupils in attendance therein devolves upon the Managers and the owners.</P>
    <P>It is understood that in the residential schools generally adequate safety precautions in the matter of fire escapes are provided and the buildings are usually centrally heated.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the regulations made under the law prescribe fire-fighting equipment for cinemas, halls and such like places where there may not be open fireplaces such as have been described by the Minister, would he not consider it appropriate to lay down, perhaps in consultation with the Department of Local Government, certain minimum requirements regarding fire-fighting equipment for schools with or without open fires?

    <P> (i)  if the amount of such compensation is equal to or less than the redemption price of so much of such annuity as is apportioned to the affected land and the arrears (if any) of such annuity&mdash;to order by its award payment to the Land Commission of the whole or such part of the compensation as the Land Commission request, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the amount of such compensation exceeds the said redemption price and the arrears (if any) of such annuity &mdash;to order by its award payment to the Land Commission of so much of the compensation, not exceeding the amount of the said redemption price and the arrears (if any) of the <Col N="1264" /> annuity, as the Land Commission request,</P>
    <P>and the Board shall comply with such request.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where an award in relation to land (in this paragraph referred to as the affected land) which is subject, in conjunction with other land, to a land purchase annuity provides for the payment under paragraph (a) of this subsection of any moneys to the Land Commission, such moneys shall upon receipt thereof be applied by the Land Commission as follows&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  in case there are any arrears of such annuity and the amount of such moneys does not exceed such arrears&mdash;in or towards discharge of such arrears,</P>

    <P>(iii)  in case there are no arrears of such annuity&mdash;in or towards redemption of so much of such annuity as is apportioned to the affected land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendments 1 and 3 deal with the same point and, with the permission of the House, I should like to take them together.  Amendment 1 deals with petroleum workings and amendment 3 with working for solid minerals. Under the existing law, in the event of compensation being paid to the owner of a holding which has been acquired, the Land Commission is entitled to seek from the Mining Board, which is the authority paying compensation, the arrears of any <Col N="1265" /> annuities due by the owner of the land to the Land Commission plus the full redemption value of the entire holding. The amendment does not affect the entitlement of the Land Commission to acquire arrears in respect of the whole holding where only part of the holding is subject to compensation, but it is considered inequitable that in the event of only part of a holding being damaged or acquired and compensation being paid in respect of it, out of that compensation the owner should pay the redemption value of the entire holding.  The redemption value under the section as amended will now be limited to that part of the holding which is subject to payment of compensation. I think it is a reasonable amendment and I suggest that the House might accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to pick up where I left off.  The point I had then reached was that in April of 1957, there was falling due, and stacked up for some months, a considerable back-log of moneys due, under various headings affecting housing, to local authorities that had not been paid by our predecessors.  One of the figures which I already mentioned, but about which I do not think I gave the full reference, was that money paid from the Local Loans Fund in April, 1957, for supplementary grants was £350,000 and for S.D.A. loans £250,000, a total of £600,000 within days of our assuming office.</P>
      <P>At this point, I should like to disabuse Deputy Belton of the impression he was given by someone or other that this, as it were, falling due of commitments on the Fianna Fáil Government in the beginning of April, 1957, was purely accidental.  There was nothing accidental about it.  These commitments should have been paid, many of them, months before that. They were not paid and Deputies who spoke from the front bench of the Opposition today are in a much better position and freer than I to indicate to the House just why they were not paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I wanted to bring to the notice of the House was that the issue from the Local Loans Fund in regard to the year 1957-58 amounted to £1,000,000 under the heading of Supplementary Grants, and that the <Col N="1270" /> figure against the amount payable in the previous years was £340,000 and £440,000, in the years 1956-57 and 1955-56, and again in 1958, as I said, £300,000.  The difference between the average run of those three figures in 1955-56, 1956-57 and 1957-58 of roughly £600,000, can be accounted for by the fact that commitments were entered into for which the money was not provided until Fianna Fáil assumed office, got the money and issued it to our local authorities to clear up the commitments they had entered into as far back as six months before.</P>
    <P>Anybody in the local authorities of those days, in 1956, who recalls clearly the dilemma that we, as members of local authorities, found ourselves in, will certainly take issue with the bland assertions made here today that there was no back-log of commitments then.  We know, and I know personally, as a member of a local authority, that in the latter half of 1956, we did not have made available to us the moneys we required for the commitments we had already made to persons throughout our counties then building their houses.  It was not until we got a change of Government that we were given the money from the Local Loans Fund which we had already committed ourselves to pay to people in our counties on foot of the supplementary grants which we were then operating.</P>
    <P>In the same way, many Deputies will recall very vividly that all forms of planning and all forms of new works of a constructional type were strangled at that time, and that is reflected in the years that followed that date.  It is reflected in the figures of a downward trend that emerged in the following years in regard to house-building. That strangulation with regard to constructional works naturally became evident, not just immediately, but in the years that followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the Deputy's dilemma in 1956 is concerned, all I can say is that, even at this far removed date, I am sorry for the dilemma he then found himself in, that he could not get on with the work that was being asked for by the local authorities, that he could not sanction the new programmes they were putting up, and that he could not pay them the moneys due on foot of their commitments in regard to housing and other local authority activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It comes badly from the members of the Government of those days to come in here now and try to make out that the falling figures shown in 1958-59 are, in fact, the result of the actions of the Government.  They are the direct result of the suppression of housing by virtue of the lack of money from central funds and through the Local Loans Fund to county councils under the headings of Supplementary Grants and moneys for the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts housing.  It is entirely as a result of that that we had this depression and when the Fianna Fáil Government came into office&mdash;and I repeat this&mdash;we did not have a building programme going ahead.  We had a <Col N="1272" /> building programme that was on its knees, crawling and about to collapse, and that is the point from which we had to start to bring it back and to bring some life back to the house-building trade.</P>
    <P>We have succeeded to some degree, even to a greater degree than we had even hoped was possible in the short time in between, as evidenced purely by the fact that I come here before this House today to secure further moneys by way of Supplementary Estimate in order that the increased number of people who have since commenced their building operations under the various headings will, in fact, have their grants made available to them before the end of this financial year.</P>
    <P>There have been all sorts of charges about delays and some of them have been attributed, and quite wrongfully, as can be shown and understood, to various causes.  I think the most outlandish cause of all&mdash;of course, it would be the most outlandish coming from the Deputy who put it forward, Deputy O.J. Flanagan&mdash;was that we were in fact purposely delaying the payment of grants in order that we would pay them when a Fianna Fáil Deputy came along and made representations for the individual applicants.</P>
    <P>Surely the fact that the total amount of the allocation for this year of £1,700,000 has almost gone, has actually been paid, is in itself a complete refutation of what Deputy O.J. Flanagan now suggests.  In fact, my being here on this business today refutes many of these allegations, no matter how they may be couched, that we have been delaying the payment of grants and delaying the approving of plans for houses and so on.  All this money, with practically very little exception, has already been paid, and it is because it has already been paid that we are asking for £195,000 more during this financial year.  Deputies who tried to make capital out of that argument will find that the evidence is so strong against them that it is likely to boomerang in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, another matter <Col N="1273" /> at issue.  I am dealing with Deputy O.J. Flanagan, who said that, by ministerial instruction&mdash;no fault of the Department, of course&mdash;no payments were to be made.  Regardless of what I as Minister say, he went on to say that that is what the position actually is.  Of course, Deputy O.J. Flanagan would like the House to believe that he has a monopoly of the facts and that when it comes down to talking facts and truth in this House, he must be believed, regardless of how wild or unfounded his statements or allegations may be.</P>
    <P>I gave no such instruction at any time either on this or any other matter since I became Minister for Local Government, for the very good reason that, far different from my predecessors in the Coalition Government, I have not been restricted by the Government in providing money for building houses, reconstructing houses, local authority housing or any other activity of local authorities.  I have not been nailed down, as my predecessor in that Government was, by a shortage of money and I have not had to make efforts to suppress the spending of money because the money was not there.  That is my answer to Deputy Flanagan and any other Deputy who wants to try to make the public believe through this House that a ministerial direction had gone to my people in the Department not to pay.</P>
    <P>The thing is completely and absolutely without foundation.  It is a happy position for me, as against that of my predecessor in office during the years of the last Coalition Government, when he was so cramped that he was not able to do the things he felt he should do, to which he and his Department were committed and which we, as a Government, in 1957, had to do for them, when we had to provide the money they had not paid during their last six or seven months in office.</P>
    <P>One thing more I want to make clear is that while we had this dying down and crippling of the building industry and of local authority activities during the year 1956, we found that, in 1957, our big task was to pay the debts due by the Coalition Government, <Col N="1274" /> to try to clear up the muddle and the mess that we inherited from our predecessors and, in 1958/59, to try to instil some life into the almost dead industry of building, we advocated in every possible way further and new developments in house building, both in the reconstruction and repair field, as well as in the field of new building, where that was necessary. In order to show that that is not an empty formula, our 1958 Housing Act brought substantially increased benefits by way of grants to the many people who have since availed of it. The position in 1959/60 shows the results of that revival which we, by Government policy, have been encouraging since we found the building industry in the dying and almost dead state in which it was in March, 1957.</P>
    <P>The results today are encouraging. The upward trend is there again to be seen and we want this Estimate through this House so that we can stand by our bond, that is, to pay the debts that we owe to any of those people who have applied for grants and who have gone on with their work and to whom grants are now due. We want that money to pay those people, not to leave it to the next financial year and not to leave to another Government the task of paying debts incurred under our régime.</P>
    <P>Various other matters have been raised.  I should like to say to those people who are criticising the Department's administration&mdash;as some Deputies did&mdash;that if there are delays and if there have been delays, that is not evident in the fact that the trend is up, which would completely negative the argument that we are slowing up. We are being accused of slowing up and delaying.  Rather than a slowing up, there is a speeding up.  Greater numbers are qualifying and are being paid now than in the immediately previous years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us go back a little and find out the figure which was mentioned here a while ago.  Let us take the total amount of moneys that had to be found to meet obligations on hands from the Local Loans Fund in May, 1957.  Rather, let us look at 5th April, 1957.  We find that, on 5th April, 1957, obligations on hands from local authorities for issues under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts were of the order of £287,000 and, under the Labourers Acts, of the order of £235,000, giving obligations on hands against commitments already entered into but not paid for, at over £500,000.  Immediate payments were made at that time under these two heads and again, under the heads of the small dwellings and the supplementary grants, in addition to that, we find immediate payments being made of £209,000 and £321,000, giving us another figure of £.53 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those two figures together indicate <Col N="1276" /> the commitments in regard to applications on hands at the beginning of April, 1957, of well over £1 million.  I suppose some Deputies will say those would have arisen in the 11 days while Fianna Fáil were in office or, as I heard others of them say, that they were just payments due on foot of work done as a result of Coalition policy and which only then fell due. These are not the figures that fell due. These are the figures that were due.</P>

      <P>The current year.  That includes what we feel will fall due <Col N="1279" /> now, and at the end of the month the overall increase in payments of grants will amount to approximately 11½ per cent.  What is more significant and of greater benefit is that the draws in relation to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts will be increased by 50 per cent. over what my Department had in their wisdom estimated not twelve months ago.  This latter increase of 50 per cent. under the draws for S.D.A. gives the hope that the opening figures we see here in regard to building of new houses and the increased activities in other housing matters are not for this year only. I am hopeful from those drawings that this will not be an isolated matter in so far as these housing grant draws are concerned and that we shall continue doing a good job in repairing and improving our houses and building the new houses that will be needed during the coming years.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley was challenged quite strenuously on the figure of £1.3 million which he quoted from a speech by the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Smith, which appears in the Official Report of 1957.  Of that £1.3 million which was mentioned in that context, £.99 million was due at that time against applications withheld for months previously.  That figure of £1.3 million mentioned by the then Minister, Deputy Smith, and quoted here today by Deputy O'Malley is a figure that cannot be refuted and the argument used by Deputy Sweetman in casting a doubt on the veracity of those figures by indicating the abstract of accounts and referring to other volumes, does not hold water because the figure is correct.  Of that figure of £1.3 million which the then Minister mentioned in May, 1957, £.99 million had already been issued against applications withheld for some months and if you move back a few months you will find that they must have been withheld in the previous financial year, and in the previous financial year, except for 11 days, the people then in office were the Coalition Parties and the Opposition who are making such noise about this matter today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am gratified that our efforts to <Col N="1280" /> pick up off the floor, as it were, the building industry have met with some success.  As I said in my opening speech, I am satisfied to come into the House at this juncture of the year to ask for more money than we had anticipated would be drawn or called upon under the head of grants for repair and reconstruction.  I know that even the Opposition members, would be quite happy in the knowledge &mdash;regardless of what propaganda they may have tried to make here to-day&mdash; that the wreck they made of the building industry in 1956 has in some degree been remedied and that there is a fairly stable future for the industry which was very much absent three years ago.</P>

      <P>Bad habits can be created and if I were to fall into the bad habit of not trying to come in and pay the debts of my Department, it would only be a bad habit created by my predecessors, the Coalition Government.  But I have not slipped to that extent.  We are trying to get money through to pay our commitments up to the end of the month. Those commitments have arisen because of the substantially improved number of new housing grants falling due.  There was an abnormally high demand for the payment of grants in <Col N="1281" /> the month of February, so high in fact, as I said earlier, that it was subject to check.  It has since been checked and it is the highest figure for any February in any year in the history of the State.  The figure of £225,000 in grants falling due in February is the highest figure ever in any year at any time under that heading in this State and furthermore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not talking about payments in the month of February, lest the Deputy may have been misled and thought he had something to go on.  I am talking about amounts falling to be paid, on foot of new hous-housing grants applications for February. The sum of £250,000 is the highest figure that has ever fallen due in the month of February and in fact is exceeded, I think, in only one or two instances by the demand in any other month in any other year since the housing drive started.  It is quite a phenomenal figure.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the January figure was high and furthermore I can also relieve the Deputy of the trouble of trying to frame a Question through which he expects to find out there is some trick in the figures for February. It is a down to earth figure and the proofs are there and, as I said, it is extraordinarily high.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I daresay the Deputy would like to think over this question. If he wants an answer to that question, possibly he might also think over the answer to the next question which is: why was there such a big drop in the number of houses completed in the year after Fianna Fáil came into office?  Do not say that Fianna Fáil were to blame.  If the houses were not started, they could not have been finished and obviously they could not have been started and finished in the few months.  There was a big drop and that must have started before the Coalition left office, in spite of the fact that they would like us to believe it was entirely due to Fianna Fáil.  The Deputy might think over that.  I have been asking that question since I got up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, let me say that it gives me great satisfaction to ask for this money, because it does show, regardless of the extraneous matters that have been raised, that there has been a picking up in the building industry. <Col N="1283" /> Under whatever heads you may wish to take, that evidence is there and it is evidence that we all welcome, regardless of what attitude we may have taken on this Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to that.  The matter was raised by a few Deputies, including Deputy MacCarthy, and I think his attitude was that the appointed officers, because they were local, were more accurate in their estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody referred to activity.  I think people said &ldquo;more acquainted with local conditions&rdquo;.  We do not criticise officials&mdash;we leave that to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some of your colleagues who did not do so today.  I have done away with the appointed officers and with all due respect to those of them who gave really good service in all the years of housing drive, I have no apology to make.  While there may be the local aspect of the situation particularly in the case of men with long experience in their area and who seem to know local conditions so well, I do not see what that has got to do with the matter.  After all, these men whom we are now sending out are people who are qualified men and men who are selected by a board.  They are put out after a training period with senior men and why or how they should fail to do the job of initial inspection and estimation as well as any of their colleagues elsewhere, regardless of where they are located, is a mystery to me.  In fact if one fault were to be found, possibly the Department of Local Government might hold that it could be said that a local man, being more acquainted with local conditions, might turn that personal knowledge to compute a lesser estimate than would a man who <Col N="1284" /> is strange to the district.  If that is so, and possibly it could happen and may be happening, it is not a disadvantage to the applicant.  Rather it is an advantage in many cases where an estimate comes into question in the allocation of a grant.</P>
      <P>It has also been said that there was no real need for this change and, at the same time, that people were paying as much to-day.  I do not exactly get the significance of that suggestion.  Somebody mentioned here that by getting the local officer, they could get everything, including the plans, for £2 2s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said in this way, that £2 2s. was the fee for these local men and that, in many cases, they prepared the plans.  I shall say nothing further than that that is one of the reasons it might have been wise to discontinue the appointed officers in certain areas.  In those other areas where that was not really the cause, we must be grateful for the good work.</P>
      <P>Let nobody suggest to the House that by giving the work to the inspectors who are all from the Department&mdash;they are fully qualified men and they are completely impartial &mdash;we have done something wrong.  In fact, our inspectors have the ability to do the work.  They have done general inspections and not only is it their job in the initial stages to inspect the work, but their qualifications would enable them at an early stage, before any of the work was done, to advise and help the applicants to amend their plans, to amend what they were proposing to do, rather than having the job half done before finding out it would be a bad job.  That is a service now, free to each of the applicants, which was not free before, when it was a question of an appointed officer on a fee basis who went out to do the initial inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only assure the House that so far as my Department is concerned, and so far as the inspectorial staff are concerned, we have been making repeated efforts in recent months, because of the growing volume of applicants, to speed up in every <Col N="1285" /> possible way and at every juncture, the whole system of grants so that there will be no cause for complaint. Generally speaking, it will be found that our efforts in that direction have been meeting with success.</P>
    <P>May I say further that complaints were made here that there is a back-log and a hold-up in Dublin with regard to grant allocations or payments. So far as the Department is concerned, our information is that no such back-log of arrears actually exists in Dublin in the matter of reconstruction or repair grants.  The matter has been the subject of a check very recently&mdash;indeed, within the past few days.  There may have been a substantial back-log a year ago, or thereabouts, as a result possibly of a change-over of staff, or a shortage of personnel of the type we require.  That may be true, but I am not at all prepared to agree that, so far as the Department is concerned to-day, there are, in fact, any substantial arrears whatsoever.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary to encourage Deputies to come to the Department for any information, but lest some might be hesitant, I am now issuing an open invitation.  If there is a case of extra delay, I shall be very glad to hear of it. Deputies are quite welcome to send facts and particulars and they will be gone into immediately.  With regard to the inspectors and inspections&mdash;and I know Deputy Carroll knows quite a lot about building and reconstruction &mdash;the only thing I can say, if the situation is as he outlined it, that inspectors are so pernickety because of inexperience&mdash;that reason was not alleged&mdash;that there was difficulty for the applicants and that nonsense was being made of efforts to get houses reconstructed, is that our inspectors are are well-qualified men whether they are young or not.  When they come to <Col N="1286" /> us, the first job they get is to go out with a senior inspector for a number of weeks, or months, if necessary, depending on the ability of the chap to take in every aspect of the job. Finally, after that training, he goes out on a job himself.  If a matter is in dispute, it is quite a normal practice for a senior inspector to be sent to the job or to the site, which is in dispute. How the matter which the Deputy has mentioned can have arisen, I just cannot understand.  As I said already, I am quite prepared to get from the Deputy, and I shall be glad to get from him or any other Deputy details of that, or any other case, because they are of vital interest to the whole programme of the grant aids.  We, in the Departments, want to streamline the procedure to as great a degree as possible.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide for the increases in Army pay which have been approved with effect from 15th December, 1959.  The cost of these increases in respect of the current financial year is £72,000 and, regard being had to anticipated savings in the Vote generally, the amount of the Supplementary Estimate is £32,000.</P>
    <P>The pay of officers has been increased <Col N="1288" /> on the same basis as that of civil servants, the increases in the maxima of the married scales ranging from £41 a year for a second-lieutenant to £134 a year for a major-general.  In addition, professional pay and certain forms of additional pay have been increased, as also has uniform replenishment allowance.  The annual cost of the increases for officers is £70,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>The pay of men has been increased generally in the same proportion as that of officers, the value of emoluments&mdash;rations, uniform, etc.&mdash;being also taken into account.  The increases in pay range from 10/6d. a week for a Sergeant-Major to 5/3d. a week for a recruit.  Long-service increments, payable after five and ten years' service, have been increased by 1/2d. a week and the allowance to wives of married soldiers by 3/3d. a week.  The annual cost of the increases for men is £192,000 approximately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to this Estimate because it is essential that the Defence Forces, in company with so many other sections of our people, should be given this increase in income that arises from the substantial and steeply-rising increase in the cost of living in recent years.  We agree to this Estimate but I would point out that it is completely contrary to the policy of the Government at the time the food subsidies were withdrawn and when they informed the Dáil they would resist with all their power any effort to come back and force the State to pay higher salaries and wages consequent on any repercussions due to the withdrawal of food subsidies.</P>
      <P>We have repeated Estimates&mdash;the annual Estimates were increased and Supplementary Estimates were introduced&mdash;purely because of the Government's action (1)  in failing to control the cost of living and (2)  by causing the cost of living to rise so steeply, consequent upon the withdrawal of food subsidies.  Those who hoped it would be possible to curb the expenditure of the State as a result of the withdrawal of food subsidies now see the results of the unwise action of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> This House is now called upon to face repeated Estimates and Supplementary Estimates to meet the charges falling on each Department arising out of the Government's action in failing to control the cost of living.  Bear in mind that those for whom we cater in those Estimates do not represent all the people in the country.  Nevertheless, when the occasion arises, we should try to ease the burden from falling too heavily on these people as reflected in the information which this House received that there has actually been an increase of 5½d. in the 2 lb. loaf since this Government assumed office. Consequently, we must do our utmost to cushion the people against the impact of the steep increase in the cost of living.  It is with that consideration in mind that we feel the Supplementary Estimate should be passed.</P>

      <P>I take it that on a Supplementary Estimate of this kind, we are restricted to the subject matter of the Estimate very closely.  We accept the Estimate in consequence of the necessary decision to which Deputy O'Sullivan has referred.</P>
      <P>I wonder if it would unduly widen the scope of the debate to inquire of the Minister whether there is a change of policy in the matter of the location of the Army?  Possibly this might be brought up on the general Estimate. I suggest that as we are voting considerable additional sums of money, it is legitimate to direct the Minister's attention to a point of view which I think calls for explanation.  I get the impression that there is a tendency in the Army to draw away from relatively rural centres and to concentrate their personnel in urban centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Army was stationed in a relatively small post, their presence made a very substantial contribution to the economy of the area.  Money of the kind voted here for payment to the Army personnel did fructify in increased trade and business to a disproportionate degree where the Army was located in a relatively small centre of population.  As the Army is drawn into larger centres of population, such as our cities, the contribution to the economy is <Col N="1290" /> relatively unimportant to these centres.

There are very fine buildings there.  In the past few years, a great deal of public money was spent on them.  Actually, a new church was erected there for the Army post.  That may be an isolated case&mdash; I do not know.  It seems to me that if we are voting large sums of money which would produce very substantial benefit if they were paid to Army posts in relatively small centres of population, it is a mistake to pursue a policy of drawing the Army into large centres of population.</P>
      <P>It would be better from an economic point of view and for the morale of the area that the Army should be kept more in touch with the people as a whole by the occupation of semi-rural barracks, although the barracks at Clonmel is not a rural barracks. Clonmel is a city with a Charter. However, it is a smaller city than Limerick.  I do not know if that has happened in other centres in the country.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of making a comment on the conditions of the ordinary rank and file of the Army.  In doing so, I should like to say that I make this observation out of no disrespect whatever for the Irish language. We on this side of the House believe in the Irish language.  We further express the hope that eventually, not through compulsion but through proper methods of voluntary teaching, and so on, the Irish language will be the spoken language of our people.</P>
      <P>I want to say that, in so far as the Army is concerned, it is being used as the dumping-ground for the Irish language.  The ordinary soldier in the Army is expected to respond to orders in Irish.  He is expected to click his heels on orders in Irish.  He is expected to carry out his route marches and he is expected to perform every act and duty through the medium of Irish. The Minister has certainly left nothing undone to stuff Irish down the necks of the young men in our Defence Forces.  I feel that if he were to devote the energies he is devoting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Instead of doing that, the Minister has devoted most of his energies towards trying to stuff Irish down their necks.  I want to forewarn the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak but, having heard Deputy O.J. Flanagan, I have some comment to make on this Estimate.  This is an Estimate in relation to the pay of the Army.  The pay of the Army is graded according to rank.  I think it would be well that young men joining the Army should know that when they go into the ranks, they will never come out of them.  They can never be anything but non-commissioned officers, unless they belong to the new Brahmin class.</P>
      <P>We used to condemn the British years ago for their methods and for their old school tie attitude.  It used to be held up that they recruited an army in India of the natives, as they called them, who could never attain commissioned rank.  Now we are creating a low-caste native here in Ireland. The English-speaking Irish boy who joins the Army has no chance of promotion to commissioned rank, according to the answer the Minister gave me last week.  I think that should be remedied because we were always led to believe that it is not for academic qualifications that men were promoted.  It was because they looked the type that would make better soldiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy O.J. Flanagan that the Minister is carrying his policy too far.  Any Irishman who joins the Army, whether he speaks English or Irish, or both, should have an equal opportunity of promotion.  I do not want words put into my mouth. <Col N="1293" /> What I am saying is this.  I was told by the Minister last week that nobody can be promoted unless he gets a cadetship and to obtain a cadetship, he has to be proficient in the Irish language. I do not think that is right, but as the Minister considers it is right, then I consider that the Minister should recruit only from people who are proficient in the language.  I shall have more to say on this when the Minister brings in his Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the points made did not refer, I think, to the Supplementary Estimate.  With regard to these increases, of course they have no connection whatever with the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The last round of wage increases was not, generally speaking, related to the cost of living at all and the decision to grant increases to the different branches of the State service was consequent upon the last round of wage increases.  With regard to Deputy Dillon's question as to whether there was a change of policy or not with regard to the location of the Army, there is no such change of policy.</P>
      <P>There was a reorganisation of the Army involving the integration of the F.C.A.  This did involve certain changes but the general effect of any changes will not in any way diminish the numbers stationed in provincial centres.  In fact, the over-all effect is that there will be more members of the regular Army now out with the F.C.A.  Therefore, there will be an over-all increase in the numbers stationed in provincial centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regard cities like Cork and Limerick as provincial centres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not.  I am thinking of rural centres.  With regard to the particular case of Clonmel, the new scheme of organisation involved a reduction in the total number of regular battalions.  One of the main reasons for that was that these battalions had never been fully up to strength.  Therefore there was no longer a battalion stationed in Clonmel but <Col N="1294" /> there is an equivalent number of personnel stationed in Clonmel.  The battalion headquarters was changed to Limerick but there are two companies stationed in Clonmel of comparable strength with those there previously.</P>
      <P>The only other point raised was the attack on the continuation of the policy of all Governments of trying to expand the use of the Irish language.  I know that certain Deputies have been preparing themselves to launch an attack on that policy but I have no apologies to make for it.  Nobody suffers any hardship whatever due to my attempts to bring the policy that has been pursued in this State over the years to some kind of fruition with regard to the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>There is no difficulty whatever in recruits or soldiers understanding the ordinary military commands spoken in the Irish language.  It is just as easy to understand them in Irish as in English.  I am very glad to say that no difficulty whatever has been found in that respect.  There is a certain amount of success already to be seen with regard to that attempt.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of cadetships, Irish has always been an essential subject for cadetships.  I do not take any credit whatever for introducing that.  That has always been the position.  It may be that the system which Deputy T. Lynch proposes of direct promotion from the ranks might be a better one but the military people have never thought that and it has never been the position. There was a certain amount both prior to and since the Emergency.  Appointments to commissioned rank have always been made as a result of competitions for cadetships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain standard of education is laid down there.  That standard is thought to be necessary by the military authorities in order that the cadet may learn the different military subjects and qualify to become a commissioned officer.  So far from their being a bar on non-commissioned officers or private soldiers obtaining cadetships, a certain number of vacancies each year is reserved for serving members of the Defence Forces but they must also reach the same standard of education <Col N="1295" /> as applicants from outside.  There is no innovation whatever in that regard.</P>
    <P>In regard to the promotion of the Irish language within the Defence Forces, I think it is about time that some use was made of the amount of Irish that has been taught in the schools since the foundation of the State up to now.  The position at present is that the vast majority of the officers in the Army are men who acquired a competent knowledge of Irish at school.  They have found no difficulty in carrying out their duties through the medium of Irish but a knowledge of Irish, or competency in Irish, is not an essential qualification for promotion.  It has been found possible to give all instruction in the Military College through the medium of Irish.  Nobody has experienced any difficulty in that respect.  That, of course, is because it is the more junior officers, generally speaking, who are undergoing courses there, but I am absolutely satisfied that, while the attempt that is being made to expand the use of Irish in the Defence Forces is meeting with some success and therefore is going some way towards putting the policy of the State into operation, there is no injustice being done to any person in the Army on account of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

      <P>Surely it is rather odd that while, as the Minister now tells us, all instructions in the Military College are to be given through the medium of Irish, Irish is not the vernacular of a great many of the students in the College?  Does he seriously suggest that the entire course of the Military College can be given, to best advantage, to a body of young <Col N="1296" /> officers, the vast majority of whom may know the Irish language but for whom it is not their vernacular?  Does the Minister really think that is consistent with good Army administration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £587,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for Old Age Pensions and Pensions to Blind Persons, Children's Allowances, Unemployment Assistance, Widows' and Orphans' Non-Contributory Pensions, and for Sundry Miscellaneous Social Welfare Services, including Grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy) Michael Joseph Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for this Supplementary Estimate arises from the Social Welfare Act, 1959, which increased Old Age and Blind Pensions Widows' Non-contributory Pensions and certain rates of Unemployment Assistance by 2/6d. a week from the first week in August, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As shown in the Supplementary Estimate, the additional sum required for Old Age Pensions&mdash;Subhead A&mdash; is £585,000.  It was originally estimated that the increase in old age pension rates would cost £694,500 in the current year.  Now it is estimated that the cost will be rather less, namely, about £585,000.  Owing to the numbers of pensions in payment during the year being less than anticipated there will be an estimated saving of £100,000 on the original provision of £10,400,000 for Old Age Pensions, with the result that an additional sum <Col N="1297" /> of £585,000 will suffice to meet the whole cost of this service for the year.</P>
    <P>Similarly, on Subhead D&mdash;Widows' and Orphans' Non-contributory Pensions&mdash;the additional sum required to be voted is less than the cost of the increases as originally estimated.  It was originally estimated that the cost would be £108,500.  The present estimate of the extra cost is slightly lower, at £106,000.  In addition to this small reduction it is expected that there will be a saving of £26,000 on the original provision of £1,627,000 under Subhead D, owing to the numbers of pensions in payment during the year being slightly less than was anticipated. Accordingly, an additional sum of £80,000 will meet the current year's requirements for Widows' and Orphans' non-contributory Pensions.</P>
    <P>On Subhead G. there is provision for an additional sum of £4,300 for Welfare of the Blind.  The authorities of the approved institutions for the blind have been pressing for some time for increased assistance on the ground that the increased cost of maintaining blind inmates had caused considerable financial difficulties for the institutions.  After full consideration it was decided to increase the amount of the State capitation grants payable to the institutions and to ask the local authorities to increase their contributions also.  I am glad to say that the local authorities responded and agreed to increase their contributions from the 1st April, 1959.  With the approval of the Minister for Finance the State grants have been increased as from the same date.  The additional cost to the Exchequer for the increase in the State Grants amounted to £2,200.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,320 was also paid to an Institution, which closed down in December, 1957, in respect of grants due for the year 1957.  The claim for these grants was not ready for payment until certain legal formalities connected with the winding up of the institution had been completed.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the number of blind persons maintained in the other institutions and an extra £780 is needed to cover the consequential increase in the amount of grants payable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> The sum already voted for Welfare of the Blind is insufficient to meet these various additional requirements and I am, therefore, seeking a sum of £4,300, bringing the total cost of this service for the year to £18,800.</P>
    <P>The additional sums required, details of which I have given, come to a total of £669,300.  It is expected, however, that savings will arise on other Subheads of the Vote, mainly on Subhead B&mdash;Children's Allowances &mdash;and Subhead C&mdash;Unemployment Assistance.  These savings are estimated to come to about £82,300, and accordingly the net additional amount required to be voted is £587,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is still another Supplementary Estimate which we feel the House should pass.  It is vital that those classes in the community who are dependent on the State to maintain the level of life that means all the difference between destitution and a reasonable standard should be cushioned against the increase in the cost of living.  Consequently, we welcome any measure that will protect those people from a worsening of their meagre standards.</P>
      <P>This is another Supplementary Estimate arising from the Government's policy of withdrawing the food subsidies in the Budget of 1957.  It was announced to the House and to the country that the expenses of the State would be reduced by the £5½ million that were being spent annually on the subsidisation of food.  When those subsidies were withdrawn, a feeble attempt was made to compensate the aged people for the impact of that withdrawal, but there is no evidence that any effort the State has made has cushioned them against the impact of the hardship of that withdrawal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day we were informed that there is an increase of £5½d. in the price of the 2 lb. loaf of bread, the article of diet which is most important to the classes catered for in this Estimate. That is only one of the items which has risen in price, due to the action of the Government.  Although we were presented with the picture of a strong Government capable of cutting State expenditure, we have had a whole <Col N="1299" /> series of increased Estimates and Supplementary Estimates in an effort to cushion the most deserving members of our community against the impact of the increase in the cost of living. However, despite all their efforts, the Government have failed to save the people from the result of their own extremely ill-advised action.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has indicated in figures that there has been a saving of £100,000 in the past 12 months on the amount originally estimated as necessary for the year's working.  This bears out the opinion of many of us that for several months past, there has been a much more stringent application of the means test since the Government decided to increase the old age pensions.  We all know of cases of widows who had to bear the increase in the cost of living and whose allowances have been suspended or withdrawn.  I know of several such cases and I can give them to the Parliamentary Secretary, should he require them.  These are cases in which old age pensions were arbitrarily suspended, pending further examination, and the net result was that they were either reduced or withdrawn. That is now proved by this saving of £100,000.</P>
    <P>Further on, the Parliamentary Secretary stated that it was necessary for the State to come to the assistance of the institutions looking after our aged people.  This should have been obvious to the Government when they decided to withdraw food subsidies.  It should have been obvious that these institutions could not possibly provide the aged people with the amount of food necessary to maintain them in reasonable health, once the food subsidies were withdrawn.  This is just another effect of the Government's action at that time.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a well deserved tribute to the work being done by many of these institutions.  It is a magnificent job of work and I do not know what so many of our people would have done, had it not been for the help given by the Nazareth Home, near Mallow.  It is regrettable that <Col N="1300" /> there are not more such institutions and it is also regrettable that they had to limit those seeking admission to the North Cork area.  The provision to give increased assistance is very desirable and it is only proper that this Estimate should be passed so as to give these people the amount necessary for them to live in frugal comfort and to enable these institutions to meet their increased running costs.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that on the day Deputy N. Lemass announced that there was a tremendous economic upsurge and that in respect of our housing requirements, we must look forward to increased family numbers, the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Welfare should indicate that the Estimate for children's allowances was over-estimated and that a saving had been effected.  In the Book of Estimates published to-day, there is a further reduction of £17,000 on the amount to be paid in children's allowances next year.  That is proof positive of the real state of affairs in this country.  It is a true statement of what is happening, not what Ministers say at dinners, meetings or what is published in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Due to emigration, we have had a saving in the amount paid out for children's allowances in the past 12 months and there is to be a still further saving in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This afternoon, I addressed a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to increases in the price of bread, with particular reference to the increase in the price of bread since March, 1957.  In the course of his reply, the Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increase in the price of bread in May, 1957, followed the removal of the subsidy on flour.  Bread prices were freed from control in August, 1957, and I am, therefore, not in a position to give the precise <Col N="1301" /> reasons for increases since then, but I understand they were due to increased costs of production.</P>
    <P>The policy of the inter-Party Government, which has been criticised severely by members of the Government, was one of keeping down the price of bread.  They realised that bread was the principal item of diet of the great majority of our people. No matter how the inter-Party Government may be criticised, it cannot be said that they deliberately increased the price of bread for the poor of this country.  When the Government took office in 1957, the price of the 2-lb. loaf was 9d.  Because of the deliberate policy of the Government, the price of that loaf is now 1/2½d., an increase of 5½d.  That is due to the deliberate policy of the Government in removing the subsidy on flour and bread.  We must bear in mind also that the price of every other commodity needed by the housewife and by the poor and the sick in order to keep body and soul together has also increased.  The price of butter was increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates entirely to the price of bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of the poor people of the country, widows, orphans, home assistance recipients and low wage earners, were compelled to use dry bread or bread and margarine.  Now they are faced with a continual increase in the price of bread.  I want to accuse the Government of deliberately allowing these increases to continue, increases which are imposing great hardship on the working class people and the middle-class wage-earners in our towns and cities, particularly those wage-earners with large families.  It also places an increased burden indirectly on the ratepayers because an increase in the price of bread means an increase in the costs of local authorities who have to purchase supplies for institutions and hospitals.  The resulting increase is passed on to the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that the price of bread has increased and that the price of flour has increased from 4/10 per <Col N="1302" /> stone to 7/6 per stone, there has been a reduction in the price the farmer gets for producing wheat.  Have the Government entirely forgotten the conditions of the working class people, the aged and the poor of the country, or are they living on the moon?  The vast majority of our people have to live entirely on bread They have not got vegetables and they cannot afford to buy meat Meat is a luxury in most of their homes Where you have large families of young children going out to school, it is customary for them to take bread with them So also in the case of forestry workers, road workers, mill workers, factory workers and those engaged in night shift work, bread is an essential part of their meals.</P>
    <P>Of all the increases we have had, such as that in regard to transport and so on, none has impacted so severely on the people as the increase in the price of bread.  I want to accuse the Government of deliberately freeing the price of bread from control in 1957. The price of bread was recently increased. What is to stop those responsible increasing the price next week or within the next three months when they have succeeded in getting away, with Government approval and support, with increasing the price of the 2-lb. loaf by 5½d.?  What is to stop them increasing it by 1/- if they wish, when the Government allow that state of affairs to exist?</P>
    <P>The Government should view the matter of bread prices with greater concern.  Why not have a public inquiry? If the increased price is due to increased costs of production, let the bakers or whoever are responsible make their case, so that the consumer will know exactly what items are responsible for the increase.  I view this matter with the greatest possible concern and I accuse the Government of deliberately neglecting to protect the majority of our people who depend on bread for their food.  Bread and flour have to be purchased by every household, rich and poor.  It shows great carelessness on the part of the Government that they did not have more regard for the masses of the people, who are put to the pin of their <Col N="1303" /> collars to eke out an existence without having to face an increase in the price of such an essential commodity as bread.  I protest most vigorously and determinedly against the Government's lack of concern for the poor.</P>
    <P>I want to hear from the Minister what the Government's future policy in relation to bread is to be.  Will they allow this position to continue? Was it a wise policy for the Government to free bread prices from control in 1957?  I think there should be control by someone over bread prices. No concern, no monopoly or nobody in authority should hold the people up to ransom in increasing the price of bread beyond their capacity to pay. Is it not merely an indirect method of starving the people out?  When they have not the money to pay for it, it means they have no alternative but to starve and do without it.  This is too important a matter to allow to pass without a protest from some part of the House.  It is the duty of the House to take the necessary steps to see that bread prices will not be allowed to increase at the whim of whoever is responsible, without justification for it being put forward before a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know from the Minister, in view of the fact that our people are not now in a position to pay for bread, does he propose to re-establish control over the price of bread or does he propose to make an Order whereby an increase in price will not be permitted, unless a sound case is put forward to justify such an increase by whoever is concerned? The general public are in the dark. They have been given no facts or figures in relation to the cost of production responsible for the increased price of 5½d. for the 2lb. loaf since 1957.  One of the main causes, however, was the removal of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>That was a mistaken policy, an ill-considered policy, which brought severe hardship to the poorer sections of our people.  It is a policy which we on this side of the House condemned, and a policy of which we are prepared to renew our condemnation <Col N="1304" /> today.  It put a severe burden on every section of our people, in particular on the old age pensioners, the widows, and all those in retirement, including civil servants.  It was a mistake and I believe that in the next general election, the Government will have brought home to them the folly of that mistake, particularly having regard to the fact that the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time made a misleading reference to bread prices.</P>
    <P>When the inter-Party Government were in office, Fianna Fáil were envious because the price of bread was kept down, but, during the last general election, a rumour went through the country that the inter-Party Government were about to increase the price of bread.  That was denied and at the same time, a guarantee and pledge was given to the people by the Leader of Fianna Fáil, when it was suggested that if there were a change of Government, one of his first actions would be to remove the food subsidies, with the result that bread would be one of the items that would suffer, that that would not happen.</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>You know the record of Fianna Fáil in the past.  You know that we have never done the things they said we would do.</P>
    <P>He was referring there to the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>They have told you that you would be paying more for your bread.  We did not cut them</P>
    <P>that is, the food subsidies&mdash;</P>
    <P>all out before because we did not want the price of bread&mdash;so important an article of diet for the poor&mdash;to be increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, speaking at Belmullet, Co. Mayo, on 1st March, 1957, and I am quoting from the <i>Irish Press.</i>  The Leader of Fianna Fáil was speaking on behalf of his Party, giving an honest pledge to the people that whatever else he might do, <Col N="1305" /> there would be no attempt to interfere with the price of bread, because, in his own words, it was &ldquo;so important an article of diet for the poor.&rdquo;  I ask the House to judge the sincerity of that statement now and to judge the sincerity of that Party which, having captured the votes of the gullible people of the country by undertakings of that kind, immediately proceeded to take bread out of the mouths of the poorer sections of the community.</P>
      <P>I want to ask Fianna Fáil and the Minister how they can reconcile their behaviour in regard to bread prices since 1957?  If this Government are to be judged by their conduct in relation to the price of bread alone, then there is a severe shock awaiting them.  Does the Minister now face up to the fact that his Party were dishonest in the last general election in pledging themselves never to increase the price of bread?  Let us hear from him why he did two things: why the food subsidies were removed and why he then proceeded to give away his right or authority in freeing bread prices from control?</P>
      <P>The price of bread has now put it out of the reach of many people and severe hardship has been imposed on large sections of our community who have to stay hungry for want of it. That is a sad commentary on 1960, and it is a sad state of affairs that the Minister should allow such a condition to develop.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister hold any hope that there will be no further increase in the price of bread and flour, and can the consuming public rest assured that, having laboured under the present burden of high bread prices, they will not face any further increase?  Will he now take steps to prevent any concern, or any monopoly in the bread, flour and baking industry from increasing the price further without showing that an increase is justified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to hear from the Minister what proposals were put forward to him by the parties seeking the increase.  Surely they did not take it upon themselves to increase the price of bread without consulting the Department of Industry and Commerce <Col N="1306" /> the principal Department of the State, and surely the Minister was given an opportunity of expressing his opinion on any such proposition?  I should like to know what reply he made to any such representations, and what objection he has to the setting up of a public inquiry at which the consuming public, the bakeries, the Department of Industry and Commerce and particularly the farmers, who are producing wheat at a loss, can give evidence.</P>
    <P>Lastly, is there not an apology due from the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party for the disgraceful manner in which the Irish people were so successfully gulled in relation to bread prices when a solemn undertaking and pledge was given to them in the last general election that there would be no question of increasing the price of bread?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In those few minutes, I should like to say that within the past hour, the Government have conceded the point made by Deputy O.J. Flanagan when two Ministers in succession came in with Supplementary Estimates to provide for institutions the increased money necessary for their running, due to the withdrawal of food subsidies.  It will cost more to run barracks for the Department of Defence and institutions for the old and sick, due to the increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>There are other indications also that the action which the Government took in 1957 has resulted in a substantial reduction in the consumption of bread. The price of bread had gone so far beyond the reach of the people that in my own constituency, a mill was closed down in Mallow and 40 men were put out of employment.  The head of the company said that, due to the increased price of bread, consumption had gone down so far that they could no longer keep those mills in operation.  In addition, we know of the efforts being made by the big millers throughout the country to squeeze out the small concerns because of the increased difficulty of securing a market for the flour processed in their mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> Further point has been given to our argument by the fact that, notwithstanding the reduction in the acreage of wheat this year, in the Book of Estimates supplied this morning there is evidence that it is also the opinion of the Government that there will be a further reduction in the production of wheat next year.  That will be in line with the contraction in the consumption of flour.  In the Government's attempt to make up to the people for what they did to them in the Budget of 1957 there was no equity or justice because people who eat meat three times a day got substantial increases in their incomes while many self-employed people and the poorer categories did not receive sufficient to guard them against the impact of the reduction in the subsidy on flour and bread.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The concern expressed by Deputy Flanagan and Deputy O'Sullivan for the people who consume bread is less than the concern they have now for the success of Fine Gael in the local elections and questions such as this are brought before the House, I have no doubt, with that end in view.</P>
      <P>The price of bread did increase as a result of the withdrawal of the subsidies. Subsidies were reduced following the first inter-Party Government and were almost completely withdrawn following the second inter-Party Government. On each occasion the reason was that the Exchequer was so committed by each of these Governments to the expenditure of money which to the knowledge of the outgoing Government was not available, that it was necessary, in order to keep the finances of the country in order, to provide the necessary moneys for such purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the inter-Party Government had been returned on either of these two occasions, May, 1951, or March, 1957, they would have found themselves, as a result of their deliberate policy of over-spending, without the necessary financial provisions to meet that overspending, in such a position as to have to seek the money necessary to <Col N="1308" /> carry on the work of the State from some quarter, if they did not reduce the subsidies, at least by some form of extra taxation.  I do not think anyone can doubt that.</P>
    <P>Secondly, may I ask why, since the same cry was made after the reduction of the subsidies in 1952, when the inter-Party Government returned to power in 1953 they did not then reintroduce the full subsidy as it obtained when they left office?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is an answer to it I should like to hear it.  It has been a long time coming.  On the abolition of the subsidies, let me say that nobody ever envisaged the food subsidies as a permanent measure in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the abolition of the subsidies, price control on bread was, in fact, freed.  Since then prices have been dictated mainly by the cost of wheat and largely as a result of competition between bakers.  I do not think anybody can suggest that there is not competition between bakers in this country.  The facilities available to me now for the fixing of a minimum price for bread are under the Prices Act, 1958 and in the case of flour it would be necessary to form a committee under that Act to examine the cost of production.  In the case of bread it is not statutorily imposed on me to do so but it would be necessary to have such an inquiry.</P>
      <P>My predecessor stated, when control was freed, that if it appeared to him necessary at any time, having regard to the fair cost of production and existing price of bread, to reimpose control, he would not hesitate to do so.  I am satisfied that there is in the bakery trade a reasonable degree of competition and that to impose a maximum price now would in effect make that maximum price a minimum price and would not leave room for that competition which at present operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> There is in Dublin alone&mdash;if Deputies care to inquire&mdash;a varied range of prices of bread.  Different bakers charge different prices, which indicates that there is that degree of competition prevailing at the present time. If bread prices increase to the extent that I feel it will be unfair to the public, from the point of view of cost of production, I certainly will not hesitate to take action under the Prices Act, 1958 to ensure that the public will be protected from any unfair price maintenance or lack of competition.  As I said, I am satisfied that there is such competition at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan said in a very general way that the cost of everything has gone up.  The fact is that the cost of living has been maintained stable for the past 15 or 12 months and if the Deputy will consult the consumer price index as available during the whole of 1959 he will see that in the June-March quarter 1959 the index was 147, taking mid-August, 1947 as base 100.  It was maintained in the April-June quarter; reduced to 144&mdash;by three points&mdash;in the July-September quarter and still maintained at that level in the October-December quarter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, on the other hand, started to plead for the farmers as well.  He knows as well as I do that the price is related to the <Col N="1310" /> price paid to farmers for wheat.  In the White Paper there is, in the interests of the farmer, a certain minimum target of millable wheat which the millers are required to take for the production of flour.  Is the Deputy suggesting that the price of wheat to the farmer should be further reduced in order to reduce the price of bread? I doubt if he is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If the price of wheat is increased, as the Deputy suggests, it will, in present circumstances, inevitably result in an increase in the price of bread.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the increase before the present one, the increase which took place last autumn.  As a result of the poor yield of wheat in this country in 1958, it was necessary to import large quantities of foreign wheat, which is cheaper than native produced wheat.  As a result of the use of that wheat for flour milling purposes it was possible to reduce the price of bread.  As a result of the bumper harvest, it was necessary, in 1959, to restore the price of bread to that which obtained in the previous year.  Therefore, it is not fair to suggest that only increases take place. When it was possible, a decrease in the price of bread and flour was effected. The recent increase of a farthing has been, to my knowledge, attributed to the increase in the price of wages granted to bakery workers.  The increase in the 2-lb. batch loaf is a farthing.  I have been given to understand that even that farthing does not take into account fully the increased wages that have been given to bakery workers recently.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat that if it appears to me that there is not reasonable competition&mdash;and I am satisfied that there is&mdash;in the price of bread, I shall not hesitate to use the powers that are given to me under the Prices Act, 1958.</P>
