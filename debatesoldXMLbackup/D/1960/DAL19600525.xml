      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  A person who consumes, or permits the consumption of, intoxicating liquor during prohibited hours in a refreshment house which is not a licensed premises shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to the fine to which he would have been liable if the conviction had been in relation to premises which, at the time of the commission of the offence, were licensed premises.</P>
      <P>(2)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;refreshment house&rsquo; means premises, or any portion thereof, deemed for the purposes of the Refreshment Houses (Ireland) Act, 1860, to be a refreshment house;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;licensed premises&rsquo; and &lsquo;prohibited hours&rsquo; have the meanings they have in the Act of 1927.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the earlier debates, some Deputies&mdash;I think Deputy Sherwin, in particular&mdash;referred to the illegal sale of drink in certain late-night restaurants and cafés.  It has come to my notice that detection of this illegality can be very difficult in certain cases.  Where a wine licence is held&mdash; or, of course, a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor generally&mdash;no special difficulty arises, since it is sufficient to prove the consumption of drink after hours on the premises <Col N="145" /> Where, however, there is no licence at all for the sale of intoxicating liquor, there is a difficulty because in those cases, owing to what I can only describe as a loophole in the law, it is not sufficient to prove the consumption of drink on the premises after hours; the sale of the drink has to be proved and, needless to say, this can be extremely difficult.  Patrons can be told to say, if found consuming liquor on the premises, that it was not sold by the proprietor but was brought in by the patrons themselves.  Obviously the Garda would seldom be in a position to contradict that statement and the result is that a café or restaurant might carry on a shebeen trade with little danger of detection.</P>
    <P>The amendment that I propose would make the after-hours consumption of intoxicating liquor in a refreshment House an offence.  I ask the House to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Act of 1927 is hereby amended by the insertion after section 12 of the following section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;12A.  (1) Where on application to a Justice of the District Court in relation to premises to which <Col N="146" /> an on-licence is attached or on the occasion of an application for a new on-licence, the applicant requests the Court to certify that any portion of the premises to which the application relates is a restaurant for the purposes of section 13 of this Act, the Court, if satisfied, in relation to that portion of the premises, after hearing the officer in charge of the Garda Síochána for the licensing area that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it is structurally adapted for use and <i>bona fide</i> and mainly used as a restaurant, refreshment house or other place for supplying substantial meals to the public,</P>
    <P>(b)  it does not include a public bar or part of a room in another part of which there is a public bar, and</P>
    <P>(c)  there is public access to it otherwise than through a public bar,</P>
    <P>shall grant to the applicant a certificate (in this section referred to as a limited restaurant certificate) certifying that that portion of the premises is a restaurant for the purposes of section 13 of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Court shall not entertain an application for a limited restaurant certificate unless and until satisfied that not less than ten days before the date on which the application is proposed to be made notice in writing of the intention to make the application was given to the officer in charge of the Garda Síochána for the licensing area.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every limited restaurant certificate shall unless sooner revoked under this section remain in force until the next annual licensing district court for the licensing area.</P>
    <P>(4)  A Justice of the District Court may, on the application of the officer in charge of the Garda Síochána for the licensing area, at any time revoke a limited restaurant certificate if he is satisfied, after hearing the officer and the holder of the certificate, that the portion of the premises to which <Col N="147" /> the certificate relates has ceased to be structurally adapted for use or to be <i>bona fide</i> or mainly used as a restaurant, refreshment house or other place for the supplying of substantial meals to the public or that it includes a public bar or part of a room in another part of which there is a public bar or that there is no public access to it otherwise than through a public bar.</P>
    <P>(5)  Every holder of a limited restaurant certificate shall cause the certificate to be displayed prominently in the portion of the premises to which the certificate relates.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where, in relation to any portion of a licensed premises, a limited restaurant certificate is in force&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the portion of the premises to which the certificate relates shall be deemed, for the purposes of section 13 of this Act, but not otherwise, to be premises which are for the time being a restaurant, and</P>
    <P>(b)  subsection (1) of section 17 of this Act shall be construed and have effect in relation to a person who is found on those premises at a time specified in the said section 13 at which the consumption of intoxicating liquor is permitted with a meal as if references therein (other than the reference in paragraph (b)) to a licensed premises were references to a public bar in licensed premises.</P>
    <P>(7)  In this section &ldquo;public bar&rdquo; includes any place exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes to make what I think is a fairly important modification of the law.  Under the existing law, hotels and certified restaurants have the right to serve drinks with meals during certain periods outside the ordinary licensing hours.  The Bill modifies the law in extending these hours up to midnight on weekdays and up to 10 p.m. on Sunday nights.  A premises could be certified as a restaurant, however, only <Col N="148" /> if the Court were satisfied that it was structurally adapted and mainly used as a restaurant.  A licensed premises could, therefore, have a fairly extensive restaurant business, quite distinct from a public house business in some other room or rooms, and yet be able to secure a restaurant certificate because it could not be said that the restaurant business was the main business.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage, some Deputies raised the question whether these facilities could not be extended to public houses which in the normal course of their trade serve substantial meals.  I considered this matter carefully and came to the conclusion that, while it would be leaving the way open to evasion of the law to allow drink to be served with a meal at a bar counter outside the ordinary public house hours, it was desirable to allow these facilities to publicans who could set aside a part of their premises as a restaurant.  This is a desirable change in the law, and one which will encourage the tendency which has shown itself in recent years in many good class public houses to supply meals at reasonable prices to the benefit of everybody.</P>
    <P>I am conscious, of course, of the fact that we are dealing with premises which are primarily public houses, and for that reason I think it essential to insist on certain safeguards.  First, the portion of the premises to be certified as restaurant must be distinct from the public bar&mdash;it must be in a separate room or rooms and it will not be sufficient to put tables in part of the lounge bar and call that the restaurant.  Secondly, there must be access to it otherwise than through the public bar.  This does not mean that there may not also be an entrance to it from the bar, but merely that people may be in a position to enter and leave the restaurant without passing through the bar.  Thirdly, during the additional hours in which drink may be served with meals, the public bar will be shut down.  Finally, the privilege allowed to it will be confined to the serving of drink with meals during the additional hours specified in Section 5 of the Bill; in other words, <Col N="149" /> patrons may not be in a public house with a limited certificate at all after midnight on a week day and after 10 p.m. on Sundays, just as they may not be in the ordinary public house after the ordinary drinking hours, that is, 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. on week days and 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. on Sundays.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, in an ordinary licensed restaurant and in a hotel, under the law as it stands and as it will be under the Bill, a person may be on the premises at any hour of the night without committing an offence against the licensing code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The apparent purpose of this amendment is to give in some way compensation to those traders whose livelihood has been jeopardised by the extension of drinking hours in the urban areas to 11.30 p.m.&mdash;an extension which is not wanted in the city by either the trade or the assistants, and in so far as there is any evidence available, there is no large-scale demand for it either.  The position is that under the proposed change in the law the same opening hours will now be operative for city and country.  As I understand it, the trade themselves do not want the amendment which the Minister has introduced.  It is true that the amendment is permissive but what is involved in the amendment is that people will have to reconstruct their premises and make structural alterations. If they make structural alterations, they will very likely find themselves subject to an increase in valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It places the obligation on a person who wants a drink of having a meal with it.  It follows therefore that for the future if a person wants to have a drink outside the normal trading hours, if, say, a man wants a pint, he has to have a meal with it.  It is obvious that the interpretation of &ldquo;a substantial meal&rdquo; will involve very difficult problems.  It has, I think, been held that in certain circumstances a sandwich could be described as a substantial meal.  In, say, warm weather, would a plate of salad be a substantial meal?  If traders are to make these changes and structural <Col N="150" /> alterations in their premises, will they be provided with the grants which are available from Bord Fáilte to hoteliers who modernise and improve their premises?  As I understand the views of the trade in this matter, there is no demand for it.  Their businesses will be jeopardised considerably by the extension of the opening hours in the city which, as I say, the trade do not want and which will involve the same opening hours in city and country.</P>
    <P>Many of these people, as the Minister said, have over the years improved their premises very considerably.  They have spent large sums of money modernising them and providing proper facilities so that people can drink in suitable surroundings and under hygienic conditions.  It is only right to say that not only have they provided improved accommodation and amenities but also that these premises are, in the main, well run and properly supervised.  They are properly supervised because the traders are anxious to continue in business and to ensure that no action of theirs will lead to criticism of the manner in which they conduct their businesses. They are, as I say, anxious to avoid conflict with the law.  There is, in fact, far greater supervision of the way in which they carry on their premises than there is of the manner in which drink is served at dances up to very late hours.  Therefore, so far as the traders are concerned, particularly those who up to this have enjoyed <i>bona fide</i> rights, their premises are generally well conducted.</P>
    <P>The view of these traders is that this proposed amendment is no substitute for the rights they have at present and which are being swept away by this Bill.  Many of these businesses are well established family businesses. A number of them have been trading for not one generation, but in some cases, two and three, and all of them have enjoyed the right to trade under the existing opening hours for at least 18 years, while some of them go back 30, 40, 50 years and maybe longer. The position is that under the Bill the trading hours will be altered considerably. As far as they are concerned, <Col N="151" /> the trading hours will be brought back to 11.30 p.m. in the summer and 11 p.m. in the winter&mdash;half an hour less in summer and an hour less in winter. The trading hours in the city will be extended from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. in the winter and to 11.30 p.m. in the summer.  These people feel they are entitled to compensation for loss of business and for interference with their trade.  They feel that this proposed amendment will be no substitute for the business taken from them.</P>
    <P>It is certain that if such persons reconstruct their premises to meet the requirements of this section, the premises will be revalued and the valuation increased.  So far as I know they will not qualify for the grants which Bord Fáilte gives to hoteliers who modernise their premises, though they will be expected to provide the same standard of service as an hotel or restaurant in respect of meals.  Many of these houses provide first-class food under good conditions, serving quick meals at the counter for those who require them, but now they will have to construct a separate compartment or room, and divide it off from the public house portion of their premises. If a man wants a pint, he will have to buy a meal and I believe the problem of enforcing the law will be just as difficult in this matter as it has been in other cases in the past.</P>
    <P>Assuming the restaurant portion of the bar is open for trade and a person comes in for a drink and there is a plate of sandwiches on a table with a number of people sitting around, how is a Guard to prove that that man taking a pint is not also having a meal?  Has he to have a set place in front of him and will he be obliged to prove to the satisfaction of the Guard that he is having a meal?  I believe this modification is not wanted by the trade and is no substitution whatsoever for the very substantial drop in business which will result from the longer opening hours in the city&mdash; which are not wanted by any section &mdash;and the curtailment of the hours in areas adjacent to the city.  That is an effort to make uniform by legislation a pattern of life which cannot be made <Col N="152" /> uniform in that way.  The mode of living in the cities and in the country is entirely different and to try and legislate to make it the same is refusing to face the facts.</P>
    <P>I feel this amendment is no improvement. In fact it is not wanted by the trade and, even though it is permissive for those who might adopt its provisions at considerable expense, those who have already gone to the expense of improving their premises, equipping them and providing proper facilities and amenities, now find their businesses will be seriously interfered with, and they feel they are entitled to compensation for the business that will be taken from them.  While this proposal may appear to be an effort to meet their needs, to meet the just claims which they have, in fact the very contrary may well be the case and I would again ask the Minister to consider the claim which they have for some measure of compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke of this with particular reference to Dublin and the problems that arise in Dublin as a result of other aspects of this Bill, but I take it that the amendment is intended to apply to the whole country.  Applying as it does to the whole country, there are one or two points raised by Deputy Cosgrave on which I should like to get some information.  There are a number of cases throughout the country in which six-day licensees run small restaurants in part of their establishments and with the possibility, even at considerable cost, of changing over to seven-day licences, they would be anxious to develop their restaurant businesses in order to extend their general trade.  I think this amendment would be of assistance to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with that, and on the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave, I <Col N="153" /> should like to ask the Minister whether facilities for improving their premises will be available to them under some of the arrangements in relation to the tourist development machinery because, hit as they will be if the Minister does not change the proposal he has put to the House of fining them £200 for changing over to seven-day licences, they might have difficulties in facing up to the expenditure necessary to improve the restaurant side of their businesses.  I feel that if facilities for loans and grants in relation to the extension of their businesses on the restaurant side were available, it might help some of them to make their businesses more secure, by giving them some kind of offset as against the expense of throwing themselves into seven-day licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In putting down this amendment, I think the Minister appreciates very much the development that has occurred in the licensed trade since the last Intoxicating Liquor Bill was introduced but I do not think the amendment will create the position the Minister obviously would like to see.  Being a person who is interested in the trade, for the life of me, I cannot see how any public house or bar in this city which intended to cater for the public by way of meals could, within reason, carry out structural alterations to suit the requirements set out in the amendment.  Where the Minister suggests that separate dining rooms should be provided, apart from the bar, I think that the difficulty could be got over by installing roller shutters to close off the bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of places now providing meals in licensed premises are doing it in the lounges.  If the Minister's amendment is approved and some licensee would like to avail of its provisions, he would have to construct a completely separate entrance to his premises and the Minister, knowing the city of Dublin as well as anybody else in this House, must realise that these premises have not got the room or accommodation to do so.  In many cases, if extra entrances had to be provided, it would mean that structural alterations would have to be carried out on the ground floor <Col N="154" /> because the bulk of the catering trade is carried on on the second floor.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that the licensed trade in this country is 25 or 30 years behind the licensed trade in Britain.  Everybody in this House has heard the advice often given by friends living in London and other cities in England that when they go there, they should have bar lunches, because they are cheaper, quicker, and so forth.  That trend is developing in this country, whether we like it or not, and I believe the Minister for Justice appreciates that fact because he has brought in this amendment to deal with it.  However, I do not think it will enable licensees to carry out economically the structural alterations required.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Cosgrave, I should like to know if it will be possible for Bord Fáilte to make grants available to people in the licensed trade who wanted to cater for the public and develop tourism, in the same way as grants are made available to hoteliers, large and small.</P>
    <P>The principle of the amendment is sound but I realise that there are too many difficulties in the way of its effective operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment in principle, as it may have the effect of helping a number of my constituents who are in the licensed trade.  Nevertheless, it will be very expensive on any publican to open a restaurant.  If there were a large lounge in a public house, could the publican apply to have portion of that lounge licensed on the basis that he is partitioning the lounge for the purpose of using portion of it as a restaurant, to which there would be a separate entrance? While I agree with and welcome the amendment in principle, I do feel that a number of publicans would find it hard to meet the expense of carrying on a restaurant.  I am referring to people in county Dublin whose sole livelihood has been the <i>bona fide</i> trade. Whether we like it or not, that problem is there.  It was there before our time.  I know that the amendment <Col N="155" /> will go a long way to meet that problem. I do not want to labour the matter but I am talking from my experience in county Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully realise that in the case of people who were depending on the <i>bona fide</i> trade their business started from 10 o'clock.  Now there is uniformity and city publicans will have the same hours and I feel that the <i>bona fide</i> trade will disappear completely in a number of areas.</P>
      <P>The amendment would have been wonderful, if there were not so many restrictions.  The type of people I have in mind will find it very expensive to take advantage of it.  There are not as many hotels in the county as there are in the city.  In London, one can go into a public bar and have dinner or tea. That has been the custom.  The same applies to other countries.  The Minister should reconsider this matter.  It would be impracticable to clear one section of a public house and reopen after 11.30 p.m.  There must be some room specially provided for the serving of meals.  It would not be practicable for the licensee to say to people on the premises that they must leave at 11 o'clock because a restaurant is to be opened in that portion of the premises. There should be some other way out of it without involving too much expense for the people I have in mind.</P>
      <P>I know that the amendment is intended to apply to the whole country and I would say good luck to anybody who is sufficiently enterprising to take advantage of it but the people I am trying to defend and seeking some way to help will find it very expensive.</P>
      <P>In principle, the amendment is definitely a good amendment, but there are too many restrictions embodied in it and too much expense involved in carrying out structural alterations.  For the moment, I shall say no more about it.</P>

If the Minister were to meet the people I have in mind in that way, it would be of great assistance to them and I am sure they would be able to rise to the occasion and get an alternative entrance to that part of the premises. If they have to build and carry out structural alterations, it will involve great expense.  It is problematical if they would make a profit on the serving of food.  Unless there is constant demand, it would not be profitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify one point for me, that is, in relation to the proviso in subparagraph (c).  I take it that when it says that there is to be public access to it otherwise than through a public bar, it means the actual bar portion of the premises and not the public bar licensed portion?  The difference is this: if you have a hallway into which you go, you turn to the right to the bar proper; you turn to the left to the room that is to be used under this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to keep them both on the same floor for a particular reason.  You turn to the left to the restaurant&mdash;that is in a separate room&mdash;you have the bar on the right hand but the middle hallway is licensed also.  I want it to be perfectly clear that it is licensed also and it is not an offence, for example, to carry your bottle of stout out of the public bar and drink it in the hallway.  I want to be quite clear that the mere fact that that is so does not debar a person from taking advantage of this phrase.</P>
      <P>I should also like some further clarification of another point.  The term &ldquo;public bar&rdquo;, so far as I know, appears only in the licensing Acts in respect of the actual counter which is excluded by the hotels section of the 1906 Act.  Is it clear that in relation to this Bill now, and therefore in relation to this amendment, the term &ldquo;public bar&rdquo; means every place other than a restaurant in which&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I know about subsection (7) of the amendment but again I am not clear on it&mdash;not merely consumed, <Col N="158" /> but dispensed.  I can see that if the phrase were also &ldquo;public bar&rdquo;&mdash; and I think subsection (7) would perhaps cover it&mdash;if it is to include as well that you must have access other than to the dispense bar, it may cause even further difficulties.  I should like the Minister to clarify that point in relation to what I have given as an example, the hallway.</P>
      <P>Secondly, does it mean only the part in which the drink is actually consumed, as apart from the portion in. which it may be dispensed?  I take it also the intention is that in this restaurant the licensee will have the right to go into the public bar portion of the premises for the purpose of getting there drink which he wants to bring in to serve in the restaurant.  I do not think that is very clear. Obviously, it is not intended, I imagine that a restaurant proprietor who wants to take advantage of this section should be forced, so to speak, to carry two stocks in two different places.  That is not as it should be.  I am not clear as to how this section which is being inserted now will work out in practice and for those reasons I should welcome further clarification from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>My worst fears have been realised.  I was not happy about bringing in this amendment because I felt that it might be construed as the re-establishment of the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  I want to state categorically that so far as I am concerned it has no relationship to the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  It is not making any effort to re-establish it or to provide the facilities which <i>bona fide</i> customers had in the past.  I had representations from sections of the licensed trade, from <i>bona fide</i> traders, from Deputy Cosgrave's side of the House and from this side of the House, to bring in an amendment of this particular type and I must say I was very doubtful as to the wisdom of it. But I realised that hotels and restaurants as at present established have been carrying on this type of business for very many years and that none of the abuses suggested in the course of the discussion have been known to occur.  I feel certain, because of the manner in which this amendment is framed, that they will not occur in the <Col N="159" /> future, that the supervision will be such that there will be no illegalities involving abuses of this concession.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Sweetman will look at subsection (7) of the proposed section, I think he will find that the bar is defined and that there will be no difficulty about it&mdash;&ldquo;In this section, &lsquo;public bar&rsquo; includes any place exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The clearest way I can put it is this: at the precise closing hour, the licensed premises closes down and no drink may be consumed on that portion of the premises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever drink people may have at that particular moment, even in their hands, they must leave the premises and if they want to have the benefit of the amendment, that is, by proceeding from the public bar to the restaurant portion, they can do so only without carrying their drinks with them as the Deputy suggests.  The drink must be purchased in the restaurant portion after having ordered a substantial meal.  I am not going into the question of what is a substantial meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the point about structural alterations is concerned, I cannot answer the question by Deputy Mulcahy and other Deputies in regard to whether Bord Fáilte would or would not provide a grant.  I rather imagine that if the matter were put to them, they would be quite prepared to consider it because they are interested in this from the point <Col N="160" /> of view put forward here from time to time in this debate, that many tourists coming here do not quite understand why they cannot continue to have drinks up to, say, midnight.  This is an effort now to make that provision in such a way that it will not be abused.</P>
    <P>I received a letter recently from the County Dublin Licensees' Association extending their congratulations to me on this amendment of the law.  The only suggestion they had to make was that it should not operate in respect of new boroughs.  I could not accept that suggestion because this Bill is being brought in on the understanding that whatever we have in it will apply uniformly to the whole State.  To accept that it should be provided to facilitate the county Dublin publicans, or some other set of publicans, would be to suggest that it is for the purpose of compensating in some form or another the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  That is not its purpose.  As I said, the purpose of the amendment is to meet the requests that have been made generally from people interested in this matter, including Bord Fáilte.  This amendment will do that and I am satisfied there will not be any abuse of its provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that. It would be a question for the Valuation Office.  I rather imagine if the reconstruction or extension were of such a character as to necessitate revaluation, they would have to face up to that fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one question if the premises are extended, but assuming that the bar is a single room and the owner runs a partition through it without increasing the floor space or the floor area, would that involve him in revaluation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that from the purely technical point of view. Many representations were made to me in respect of this matter by people who had been carrying on this type of <Col N="161" /> business and who were fully equipped and furnished to adapt their business. The Bill, as it was, ruled that type of business out after a certain hour, and there were many of those people depending on it who would be hit.  The amendment goes further than meeting their requirements to the extent that now any person in any part of the State who wishes to avail of the facilities provided in this amendment can adapt his premises to meet the requirements. I rather imagine that will be done in many seaside resorts throughout the country.  That type of public house will, I think, be adapted, but I doubt very much if many licensees other than that type of person will bother their heads about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 25, to delete &ldquo;subsection&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;subsections&rdquo; and to add to the section the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(11) An exemption order granted under the provisions of this section in respect of the Dublin Metropolitan District shall not be in respect of any hour prior to half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and it shall be a condition to the granting of each such order that the holder thereof, while such holder, shall cease trading at such earlier hour as bears in relation to the statutory closing hour the same differential as the earlier opening hour provided for in the exemption order bears to the normal opening hours of licensed premises in the same district.</P>
      <P>(12) The provisions of subsection (11) shall not apply in respect of exemption orders granted in respect of any public market or fair.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with exemption <Col N="162" /> orders for the opening of licensed premises in certain specified areas and suggests that where the licensed premises get permission from the courts to open at 7.30 a.m. or 8 a.m., the premises should be closed at a corresponding hour in the evening.  The ordinary publichouse at the moment can remain open for 13 hours: 12 trading hours and the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo;, as we call it.  Any of these traders who elect to apply to the courts for a special exemption should also be permitted to open for trading for 13 hours.</P>
    <P>In the licensed trade in the city of Dublin at the moment, a great number of publichouses are availing of this relaxation and I suggest that of the people who are availing of the special hours, more are wearing dress suits and morning suits than are wearing working clothes.  In the dock areas in Dublin, I suppose 50 or 60 publichouses are open at 7 a.m. or 7.30 a.m.  If the licensee thinks it worthwhile to have a special exemption to open at that time, I suggest he should close at 8.30 p.m.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Belton on this amendment.  It is true that the reason so many publichouses in certain areas are seeking leave to open at exceptionally early hours is that they are afraid that if they do not, their rivals will skim the cream off the milk during the other hours of the day.  If they were to have the assurance, which this amendment will give, that they will not lose later in the day if they do not open at those awkward hours, there would be a considerable reduction in the number of these exemption orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Belton has quite rightly said, a large proportion of those people are seeking cures on their way home from long night binges.  It is a kind of <i>bona fide</i> traffic at the other end of the day.  For the amount of business spread over 60 public houses, it is certainly not worthwhile to light and heat them in the early hours of the morning, and the publichouses which can afford to pay overtime are very <Col N="163" /> few indeed.  Those unfortunate owners who are afraid they may lose their reasonably respectable trade at other hours of the day, have to climb out of bed at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. and go down and open their doors just because their neighbours do so.  The Minister may feel it is no duty of this House to protect a foolish man against himself, but the fact is that people bought public-houses in those areas.  This tendency has grown up in recent years and they feel that they cannot afford to be out of line with their neighbours.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware that the licensed trade is a very ticklish trade.  If people feel that one house does not offer the same facilities as another, they are inclined to move along the line to the publichouses which remain open longer.  The object of this amendment is to ensure that if it is worthwhile for the trader to open in the morning, and he feels that he can make more by doing so than by remaining open from 8.30 p.m. to 10 o'clock in the evening, he should be free to do so but it is undesirable that people in close proximity to him should have to act in the same way for fear that the man who opens at 7.30 a.m. will get the extra customers in the late evening because he offers that facility.</P>
    <P>I do not think this amendment offends against the principle of uniformity which the Minister has in mind.  It simply allows traders in certain areas where there is supposed to be a large concentration of people to suit the needs of that concentration of people, be they workers, travellers or people coming into the market.  If that facility is given, they should close in the evening and not be allowed to have it both ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of representations were made to me by a friend in the trade in the city on this problem which is really a vicious circle in the dock areas and the markets.  We have had experience of a man who gives a big amount of employment on the quays&mdash;I shall not mention his name&mdash;whose neighbour, about 40 yards away, got permission to open at 7.30 a.m. and was open until 7.30 p.m.  It is a difficult problem for <Col N="164" /> the Minister to solve.  I have great sympathy with him.  Nevertheless, it is a vicious circle among the trade in Dublin especially around the areas to which Deputy Belton and Deputy Ryan referred, that is, the dock and market areas.  &ldquo;John Jones&rdquo; will get a permit to open at 7.30 a.m. on this side of the street and &ldquo;Paddy Murphy,&rdquo; on the other side of the street, will not get a permit to open at that time.</P>
      <P>If people want to avail of the opening hour of 7.30 a.m., they should be asked to surrender a few hours at night because some lining-up has to be brought about.  A number of very decent traders in Dublin city welcomed this Bill very much.  Certain publicans got permission to open at 7.30 a.m.; then a few other neighbours along the street started the same practice; then it went to the next street and away into another street.</P>
      <P>Consider the man employing trade-union labour and keeping a very big house.  He will see that his neighbour down the street is able to open at an early hour.  For that reason alone, I feel it is unfair trading.  We agree that around the markets it is a recognised principle.  I should like to see that principle carried on so that people going either to the cattle market or the vegetable market will be facilitated.</P>
      <P>Certain traders had the privilege of opening at 7.30 a.m.  It has gone out of bounds altogether.  Representatives of the licensed trade, the chairman and the secretary, have been with myself and other Deputies on this subject because we know the problems that have arisen over the years.  If the Minister could look into this and see what can be done to be fair to every section it would ease our minds a lot. Of course, anybody can go to the courts in relation to this matter.  At the moment, it is not fair trading because one would nearly require to give it to everybody in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of speaking on this subject.  I want to speak on another matter.  However, the question of early opening hours has been raised and I represent the market areas.  Consider what might arise if we were to deny those early <Col N="165" /> openers the late period, if we were to ensure that they had an early licence and closed early.  Suppose all the publicans decided not to open early.  Then the people coming in from county Dublin, which Deputy P.J. Burke represents, would complain that they could not gee a drink.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the early opening is that large numbers of persons coming in with vegetables, and so on, will be able to get a drink because they must wait at the auctioneers' market.  It is important to get there first so as to get away first.  There is usually a big line-up there waiting for the auctions to begin.  It could be a cold morning. There is no point in hanging around for an hour.  Therefore, to serve those people, we have the early hours.  Most of the men walk in with their load of vegetables.  They may walk ten miles or more.  They do not drive in.  There is no room on their lorry.  They want a drink and a position for their car while waiting for the auctioneers to commence business.</P>
      <P>The early opening hours are there to serve the public.  If we penalise the publicans concerned and say they must close at 8 o'clock in the evening a lot of them might not apply for the early opening but prefer the ordinary hours.  It is like a lot of complaints I get about differential rents and flat rates.  One hates the other and thinks the other is getting away with something.</P>
      <P>We should get rid of that approach. It would probably encourage a certain amount of illegal trade if people opened early and closed early.  The public houses at the docks and at the markets are there to serve the people. That is the main purpose of the early opening.  As far as the markets are concerned.  Deputy Burke's constituents are served.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the circumstances which have given rise to this amendment and I have sympathy with the licensed traders in Dublin who have a grievance in the matter.  But the cure is not to legislate in the manner set out in the amendment but to take steps, under the existing provisions of the law, to <Col N="166" /> ensure that when a General Exemption Order is in operation it fulfils the public need for which it was granted. If an Order does not fulfil the need for which it was granted there is machinery whereby the Courts can revoke or vary an order.</P>
      <P>A deputation from the Vintners' Association, expressing concern on this matter, was received in my Department on 25th April.  Earlier, I had heard similar views from a trade union deputation.  I have since given the Association an assurance that I am instructing the Gardaí to keep the situation under review with a view to informing the Court from time to time whether the precise purposes for which the Orders were granted are being fulfilled.</P>
      <P>Section 9 of this Bill provides that a General Exemption Order will remain in force until the next annual licensing session and will then expire. That means that the publicans who are now operating under General Exemption Orders must apply again at the next licensing session&mdash;at the end of September&mdash;and must satisfy the Court that they have been stocking food and non-alcoholic drinks at reasonable prices for supply on demand and that they have been accommodating a considerable number of persons attending a public market or fair or following a particular calling.  At the forthcoming annual licensing session the Gardaí will be in a position to inform the Court as to whether the applicant has been fulfilling the purpose for which he got an Order in the past or whether he is keeping open mainly for casual trade for passers by and the people who want a &ldquo;curer&rdquo; after the night before.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Vintners' Association are fairly well satisfied that the course I have suggested will rectify the position and they have no better suggestion to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It came to my attention that the issue of these exemption orders was not being done with what I might describe as common sense or wisdom.  The original intention was to provide for people working in the vicinity of the markets or the docks.  The boundary, <Col N="167" /> so to speak, was being extended slowly but surely.  On examination of the position, I found that quite a number of people were granted exemption orders unreasonably.  We are dealing with the matter now by ensuring that in future it will be of annual application. I think that will probably meet the needs of the Vintners' Association. In the case of these applications, anyone who wishes to make an objection to the reissuing of that exemption order can appear before the court and make the objection.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 10, between lines 23 and 24, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Section 4 of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, is hereby repealed.</P>
      <P>(2)  The provisions of section 12 of this Act shall apply in respect of the granting of a new licence in urban areas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to alter the situation as it stands at the moment.  In an urban area, a new licence may be granted by the court on condition that an old licence is extinguished and that a 25 per cent. increase in population is proved in the civil parish in which the proposed new licence is situated.  This amendmend suggests that two licences should be extinguished rather than one.  In rural areas, it is necessary to extinguish two licences to get one new licence.  I am suggesting that the conditions applying in rural areas should apply in the cities, that is, that when a person seeks a new licence, he should extinguish two licences within the borough area.  I am not suggesting that two licences should be extinguished in the rural areas to grant a new licence in the borough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

      <P>The provisions of Section 12 of the Bill allow a new publichouse to be established in a rural area on the extinguishment of two publichouse licences anywhere in the State.  The reason for this section is that in isolated rural areas, particularly in the West of Ireland, there is <Col N="169" /> no publichouse for many miles, that this is a hardship on the local people and is moreover an incentive to sheebeening and illicit distillation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton's amendment now asks that the law should permit of a new publichouse being established in towns and cities, also, if two public-houses are abolished in any part of the State.</P>
      <P>Most people would agree with me that there is scarcely a single city, or town, in the whole State which has not too many public houses.  I do not know precisely what Deputy Belton has in mind but I have been assured that his amendment is not supported by the Vintners' Association.</P>
      <P>Since 1902, no new licence for a public house may be granted in an urban area except in substitution for an existing licence in the same urban area, and then only where a 25 per cent. increase in population has taken place in the parish as compared with the year 1901.  The result of this law has been that existing public houses have a certain monopoly value; every urban publican knows that a new public house cannot be established beside him unless he happens to be living in some place such as a city suburb where there has been a 25 per cent. increase in population in the parish since 1901.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton's amendment seeks to abolish the condition that a 25 per cent. population increase must have taken place.  Admittedly the amendment would make the applicant extinguish two existing licences instead of one as at present, but that does not alter the fact that it would radically upset the equities that have existed for nearly sixty years.  The change proposed would be a major one, and its consequences would be difficult to foresee.  I have had no evidence that the change is in the interests of the public or that it has the backing of any substantial section of the licensed trade.  I think that we should leave well enough alone.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 48 and 49, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where a person proposes to acquire, construct or alter premises and to apply for the grant of a restaurant certificate, within the meaning of section 12 of the Act of 1927, in relation to the premises, he may apply to the Court to which it is proposed to apply for the grant of the restaurant certificate for a declaration that the premises would be structurally adapted for use as a restaurant, refreshment house or other place for supplying substantial meals to the public, and the Court, if it is so satisfied, may grant the application on such terms as it may think fit.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a person proposes to acquire, construct or alter premises and to apply for the grant of a limited restaurant certificate, within the meaning of section 12A of the Act of 1927, in relation to any portion of the premises, he may apply to the Court to which it is proposed to apply for the grant of the limited restaurant certificate for a declaration that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that portion of the premises would be structurally adapted for use as a restaurant, refreshment house or other place for supplying substantial meals to the public,</P>
      <P>(b)  that portion of the premises would not include a public bar, or part of a room in another part of which there would be a public bar, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  there would be public access to that portion of the <Col N="171" /> premises otherwise than through a public bar.</P>
    <P>and the Court, if it is so satisfied, may grant the application on such terms as it may think fit.</P>
    <P>(3)  The intending applicant under either of the foregoing subsections of this section shall give the Superintendent of the Garda Síochána, within whose district it is proposed to have the premises, at least ten days' notice in writing of intention to make the application and cause to be deposited with the said Superintendent a copy of the plans of the premises.</P>
    <P>(4)  An application under either subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section shall be accompanied by a plan of the premises.</P>

    <P>(6)  In this section &lsquo;public bar&rsquo; includes any place exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that, where a person intends to ask the Court to certify his premises or portion of his premises as a restaurant, he may, before incurring expense on construction or repairs work, made a preliminary application on the basis of plans.  Section 13 of the Bill has a corresponding provision in relation to applications for licences.

      <P>In page 18, line 40, after &ldquo;the Act of 1910&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or of a wholesale dealer's licence for the sale of spirits, beer or wine under the Act of 1910.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of Section 31 was to implement a recommendation of the Commission that cider should not be retailed in ordinary shops.  To achieve this, it proposed that a cider off-licence could be held only by the holder of a spirit retailer's off-licence.  Publicans and beer retailers do not need a special cider licence and the net effect of the section would be that only retailers of spirits or beer could retail cider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, however, it was brought to my notice that the main distribution channels for cider are the wholesale dealers in spirits, beer or wine and that, at times, particularly in the <Col N="174" /> Winter, these wholesale dealers would be asked to supply traders with fairly small quantities of cider&mdash;four and a half gallons or less&mdash;which a wholesaler is not entitled to supply unless he also has a retail licence.  Many if not most of them would be able to meet such demands even under the section as it stands, since they happen to be retailers of spirits or beer as well as wholesalers, but the difficulty arises with the wholesaler who has no trade in the sale of spirits or beer in retail quantities but who has a trade in the sale of cider in retail quanities, especially, as I have said, in the Winter.  It is to preserve the existing rights of that class of trader that the amendment is introduced.</P>

      <P>As I said last night, certain people seem to think that if you criticise the language policy you <Col N="175" /> must be opposed to the revival of the language.  I do not accept that attitude. It depends on the way the language policy is applied.  It can be applied rightly or wrongly.  I hold a certain viewpoint which differs from the fanatical viewpoint on the language. It is a well-known fact that fanatics see no viewpoint but their own.</P>
      <P>The children attending primary schools were expected to learn through the medium of Irish.  They were expected to have a knowledge of the written word as well as the spoken word.  The results are a clear indication that that policy has been a failure. We are told that approximately 500,000 children attend primary schools and that approximately 75,000 attend secondary schools&mdash;at least it is said that 75,000 were on the rolls of secondary schools at the beginning of the year&mdash;but it does not follow that all those children complete the secondary education course.  Many of them remain for a year and then drop out. Therefore, it could be said that about seven-eighths of the children receive only a primary education.  Those children are handicapped in so far as they have little knowledge of either English or Irish and thus have to face the world with very little education equipment.</P>
      <P>If the Minister laid the emphasis on the spoken word in the primary schools and let the children learn to speak and write English, by which they will eventually have to make their livelihood, better results would be achieved.  Those children who leave after a primary education depend on labouring employment or a trade and Irish is not essential for that type of employment.  It is important that children should be able to read and write in English which may have much to do with their advancement in their employment or with their obtaining employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who attend secondary schools and who seek the Leaving Certificate are a minority.  In seeking that certificate, they hope to obtain employment where Irish is required, mostly employment by the State, and perhaps that has a lot to do with their desire to have a knowledge of the language because they hope to <Col N="176" /> profit from it.  However, 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. of the people have no hope of profiting from it and they are depending entirely on their knowledge of English to make their way in the world.  Large numbers of our youth have had and will have to leave the country.  They are often placed in the same position as the youth who left the country a century ago.  Their ignorance of the language of the country to which they went, for instance, the United States, was exploited.  They were paid in buttons and were given only the dirty work to do.</P>
    <P>If the children who cease to attend school after the Primary have not a fairly good knowledge of the English language, they will be handicapped in Britain, America and in whatever other country they emigrate to.  It does not follow, however, that because I make those statements, I am opposed to the language but I am very much concerned with that vast number of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is all right for certain people who have a knowledge of both languages and who have the best of both worlds, as the Deputy has.  Some members of Dublin Corporation insist that all new areas should be named in Irish. Although the residents on a number of occasions, even as recently as a few weeks ago, asked that the names be bilingual so that they would understand the names of their own streets, these gentlemen refused.  Even though I asked that the Irish name be put up in some kind of Roman script to make it possible for those who have not a good knowledge of the language to understand it and at least have an idea of the name of the street, they said: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is all right for the Deputy.  He knows both languages. Therefore, he has the best of both worlds.  It has been brought to my notice by certain parents that, although their children have a good knowledge of the English language, they are denied certificates and are not able to prove to employers their standard of education. I understand that they cannot obtain the Leaving Certificate unless they pass the test in Irish.  The employers are largely indifferent as to whether they have a knowledge of Irish or not, but as the employers insist upon a certain standard of education and as the children are not in a position to demonstrate their standard, they are denied employment.  The Minister should at least provide two forms of certificate.  Whether it is first class or second class does not matter but they should have some certificate to show that their standard of education, other than in Irish, is good so that they will have a reasonable chance of obtaining employment.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter with which I am particularly concerned, that is, the lack of physical training in the schools.  A short time ago, I read a leading article in the <i>Evening Mail</i> which quoted a Mr. Farnam, chairman of the national physical culture coaching scheme.  This expert stated he was amazed at the neglect of physical culture in the schools.  He said that the programme was a heavily loaded academic programme.  I have referred to the need for physical training in the schools on each occasion I spoke in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" /> There are school children who may suffer from some physical defect. These children are supposed to be up to standard but the school authorities and the Department do nothing to help them.  It has been shown that where there were medical tests for the army, large numbers of men were rejected because of physical defects. That makes it quite obvious that a large number of children are suffering from physical defects of one kind or another.  The proper time to help those children is when they are young.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>In order that children will be able to concentrate properly on their school subjects, they must be in good health.  They must have proper poise and balance.  If they do not, their ability to concentrate must be affected.  Any Deputy who has any little experience of machinery, even if it is only an old bicycle, knows that if there is a slight defect in the handle bars, the tendency is to steer the machine into a wall.  You have no control over it.  It may be only a slight defect but it affects the whole mechanism.  As far as the human body is concerned, no notice is taken of the defects and yet we wonder why children do not give good results.  The reason is that they are physically handicapped. They receive no help at an age and in a place where they could easily receive it.  Perhaps some day we will have a Minister for Education who may himself have been physically affected.  It is a strange thing that often people who are themselves physically affected are spurred on to bring about some reform.  They take their own case as an example by which to help others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about child delinquency.  Deputy Coogan last night spoke of the need for the strap. There are various viewpoints in regard to what is called child delinquency. Some people blame the parents.  Some blame the Guards while others blame the school authorities but no one seems to be able to solve the problem.  Lack of physical training and lack of sports <Col N="179" /> on the school curriculum have a lot to do with child delinquency.</P>
    <P>When they leave school, children have nothing to do.  When they leave school at the age of 14, they are idle for a year or two.  We know that idleness has much to do with child delinquency. There should be gymnasia attached to all schools as is the case in certain countries.  If there were a sports department to deal with this aspect of education, you might get children interested in sports.  It would be up to the school authorities to cultivate this.  You might find the children anxious to shine in some form of sport or another instead of doing nothing but digging holes and lighting fires in empty houses.</P>
    <P>There was a writer called Carlisle who wrote a book entitled <i>Heroes and Hero Worship.</i>  He wrote on heroes in politics and heroes in business.  In fact, he wrote about all kinds of heroes in schools.  Among every grade of children, there are heroes.  When children do anything, they are led by someone.  That applies even to tiny tots.  The rest do as the leader does. Often the leader may be only a child. He may be a bit nervous, touchy or highly strung.  He wants to shine; he wants to show that he is superior to his pals or colleagues.  If sports were provided, he might indulge in them for the purpose of showing off by winning a race or a boxing bout.  In the absence of such facilities, the young person probably wants to break a few windows. In all these matters someone leads.  Children do not automatically throw stones at a window.  If they had something else to do, there might not be so much child delinquency.</P>
    <P>I shall be told that what I have to say now is not a matter for the Minister but I wonder whether Irish is taught in the prisons.  I suggest to the Minister that would be a good place to teach it where people have nothing to do. That is where some of our great patriots learned the language.  Perhaps if there had been many more admissions, we would today have many more Irish speakers.  Perhaps if there were more admissions now, we might have a great many Irish speakers.  These people might turn <Col N="180" /> out very good types because whether a person turns out good or bad depends for the most part on his beginnings.  A great many criminals might be good business men and good statesmen, had they got a different opportunity and a better chance.  Perhaps some of our great statesmen would have been notorious criminals had things gone differently with them.  It all depends on the start one gets and the inspiration one receives.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which concerns the Minister and which I previously raised by way of Question here.  A child may leave school at 14 years but that child must wait until the end of the term in which the 14th birthday occurs.  If a child reaches the age of 14 in January or February, he must wait until the end of March before he can leave school.  I had a case where a child, having reached the age of 14, entered employment.  The father was prosecuted and fined 15/-. I pointed out to the school inspector that the child had got a job.  He ignored that aspect.  He wanted his pound of flesh.  He wanted to show who he was.  He wanted to show what power he had.  He got his 15/-.  But the child did not leave the job and go back to school to finish the term.</P>
    <P>The position does not make sense. The Minister may have his reasons for insisting that the child should remain till the end of the term, but, where a child actually enters into employment on his 14th birthday, no action should be taken.  It might be different in the case of a child who would be hanging around.  The Minister might then decide that his proper place was in school until the end of the term.  It is absurd to prosecute a parent when there is incontrovertible evidence that the child is in employment. That is going a little too far. What does the inspector want?  Does he want the child to let the job go and, perhaps, fail to find a job later on?  The law is the law, but there should be some little give and take. Inspectors should be instructed to take no action when children are actually in employment.  They should turn the blind eye.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am very anxious <Col N="181" /> to see physical training in the schools. I am not opposed to the Irish language, but I do not want to see it shoved down people's throats.  I do not want to see people suffering on that account.  Those who want the language should approach the problem in easy stages.  They should not act in such fashion as to make others biassed against it by denying them a proper opportunity of getting the best livelihood possible.  I am against that kind of fanaticism.  It is all very well for those who have a knowledge of both languages.  They have the best of both worlds, but there is another world, too&mdash;my world.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire ar an Meastachán seo as ucht an mhéid a rinne sé.  Is maith an rud é go bhfuil deireadh curtha leis an gcúrsa A.B.C.  Rachaidh sé go mór chun tairbhe na teanga na páistí bheith á labhairt.  Is é mo thuairim go rachaidh sé chun tairbhe don chuspóir sin.  Is dócha go réiteofar an chuid is mó de na fadhbanna a bhaineann leis an bpolasai atá ann leis na blianta anuas cainteanna a bheith idir an Roinn agus Cumann na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta.</P>
      <P>Ach tá cúpla rud ann go mba mhaith liom féin tagairt a dhéanamh dóibh, is é sin, toghadh agus oiliúint múinteoirí, scoileanna nua a thógáil agus an clár atá le múineadh sna scoileanna.</P>
      <P>Many of our smaller problems, I think, require the good policy that has grown up in the past few years of having closer consultation between the Department and the teachers' organisations. Most of them, I think, can be solved through that closer co-operation between the two parties concerned. From my own point of view, the selection of teachers is one of the main problems facing us.  The change made last year in the manner of selecting candidates for the training colleges was a good change and one that ensured that those entering the training colleges would be the best material selected from those presenting themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having selected those who we think would make the best teachers, I think our next problem should be the training of those teachers.  I would ask, as <Col N="182" /> I have asked on previous occasions, that there should be a common basic system for the training of all teachers, whether they be primary, secondary or vocational, and then going on to specialisation, and for all of them there should be a course ending in a degree.  I do not think there should be any great difficulty in ensuring that that should be done.</P>
    <P>Having selected and trained our young teachers, we must give them conditions that will enable them to carry out the work they have to do.  We must give them proper buildings in which to teach.  I know that an improvement has been made in the past few years in the number of schools being built and extensions being built to schools and renovations being carried out, but if we are ever to overtake the backlog, there will have to be a speeding up in the provision of new schools and the entension of existing schools.  We must give the teachers classes of a size which will enable them to do their work.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing to see this year that there is a reduction in the number required for third, fourth, fifth and sixth assistants.  I would much prefer, however, to see a reduction in the number necessary for the employment of a second assistant.  The great majority of our schools are two-teacher schools and each teacher has to deal with at least four classes.  By giving a reduction in the number necessary for the appointment of a second assistant, we would be doing a greater service than the reduction for the higher number. The problem is greater in the two-teacher schools where each teacher has to deal with a number of classes. While there are difficulties in the other schools, and I welcome the reduction in respect of the larger number, I think the difficulty is greater in the smaller schools.  By allowing the teacher to deal with smaller classes, we would be helping the backward child.  I am not speaking of mentally retarded children who present a different problem.  If the classes are too large, teachers cannot be expected to deal properly with such children and they cannot be expected to go anywhere near completing the school programme.</P>
    <P>On the question of the school programme,  <Col N="183" /> I think it should be a realistic one.  I referred to that previously, particularly in regard to the teaching of history.  In a national school in two years between 5th and 6th classes, with two hours per week and about 40 weeks in a year, a teacher is expected to cover the teaching of that subject from the earliest times to the present day.  It is an absolute impossibility; it cannot be done.  We should have a programme that could be properly dealt with within that period.  A great proportion of our children get no education other than that which they receive in the primary schools.  I think, therefore, that the programme should cover the making of modern Ireland and that the early stages of our history should be dealt with in reading lessions, both in English and Irish.  Such a shorter programme would give the children an idea of how the Ireland of today was built up within the past couple of hundred years.  That could be taught within the time allotted.</P>
    <P>We are also asked to put forward children for the Primary Certificate examination.  While there may be some merit in having an examination for children capable of undergoing it, it is entirely wrong that every child in the sixth class, irrespective of mentality, is expected to do the examination. The teachers and pupils in the small two-teacher country schools are expected to do the same examination as that for schools in which there is one teacher for each class.  That the examination is compulsory is entirely wrong.  Have an examination if you like, but let it be an examination for which the child may opt.</P>
    <P>I should like to make reference to some differences between the Six Counties and ourselves in the matter of education.  The Estimate for Education there is much higher than here, although they have a much smaller population.  The school leaving age there is 15 years and it is to be advanced to 16.  I know we have been given figures here previously showing that the number of children who go on from primary to vocational and secondary education is increasing.  That is a good thing but there are still far <Col N="184" /> too many children who never go further than the national school.  Many of them, once they have done the Primary Certificate, do not remain on even until they are 14.  When they have done the primary examination, they consider that their time in the primary school is finished.  They simply leave the school and nobody seems to bother about them.  The teacher, perhaps, tries to get them to go on for vocational or secondary education.  In some cases he succeeds, but in other cases they simply remain at home and that is the end of their education.</P>
    <P>It would be a good thing if some effort could be made to increase the school leaving age.  I know there would be difficulties about buildings and so on, but these could be overcome if we had the will to do so.  In the Six Counties, there is a Senior Certificate examination.  Perhaps the standard is higher than our Leaving Certificate, but any child who succeeds in getting 55 per cent. in that examination and whose parents are unable to afford to provide him with university education is entitled to free University education.  Even those who can afford it are assisted because there is a grant of £50 to every student entering the University.</P>
    <P>While I would have sympathy with increasing the number of Universities&mdash; and I have every sympathy with the case made for a University in Limerick &mdash;I do not think, however, that that is the answer to the problem.  The majority of the children would still be living some distance from the University and I think that the only answer is to increase the number of scholarships. I know the Minister has announced there is to be an increase for certain categories, but I think something more will have to be done if we are to give to every capable child an opportunity of benefiting from University education.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister when he comes to select those who will sit on the Commission on Higher Education to give representation to the I.N.T.O. on that body.  While it will deal with higher education, we must consider the foundation on which that higher education <Col N="185" /> is built.  If your foundation is not sound, you will not get a good structure on top.  Therefore, I think primary teachers have something to contribute to that commission and the Minister should consider giving them representation.</P>
    <P>I thought that the Council of Education would consider the introduction of an integrated system of education in which all branches would be united. Unfortunately, they have been asked to report, first, on primary education alone.  I do not think that was the correct approach because we shall still have education in separate, watertight compartments.  What I would like to see is a system dealing with education from the bottom right up to the top. I know that at some stage there must be a break and you must go for either vocational or secondary education.</P>
    <P>Here is a difficulty which arises at present.  You have the child of 12 or 14 in a two-teacher country school like my own who leaves it to go to a vocational school.  You also have the child going to the Christian Brothers' schools in the towns who has gone as far as the Intermediate Standard and who is put into the same class in the vocational school as the child from the two-teacher country school.  You are creating an impossible situation both for the child and the teacher.  There is a want somewhere in that situation which may be supplied by raising the school leaving age and providing continuation education from the age of 13 on.  If you aid the children to enter vocational schools at something around the same standard, at about 15 years of age, I do not think it would be too late.  The Ard Teastas, or whatever they get from it, could count as part of their apprenticeship for whatever training they go to afterwards, and I do not think it would be any disservice to them.  I hope the policy which has been established over the past few years of closer consultation between all interested in education will be continued in the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Education Estimate, seen in correct perspective, is of course one of the most important Estimates this House <Col N="186" /> is called on to consider.  It is proper that a number of detailed matters should be raised in connection with the administration on this occasion, but it is also good that wider issues should be considered, too.  When I look back over the past 12 years, beginning in 1948, it is a striking fact, and one I think we ought to bear in mind with some satisfaction, that the annual appropriation for primary education 12 years ago was something in the order of £5,175,000 and this year, it is £10,478,000.  That represents an increase of 104 per cent.  In 1948, the annual appropriation was £886,000 for secondary education and today it is £2,629,000, an increase of 210 per cent.  In 1948, the appropriation for technical education was £595,000 and today it is £1,478,000, an increase of 143 per cent.  The annual appropriation in 1948 for University education was £323,000 and today it is £986,000, an increase of 203 per cent.</P>
      <P>Those global figures are satisfactory as evidence of the effort being made to improve the educational facilities of our people but somebody said in the course of this debate, and I think it is profoundly true, that the best test of an educational system is the product, and I am not altogether sure we can all be satisfied that, judged by that test, we are getting value for our money. I often wonder what it is that seems to abridge the quality of the education that we should wish our children to receive.  I propose to touch on a few of the matters I think want correction but there is one matter which is peculiarly dear to my heart and which, I think, stands in very urgent need of attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary claim of children upon us is that they should get a decent education and I am often afraid that certain zealous souls in this country are quite prepared to say that, if needs be, they are prepared to sacrifice the education of a generation for an ulterior end, and that ulterior end is what they are pleased to call the restoration of the Irish language.  In my opinion, to sacrifice the education of a generation to that end would be criminally wrong, even if it were necessary, but I think it is doubly tragic that people should <Col N="187" /> proceed along those lines when there ought not to be any conflict at all between the promotion of the Irish language and the promotion of the sound education of the young people of this country.</P>
    <P>Unhappily, this is one of these questions that gives rise to a great deal of irrational fury and excitement when anybody dares to touch upon it with a view to reform.  Rightly or wrongly, I was reared to love the language.  I acquired that love of the language when I was very young and I have never been able to get rid of it.  When asked the question&mdash;I am not often asked it but I ask myself&mdash;why do you want to hear your neighbour speak Irish, why do you want it to survive? &mdash;I cannot find any utilitarian answer to that query.  The only satisfactory answer I can formulate for my mind is: why should Callas sing, why should Kreisler play the violin, why should Solomons play the piano?  Who is any richer for their activities?  The answer is that I do not think anybody is, but I think something infinitely precious is preserved because such people as Callas like to sing, because such people as Kreisler like to play the violin, and because such people as Solomons like to play the piano.  Some precious element in our lives is preserved and it is on that analogy I feel that a language that is living deserves to survive.</P>
    <P>But, mind you, a lot of rational people take the opposite view. Approaching the question from a purely utilitarian point of view, they say how much better it would be if all people in all countries spoke the same language, how much better it would be for mutual understanding, the promotion of trade and commerce, and the exchange of ideas if everybody spoke the same language, and we cannot close our eyes to the fact that there is a great deal of force in that argument.</P>
    <P>I reject that contention on two grounds, one, because I do not think it is by bread alone that man must live, and the second, the more practicable ground, that I do not believe we are going to see in our time a <Col N="188" /> universal <i>lingua franca.</i>  If you have not got one language for the whole world, you have to face the fact that there are many languages, amongst which ours is one and, for romantic and cultural reasons, I belong to that section of our people who desire to see that language live and to see it one of the spoken languages of our people.</P>
    <P>I freely confess that I do not fully understand my own motives or reactions when I attended an international conference as a representative of this country, attended by officers of the Department over which I presided when I was Minister.  I do not understand why it gave me peculiar satisfaction to transact some of my business, in the presence of strangers, in the Irish language, but it did.  Perhaps, that reaction has no permanent value, but it is present in the hearts of many of us in this country and certainly present in a sufficient number of us to deserve respectful attention.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am greatly distressed by what is borne in upon me by the evidence of my own eyes and ears, that the present methods of imparting Irish in the schools and the element of compulsion associated with those methods are creating in the children attending the schools a kind of prejudice against the language that did not exist at all 35 years ago.  It is becoming an unhealthy kind of fashion amongst pupils in primary and secondary schools to say that they do not like Irish.  I attribute that distaste to the fact that it is thrust upon them and that they feel a constant sense of coercion in respect of their studies in Irish which they do not feel in respect of the other subjects imparted to them.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that this whole generic expression of &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo; is largely a misunderstanding. Children have to learn arithmetic; children have to study English.  Every curriculum includes a certain number of subjects which a child is obliged to study, but, the fact remains that you will find children who have a peculiar facility in mathematics or certain subjects and little capacity for linguistics or the study of language, for whom the <Col N="189" /> compulsion to study and pass at a certain standard in Irish constitutes a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>We have seen in our own time in such citadels of the classics as Oxford and Cambridge a movement there to remove the compulsory element that did relate to Latin and Greek for their entrance examinations.  Greek, I think, ceased to be compulsory many years ago but Latin is now being removed. I have the feeling that one of the most urgent things now requiring to be done if the language revival is to be achieved is to eliminate from our approach to it in the highest possible degree all thought or talk of compulsion.</P>
    <P>Very recently, the Minister made a new regulation in regard to national schools.  Up to that time, there was in effect a compulsory regulation requiring that children in infant classes be taught through the medium of Irish.  I am well aware that in the infant classes very little of an academic kind is taught.  I am very well aware that the Department of Education told the teacher: &ldquo;If you are not competent to teach infants through the medium of Irish, you need not do it&rdquo;, but I am also very well aware that national teachers, being human beings, did not care to proclaim to the Department that they could not teach even infants through the medium of Irish and, of course, the effort was widely made.  I am told that that regulation has now been substantially amended and I think that is a good thing.</P>
    <P>I want now to suggest to the Minister something which I have not the faintest hope he will adopt, but the fact that people will not do the right thing is no reason why you should cease advocating the right thing.  I think the language is dying and will be dead in the Minister's lifetime, if the present procedures are adhered to. The only hope we have of restoring the language as a living language with the vitality to survive and spread is to embark on an entirely new approach to the whole problem.  I want to say quite frankly that I believe the best we can hope for, and I think probably it would be the best of all hopes, is that Irish should become in this <Col N="190" /> country the hallmark of higher education to which every child, no matter from what house he came, rich or poor, could aspire and attain through the system of education made available to him.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the very substantial increase in the cost of our educational system in the past 12 years but I believe that money is well spent if it is producing results.  We could brace ourselves to the task of spending more if we were satisfied it was going to produce the desired results.  I believe the ideal is the system obtaining in our wealthy neighbour, Great Britain, where any child, whatever his financial circumstances are, who attains to a certain level of academic distinction, I understand it is 55 per cent., shall be facilitated to acquire secondary and ultimately University education.  I doubt if our resources will extend to that at the present time.  If they did &mdash;I entirely agree with the last speaker &mdash;that is the ideal at which we should aim.  I think it is the ideal at which we should aim in any case but we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we can approach it only as our resources will allow.</P>
    <P>I believe that an interim measure could be a powerful instrument for the restoration of the language and could at one stroke eliminate the whole talk of compulsion which at present, in my judgment, is destroying all the efforts that have been and are being made. If, instead of presenting Irish as a compulsory affliction on children in schools, it could be presented to them as the passport to higher education, I believe the entire reaction of parents and children would be dramatic.  I cannot see that it is impossible to envisage a plan whereby all compulsion in relation to the teaching of Irish would disappear overnight and that thereafter we should prescribe that the child in the primary school who qualified in the ordinary subjects of the curriculum and, in addition, maintained a certain high standard in Irish, should be provided with adequate scholarships to carry him to the secondary school; and then, provided in taking his Leaving Certificate or matriculation examination, he acquired a pass standard, or better, in the <Col N="191" /> required subjects for that examination, plus an honours standard in Irish, he would be provided with a scholarship sufficient to carry him through University to whatever Degree he aspired to, always provided that in addition to the studies appropriate to the Faculty for which he elected, he would also undertake to take Irish as an additional subject and possibly accept the obligation to maintain an honours standard.</P>
    <P>I believe that one reform would result in a metamorphosis in the whole approach to Irish.  The language, instead of being an affliction on the young, would be presented to them as the passport to higher education and it would result in the Universities turning out, year after year, a considerable number of educated men or women who would have one hallmark in common&mdash;they would be fluent Irish speakers.  We would create an intellectual aristocracy in the country whose one common hallmark would be their command of their own language.</P>
    <P>If I am any judge of our people&mdash; and I think I am&mdash;fundamentally, there is more esteem in their hearts for learning than there is for wealth or distinction of any other kind.  If you once associated in their minds a command of the Irish language with higher education, if that became the mark of the highly educated man or woman, instead of having to thrust the language upon them, you would find them clamouring for better facilities to learn it.  In that metamorphosis, the whole problem of the Irish language revival would disappear overnight and we would be back on the lines which saved the language when it was almost dead, the lines of the old Gaelic League of 1906 where, at a time when this country was rent with the most vindictive political issues, you could find on the one platform an old Colonel Blimp who had spent his life possibly in the British Army, some old lady who dearly loved the Queen, with the baker, the butcher, the shopkeeper, the teacher and every other element in our society all drawn together in this extraordinary combination of devotion to the language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> Those of us who participated in that movement as children or as more mature people had a very exciting experience in the unifying effect of the common love of the language and it was reflected, as I have often reminded this House, in the attitude to the language of the University student.  When I was at U.C.D., we regularly spent our Saturday afternoons assembled around the bandstand in Stephen's Green for no better reason than that we knew certain students of our own age who knew Irish, wanted to talk it and would frequent the bandstand also. Can you imagine any grade of students at the present time, without some kind of organisation or direction, devoting their Saturday afternoons just to meeting others who wanted to talk Irish? All that appears to me to be dead.  I think an effort is being made by Gael Linn to revive a purely voluntary enthusiasm for the language and the promotion of those things that will promote the language.  I should like to see the whole revival movement handed over to a kind of movement such as Gael Linn is, and harnessed to it the passionate zeal of people who want to revive the language out of love of it and who are quite indifferent to the baser ends for which many people seem to pay lip service to it at present.</P>
    <P>When I first went to an Irish College at Ballingeary and subsequently to Cloghaneely, there was not a single person attending either of these colleges who was there for any other purpose but to learn the language: by the time I gave up going, there was not a single creature there who was not there for the purpose of getting a job.  That was a horrible change.  Everybody there was looking for a Teastas, a Meán-Teastas or an Árd-Teastas and they had it all measured out that you could get a certain job with a Teastas, that if you wanted to go further, you needed a Meán-Teastas and if you wanted to go the whole way, you had to have an Árd-Teastas.  When we went there first, nobody was interested in, or talked of anything else but the language.  That was not long ago.  Nobody gave a fiddle-de-dee what Teastas he got.  He spent his days sitting on the bridge outside Lucey's house with old Dr. Daly <Col N="193" /> trying to get us to say: &ldquo;Tá mé in san ngort,&rdquo; and Dr. Daly almost put his two fingers down our throats to help us pronounce it correctly.  Other distinguished scholars frequented the place and the students were eager to learn all the teachers could tell them.  Even when they were outside the class, they wanted to teach something that we wanted to learn.  All that is gone because instead of being something which people want to do and for which they are prepared to work for its own sake, they now feel Irish is being forced down their throats.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister can be briefed up to the hilt to demonstrate that nobody is compelled to do anything beyond passing certain examinations in Irish, as they must do in other subjects, but the fact is that people feel that they are so compelled and it is spreading all through our social pattern in such a way that it may be impossible to correct it.  But, so long as there is a chance, I propose to impress on the Minister and the Government the urgent desirability of correcting it.</P>
    <P>I do not think this element of compulsion is exclusively within the province of the Minister for Education or that it is exclusively a problem of the schools.  I think a great many other things contribute to it but they are all ultimately focussed on the school.  The thing is so complex that I find myself trying to elucidate it even while on my feet.  I think one of the reasons why the children feel this awful resentment of compulsion is not only that they cannot pass the Matriculation examination without presenting Irish and that they will fail if they do not pass in Irish, but the knowledge that, in a wide variety of public appointments, if they aspire to enter the public service or the local authority service, this same restriction is put upon them, and it is true.  It is a public scandal in the public service.  The extent to which Irish is becoming the instrument of inefficiency is a public scandal.</P>
    <P>I remember a case when I was Minister for Agriculture, when I wanted a research professor for the Veterinary College.  There were several candidates <Col N="194" /> and the matter was referred to the Appointments Commission.  One candidate was a research lecturer in Cambridge; another was a veterinary graduate who had graduated about three months before and who was assistant to a veterinary surgeon somewhere in rural Ireland.  On the technical examination conducted by the Appointments Commission, the research graduate from Cambridge sailed out in front, and we counted ourselves lucky that he had applied, because he was the kind of man we wanted.  We were delighted when we were told that on the first round he was away out on his own.</P>
    <P>There was a second round.  The man out in front, a Cambridge graduate but an Irishman, had a competent knowledge of Irish, whatever that may be, but the other chap who had graduated months before was a native speaker.  Before I knew where I was, I was presented with the fact that the man who had graduated in general veterinary medicine three months before was to be a professor.  I refused to appoint him.  At that stage I stuck my heels in and said: &ldquo;I will not participate in this farce.  If I appoint this man professor for the next 40 years he will be labouring away and he simply is not competent to be a professor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That battle was still going on when I left office.  I do not know what happened afterwards.  That happened in 1951, and I heard rumblings afterwards in the Department of Agriculture that there was blue murder.  I think the post was ultimately re-advertised. That happens regularly in the public service.</P>
    <P>I remember another occasion upon which it was a question of a dispensary or some other medical post in Athenry, I think.  On the first round, a competent man was chosen but then it was discovered that Athenry was deemed to be in the Breac-Ghaeltacht and, therefore, because the candidate was obliged to undergo some examination in Irish, someone entirely different was chosen because he was deemed to have a knowledge of Irish <Col N="195" /> superior to that of the doctor who had been originally chosen.</P>
    <P>It is a public scandal and every rational person knows it is a public scandal.  We do not get the best men for the jobs they are required to do. That is the kind of thing that is filtering back into the schools and disrupting the whole movement for the revival of the Irish language.  It is souring hundreds and thousands of people whose goodwill could be secured and without whose goodwill we have no prospect of succeeding. The great danger is that, with the passage of each year, the prospect of enduring success becomes less likely than it was the year before.</P>
    <P>I heard with amazement and dismay that the modern classic <i>Seadhna</i>, by An tAthair Peadar Ó Laoghaire, is now being issued, not in the Munster Irish in which he wrote it but with what the Department of Education are pleased to call modern spelling.  I doubt that the syntax itself has not been changed.  I understand it is being issued in the standard Irish which is to be universally employed.  It seems to me that people have gone stark staring mad if they take the modern classics and impose upon them what they are pleased to call standard Irish and destroy the real value of these classics in the sacred cause of standardisation.</P>
    <P>That seems to be as insane as the proposal that was made to me once by a person I regarded as a relatively rational man&mdash;as a highly rational man, in fact.  He said that Radio Éireann was making a great mistake in hiring native speakers to speak on the radio, because they discouraged the people who learned Irish in schools, and that Radio Éireann ought to be prohibited from employing native speakers and only permitted to employ people who had learned Irish in Dublin.  I cannot understand that. That is what my neighbours in the country used to call &ldquo;book Irish&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think we have manipulated ourselves into the position of having invented a language&mdash;a kind of Irish Esperanto.  I solemnly declare we are in danger of letting Irish die and substituting <Col N="196" /> and imposing on our people something that has no roots at all, in the sacred name of uniformity, to give something that everybody can use. That seems to me to be stark staring mad, because, while there is still a very strong army of us in the country who love the language, I doubt if you will find any substantial body of people at all who are prepared to make any effort whatever to acquire what I can really describe as an Irish Esperanto, which is neither fish, flesh nor good red herring, and is certainly not Irish, whatever else it is.</P>
    <P>I am trying to draw a picture for the House to show that there is in existence a growing antipathy to what is popularly called &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo;.  You can rebut that charge that there is compulsory Irish, but if you do so, you will be simply ignoring the existence of something that is very real.  What I am trying to do is to analyse what is, in fact, the thing against which people are reacting to the grave detriment of the movement as a whole.  I think it is very complex.  Part of it is that it is an essential qualification in the provision of technical branches of the public service and the local authority service, and appointment to these services is distorted by this absurd requirement that persons who will never have to use Irish in the ordinary course of their duties must qualify in it and that someone who has a superior knowledge of it is preferred before someone who is technically superior to the Irish speaker.</P>
    <P>It also involves a number of other factors.  If a secondary teacher wants to qualify for an increment, he must satisfy the Department that he can speak Irish.  Whether the standard required for him is that he must satisfy the Department that he can teach subjects through the medium of Irish, or that he can speak Irish with a sufficient fluency to conduct conversations with the other members of the staff, I am not quite sure, but it is a grotesque fraud, and we all know it is a fraud.  Many secondary teachers are not equipped to do it, but an abracadabra is gone through and the inspector interviews the teacher and <Col N="197" /> says: &ldquo;Nach breagh an lá é,&rdquo; to which the teacher replies: &ldquo;Tá an lá go breagh&rdquo;.  The teacher says: &ldquo;Is fear mé&rdquo; and not: &ldquo;Tá me fear.&rdquo;  They both agree on that.</P>
    <P>The inspector says: &ldquo;That man speaks Irish&rdquo; and the difficulty is overcome. But everybody knows it is a fraud.  Yet it is in existence.  It operates effectively to prevent a school that wants to employ a graduate of a French University to teach French from employing him because he cannot even say &ldquo;Is breá an lá é&rdquo; and he will not try.  His attitude is: &ldquo;My business is French and I do not know Irish.&rdquo; That man is not entitled to an increment and they cannot employ him. The same is true of an Italian, a German or a Spaniard or such person required to teach a language in a secondary school.  Unless this farce is gone through, those who are native speakers of these languages are excluded from employment.</P>
    <P>I think most parents will agree that if they want their children taught French, German, Spanish or Italian as a general rule it is desirable that they should receive instruction from somebody who has it as his native language.  If they get started right in a language and get the right accent, the right intonation, the right inflection, they can subsequently go abroad and use their knowledge but if they go off on the wrong foot at the early stages they are gravely embarrassed for the rest of their time.</P>
    <P>It seems absurd that Irish should be the reason for preventing a school from employing what they conceive to be the best teacher for a particular subject. The same problem arises in this way. You will get a highly competent Latin teacher or a distinguished Greek scholar or, what is much more common now, a Science master&mdash;and they are as scarce as white blackbirds&mdash;but he cannot speak Irish.  He cannot get any increment.  Therefore, he cannot be employed.  The school cannot afford to pay him the full salary including the increments and if he cannot get them from the Department he goes to Northern Ireland and works there.  All that is contributing to a growing hatred of the language in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> It ought to be our concern to prevent the development of any antipathy to the language.  It ought to be our concern to help in every way we can those who feel the romantic desire to provide the language as the spoken language amongst our people to realise that dream.  I think we are on the wrong road at present.  I think if we travel this road much further the language will be dead and we will be left with nothing but the Irish Esperanto which the Department are developing for themselves and when that day comes no rational person will wish to see that Esperanto long survive.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if we go about the problem in the right way we yet can save the day.  It would require imagination, courage and money.  I believe most people would be glad to see the money spent, even those who do not share our love of the language, if it was spent on the promotion of the language and, incidentally, provided educational opportunities for numbers of our young people who otherwise would have to go without them.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister will tell us when he is winding up that he is considering the Report of the Commission on Primary Education, that he awaits the report of the Commission on Secondary Education and that he will set up another Commission to report on Higher Education.  If the Commission on Higher Education takes as long as the Commission on Primary Education and the Commission on Secondary Education did to prepare their reports the Minister will be a venerable figure in the Opposition long before any of these reports come to be acted upon and will be in a position sternly to rebuke whoever has succeeded him in the meantime for not having done something.</P>
    <P>I have a great respect for commissions. They are splendid bodies.  They give their time freely and generously to the excogitation of these immense reports.  I wonder if I would shock Deputies if I asked how many people ever read the reports.  Cross our hearts and hope to die, how many Deputies have sat down and read the Report on <Col N="199" /> Primary Education from cover to cover with which we were furnished some time ago?  Very few.  When we get the Report on Secondary Education, it will have been most carefully digested in the Department, with cross-references, and the Minister will be given a copy with little tabs sticking out all over it.  He may read it, being a conscientious man, but thereafter he may rely on the tabs for the spicy bits on which he will rest his future arguments.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to concede that these commissions do good work.  They are prepared to hear everybody and they do, I suppose, digest all the material that comes before them.  They consist of persons with specialised knowledge who are prepared to make specific recommendations in a form that it might be very difficult for this House to undertake.  However, I do not think we must depend on commissions for the broad policy decisions for which ultimately this House must be responsible and it is on these broad policy decisions that the survival of the language largely depends.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that if the language revival movement continues to be associated with the concept of compulsion in the minds of our people the language will die&mdash;the language I care about, in any case, the living language as spoken by the people who were born to it.  I am sure of that.  Compulsion will kill it.  I am equally sure that even now it could be preserved and in a form that would make it equal to any spoken language in the world in vigour and beauty.  It is fairly safe to say that in 10 years' time, if there has been no change, no effort will save it in a form in which it can long survive.</P>
    <P>It is certainly true that if the whole educational machinery of the country is concentrated on forcing on the people what I have described as an Irish Esperanto, some shadow of the language will continue to flicker in the backgroud, but it will have no vitality, no staying power and certainly no beauty.  As far as I am concerned it will be a matter of complete indifference to me whether or not an Esperanto of that kind survives. <Col N="200" /> It is a matter of very real concern to me that the language I heard my neighbours speak as their native language should continue&mdash; the language which Thomas Davis came to our house in Ballaghaderreen to learn 120 years ago.  It is very precious to many of us, and I believe to the majority of our people and if it were disassociated from this accursed compulsion I believe it would survive.  It would be no mean achievement on the part of the Minister if he could achieve the revolution of divorcing compulsion from the whole context of the language movement.</P>
    <P>I want to make a special appeal in that regard.  One of the great needs of trade and commerce, and, indeed, of the tourist trade, is that we should turn out of our secondary schools a growing number of pupils who would have some familiarity with the vernacular of other countries.  I think we are being greatly hindered in that by not being able to employ competent teachers in these languages through the operation of this rule.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider permitting the employment of teachers to teach languages, especially if they are natives of the countries whose language they teach, without being required to pretend that they are in a position to teach the language through the medium of Irish, or being required to pretend that they have a knowledge of Irish, which, of course, most of them cannot have.</P>
    <P>I make the same appeal in regard to teachers of the classics, Greek and Latin, and of science.  So far as I know it is extremely difficult for schools to get teachers with the proper qualifications to teach science purely for the simple reason that men and women who have these qualifications can so readily get much more remunerative employment in trade or commerce.  It is almost impossible to attract them to the vocation of teaching which, in fact, is largely restricted to people who have a real vocation.  If you add to the existing difficulties the obligation on anyone who wishes to follow the vocation of science-teaching that he must also pretend to a knowledge of Irish that <Col N="201" /> he has not got, you make it virtually impossible to get the kind of teachers we ought to have if the stimulation of science teaching in secondary schools, which is so urgently necessary, is to be provided.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a problem which exists.  We all know about the difficulty of getting science teachers.  Even when you do get them there are relatively few secondary schools in this country which have the resources to provide adequate science laboratories.  I do not believe in making excessive comparisons between the situation here and in Great Britain. We have got to reconcile ourselves to the fact that we are not as rich as Great Britain and that they can do things there which we cannot do because we have not got the money. It is no use yearning for the fleshpots of Egypt.  We had them and we rejected them by our own volition and if we had to make the choice again I think we would make the same decision.  The Six Northern Counties are enjoying them but at a cost, a cost which we are not prepared to pay, so far as I know, and if we are not prepared to pay, there is no use repining for them.</P>
    <P>It is surprising what we are able to do with our limited resources.  Provided we are able to give the essentials we are better off but we ought to recognise what the essentials are.  One of the essentials, in our present set-up, should be better facilities for teaching science in our secondary schools.  I think an undergraduate going to the College of Science, who has had no adequate science teaching in secondary school, is labouring under a very heavy handicap and, incidentally, throwing an unreasonable burden on the Science Faculty of the University which is trying to teach such students the elements they should have learned in secondary school.  They cannot learn these elements if the secondary school has not got the necessary facilities.</P>
    <P>I observe that Messrs. Arthur Guinness, a very public spirited company, have launched a fund to which they have invited mercantile interests <Col N="202" /> to contribute in order to help to endow science laboratories in schools.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought consider seriously some plan whereby if the secondary schools apply to that fund or to him for the wherewithal to equip, or indeed if necessary to build, a laboratory, the Minister might consider saying that for every £1 the fund provides he would give another £1, or develop some scheme to make it possible for those schools which have the staff and the pupils desirous of studying science, but which have not got the equipment or accommodation, to have some ready means of acquiring them without delay.</P>
    <P>Now I come to another broad topic on which I wish to make an appeal to the authorities, and not for the first time.  One Deputy to-day spoke about the difficulty of teaching the whole of Irish history in the short period set aside for it in the school.  That is a problem of which I have no experience but whatever history is taught in the schools, the Minister has a very solemn obligation, which I do not think is being discharged at present, of revising the text books used in our schools for teaching history.  This country has a long and chequered history.  So have most other countries in the world.</P>
    <P>We have had periods of persecution and we have had periods of war and they belong to far-off distant days. They have their place in history but it fills me with horror to read in history books long stories of religious persecution clearly designed to foment hatred and ill-will between our people and the British people.  You would really imagine from these documents that the British zealots were burning and hanging our people because they were Irish Catholics.  Nothing of the kind was the fact.  They were burning our people because they were Roman Catholics and, when they were finished burning Roman Catholics here, they bustled home and started burning Roman Catholics at home and, if the truth were told, they burned more Roman Catholics at home than they did in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If you investigate the matter far enough you will find that the Roman Catholics when they got around to it burned a few Protestants too.  The sad <Col N="203" /> part is that these tragic details of centuries ago should be presented to the children in our schools as evidence of a peculiar desire on the part of the ancient enemy to persecute our people because they were Irish Catholics. These incidents were incidents in a period of religious enthusiasm of a kind to which I do not suppose anyone would subscribe in this modern day.  We do not believe now in burning people who are heretics but there was a time when we all believed in it.  It is more than folly; it is criminal to present that kind of history for the purpose of fomenting hatred between ourselves and the British people.  It is wrong and it is evil to use the story of our country in its relations with Great Britain for the purpose of reviving ancient hatred.  By the mercy of God's Providence, we have passed through that period and these hatreds are much better allowed to die.</P>
    <P>I always think of the lines of Tom Kettle who was called upon to forget the past and who replied that he kept the past for pride but he had not the slightest intention of forgetting anybody, the humblest creature that laid down his life for this country, that he remembered them not for the purpose of hating those who were opposed to them but for the purpose of taking pride in the sacrifice they made of their lives.</P>
    <P>I wish there were more of that in the history text books that are being used in the schools.  The Minister for Education has an obligation to look at all these text books and where in his judgment they are designed more to foment hatred and misunderstanding than to portray the glories of our past, he should direct the attention of the educational authorities responsible for these publications to the fact that their duty is to record history and not to use the complex event of history for the purpose of engendering hatred and resentment in this generation against people with whom we ought to learn to live in good neighbourly relations.</P>
    <P>When one sees young fellows going out and being shot, when one sees young fellows engaging in that sort of <Col N="204" /> daft activity that one sees them engaging in at present, nothing is more certain than that they have allowed themselves, in the vast majority of cases, to be misled into this kind of activity as a result of the education they have received in the schools to which they have gone where they were taught that it was their duty to hate and where they were exhorted to believe that there was something admirable and desirable in reacting today to the distressing events of 300 years ago, and their simple enthusiasm, which one cannot but in some degree admire, is very often deflected by evilly-intentioned persons to a very bad end.  If they were better informed from the history books from which they learn the story of the past these young men would not be so susceptible to misdirection and misguidance as they now are, with disastrous results for themselves and for the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>There are only two details with which I wish to deal.  There is £13,370 provided in this Vote for the National Gallery, but <i>My Fair Lady</i> is providing a great deal more.  I always used to be ashamed of my life when I was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee when reading in the annual Vote the appropriation for the National Gallery to acquire pictures, which was some derisory sum.  They used in fact to save it up from one year to the next: &ldquo;Purchase and Repair of Picture: Grant-in-aid Subhead B, £2,500.&rdquo;  You would want to save that for about 20 years before you would get the price of one picture worth hanging on the walls of the National Gallery.  However, that problem has been largely resolved by <i>My Fair Lady</i> who is now pouring a golden flood into the coffers of our National Gallery which I assume will be used with prudence and discrimination in acquiring suitable pictures for display there.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the National Gallery has nowhere to display these pictures, but it is much worse than that.  The cellars of the National Gallery are full of pictures and we hope there is an exhaustive list of them.  That itself is very doubtful because to go through them and find out what they are and prepare an <Col N="205" /> inventory of them is practically impossible.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the House that, in my judgment, the situation in the National Gallery is such that precious canvases may suffer irreparable damage because there is no place to hang them; there is no place to store them properly and they are simply stacked in the cellar.  I think they are being stacked with all the care and anxiety that can be shown by the staff available in the National Gallery but there is no room to handle them properly.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister ought to be able to complement in some degree this golden flood from <i>My Fair Lady</i> by, at least, envisaging the provision of some extension of the Gallery, which I believe is possible, where the new acquisitions could be shown and the existing stock could be properly stored if it is not possible to display it all at the same time.  I am not asking that provision should be made to display all the pictures at the same time.  Few National Galleries in the world are in a position to do that, but the pictures that are not on display ought to be properly accommodated for their safe-keeping so that in due course they can be taken out in rotation and put on display.  I would urge that strongly upon the Minister, because it would be a grotesque reflection on this country if, having fallen in for this fortune of bequests, we have the money to acquire paintings but no room in which to show them.</P>
    <P>The last detail to which I wish to refer is a phrase employed by the Minister in the course of his speech. It does not appear in the Irish version of the speech, I am happy to say.  In-the Irish version the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>An titim i líon na leanaí ins na scoileanna saothair go ndearnadh tagairt di le roinnt bhlian anuas ...</P>
    <P>He says on page 13 of the English translation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The downward trend in the numbers detained in industrial schools, which was referred to in previous years, continues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> Is that an appropriate phrase: &ldquo;detained in industrial schools&rdquo;?  It is a mistake to think that industrial schools are places of incarceration. They are very largely homes for orphan children and are looked upon as such.  They are not to be associated in the mind of the people with reformatories and so forth.  It is true that some children are referred to industrial schools who get out of control at home but the majority of the children in industrial schools with whom I am familiar are, in fact, orphans who, if they had not an industrial school to go to, would have nowhere to go.  They look upon it as their home.</P>
    <P>I make no great consequence of this phrase because I know that the Minister realises as well as I do the kind of paternal service these schools provide for many of the children committed to their care.  I thought the word &ldquo;detain&rdquo; grated a little in this context.  I hope the Minister will agree with me that, while theoretically it may be correct, in fact, it is scarcely appropriate to describe the relationship that exists between these schools and the majority of the children in them.</P>
    <P>I cannot conclude without asking the Minister to give us some account of what he has done for what I used to call Summerhill and which is now Marlboro' House, a place of detention. I cannot find any reference to that in his speech at all.</P>

      <P>Where?  The only reference I see to it is the following: &ldquo;I am happy to be in a position to say that a suitable site has been obtained for the premises which it is proposed to provide in lieu of the Place of Detention at Marlboro' House.&rdquo;  The Minister is going to construct a new building, but what are we doing for the children there at this moment?  This matter has been troubling me now for the past quarter of a century.  We have succeeded in letting in the light and improving things a good deal.  I did ask on a previous occasion whether <Col N="207" /> the Minister ever visited Marlboro' House</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, do.  You are not the first Minister whom I have exhorted to do that.  This place was originally intended for two purposes&mdash;one for the detention of children on remand and, secondly, for the accommodation of children in transit between their homes and industrial schools or between one industrial school and another.  The result is that you get a very mixed and transient population of children of all ages and in all circumstances. One finds in Marlboro' House, as I found many years ago, children from two years of age up to 15 years of age.  In those bad old days the children were all in one large room.  The eldest was on remand for an indecent assault on a girl while the youngest was just able to walk. That was 25 years ago in Summerhill. There was no segregation in those days.  They were not even allowed to go to Mass.  A good many of those faults have now been corrected.</P>
      <P>I have continually urged upon the Minister that children on remand there should receive some proper examination by a child psychologist.  There is now an institute, run by the Brothers of St. John of God, who undertake that work.  I would urge the Minister, if it has not already been done, to avail of the services of these Brothers.  District justices should have sent back to them with a child, when he is to be finally disposed after a period of remand, an informed report of a competent child psychologist as to what is truly wrong with the child, if there is some psychiatric defect in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not within the Minister's province because there is this strange dual responsibility, the Minister for Justice is responsible for the child up to the door of Marlboro' House, the Minister for Education is responsible for the child inside Marlboro' House.  Then he loses his responsibility again when the child leaves Marlboro' House.  I believe that, if and when, a proper psychiatric <Col N="208" /> examination is undertaken of these children for the guidance of the district justice who must ultimately dispose of them, the psychiatric examination will indicate clearly the necessity for investigation of the child's familial background if the ultimate fate of the child is to be intelligently settled by the district justice.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge upon the Minister that, while he is building these new premises, he should visit the place and satisfy himself (1) as to whether the children are adequately provided for and (2) as to whether there is appropriate segregation in age groups and categories.  I remember once asking a previous occupant of the Minister's office, who for Constitutional reasons must be nameless, what his reaction would be if his son had been arrested and remanded to Summerhill. He said he did not know.  In justice to him he visited the place and said he would not be at all uneasy.</P>
    <P>I would have gone mad at the thought that a child of mine was incarcerated there even for a night at that time.  I think it is pretty bad still.  I am not making any reflection whatever on the people who look after the children.  They are doing the best they can but the facilities available are deplorable.  I do not think anybody fully appreciates the gravity of removing a child of tender years from its family background and putting it in this place on remand.</P>
    <P>It would be bad enough if the children were left there for a day or two but there is a practice growing up in the district courts in Dublin not only of accepting it as a place of remand but as a place of detention.  In some cases the district justice remands the child for a fortnight.  That is really a prison sentence.  Before you send a child away for a fortnight you ought to be pretty certain that the institution is properly equipped to deal with that problem.  To deal with a child on a fortnight's detention is one of the most difficult things to accomplish.  It is relatively easy to deal with a child who is there for a year but it is virtually impossible to deal with a child who is remanded for a fortnight.  It certainly <Col N="209" /> requires very highly skilled personnel if the child is not to suffer a permanent psychological scar.</P>
    <P>I think we are all much too much inclined to shrug our shoulders and think that it will be all right until you ask yourself the question: &ldquo;Suppose your own child was involved in this difficulty.&rdquo;  If you found to your horror and dismay that the district justice proposed to remand a child of eight, ten or twelve years to Summerhill there are those of us who would probably appeal and get writs of <i>habeas corpus</i> but simple people do not have recourse to those elaborate procedures and yet their children are just as precious to them as ours are to us.</P>
    <P>We have got to face the fact that a case may arise in which it might be necessary to have recourse to that extreme sanction of taking a child away from its parents.  But we ought to be certain&mdash;and this is a point I want to press upon the Minister&mdash;that, if we accept responsibility for taking a child out of its family circle, no matter how bad that family circle is or how much it has contributed to the child's delinquency, the duty upon us, if we accept responsibility for lifting the child out of its family circle, is to see that it is put nowhere in which it will not receive the best possible treatment in the power of the institution to give it.  We have no right to take a child away and dump it into a place which, in our hearts of hearts, we know to be thoroughly unsatisfactory.  I agree it is a good thing that new and better premises should be provided but, to tell the truth, I would sooner see children in a Nissen hut, under a good, and sympathetic, and trained staff, than see them in the grandest building you could put up for the money with an untrained and unsympathetic staff.  Pray, let the Minister interrupt me, if he will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that, but might I suggest that buildings take a long time to go up?  Why could we not be building up the staff we intend to have in the new building and <Col N="210" /> use that staff <i>ad interim</i> in Marlboro House?  If the Minister has it in mind to put the new institution in the hands of religious who have special training in this work, or, indeed, in the hands of any other body of persons who have special training, why should he not put Marlboro' House in those hands now and let them run it, inadequate as it may be?  At least we would have the feeling that any child who goes to Marlboro' House between now and then will have all the sympathy and understanding it is possible for us to provide for him.  I think that would be a comfort to us all and a vindication of us all in the discharge of the obligations of our responsibility.</P>
      <P>I like to look back on the figure I quoted at the beginning of my observations as evidence of the steady progress that both sides of this House are concerned to see made in education.  I do not believe our system is perfect any more than I believe that any other system is perfect.  I believe in sectarian education.  That qualification has almost come to be an indecent word in the ears of many people in this secular world in which we live.  I believe Protestants should educate Protestants. I believe Methodists should educate Methodists; and I believe Roman Catholics should educate Roman-Catholics.</P>
      <P>I do not believe in non-sectarian education and I rejoice that in this country we are prepared to provide sectarian education for any sect that lives in our community provided we can get enough sectarians to assemble to fill a classroom; and, sometimes, where we cannot get enough in any particular area, we send round a bus to collect them so that everybody may have the right kind of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reconcile myself to the fact that in order to serve that dominant end &mdash;I believe it to be a dominant end &mdash;there are certain disadvantages with which we have to put up, but we put up with them with our eyes wide open; and I believe that, in the long run, we are right to accept the handicaps with the overwhelming advantages for our own children, if we are Catholics, and for our non-Catholic neighbour's children, whether they be Protestants, <Col N="211" /> Presbyterians, Methodists, Jews, or anything else.  I believe that in this sphere, as in any other sphere, the scope for wide improvement exists, and the urgent need for improvement at present lies in the major reform that I have advocated here today, namely, the divorce of Irish from the notion of compulsion.  That may involve the locking up of the Minister for Defence in Marlboro' House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>From the tone of his conversation I should imagine that was the appropriate institution in which to incarcerate him&mdash;a place of detention for delinquent juveniles.  If the Minister carries out the reforms I urge in respect of Marlboro' House, then, possibly, the psychiatrists who will be in attendance there will be able to unwind the Minister for Defence sufficiently to make it safe to release him on the public again.  His attitude to Irish will provide its own requiem.</P>
      <P>I am not without a hope that a more sophisticated and illuminated approach on the part of the Minister for Education may produce what I believe the large majority of our people earnestly desire, and that is the revival of the spirit which was first manifested in the Gaelic League fifty-four years ago, which I like to think is reborn today in the Gael Linn movement, and which, if reintroduced into our educational system, may yet resurrect the ghost of the language and greatly improve the educational standards of all our people in all our schools.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Great emphasis is now placed on <Col N="212" /> education and we ought certainly in this country today value the opportunities that are available.  We are all familiar with the hardships endured by our forebears in the centuries that have passed and the difficulties they had to face and surmount in order to educate their children.  That is all the more reason why we should appreciate today the facilities and the advantages placed at our disposal by the State in regard to education.  It has been clearly demonstrated in the figures quoted by the Minister that there is a tremendous emphasis on education in all its aspects&mdash;primary, secondary, vocational and University. The numbers of pupils and students are growing year by year.  Added to the cost of helping to defray the expenses of education, there is the added burden on the State of providing the schools.</P>
    <P>There is one rather peculiar anomaly in the educational sphere.  The four systems are more or less in competition with one another.  No effort is made to integrate the systems in order to ensure continuity.  No one is more competent to judge and measure the travesty of that situation than the operatives engaged in the various systems of education.  We have, first of all, the primary school, which is the only academy to which a big percentage of our children go. Those who are lucky enough or well-circumstanced enough will go on to the secondary school.  But there is no continuity at all as between the secondary and primary to give the child an opportunity of following the calling in which he may show a certain proficiency. That is a great pity.</P>
    <P>You could have a child with a great aptitude for languages, with a great memory or a mathematical turn of mind.  It is a pity that from the start that child could not be put into the channel most useful to him or her in after life.  Except for the very retarded child bordering on the imbecile, teachers know that every child has some latent gift.  Some have it in their hands; others have it in their feet, and may become great dancers; others have the gift of music <Col N="213" /> and are able to play any musical instrument.  These are all gifts of nature.  Some children, however, are very slow to learn and it is the child, slow in its reactions, that causes the most worry to a teacher in a school. For that reason, there should be integration between our systems instead of the competition we have to-day.</P>
    <P>One thing I deplore is the publicity that secondary schools indulge in nowadays in order to capture entrants. That is putting too much emphasis on the commercial side of education. Rather should the desire flow from the parents of the children themselves. They should not be in any way attracted by very grandiose advertisements and results of all kinds.  Some people condemn results very much. They are hardly fair to the child of slower intellect.  It makes them rather sensitive.  I was very much struck by what Deputy Dooley said today about the Primary Certificate in the national school.  Nobody condemns it as an examination.  What is to be condemned &mdash;Deputy Dooley is quite right&mdash;is the compulsion which forces every child who has attended a certain number of days to sit for that examination.  Any teacher in a one, two, or three teacher school knows that children are very sensitive.  He who is with those children from 9 o'clock in the morning until 3 o'clock in the afternoon knows every phase of a child's character.</P>
    <P>When he finds a child slow in its reactions and not competent to be promoted, the teacher is always influenced by the sensitiveness of the child and invariably he promotes that child, even though the child is not really eligible for promotion.  He does so simply to save the child from that embarrassment because of its sensitivity.  That is something the Department of Education should appreciate.  Take that compulsion out of the Primary Examination and it could be made a worthwhile step in the progress of national education.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said by Deputy Dillon about the teaching of Irish, with much of which I do not agree at all.  We owe a lot to our national language.  Deputy Dillon said there was a growing volume of opinion <Col N="214" /> that there might yet emerge in the world one language only.  We have had various languages from the earliest times.  We all know about the Tower of Babel.  We all know that the Apostles were sent to preach in divers tongues almost 2,000 years ago.  Languages will always exist.  Our forefathers spoke our native tongue and I believe that, through that, we preserved many of our traditions.  Certainly I think we owe our Christianity very considerably to the language we had here from earliest days.</P>
    <P>Personally, I love the language.  I think it is a pity that the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; should be used in connection with it at all.  From the very first day a child goes to school it has to learn all things by compulsion.  There is an all-Irish school in Cork and the results from it have been magnificent.  From the very day the child enters that school, it is taught nothing but Irish and everything through Irish, and the results can compare more than favourably with the best schools where they are taught through English or bilingually. I am not advocating that the child should be compelled to learn Irish in the infant stages.  Nobody is more fitted to express a view than the people who have been operating this system.  They know how far they can go with Irish and at what stage to introduce it.</P>
    <P>I believe if there were less emphasis on the written language and more on the spoken tongue, that three-quarters of our people would be bi-lingual to-day. I do not agree at all with Deputy Dillon that Irish should be made the hallmark of higher education.  If that is so, then it will be exclusive to the few and the language will die.  If the language is to survive, it must be spoken; and it is on the spoken language we should have the emphasis.  I think the Department's change of attitude in emphasising the importance of the spoken language was very wise, while at the same time lightening a bit the standard required on the literary side.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department are to be congratulated on easing the physical labour in the national schools by the lowering of the ceiling for the <Col N="215" /> appointment and retention of extra teachers.  It is really a physical impossibility for any teacher, no matter how proficient, to teach a class of 60 or 70, particularly at the infant stages.  All teachers know that in the past 15 or 20 years there has been a tendency to be insubordinate.  It is not so easy now to get children to apply themselves in school.  A person has to be a psychiatrist and a disciplinarian, as well as being efficient at his work, if he is to get the desired results.  I have no doubt that if the money and teachers are available, that burden will be eased further in the course of time.</P>
    <P>I submit in all earnestness that the Department of Education could do an amount of good in the way of checking juvenile delinquency by raising the school leaving age to 15 years.  It is between 14 and 15 years that children can fall into bad habits.  It is noted, too, that for a half-year before children leave school&mdash;very few of them finish out to 14 at all&mdash;they are always thinking of the day when they will get their feet outside the school door. Therefore, the last half-year is not always availed of to the maximum by some children with that mentality. We are all worried and perturbed by this delinquency, and that would be one of the best possible ways of checking that tendency, so obvious in our society in recent years.</P>
    <P>My main motive in speaking on this Estimate at all is to raise this question of the Cork School of Music.  There is a row on there at present and it is rather hard for anybody to understand the reasons for the dispute.  The simple facts are these.  There is a Youth Orchestra in Cork conducted by a man of outstanding merit in music, a magnificent teacher in every sense, who has a degree in music. Because the children from the School of Music take part in the Orchestra, they have been suspended from the School of Music.  It is the most highhanded thing I have ever heard of and I do not think it should be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister knows about it but I understand he has no function in the matter.  However, I put it to <Col N="216" /> him as a sensible suggestion that he should send some of his music inspectors down to Cork and let them see these children in the Youth Orchestra. Let the inspectors see them at their practices and then let them talk to the children's parents, to the members of the vocational education committee and to the teachers in the School of Music, and try to determine how to hammer out a means of ending this very undesirable and incomprehensible situation.</P>

      <P>It ought to be said that in recent years, particularly with the last three, four and maybe five Ministers for Education, there have been certain advances in the general matter of education and it should also be said that the present Minister has also made some desirable improvements. I think that ought to be said in view of the fact that most of us from this side of the House avail ourselves of the debates on the Estimates to make criticisms in probably 95 per cent. of our speeches.  However, there are still improvements to be made and the criticism that is levelled, and the suggestions made from this side of the House, ought to be taken in the spirit in which they are given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make only a few comments and my first is with regard to the Irish language.  There are various views in this House on the Irish language.  There are various views throughout the country on it, especially on the question of its revival. I have never seen or heard of more intolerance on any subject in recent years than there is from those people who suspect anybody who talks about the revival of the Irish language and who does not speak in accordance with what has been accepted as the <Col N="217" /> only method of reviving it.  Even from a Deputy on the other side of the House we, yesterday, heard something to the effect that the onslaught on the revival of the language had somewhat diminished.  I do not think there has been any onslaught on the language as such.  The onslaught has been on the method of reviving it. People like myself who have spoken on practically every Estimate over the past 10 or 15 years and have given our views on the method of reviving the language, have been regarded, more or less, as traitors to the language.  We have been described as unpatriotic, but, surely, there should be no necessity for some of us to protest in 1960 that we want to see the language revived.  We are not against the Irish language, but we disagree with the methods employed up to this to revive it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has now come somewhat to the viewpoint that has been expressed by the members on these benches, members of the Fine Gael Party and other Parties comprising the Opposition.  During the past two decades, it was advocated in debates that the emphasis be placed on the oral use of the language rather than the written word in the teaching of the language in the schools, and the Minister now admits that the introduction of oral examinations has been a tremendous success.  I think it is a bit late in the day, but the Minister did not make mention of the fact that this was advocated by certain members of the Opposition for years and years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only in the year 1959-60 that he has introduced what he terms an experiment and he went on to say that the experiment is a success. His words were:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is with much pleasure that I record that the change in emphasis from written to oral work appears to have caught the imagination of the schools.  This is evidenced by the steps taken by managers and teachers for the greater use of Irish as the vernacular of the schools, by <Col N="218" /> the introduction of many extra-class activities in Irish&mdash;discussions and special courses etc.&mdash;and by the increased number of students who spent some portion of their summer holidays in the Gaeltacht or in the Irish Summer Colleges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I remember saying something to that effect ten years ago and I remember Deputy O'Donnell speaking in the same strain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I also remember other Deputies advocating that from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Manley said that we should not use the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; when talking about Irish.  People take offence because we talk about compulsory Irish but I still wish to describe it as compulsory Irish.  Deputy Manley asks if all subjects are not compulsory but I should like to say that there is a vast difference in the compulsory method of teaching Irish and the compulsory method of teaching arithmetic, algebra, geometry or any of the ordinary school subjects.  We do not want to revive Irish so that it may be of use to the children in later years in industry, commerce or anything like that.  We want to revive the language because it is the language of the country and if it is compulsory to any degree, we cannot expect the young people to have the love for it that they should have.  There is too much emphasis on the idea of having the children word perfect, as far as grammar is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I honestly believe that if we cut out written examinations, its revival would come about infinitely more quickly, and when children have an expert knowledge of the language, they can then start to write it and study it as they would study any other language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many prejudices against the language and there is no use in denying that fact.  In many cases, there is justification for prejudice against it when there are certain people <Col N="219" /> in the country who get advantages by reason of the fact that they are competent in Irish.  I do not refer to those people who got their competency in the Irish language in the schools.  I am not prejudiced against the Gaeltacht, against any section of the Gaeltacht or any person in it, but I fail to see why these people should have any particular advantage in the matter of examinations over people from the Galltacht who do not have the advantage of Irish from birth.</P>
    <P>I want to see the Gaeltacht boy of 19 years of age who applies for recruitment to the Garda Siochána treated in exactly the same way as the boy from the Galltacht.  The procedure is that boys from all over the country do an examination and many of them pass.  Then there is the interview and the interview in Irish.  The boy from the Gaeltacht, who has the language from birth, has a decided advantage over the boy from Wicklow, Dublin, Louth, Tipperary or any other county in the Galltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education would have no responsibility in making these appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>He has no responsibility in that matter but I am trying to point out why there is prejudice against the Irish language.  I mention these matters because I want to see the Irish language revived but I do not want to see it abused.  That is why I say these things on the Vote for the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in regard to appointments to the Civil Service, candidates from Gaeltacht areas are given preference over candidates from the Galltacht.  That is wrong.  That is why there appears to be certain prejudice by people living outside the Gaeltacht against the Irish language. If the Minister continues in the way he suggests in the matter of the teaching of Irish in the secondary schools, there will be a better chance of reviving the language in a relatively short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the preference in relation to the teaching profession that is <Col N="220" /> given to students from Gaeltacht areas.  The Minister indicated that that will be an advantage, in that Gaeltacht teachers will have a very good knowledge of Irish and will be able to impart it to the students in the secondary schools.  That is good, but, over and above all that, it means that persons from the Gaeltacht are given a preference in seeking to become national teachers and secondary teachers, a preference which I believe they should not have.  There should be equality in this matter, and persons from the Gaeltacht should compete on the very same terms with persons from the Galltacht.</P>
    <P>The Minister should encourage the idea of Summer holidays in the Gaeltacht and in the summer Irish colleges.  There are many trade union and other voluntary organisations who organise summer holidays for children in the Gaeltacht and in the Summer Irish colleges throughout the country. In the fortnight or month the children spend in these colleges, they have a great opportunity of learning the language.</P>
    <P>In regard to oral Irish and written Irish, too much emphasis should not be laid on grammar.  Many Irish people visit France, Germany, Spain and other European countries and after a month there can express themselves in the native language so as to be understood, even though their grammar may not be correct.  If they had to be prefectly grammatical, they would not be able to utter a word. There have been many examples of intolerance by certain people in this country in the matter of the Irish language.  To some people it is anathema to speak ungrammatically. We should get away from that idea. If a person can express himself so as to be understood, irrespective of grammar, he should be accepted. There is a certain amount of intolerance which should be discouraged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Again, let me congratulate the Minister on the advance he has made in respect of the introduction of oral Irish into the Intermediate Certificate and Leaving Certificate classes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> There are only one or two further points I want to raise on this Vote. I mentioned most of them on previous occasions.  I think it was Deputy Manley or Deputy Coogan who suggested that certain other subjects should be introduced into the school curricula.  There is one subject in which I am particularly interested and which should be introduced, if only for a short time a week, in the last year at school.  I refer to civics.  It is highly desirable that that subject should be taught, if only for a half hour a week.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have spoken about vandalism and teddy boys and the abuse of public property.  Children in their teens have no idea as to what public property is.  A tree planted by an urban authority is just a tree as far as they are concerned and if they break a branch, they do not understand the consequences.  If, on St. Stephen's Day, they have an air rifle which they got for Christmas and if they fire at an E.S.B. light bulb, they have no idea what it means to break the bulb.  If they were told, in a very short and simple way, that for every tree they break, their parents will have to pay a little more in rates, there is a greater chance of the matter being brought home to them.  If they are told that if they break electric light bulbs on the street lamps, their parents will have to pay a little more in rates next year, they may think twice before doing it.  In that way the type of vandalism associated with the destruction of public property can be reduced.</P>
    <P>Children could be taught the rudiments of town and State finances. These appear to be very complicated subjects but they can be imparted in a simple and rudimentary way, so that children will have some appreciation of what public expenditure means, what public responsibility means, what their country means, how it is run and what it takes to run it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should inquire into the long hours that some school children have to work.  There is a law that industrial workers may work only 47 hours per week.  If they work longer hours&mdash;and there is no compulsion <Col N="222" /> on them to do so&mdash;they must be paid overtime.  I venture to say that there are some school children who work more than 47 hours a week at their studies.  I do not know whether or not it is a system designed specially by certain schools to cram children for examinations.  I know children who start off to school at 8.30 a.m., continue until 1 p.m., take three-quarters of an hour for lunch, come home to tea at 4 p.m., take half an hour or an hour for tea and return to school for another few hours or spend about four hours at homework.  That is wrong and unnecessary.  That sort of cramming is detrimental to children. If it does not affect them physically, it will affect them morally.  A child is not meant to spend his life entirely in study.  Children should have some recreation and recreation is an experience and education for them.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister who has only come in thinks about this.  I do not know if he got my first remark.  The point I am making is that there are some school children who work over 47 hours a week.  The Minister should take steps, through the schools, to ensure that there will not be long hours for children who are being crammed for the Intermediate Certificate or the Leaving Certificate or any other examination.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say something about the lifting of the marriage ban.  For how long will it be lifted?  Does it necessarily mean that for a long time to come married female teachers will continue in the teaching profession?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this was a temporary measure in view of the fact that we had a shortage of teachers. Will the Minister say what he is doing to ensure that we shall have sufficient teachers in future?  I made some observations at the time when the previous Minister raised the marriage ban and I said that the best way to get teachers was to pay them an adequate salary.  I still say that is the solution. In a country where we have a fairly high rate of unemployment in most trades and quite an amount of it in the professions it seems strange that in this profession we cannot get sufficient <Col N="223" /> people to do the work.  Surely if we want more teachers, the way to get them is to pay them a proper salary.</P>
    <P>It was the present Minister who took part in a discussion some time ago on education, the school leaving age and facilities for education and so on, and I was pleased to hear him say that he was contemplating the introduction of more scholarships.  He did not, however, expand on that.  I had hoped that we would have a system providing more scholarships so that the less-favoured children would be able to avail of secondary, vocational and University education.  So far as I am aware&mdash;and I should like to be corrected if I am wrong&mdash;there is no scheme for University scholarships outside those operated by the various public bodies.  I think there is none operated by the Department itself.  If we are to depend on public bodies only to provide University scholarships they will be very few because public bodies have been very niggardly in granting scholarships.  The Minister cannot do anything about that but he should consider the general situation as regards University scholarships and, so far as public bodies are concerned, the inadequacy of them.</P>
    <P>The Constitution says there shall be equal opportunity for every citizen and I suppose school-going children are regarded as citizens.  If we are to have equal opportunity for all citizens, I believe there should be many more opportunities for our school children to avail of University education when their parents cannot afford it.  Many people contend that we have too many students in our Universities but that does not get away from the fact that there are many brilliant children who should have University education but never can have it because their parents have not enough money.</P>
    <P>Perhaps when the Minister is replying he would give us the benefit of his views on the general question of scholarships, particularly to the University, and expand a little more on his statement in the recent debate when he said the question of increasing the number of scholarships was under active consideration by him.  I believe the Minister should take the initiative <Col N="224" /> and if the Department or the Government are not themselves prepared to establish a scholarship scheme I suggest that he might, after consultation with the different organisations such as the trade union movement, the National Farmers' Association, the Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Manufacturers and the Federated Union of Employers encourage these bodies to provide moneys for University scholarships for boys and girls who cannot now get, and never will be able to get, University education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Nationality is something which is most difficult to see but we recognise its insignia.  We are all very proud of our Irish nationality and its principal insignia are our flag, our games and culture and our language.  The flag is honoured by all citizens.  There is no compulsion to respect it or to fly it but we voluntarily respect and honour it.  There is no compulsion to play our national games and yet they are the most popular in the State.  They are thriving. There is no compulsion to practise our national dances and they are thriving, but we have compulsion&mdash;there is no doubt whatever about it&mdash;to endeavour to acquire the most important badge of nationality, our language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in having a badge if you are going to put it in a case and lock it away.  It is something of which we are proud and we must show it. There is no use in having the language unless we speak it and I agree with everything that Deputy Corish said and that we must concentrate more on the spoken language.  The very first time I spoke on the Estimate for Education here I appealed for more emphasis on the spoken language and less on the literary side of it.  I am convinced that the policy of teaching Irish through the years has been a total failure.  At least 80 per cent of the Deputies are over 50 years of age, or if you like, 60 per cent.  In other words, at least 50 per cent of them have received education through the medium of Irish and, if we follow this to its logical conclusion, 50 per cent of the Deputies should be fluent Irish speakers.  Let us be honest&mdash;are they? Are they capable of conversing in <Col N="225" /> Irish?  That is the true test of the success of our efforts to revive the Irish language.  If we are honest and admit that we have not been successful, then before it is too late let us attempt some other method of reviving Irish.</P>
    <P>I come from an area where Irish is fast dying out.  I could name townlands in my own native parish where Irish was the spoken language some 30 years ago but only the older people know the language to-day.  I am convinced that if those townlands were treated in the manner in which the Fíor-Ghaeltacht was treated, if students were brought in there, not during the summer months but during the entire 12 months of the year for the purpose of giving them a knowledge of the spoken language&mdash;or even for two or three months followed by oral Irish classes in the schools&mdash;we would be getting somewhere.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I really get mad&mdash;for want of a better expression&mdash;when I hear of referring our problems to a commission.  Since the State was set up, we have had nothing but commissions and where have they got us? We had a commission on vocational education; we had a commission on the Irish language; and now, I understand, there is a commission on the Universities and education generally.  I think it was the late Tim Healy, many years ago, after his experience of commissions for the Irish in the House of Commons, who said that when a commission sits, the matter drops.  If he had had experience of our Irish commissions, he would have said the same. So far as I can see, commissions are a total failure.  They are only a method of passing the buck, or of postponing discussions on some matter of the utmost importance.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Corish, I should like to appeal for a change in the curricula of the schools.  Deputies from all sides of the House, week in and week out, are asking questions of the Minister for Local Government as to when he will introduce a Road Traffic Bill. There is not much use in having Road Traffic Acts unless the people are educated into an observation of them. The time has arrived when we should have at least one class a week in all our <Col N="226" /> schools devoted to explaining the fundamental principles of road traffic, in the interests of motorists, the children themselves, pedestrians and other road users.  It would be a considerable advantage to these people, and to the safety of the children themselves now and later on when they grow up, to know the fundamental legislation in relation to road traffic.</P>
    <P>Again, like Deputy Corish, I appeal for some fundamental lessons in civic spirit.  We have all heard of the acts of vandalism, and we have heard of district justices pontificating as to what parents should do.  The school teacher has no opportunity of explaining to the children their duties to local government and to the national Government, and their duty to the property of the citizens of the State.  Elementary lessons should be given on those subjects.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer, which has caused me considerable worry, and to which I have given considerable thought.  Article 42.2 of the Constitution lays down that all citizens of the State are entitled to free fundamental education, and we have the School Attendance Act which says that children between the ages of six and 14 must compulsorily attend a national school.  What is the position in the areas of rural Ireland which are fast becaming denuded?  What are the provisions and the facilities to enable children in those areas to get an education?  Six may be the minimum age, but many parents are desirous of sending their children to school at four years, and many parents actually do send their children to school at four years of age.</P>
    <P>There are some scattered parts of the country where the school is three or four miles away from where the children reside.  We are anxious to know what facilities are provided for bringing them to school.  I find that one of the regulations laid down by the Department is that a grant-in-aid will be provided on this condition:</P>
    <P>There should be a sufficient number of children available for conveyance to school to ensure that the daily average number of eligible <Col N="227" /> children conveyed each quarter would reach at least 10.</P>
    <P>There are little pockets of populated areas in isolated parts of the country where there must be 10 children between the ages of six and 14.  The departmental circular goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In order to be eligible for conveyance to school by a transport service, a child should be between 6 and 10 years of age and reside not less than 2 miles from the nearest suitable National School, or be between 10 and 14 years of age and reside not less than 3 miles from such a school.  A substantial local contribution towards the expenses of the transport service should be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>Who is to guarantee it?  Who is expected to guarantee it?  Is it the parents, the teacher or the manager? If it is the manager, what facilities are placed at his disposal for the collection of funds?  Dances, I presume; draws and raffles; all of which are illegal unless held in a licensed dance hall or unless a permit is obtained.  Where is this money to come from?  Is it a levy on the parents of school children?</P>
    <P>Let us contrast that with the position in England.</P>
    <P>In England and Wales local education authorities are required to provide transport (without cost to parents) to and from school where the distance between home and the nearest suitable school, measured by the nearest available route, is two miles or more in the case of a child under eight and three miles or more in the case of an older child.  This is done either by providing special transport or by paying the fares by public transport. The cost in either case is met by the Authority concerned, their expenditure, in common with that of other educational services, being grant-aided by the Ministry.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon pointed out earlier today, we have increased grants for primary, secondary and University education by almost 203 per cent. in <Col N="228" /> some cases, but we have not increased by one penny the grant-in-aid towards the transport of children to school. They are expected to remain at home if they are under six years, and if they are over 10, they are expected to go by themselves.  Proportion of the cost will be paid by the State, and the remainder must be provided by the manager, but no suggestion is made, and no clue is given, as to how he is to raise the money.  I should like to see some further development towards providing for the transport of children to school, particularly during the winter months, and in inclement weather.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, in a place called Sliabh Liag the school was closed down because there were not sufficient pupils left in that locality, which, incidentally, is an Irish-speaking locality.  We hear all this talk about spreading the Gaeltacht, but in this Irish speaking locality, this school was closed down and no transport was provided to bring the children from the Sliabh Liag school to the nearest school at Cashel.  In that area, there are five families with 17 children in all&mdash;some, of course, have not yet reached school-going age&mdash;but on 22nd June this year, there were only seven children between the ages of six and 14 available for transport to the nearest national school and no transport was provided.</P>
    <P>To get to school, these children have to cross over one of the most rugged and exposed roads in the west or north-west of Ireland.  Very often in winter that locality is completely cut-off by very deep falls of snow. Very often it is pitch dark by the time they get home and there is no adult to take charge of them. They have to make their way on foot. All the facts have been made known to the Minister and we got the same answer: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo;  In a fast-diminishing population, we are told that, if there are sufficient children, free transport will be provided.  It is time something was done about that matter.</P>
    <P>Ninety-three per cent. of the additional expenditure this year is for <Col N="229" /> Universities.  At the risk of being misinterpreted, I say the Universities are the curse of this country.  Where are we to find employment in Ireland for all the graduates?  We have 5,000 students in University College, Dublin. We have approximately 1,500 students in Trinity College, Dublin.  Then we have the College of Surgeons, University College, Cork, and University College, Galway.  Every student there is a potential graduate.  Every student there is acquiring the education for a profession.  Where will they seek employment in this country in their professions? I do not know where they will find it.</P>
    <P>When I see ten students from the small Gaeltacht parish going up to the University on Gaeltacht scholarships and taking up the medical profession, I ask myself where we can place them in Irish-speaking parishes in Ireland. I find most of them are placed in Irish-speaking parishes in Chicago or on the East Side of New York.  Make no mistake about it: there are Irish-speaking parishes in Chicago yet where Irish is the spoken language, not the literary language, of the people.</P>
    <P>If we spent more money on vocational education, with more cooperation between the national school and the vocational school, if we made available in more parts of the country schools equipped for up-to-date vocational teaching where artisans' trades were taught, with scholarships available to these schools and fewer scholarships to the University, we would equip more people with the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; which they could use in trades or professions they would take up here in preference to becoming graduates of a University and being thrown on the export market.</P>
    <P>The Minister's colleague told us we are lagging very far behind in our school building programme.  It has nothing to do with this Estimate but there should be a liaison between the building of schools and the teaching in those schools.  I would ask the Minister to jerk up his colleagues in the Office of Public Works or, as it is sometimes known, the Office of Jerks, <Col N="230" /> because all it ever does is to work in jerks now and again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister for Education came back from his well-earned lunch before I began to speak.  On an essentially noncontroversial subject of this kind, 1 was seriously afraid that his substitute, the Minister for Defence, might prove unduly provocative.  I succumb more easily to dourness of that kind than to the infinite capacity which the Minister for Education seems to have, in the words of Shakespeare, to smile and smile and be a villain.</P>
      <P>As to the fundamental changes enunciated by the Minister, they are changes I could accept, if prevailed upon to accept them by the Department's experts, not alone with feeling, but with conviction.  Some of them refer to reforms which I have been advocating on this Estimate since I first became a member of this House. I want to refer to the very welcome change in the teacher-pupil ratio.  That is the only way to deal with a problem which is present in every school, the problem of the backward child who is in need of individual attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individual attention for backward children is possible only when the class is of such proportion that the teacher can get around to each pupil separately. I do not refer now to the mentally-retarded child or to anyone affected in that way.  I refer to the child who is slow to develop, slow to assimilate all subjects or a particular subject. With a smaller class and, consequently, a less harassed teacher, the needs of <Col N="231" /> the backward child are brought to the forefront and properly attended to.</P>
    <P>In such smaller classes, the teacher will better be able to judge the potentialities of each child and with it will come a decreasing necessity for corporal punishment.  I disapprove of corporal punishment if a child fails to answer a question&mdash;whether that failure be due to inability to answer or because the child overlooked learning the necessary lesson the evening before.  Education cannot be advanced by the administration of corporal punishment.  There are so few instances nowadays in that regard that it would appear that teachers are beginning to take the same view.</P>
    <P>Where an instance of undue punishment gets publicity in the courts, I am satisfied that such a case is a very rare exception of the teacher outstepping himself in corporal punishment. On closer examination, I am sure it will be found that a teacher who behaved in that manner should never have been chosen as a teacher and that the fact that he was chosen shows a defect in the system which is now happily being remedied, namely, that a child between 13 and 15 years is not, at that stage of his development, being asked to decide upon his future career.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are serious difficulties in the way of making adequate provision for the needs, including accommodation in suitable institutions, of the mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>I have been giving considerable thought to the general problem of the mentally handicapped, and have recently had a White Paper published on the subject.  As the Deputy may see from reading that Paper, the subject as a whole needs a great deal of study. As regards accommodation, there are 2,620 beds now available, and a further 600 beds are in prospect.  It is estimated that as many as 4,000 further beds may be needed, the capital cost of which might come to between £5 millions and £7 millions.  It would be quite impossible at the present time, or in the foreseeable future, to make funds of this order available for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, as is indicated in the recent White Paper, there are other problems involved&mdash;the best type and size of accommodation, the location of centres, the development of day or similar centres, the facilities for diagnosis of mental handicap, the type or standard of training of nursing and other staffs and questions of placement in jobs and after-care.  All these problems, apart from the formidable difficulty of finding sufficient money, need <Col N="233" /> further study before the best possible answers to them can be found.  The Commission of Inquiry which I propose to set up shortly will be asked to examine the matter thoroughly.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the developments aimed at providing substantial additions to present accommodation will proceed. These are outlined in the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the fact that the Minister for Education contemplates changing the purpose for which five of the preparatory colleges have been used heretofore?  Would it be feasible to use some at least of these preparatory colleges for the accommodation of children in this category, even if only as an interim measure, in view of the fact that, as the Minister knows and we all know, there are a considerable number of households in which children are awaiting institutional treatment of this kind and cannot get it because there is not room for them in the existing institutions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It occurred to me that probably the five colleges, whose present user the Minister was terminating, could be converted to the other purpose while suitable accommodation is being built or created elsewhere. Might it not be possible, <i>ad interim</i>, with the transfer of the existing amenities of these colleges, to use them if suitable religious orders, or bodies of persons, were available to man one or two of these colleges to relieve some of the urgent necessity for accommodation of children already declared eligible and for whom the local authorities stand ready to give accommodation if it were available?</P>

      <P>Arrangements have been made for the transfer of certain duties from clerical officers to lower grades and the amalgamation of those lower grades into one grade.  The change is designed to secure less dispersal of effort and more effective use of personnel and it should, in due course, produce a reduction in overall numbers.  Provision has been made for the review of these arrangements in the light of experience when they have been in operation for four years.

The consultations, which began in 1956, have taken place by correspondence and discussions&mdash;some of which were not exclusively confined to Ballycotton. Both the number of officers of my Department engaged in the consultations and the number of meetings held <Col N="244" /> are quite small and the cost would be insignificant but could not conveniently be segregated.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the question of corporal punishment in relation to primary schools.  I am completely opposed to the idea of corporal punishment being administered to a child who fails to answer questions, either because he is unable to assimilate the necessary knowledge or because he fails to make the necessary preparation.  I think that is largely a matter which must be dealt with by the necessary co-operation between the home and the school.  The same applies to this matter of vandalism which was raised by several Deputies. I would go so far as to say that there is very little by way of vandalism obtaining among pupils of the primary schools.  Deputy Corish must have been speaking with his tongue in his cheek when he says that the fellow with an air gun at Christmas who shoots at a bulb in a public lighting system does not know what he is doing by reason of the lack of the teaching of civics in the school.  I cannot accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that he did not know the effect of it on the town rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that even if he were told of the effect on the town rates, he would use an air gun in such circumstances.  The effect on the town rates would not have any influence on him.  The real test to be applied is whether that same child would use the air gun on an electric light bulb in his own house.  The fact that he would not is proof that he knows exactly what he is doing and the effect of it when he does it outside.  That does not mean that I am opposed to the teaching of civics generally in the school but I think that, by and large, the responsibility for good behaviour is a dual responsibility, that of the home and the school.  The major portion of the responsibility lies upon the parents of the children.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of transport in outlying districts raised by Deputy O'Donnell, I think that the rules of the Department are too stringent and are directed more towards the saving of money, or towards the apportionment of the moneys allotted, to be absolutely correct, rather than to the convenience and the well-being of the children concerned.  There would appear to me to be no good reason why, when the number of children falls below ten, transport should not continue for the weaker children in smaller groups in any village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary from now on that, where two schools are being abandoned and one being built at a more suitable place in the view of the Department and in the generally accepted view, transport <Col N="253" /> should be provided for the children who have to come longer distances than they had to travel to either of the old schools.  I am referring particularly now to a new school which it is proposed to build at Aughaglasheen in the parish of Kilmore-Erris in substitution for Shanahy and Tipp schools.  Having gone into the matter pretty carefully with the parents in Ballyglass area, I am satisfied that it is the duty of the Department to assist the manager in the provision of transport for the children of Ballyglass to the new school when it is completed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that there is an alteration in the system of recruitment for primary teachers now that the preparatory college system is being abandoned.  It is true, as the Minister says, that, when it was instituted, it met the needs of the time, but as it went on, I think, that the system developed a narrowness or, should I say, a lack of opportunity for that maturity and knowledge of worldly intercourse, which is so necessary for a person entrusted with the instruction of the young.  I hope that the new system will be a success, but I want to sound a note of warning to the Minister, particularly in relation to the preparations that have been made for the conversion of the preparatory colleges into class A secondary schools.  There is a danger that all the people, or a great majority of them, electing to attend what was a preparatory college, will experience the same kind of herding in another place.  That should be watched all the time.</P>
    <P>The children should be allowed to take their scholarships at the nearest local school.  In particular, their attention should be directed to the Diocesan colleges.  Children, who might secure scholarships with a view to taking up teaching, will have the advantage, not alone, as the Minister holds out, of going towards further scholarships and entering the Civil Service, but they will also have the further advantage, which they would not have in the absence of these scholarships, of pursuing a vocation for the Church in <Col N="254" /> some particular sphere, whether regular or secular.  In that way, you might probably be able to do some recruitment for secondary teaching either in the Diocesan colleges or colleges run by the regular clergy.  The competition will be broader.  Greater opportunities will obtain.</P>
    <P>While on the whole the preparatory college system is being abandoned for what I think is a broader and more erudite scheme, I am glad to see that the system in Coláiste Mhoibhi for Protestant children is not being disturbed. I should not like to think that the situation is being left as it is for the principal reason given by the Minister.  Perhaps, he did not mean this but it is something upon which he should elaborate when he is replying. What I understand from him is that the existing Protestant secondary schools have not got sufficient children with sufficient education in the Irish language or sufficient enthusiasm for the Irish language at the present time to supply recruits for teaching direct from their own colleges.</P>
    <P>I should not like to think that that is the real reason because I do not think it is a true reason.  I can find two instances in my own experience, having been on the staff of two such secondary schools which could not by any stretch of the imagination be called class A schools.  They did not have the enthusiasms with which we associate certain educational centres for the Irish language but then, in that regard, I am not at all at variance with James Joyce when he said that he distrusted enthusiasm.  The Irish taught in those two schools as a subject was taught adequately&mdash;not by me, I hasten to add &mdash;but by competent graduates from Trinity College who taught their subjects well and who successfully steered their pupils through the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate courses and through entrance to Trinity College. I can recall that some of them were so well grounded in the Irish language that they were able to compete with the more advantageous schools for higher posts in the Civil Service.  I should not like it to be thought that it would go out, from the Minister or anybody else, that the Protestant community <Col N="255" /> in this country are failing to foster the language which is the first official language of the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to industrial schools and reformatory schools, I appreciate the difficulty.  There are difficulties with regard to buildings; there are difficulties with regard to environment; there are the difficulties that normally flow from moving a rural delinquent and putting him in with a body of city delinquents whose delinquency is, if I may so describe it, of a more advanced character.  The rural delinquent is usally kept in detention for so long in the company of these rather citified delinquents that he goes back to his rural surroundings&mdash;if he does go back&mdash;more of a menace than when he left them.  That is not to say that one will not find as between city and rural areas an equally vicious juvenile delinquent in rural Ireland, rural England, or rural America, but the case is often as I have put it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's optimistic approach to the question of oral Irish in the Leaving Certificate and his statement that the experiment has proved completely successful is something to be received with great pleasure.  We shall have to wait, however, a little longer before we can adequately judge the success or otherwise of this scheme. The stress must be laid on the spoken language if it is ever to become the spoken language of all our people in their ordinary daily avocations in every walk of life.  That does not mean that I hold out this year, any more than I did last year, or any other year, that we shall become an exclusively Irish speaking country.  I do not think we shall.  I think time and circumstances are against it&mdash;our geographical position, our proximity to Great Britain, the extension of English even on the Continent of Europe and our daily closer and closer touch with the United States of America.  That does not mean that the development of the Irish language as a spoken language should be discouraged.  Far from it.  It has a great deal to offer by way of culture, mental training and patriotism.  But I think we are not moving with the times.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> I am told that some years ago Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge embarked upon a scheme of translating modern hit tunes and hit songs in order to give a modern slant to Irish.  I am also told that that scheme has been abandoned or put into abeyance.  A young secondary school pupil said to me the other evening that unless there are things like these songs and tunes&mdash;&ldquo;The Living Doll&rdquo;, &ldquo;An Babóg Beó&rdquo;,&mdash;there was not a hope for Irish. Unless we get our Irish Tommy Steels and others, we shall not generate the necessary enthusiasm to get young people into the &ldquo;swing&rdquo; of it, as it were.</P>
    <P>Everybody seems to welcome the advance of science.  I am sure it is a good thing but I would not like to think that science and technology generally would progress at the expense of the Humanities.  When you examine the world situation today, advantages and amenities apart, it is extremely doubtful if the peace of man's mind has been enhanced in any way and if the friendship between nations has been advanced in any way by this striking advance in technological pursuits and research.  In the days when the Humanities flourished, war and the implementation of enmity, if I may describe declarations of war in that way, were all carried out on a gentlemanly scale.  Armies went into the field and fought.  The Athenians used to taunt their Spartan victors, from their chains, by asking them: &ldquo;Were the dead on your side, gentlemen?&rdquo; They were asking, in other words, had the Spartans a full-blown education in the Humanities and philosophies. Nowadays, with the advance of science and the uses to which those advances are put, nobody has any opportunity of asking: &ldquo;Are the dead on your side, gentlemen?&rdquo; and, if things progress along the way in which they seem to be progressing, there will be nothing but dead on both sides.</P>
    <P>The Council of Education has yet to report on secondary education.  When it does, we shall look forward to examining it.  I am sure that worthwhile changes will be suggested.  I do not know whether the University Commission has been constituted as yet. <Col N="257" /> There is a Commission to study the revival of the Irish language; that has not reported yet.  It will be interesting to see what they have to say.</P>
    <P>The advance in technological education is striking.  So is the desire of parents and pupils to avail of that education.  I notice in advertisements by State, semi-State and private companies seeking employees that stress is laid on Leaving Certificate.  That is noticeable in areas where there is an absence of secondary schools but where there are technical schools and where the vast number of young people, male and female, have got their final qualification certificates from these schools. The stress in these areas should not be laid upon the necessity for Leaving Certificate but rather upon the technical qualifications.  They should at least be given equal status in the case of possible competitors for the vacancies advertised.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear a little more from the Minister as to what goes on in such places as the Institute for Advanced Studies and the National Gallery.  It is not enough&mdash;I think the Minister will agree&mdash;to tell the House that the increased Vote is merely to meet increased salaries.  We should like to know what these people do, what their output is, what research they carry out, what translation or original composition is achieved and, generally speaking, what contribution they make to the educational life of the country, because, after all, we all like to see a return for our money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish spoke of the niggardly manner in which public bodies make scholarships available.  I do not agree with him in that.  I think they do their best in every county, having regard to their resources.  It is possible that in wealthier counties more scholarship can be given, but, by and large, county councils and corporations have gone a long way to meet the demand of those who are not fortunately placed financially in regard to education. I think, however&mdash;and I agree with Deputy Corish in this&mdash;that our factories could give scholarships <Col N="258" /> according to their means.  If their means were large, they could give University scholarships, but if their means were not so good, they could give scholarships to secondary and vocational schools, perhaps to families of their employees.  The only people who have made any worthwhile contribution in that regard are the firm of Messrs.  Arthur Guinness in Dublin and a firm named Hygeia in Galway, which have instituted a scholarship at U.C.G.  It is a small advance, but, nevertheless, a welcome one and one that might well be followed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said the Universities of this country were a curse. Since we all agree that education is not a controversial matter, I hasten to add that it does not mean there is any essential difference of policy within my Party if I disagree with him in that regard.  He bases his argument that Universities are a curse on the fact that the vast majority of our graduates are potential emigrants to England, America, or any other country in which they can find suitable remuneration for the services they have to offer.  If we are to have emigration&mdash;and goodness knows we have enough of it&mdash;is it not better that those who go out should have a University education, that they should go out as educated Irishmen ready to play their part in the country in which they choose to work and live, to play their part in building up a great fund of prestige and goodwill for their homeland and by the excellence of their work, exalt this country and its attainments in the eyes of the people of the countries to which they go?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell talked, too, about the lack of instruction in the rules of the road in the schools.  I can remember from my earliest days in school when I used a copy book on the back of which was printed the rules of the road.  They were very simple, but reading those and taking into account one's natural instinct for safety, I think the matter of road traffic rules is well known to every child.  There will be the moments of carelessness in which tragedy will result but they are not due to any default on the part of teachers or parents.  There may be a <Col N="259" /> certain amount of carelessness but I do not think it is so great as to demand a general outcry against or denunciation of it.</P>
    <P>By and large, I must by conviction recommend the Minister's speech and pay tribute to him and to his staff, of whom I had some short experience. Perhaps they were pleased at the shortness of it.  Nevertheless, they are hardworking people, people who give great consideration to the matters with which they are entrusted; and the education of our people at any level is a very serious matter indeed and one in which we should all take the keenest possible interest.</P>
    <P>Great strides are being made and I do not think any particular Minister or Government can take credit for the whole of it.  It has been a systematic movement.  The only regret we can have is that when materials were cheaper and more readily obtainable, we did not build more, because the cost of school building at the moment, the cost of maintenance and indeed costs generally are almost prohibitive. Nevertheless, very good strides have been made.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general necessity for the teaching of civics, any teaching on this subject should take the form of asking our people to cooperate with the State in keeping our schools in good condition, thereby showing appreciation of what has been done for these schools.  The public should assist in maintaining them and making contributions when called upon.  In my experience, the State is very generous in dealing with schools in the more outlying and less well-off areas.  A certain minimum contribution is laid down for the parish in which the school is to be built.  From experience, however, I know that on negotiation&mdash;and many such negotiations are going on&mdash;the manager usually succeeds in getting the whole of the grant in some cases and very nearly all of it in the majority of cases.</P>
    <P>I hope that that system will continue&mdash;I am sure it will&mdash;and that the people in power, from whatever side of the House they come, will recognise <Col N="260" /> the difficulties of the people in the poorer areas.  That has always been the case and I hope it will continue to be the case.  I wish all concerned in the promotion of our educational system at any level the very best of luck and I hope that their efforts will be rewarded and the results obtained fully recognised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of what, I think, is his first annual Estimate.  I shall not wish him many happy returns but I would extend to him my good wishes for the effective discharge of his duties during his term of office.</P>
      <P>I cannot congratulate the Minister on the much-vaunted excellence of our educational system.  I see that only during last week-end the Minister was, so to speak, slapping himself on the back in regard to our system of secondary education.  I think there is a basic structural defect in our educational system, on which Deputy Corish put his finger in his concluding remarks here this morning: the position whereby our educational system is riddled with class distinction.  Only, I think, 25 per cent of those leaving our primary schools proceed to secondary education.  We have, therefore, an elite not of ability or of brains but an élite of privilege and of wealth to whom we entrust whatever positions of power and responsibility are available in this country.  We have the old system of two nations existing, of the privileged who have been educated and the underprivileged who have been denied what I think is every man's birthright: an education, so that he can bestow his talents to the best of his ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely every child who is mentally fit is entitled to secondary education but that is a state of affairs which does not prevail at the present time.  Again, I feel that there is a deplorable system of distinction between national schools and other schools.  I know that in rural areas every child attends a national school but that is not the case in Dublin.  Happily, that state of affairs is changing slowly.  It is now becoming more respectable than it used to <Col N="261" /> be to send one's children to national schools and I should like to see that distinction in the field of primary education disappear altogether.  I think every child under the age of 14 years should attend the same type of school, and those secondary schools at present giving primary education to children under 14 years should, so to speak, be incorporated into the over-all framework so that we would see the disappearance of this system of class distinction.</P>
    <P>Much has been said here this morning about compulsory Irish and, at the outset, I want to make it quite clear that I am completely opposed to compulsory Irish.  Indeed, I must say frankly that I have very little heart for the revival movement in any form because I have been so sickened by the humbug and hypocrisy which we have come to associate with the teaching of Irish in our schools.  The revival of the language has not succeeded. It has been a chronic failure and a most costly failure.  It was doomed to failure right from the start because it was based purely on an emotional appeal and I remember Edmund Burke's definition of emotion as the seducer of reason.</P>
    <P>To attempt to revive a dead language is completely irrational.  It cannot be defended on rational grounds, though, no doubt, 40 or 50 years ago, in the heyday of the Gaelic League, the language had a tremendous emotional significance.  It was in fact a symbol of nationalism.  However, it is not the only symbol of nationalism and I do not think it is an essential symbol of it.  The concept of &ldquo;Tir gan teanga, tir gan anam&rdquo; is something I do not understand.  I think it is a shibboleth. It is a falsehood belied by many nations in the modern world, the United States, Belgium, Switzerland and other countries, but primarily I think it has failed because it is irrational.</P>
    <P>I think the language movement has developed into an instrument of terror, of coercion, and indeed of jobbery. Deputy Dillon mentioned cases which came to his notice when he was a Minister in the Government of people with inferior technical qualifications <Col N="262" /> being appointed to official positions because of their knowledge of the Irish language.  That is a shocking, deplorable state of affairs and I want to say that I believe the idealism of the founders of the Irish movement has been exploited for an evil purpose.</P>
    <P>I want to quote here the writing of a very eminent authority, the Senior Professor of Celtic Studies in the Institute for Advanced Studies, Professor Myles Dillon, who, in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 7th December, 1958, had the following to say:</P>
    <P>The language is only one of many symbols and is valid only for those who choose it.  But unhappily it is rapidly ceasing to have any symbolic value at all, because it has been turned into an instrument of discipline. This wicked policy was launched in 1925, and it was inspired, I have long suspected, by a really evil purpose in the minds of a few people who pressed for it, namely, to use the language as a means of transferring power&mdash;or rather authority.</P>
    <P>At that time, as many of you will remember, all the cultural institutions of the country, except the National University, were in the hands of Protestants: the Royal Irish Academy, the National Library, the National Gallery, the Royal Irish Academy of Music, the Royal Dublin Society, the Museum, the College of Science, even the Society of Antiquaries.</P>
    <P>All of that must be changed, and the language was one of the means used.  Lyster, John Eglinton, Praeger, Best, George Coffey, Armstrong, Westropp, none of these men could have passed the test.  None of them would stand a chance of appointment now.  I shall not dwell upon that painful subject; but I believe that, far from helping the language movement, this turning of the screw has destroyed its value as a focus of allegiance.</P>
    <P>I believe that the pretence that Gaelic is the natural and native language of the majority of the people is an absolute fraud.  Gaelic was never the natural and native language of this <Col N="263" /> city of Dublin.  Never did any of my forebears, all of whom were Dublin jackeens on both sides for many generations, speak Gaelic.  The same, I think, is true of most of our cities, with the possible exception of Galway. It is many centuries since Gaelic was the vernacular of the people.  The humbug and hypocrisy which my generation have come to associate with the Gaelic revival is the most sickening feature of it.  How many members of this House know Irish?  How many of the Minister's colleagues in the Government know Irish?  Surely that is the acid test of their sincerity?</P>

      <P>It grieves me to have to speak as I am speaking here today, particularly because I am conscious of the fact that very sincere idealists on all sides of the House and throughout the country, people like the President, Mr. de Valera, and like General Mulcahy and many others on this side, have their hearts set on the revival of Irish, and it saddens me that their hearts' desire has not been achieved.  That is not to say that I would like to see it achieved.  I do not think it is either necessary or desirable and, as I say, I do not like to have to speak in these terms which perhaps are offensive to some of my listeners, but one is goaded into making a stand on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the example of seeing the Minister for Defence going to Mallow and speaking of the Fifth Columnists, those who are always the enemies of <Col N="264" /> nationalism, now coming out in force and strength.  We have something similar in productions such as <i>Rosc.</i>  Here is Connradh na Gaeilge which suggests in a recent issue that anyone who opposes compulsory Irish is guilty of treason.  The bitterness and venom of these people frightens me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not.  Sir, but I am referring to the spirit which has been engendered by our educational policy, and I take it that I am entitled to refer to the revival of Irish as being one of the main objectives of national policy, and to advance reasons why I think that is a bad policy and one which should be ended.  That policy is being implemented by the Minister through the schools.</P>
      <P>To give an example of that bitterness and venom which is so undesirable, one has only to read these productions I have quoted here.  There is something akin to the concept of the <i>herrenvolk</i> in the approch to this matter.  As I say, it frightens me very much.</P>
      <P>It is worthy of note that the majority of our national leaders in the past 300 years had little or no interest in the Gaelic language, even as a symbol. O'Connell had no interest in it; Henry Grattan had no interest in it; Dean Swift had no interest in it; Wolfe Tone could not speak it, and the same could be said of Robert Emmet and even of Davitt, to whom our small farmers owe so much.</P>
      <P>Again, the practice in our schools has been condemned by many eminent educationists.  I have yet to hear official spokesmen address themselves to the criticisms of the educational system led by such people as the Reverend Professor O'Doherty.  Again, of course, he is one of those who, because of their criticisms, are damned as West Britons, as being guilty of treason.  It is time we grew up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The language revival has been a failure and a very costly failure, costly in terms of £ s.d.&mdash;I suppose it would be impossible to say what it has cost <Col N="265" /> in financial terms-many, many millions; costly in terms of frustration and disillusionment, disillusionment which, I am confident, is driving many of our ablest people to leave this country in despair because they have had enough of the humbug and hypocrisy.  I believe that the real price of this failure can be measured primarily in terms of the lack of progress which we have made in real education in the best sense of the term, advancement in the social virtues, the turning out of mature people from the schools.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have asked whether or not we are turning out people with a mature outlook on life.  We have heard something about the teaching of civics.  There should be no need to teach civics as such in our schools if we were inculcating in our young people a proper sense of values, some respect for the social virtues and for the rule of law.  Take, for example, the shocking, scandalous outbreak of lawlessness in county Kerry recently.  Those unfortunates who are throwing dynamite around the place had their bellyful of compulsory Irish and small good it has done them.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of it is that our people are capable of such great things.  We possess real talent and imagination which is not surpassed in any European country or indeed anywhere.  We have an undoubted flair for leadership. Our people are capable of great things but are not being given a chance to develop their qualities or innate gifts. Instead, we have been concentrating in the schools on this folly.  The Department's folly has had the effect principally of turning out, not leaders of society, but first-class domestic servants and navvies for Britain.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned some Irish national leaders and their approach to this question.  I know it is fashionable nowadays to denigrate O'Connell, probably because of his approach to the language.  I should like to quote from something I was reading recently, where O'Connell addressed himself to this problem.  His remarks are as true today as they were in 1835, when he delivered them.  He was asked whether <Col N="266" /> the use of Irish was diminishing amongst the country people in Kerry. He said:</P>
    <P>Yes, and I am sufficiently utilitarian not to regret its gradual abandonment.  A diversity of tongues is no benefit; it was first imposed on mankind as a curse at the building of Babel.  It would be of vast advantage to mankind if all the inhabitants of the earth spoke the same language.  Therefore, although the Irish language is connected with many recollections that twine around the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue as the medium of all modern communications is so great that I can witness without a sigh the gradual disuse of the Irish.</P>
    <P>I have said all I wish to say about the Irish revival.  There are a few other points in the Minister's opening statement about which I should like to hear more.</P>
    <P>I am wondering why the grants under the Primary Schools Vote for the heating and cleaning of schools has been reduced by £5,000.  I have always understood that the grant was not nearly enough and that many school managers were dissatisfied with the amounts they were receiving from the Department.  The Minister is now decreasing the grants.  I do not think that can be desirable.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in the subhead for free school books for necessitous children.  The sum of £5,000 is being provided this year, as last year.  I know of at least one large national school in my constituency of North-East Dublin which received £6 to be distributed amongst many hundreds of children for school books.  Of course, it is farcsically inadequate. The price of school books is daily increasing.  There are many children of poverty-stricken families in the school I am speaking of and I know for a fact that the grant is not enough and that in some cases the teachers have to put their hands into their own pockets to provide school books for necessitous children.</P>
    <P>The Minister has reported on the extension of science teaching in the schools, which, of course, is a very good thing.  The extension is not sufficient. <Col N="267" /> I would hope to see science taught on a far wider scale because there is no doubt that this is a technological age and whilst those with the old approach to education might like to see a more liberal education in the Humanities being imparted in the schools, I am convinced that the future of this country is bound up with the extension of technological education.</P>
    <P>I wonder is there any chance of expanding the teaching of living foreign languages in the schools.  It is a shocking thing that only about 10 per cent of those leaving secondary schools are capable of understanding a foreign language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is indeed.  The whole trend of our policy is to withdraw in on ourselves, to develop this terribly narrow outlook.  Deputy Dillon referred to the teaching of history in the schools.  I am convinced that the fomenting of hatred in our schools or in the educational system generally is a very considerable contributory factor in the present trouble which has developed on the Border.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to touch on the University Vote.  At this stage all I want to do is to ask the Minister to tell us something more about a matter he mentioned when introducing the Vote for the Belfield project some weeks ago. I think he said that the question of the architectural competition for that project was a matter on which he had not yet made up his mind and which he was considering further.  I should like to know if he has reached a decision and if he can now tell us whether or not there will be an open architectural competition for that building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All is not well in U.C.D.  The Minister knows that only too well.  It is reported in this morning's papers that the Convocation of N.U.I. has passed a vote of censure on the administration on the College, and I <Col N="268" /> trust that the Minister will take note of that.</P>
    <P>To revert very briefly to a matter about which I spoke a few moments ago, I want to repeat that it saddens me that what I have to say about the Irish revival is offensive to some, but it would be futile to ignore the fact that the idealism of the founders of the Gaelic League has been exploited for an evil end.</P>

Now, because of the fact that the Dáil is not meeting on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Monday until Tuesday, the House is put in an impossible position with regard to a matter that would perhaps require urgent discussion today&mdash;and, perhaps, urgent action today.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that not only the Dáil but the country in general appreciates very <Col N="270" /> highly the amount of work that the Minister has done during his short term as Minister for Education.  He is kind to everyone and appreciative of their views and opinions and he has made or proposed such changes as he thinks will be to the advantage of education. I regret very much and consider with shame the views expressed by Deputy Byrne, but I feel they are quite individual opinions that do not apply to anybody else on either side of the House and so I shall leave them.</P>
    <P>I think we may all feel confident that the Irish language is making progress.  Wherever we travel, whether to the Gaeltacht or the Breac-Ghaeltacht or into those parts of the country where Irish had ceased to be the spoken language, the rising generation are able to read, understand and converse in their native tongue.  Last summer, it was my fortune to travel to the west of Ireland.  People were home on holidays there not only from this country but from many other lands&mdash; adults, people in business in various walks of life and it was certainly cheering to note that, in their entertainments and their conversation, they were able readily to turn from English to Irish and speak either language with the same facility</P>
    <P>In the various festivals where the youth of the country assemble, let it be in Dublin of the Pale or in the remote parts of our country, the children there assembled all converse freely in their own language.  That was not possible 30 or 40 years ago.  We all regret the depopulation which is taking place in some of the Gaeltacht areas but in many cases those people are coming into our cities and bringing with them the language of their forebears, the language of our country, one of the principal symbols of our national heritage and for the restoration of which the men of 1916 gave their time, their treasure and their lives.</P>
    <P>Some people are inclined to think that the teaching of the language is a drawback for some of the students in the schools.  If we go to An Mainistir Thuaidh in Cork or to any of the other schools throughout the country where the education is given through the medium of our language, we shall <Col N="271" /> see that in examinations or in any walk of life the pupils there are more than able to hold their own against any competition.  Those who take a different view are entitled to their opinion but, to my mind, they fail to see the facts or to understand the basic sympathies of our people or the traditions they have inherited.</P>
    <P>We should turn away from all the hopes of the past were we now, at this stage, not to put Irish in the forefront of our national education. Is there any country in the world with a language of its own that does not cherish it, teach it in its schools and whose people do not speak it among themselves at home and abroad?  It is a distinctive symbol of their nationality.  As Pádraig Pearse said, nationality is an ancient spiritual tradition.  That tradition permeates our race so long as we keep to those traditions which make us a distinctive nation.</P>
    <P>If we cast aside those distinctive symbols of our nationality, as Archbishop Croke said, we would abjure our nationality and become absorbed in a civilisation that is not ours.  It has been noted down through the years that the Irish people attracted those who came amongst them.  Some of them in the past became more Irish than the Irish themselves.  I hope that the spirit that animated those on all sides of the House who participated in the national struggle, and who had at that time the ideal of the restoration of our language and our other cultural attributes, will continue.  I trust they will preserve these ideals, embody them in our schemes of education and promote them in every possible way.</P>
    <P>We should not have to speak on these lines.  Irish nationality should be accepted as a fact.  Our cultural heritage should be embodied not only in our educational programmes but in our way of life.  It is regrettable when sometimes we hear these aims disparaged and put aside as if they were of no value.  Such is not and has not been the idea of any Minister for Education since we attained freedom for 26 of our counties.  It is the aim <Col N="272" /> and ideal of the Irish people through the whole 32 counties to preserve their national traditions.  The place where that ideal is first inculcated is in the home and, after that, in the school. By teaching the Irish language in the school, the rising generation have a chance which those of earlier generations, to whom Deputy P. Byrne referred could not attain.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Byrne said there is a basic structural defect in our education whereby the privileged and <i>élite</i> can go on to secondary and higher education and what he called the &ldquo;underprivileged&rdquo; cannot.  Our primary education is based on democratic lines. It is free.  Everybody has the same opportunity.  When it comes to higher education, when it comes to people getting some idea of the part they are to play in life, the time for selection comes.  Some may go into the business of their fathers.  Others may choose a different course.  Different schemes of education are open to them.  There are different fields of education at that stage.  Not everybody can enter the secondary education scheme because people will go into different walks of life.  It may not suit them to take that course.  Others will go into the vocational field and continue their education there.  Some must be content with the experience of life which comes their way and read and learn as best they can and fit themselves for their future.</P>
    <P>The scheme with regard to the selection of teachers which the Minister has changed about is very important indeed. I think the change is a welcome one.  Some people would be anxious to go back to the old monitor system, in which monitors were selected and had a chance to do some teaching at certain hours of the day when they were not studying.  When the time came, it could be seen whether or not they were fitted for the teaching profession. What the Minister has done is a step in the right direction, and will be welcomed generally.</P>
    <P>The giving of extra scholarships is, of course, a step in the right direction also.  It is difficult at times, particularly for people in the remote areas, to pursue the course of education they have <Col N="273" /> in mind, and these scholarships, together with those given by the local authorities, will be a great help.  We have not half enough scholarships in this country, unfortunately, but as time goes on, there will possibly be an improvement.</P>
    <P>The vocational scheme has made great advances in recent years and the winter farm schools, which are an extension of the vocational scheme, will be very advantageous.  They will help the rising generation of farmers to apply themselves more scientifically to their work and they will help the productivity of our soil in consequence of the better knowledge of those who work it.  I would ask the Minister, when these schemes from the various vocational and technical committees are before his Department, to study them in all their aspects and to study the conditions governing the admission of students to these schools.  Difficulties may arise perhaps during the terms, or during the year, in the application or interpretation of some of those conditions, and it would be useful and advantageous if, at the start of the year, the programmes were studied carefully in the Department.</P>
    <P>When we talk about our Irish language and our Irish culture, we must also consider our music and our songs. They do not get a sufficiently high place in the curricula, and there is a tendency to neglect them.  The Department should bear that in mind when considering the programmes for the coming year.  I do not wish to particularise or mention any school but from my experience I have no hesitation in making that suggestion to the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>One member of the House said&mdash;I think it was Deputy Dillon&mdash;that in his young days the people in the Universities were so interested in the national language that they gathered around the bandstand in St. Stephen's Green for the purpose of speaking the language.  That is not happening now. We are all aware that there are various Irish debating societies attached to the Universities which are doing wonderful work for the language, in keeping together those who are interested in its welfare.  They try to keep <Col N="274" /> a bias, at any rate, in favour of our native tongue.  Gaeltacht scholarships are now given in great numbers by various societies and by the trade unions, the Gaelic Athletic Association and other national organisations, and they send hundreds of young students to the Gaeltacht, during the summer.</P>
    <P>That is a feature of recent years which is bound to have very satisfactory results.  Unfortunately, when they come back, they go to rather scattered localities and have no opportunity of keeping together and using the knowledge they have gained.  At the same time, many of them become secretaries of Gaelic societies of various kinds, Feis committees and Gaeltacht clubs, and they are able to apply their knowledge in that way and communicate in their own tongue with the members of their organisations.</P>
    <P>The spirit of this debate from all sides of the House, with very few exceptions, indicated a recognition, at any rate, of the facts of our situation. Year after year, of course, there is a recurrence of condemnation of what is called &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo;.  There is no condemnation of compulsory English, arithmetic, writing, reading or the various other subjects.  Irish is on the school programmes and is there to be promoted according to the knowledge of the teacher and the capacity of the pupils.  That is, and has been, the policy of the Department of Education.  The idea that there is any special driving or anything of that kind is not in accordance with the everyday scheme of our schools.</P>
    <P>The standard of our education is at a good level.  Christian Brothers and various other teachers who have taught in various countries in the world are quite satisfied that Irish boys and girls, educated in our schools, can hold their own with the children of any land.  As well as that, they get a basic Irish training, a training in keeping with our ideals of Faith and Fatherland, which will stand them well in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I pay any tribute to the Minister or the Department, <Col N="275" /> I want to pay tribute to the Minister's two predecessors, Deputy Mulcahy and the late Deputy Moylan, for the manner in which they smoothed out the many difficult problems which confronted education in this country for a long number of years.  I am satisfied the Minister will follow in their footsteps and do a good job of work.</P>
      <P>This is a Vote which needs a very lengthy debate because it touches the homes and the lives of the people. The Minister is anxious to finish this Vote tonight, if at all possible, but if he has patience, the more he hears, and the different slants he gets, perhaps the better for him and the Department. I do not think we have anything to be ashamed of so far as our system of education is concerned.  We are making reasonably good progress with the resources at the disposal of the State.  There is very little illiteracy. Those who can remember 40 or 50 years ago will remember the vast numbers of people who could not read or write and who were steeped in ignorance. There is very little of that today, due to the work and the programme of education over the years.</P>
      <P>Before I go any further, I want to dissociate myself from what my colleague, Deputy Byrne, said on the question of the revival of the Irish language.  I am one of those people who comes from the land of the Pale and from the holding on which I live, I can see the ruins of perhaps 10 or 12 houses and churches levelled by the Saxon, and I think that the revival of our Gaelic culture and language is essential.  There was no need for the fight for freedom if we are to accept the Saxon yoke.  But the Irish people are a people distinct within themselves and they believe in their own culture and in having their own outlook.  They are entitled to that; our forbears fought and died for it and we, their successors, are proud to carry on the good work until it is completed.  Deputy P. Byrne is entitled to say what he did say.  This is a democratic State and it is grand to be able to say that we can sit and listen to other speakers and get up and repudiate them if we want to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> Primary education lays the foundation for the majority of the people in this country, that is, the three R's&mdash; reading, writing and arithmetic.  The vast majority have to be content with that and that is their lot.  We are sorry of course that we are in the position in which we are, that we are not a rich nation.  We are young in our freedom and we have not got the money.  However, if we are spending up to £17 million on education, we are doing fairly well.</P>
    <P>I agree that the teachers of the present day have a pretty difficult task. In the past, before children came to school, they were properly educated in regard to conduct and how to carry on and were under proper control. Today the vast majority of them come to school almost out of control.  They are almost like Red Indians and the teachers have the task of controlling those children.  The primary duty of parents is to control their children before sending them to school.  The lack of parental control is a problem but the teachers are making every effort to turn out the children in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>Another thing I should like to see is physical training being introduced in the schools where at all possible. There is nothing so ridiculous as the slouch which many boys and girls throughout the country areas have.  If you stand in the city of Dublin you will recognise the country girl or boy by the hump on their backs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see physical culture being introduced so that everyone would have a more manly stand and we would not be able to say: &ldquo;That is a country gombeen.&rdquo;  It should be part of the curriculum.  With the trend of things today, I believe there should be more groundwork in Christian Doctrine. Vast numbers of our young people have to emigrate at the age of 14 or 15 and they are not fully equipped either in religious doctrine or education to cope with the difficulties they will encounter across the water.  I believe the raising of the school age from 14 to 15 is essential.  These are the <Col N="277" /> formative years for the minds of young people, a time when they are able to receive instruction in a proper manner. If we could give them physical training and Christian Doctrine, both of which are necessary for the making of proper citizens, we would be doing good work.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to try to have the school-leaving age raised to 15.  It is a sad state of affairs to see a boy the moment he reaches the age of 14 stepping out of school with nowhere to go and no work for him at home. He gets in touch with somebody across the water and then goes there.  One can imagine a boy of 14 in a city like Birmingham or London, cities which are almost pagan in their outlook.  We know we must have emigration when we are not able to absorb our people. at home, but at the same time, we should fit them for emigration.  As I said, from the age of 14 to 16 is the most formative time in the life of a child.  You can either make or break a child in that period.  Another point is that they should be put into the F.C.A. or some such organisation where they can be given proper groundwork and at the same time their schooling can be carried on for a year or two.  These are essential things.</P>
      <P>In connection with secondary and vocational education, I am glad to say that they are going ahead by leaps and bounds and the people are beginning to realise how essential such education is in, the lives of the young.  I should like to see more co-ordination between the different educational departments.  You might describe them as being poles apart and I believe there should be one centre of education, with all of them dovetailed into one another.  I should like the Minister and the Department to consider that.  As far as I can see, vocational education is one thing that has come on rapidly in the past few years.  I remember 10 or 15 years ago raising that matter in this House and at county council meetings.  At that time, the vocational schools had only very few pupils. Where you had only six or eight pupils 20 years ago, now you have almost 60 or 100, and perhaps you would have 200 if there were room enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly it is something to be proud <Col N="278" /> of.  It shows that people are reaching for better education and fitting themselves out for the battle of life.  Today the battle of life is not like what it was 50 years ago.  Fifty years ago, you could get through life without writing your name, but this is an age of technical knowledge and technical education. We have a big task in front of us and the more co-operation there is between the Department and the different branches of education, the teaching profession, and the managers, the better it will be.  We need co-operation and co-ordination.</P>
    <P>The winter farm schools are an innovation and a very good one and they are bringing young farmers and workers together.  We are living in a mechanised age and it is only right that our people should get mechanised training.  It is something new which is catching on.  We are in the position that we can hardly find sufficient proper places to give this instruction. When we are building national schools, we should build them with an extra room.  In my county, we have migrants coming in from other counties with fairly big families and some of the schools which were built five or six years ago are not big enough now.</P>
    <P>To ease that position, we should build at least one decent-sized extra room when we are building new schools.  In the country areas, we have few halls and little hope of building halls.  While we might get a loan of some of the halls, we cannot get them frequently.  Therefore, our only hope is to have a class room to facilitate our people, farmers and workers and so on.  I would ask the Department to give that matter every encouragement to see what can be done about it.  We could expand the winter farm schools rapidly throughout my county if we had places in which to hold them.  Vocational education is going very well in my county and we are in the happy position that we have the parish priest as chairman of the committee and the Protestant minister as vice-chairman.  Politics are kept out and we are doing our best to spend the money at our disposal in the best interests of the people The provision <Col N="279" /> of itinerant manual instructors is an innovation and an essential one.  We have two in county Meath set up at different centres but unfortunately they are unable to cover the whole county. They are doing an immense amount of work helping farmers, young and old, to build houses and cow byres and to provide other essential buildings such as sanitary accommodation.  They also help them to fill up forms about which many people in the country know very little.  If we had more of these instructors, people would be very much enlightened in a short time.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that education in Ireland is progressing reasonably well and that anybody who makes little of it is only a shoneen.  Any of us who are old enough can see the improvement which has taken place in the past 30 or 40 years.  Almost everybody can read, write and spell correctly and if he cannot, it is his own fault.  Any child who goes to school can acquire a reasonably good education but let us not think this country is full of brains. There are as many duds as brainy people and you cannot put brains where there are none.  You will always find people who are backward through no fault of their own; they were not given the brains other people got. However, as a nation we can hold our heads high.  Many of our people who left this country with only a primary education reached the top in other lands.  Irish doctors, dentists and nurses are all over the world and we are proud of them.  There is a great demand for Irish nurses, especially in England, Canada and Australia, because they are people with character, perseverance and tenacity who are prepared to work hard to reach the top.</P>
    <P>We are also proud of our professional people at home, our teachers, doctors, dentists and nurses and other people who have availed of higher educational facilities.  It is the very same as regards this House.  A Deputy is appointed as Minister for Education; we do not know whether he will be good or bad, but for the past ten or 15 years every one of them has been a splendid man who has carried out his duties in an excellent manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> There is no need for shoneenism or for despondency.  People are marking time and are ready to advance again. A nation will always have a period of laxity and indifference after a difficult period such as the civil war period in Ireland.  The memory of that period and the bitterness associated with it are dying away.  I see new hope and new light and in the course of the next four or five years, this country will make a big advance.  If there is co-operation among the people, we shall be able to stem the tide of emigration. If we are able to give our people a reasonably good education, they will be well equipped for the world.  Therefore, vocational and secondary education is essential.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying there is class distinction in this country.  I see many boys and girls, some of them with mothers or fathers on the dole, trekking into the vocational and secondary schools every day and there are as many labourers' sons and daughters receiving higher education as there are other classes.  I would like if we had £17,000,000 more to allocate so that free education could be given to all but we must creep before we walk.</P>
    <P>However, in the past 20 or 30 years, a good foundation has been laid by all Parties in this House.  Each Party has contributed in its own way and eventually we can call on young Ireland rightfully to take over where we leave off.  We are overcoming difficult periods which our people have had to go through not only during the two World Wars, but over a period of 700 years.  We shall overcome all these things and the Irish language will be restored as the language of the people. Before many more years, it is not this House, the Minister or the Department who will be trying to revive the language: it is the people outside, organisations like Gael Linn, who have the spirit to revive the language.  Do not let us be cowards or whiners.  Ireland is ours for the making; let us make it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only a few points I wish to raise on this Estimate because other Deputies have covered the field of education adequately. <Col N="281" /> National teachers are paid twice monthly, on the 10th and on the 24th of the month.  Income tax is deducted from their salaries quarterly, at the end of March, the end of June, the end of September and in December. The December deduction comes at the Christmas holiday period and payment is made to the teachers prior to the Christmas holidays.  In practice, there are deductions by eight instalments from teachers' salaries.  These instalments are deducted on 24th March, 10th April, 24th June, 10th July, 24th September, 10th October, 24th December and 10th January.  Several teachers have a mere pittance to get prior to the Christmas holidays and I suggest to the Minister that he consult with the Minister for Finance with a view to having these deductions postponed to a more appropriate period than a festival time like Christmas.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of Deputy Manley's suggestion that the school-leaving age should be raised to 16 years.  In urban areas, particularly, young boys are not accepted to serve apprenticeship until they are approximately 16 years of age.  Therefore, from 14 to 16 years, they are in the best position to serve apprenticeship to juvenile delinquency and it is in that age group that juvenile delinquents are most numerous.</P>
      <P>The child coming home from a secondary school has sometimes to do four to six exercises and has a good deal of other mental work to do as well.  I believe the young boy or girl attending a secondary school has too much homework and I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Corish on this matter.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to look into the question of the deduction of income tax from the salaries of national school teachers.</P>

      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment, Deputy Barry gave notice that he would raise the subject matter of Question No. 32 on the Order Paper of the 18th of the month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 18th May, 1960, I asked the Minister for Lands:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>if he is aware that his Department have recently prepared for planting nine acres of very fertile arable land at Ballinvoher, Kilworth, County Cork; and whether in lieu <Col N="283" /> of allotting arable land for this purpose arrangements will be made to allot it to an adjoining landowner who owns eighteen acres and is very deserving of an enlargement of his holding.</P>
    <P>The Minister in reply said:</P>
    <P>The plot in question is situated in the middle of a compact forest block and it would be most undesirable from a management viewpoint to dispose of it.  The area has been in the hands of the Forestry Division since 1923.  Up to 1956 it was in use as a nursery. It is no longer required for that purpose and it is proposed to plant it in the coming winter.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to that I asked some supplementary questions and the Minister answered them.  As a result of the answers he gave me, I craved the indulgence of the Ceann Comhairle to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I believe that the question I asked was not answered in so far as the first part of it was concerned.  The first part of the question was: &ldquo;if he is aware that his Department have recently prepared for planting nine acres of very fertile arable land ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I pressed the Minister for an answer as to whether that was so or not.  I am afraid that he carefully avoided giving any answer.  In the four supplementary questions I asked him if he or his Department would agree that the land was, in fact, arable.  I am very conversant with this plot of land.  I have seen it on more than one occasion.  I had the honour and distinction some years ago of being selected by another Department to define what was arable land and what was non-arable.  I was a tillage inspector for the Department of Agriculture for four years.  At that time I worked in three different counties and none of my decisions at that time as to whether land was arable or non-arable was ever questioned.</P>
    <P>In the case of these nine acres, I have no hesitation in the world in stating now that they are certainly arable.  It was always my confirmed <Col N="284" /> belief that where land was arable it was not the function, the wish nor, indeed, the desire, of the Department of Lands to take such land for planting purposes.  We are assured by the Minister that this land is being prepared for planting purposes.  About ten days ago the Department's workers came in to plough this plot.  The owner of the adjoining eighteen acres asked the person who came in to plough to cease operations.  That man ceased ploughing.  Half of the plot is still growing rich green grass.  For that reason, I think that this is a matter of the utmost importance.</P>
    <P>The farmer in question&mdash;one could call him such with 18 acres of land&mdash; made a living with the aid of these nine acres which he rented from the Forestry Department for the past five years.  He now finds that this nine acre plot which is far better land than most of the land in these eighteen acres is being taken from him and ploughed for planting purposes.  All I can say is that the Department is taking the bread out of his mouth.  The eighteen acres which he now holds are of a wet nature.  The nine acres of which he had the use and which are within a short distance from him are a bit high and dry.  He could use them when he could not use his own eighteen acres.</P>
    <P>The disturbing feature about this whole matter is that this young man was recently married.  He qualified for a grant and put up a haybarn in this place.  There is a good slate house and outoffices.  His father and mother are still living with him.  They are both old people, in their 80's and 90's. Is he not disturbed when he finds, as he does, that because he will not have the use of these nine acres not only his young wife but his parents also must leave their home and go look for a living elsewhere?  I do not say that without knowing the position exactly.</P>
    <P>I have been seven years in the House and this is my first time to raise a question on the Adjournment.  I am putting it to the Minister in all sincerity that he should reconsider this case and see if there is some rule or regulation in his Department which would permit of the sale of the land. <Col N="285" /> Surely the Minister is a man of common sense and can use his commonsense to find some letting agreement to give this young man his own place? That can only be done if the Minister now consents to allow him by rent, sale, or any other arrangement, to retain possession of these nine acres which, in fact, are better than any of the eighteen acres.</P>
    <P>In one of the supplementary replies which the Minister gave he said: &ldquo;The plot is in the middle of a forest that was planted in 1926.&rdquo;  He is practically right there but I want to say to him that the plot is quite adjacent to this man's home.  This man has a right of way to a well fifteen yards from the plot.  In fact, the exact measurement is ten yards but I say fifteen lest I might be accused of putting the case the wrong way.  The Minister also said on that occasion: &ldquo;My information is that part of other lands which he holds was in the hands of the local autioneer for auction up to a few months ago.&rdquo; That is so, though I do not think he is right in saying it was in the hands of a local auctioneer.</P>
    <P>This man did make an attempt to dispose of a few acres about a mile away from his own home.  He did so because these few acres were at the end of a long, narrow boreen used by many other people.  There was some little trouble between this man and another farmer and, to get out of trouble, he decided to get rid of these few acres, if he could.  The Minister used that to make his case and I do not think he was quite fair in the way in which he used it.  He may have got some of the facts, but he did not get all the facts.</P>
    <P>I say this is arable land.  I inspected it exactly two months ago.  I found then four cattle and ten sheep on it. They were doing quite well.  I do not think the Minister disputed that it was arable.  Is it not strange to have this situation in existence as between two Departments of State? The Department of Agriculture is spending hundreds of thousands of pounds in trying to reclaim land which will never be usable as land. Here is the Department of Lands <Col N="286" /> planting lands which even to the casual observer is good, sound arable land.  I make a case for this man not because he is the man he is but as a matter of principle.  It will be a bad day's work if we cannot relax rules and regulations to give a man some small concession.</P>
    <P>I am anticipating some of the things the Minister may say.  The Minister may say that this man, or his father, sold this land to the Forestry Section, or to someone else.  What in actual fact happened was that this man's grandfather gave over this land many years ago entirely against his own wishes and inclinations.  It is true that he was paid for it.  It is also true that he did not accept the payment at the time.  The money was lodged in the bank.  Subsequently he drew it.  We all know what happened in those days. This man's father has told me, and I have no reason to disbelieve him, that he saw certain people come in and break up the spinning wheel in, the yard.  It is not an argument then to say that this land was sold originally.  It was not sold; it was compulsorily taken.  There is no other way to describe it.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister may say about the recent little bit of agitation there was in this area, but I can assure him there is a good deal of local feeling in this matter.  A great number of people have gone out to see this land since this agitation started.  They are all agreed that the land is good, arable land.  They are all agreed that it does not make sense to deprive this man of his living.  I wonder where will we get, if we continue annoying people in this way, the turnover of land necessary for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>Next week I shall have another question to the Minister with regard to the way in which the Valuation Office treats people when their land is taken over for forestry.  This man is an industrious young man.  His aged parents are residing with him.  They have a very nice comfortable home.  Recently a new hay barn was erected and grants were given for the reconstruction of outoffices.  In view of all those facts the Minister should seriously reconsider the position before he asks the <Col N="287" /> Department to continue ploughing the other half of this nine acres.</P>
    <P>With regard to the part that is ploughed, it will be quite easy to turn back the sod again into the furrow. The man himself will be quite prepared to do that.  If there is any fencing problem, as there may be, the man himself is quite prepared to go to the expense of putting up the necessary fencing.  He is quite prepared to lease or rent this land, or make any deal he can in regard to it. He wants it only for a few years until he has enough capital to leave it and get alternative accommodation.  The total acreage he has is 17.  The rateable valuation is £7 10s. on the land and £2 on the buildings.  He has had the land rented for five years from the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am unreasonable when I ask, for the sake of goodwill and, more important still, because of the principle involved in breaking up arable land for forestry purposes while at the same time spending thousands on reclaiming land which will never be arable, for a little more give and take.  Even at this late hour I appeal to the Minister, in all sincerity, to treat this man in a sympathetic manner and give him the opportunity of remaining in the country, with his aged parents, and the opportunity of rearing his family here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy has made a case.  I do not think that I was unfair to the man concerned in anything I said on this matter.  I gave the facts as they were given to me.  It is true that he had only a temporary convenience letting of this land for four years&mdash;not five as stated by the Deputy.  It is true that this piece of land is in the middle of a forestry development project.  With regard to the fencing, it would take in our estimation £300 to fence this piece, leaving aside all questions of fire hazard and so forth in having a small plot like that, held by an outside interest, in the centre of development.  Maps are available and I invite the Deputy to look at them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As to whether or not this land is arable, the Deputy is aware that it was used for forestry and it was not today or yesterday that this portion was taken over for forestry.  I understand it has been earmarked for forestry since 1923 and up to recently this particular portion was used as a nursery.  The man in whom the Deputy is interested got the grazing in 1956-57 for £20 for the eight acres involved.  In his view the value of the land is not the same as Deputy Barry's because he came back the following year to make a case to have the rent reduced to £16.  To use his own words, he said: &ldquo;You could not compare this land with other land for it is in the middle of a mountain and it is very poor and dry&rdquo;.  With all due respect for Deputy Barry's opinion, I got exactly the same information from my officials as to the quality of this land.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the quality of the land, it is not in general the job of the Forestry Division to do the Land Commission work of relieving congestion. Generally speaking, the Forestry Division get their land by agreement with the people concerned.  They do not look for arable land.  Where the land concerned is arable they invariably hand it over to the Land Commission to be dealt with by that body. As I have stated, this man has some of his own land up for sale.  He had only a temporary convenience letting of this piece of land for the last four years.  He made a case for a reduction in his rent because of the very poor quality of the land.  He has been, up to last week at all events, in the employment of the Forestry Division for a great number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think, in the circumstances, it is necessary for me to say any more in this matter.  It is essential from the forestry point of view that this small patch in the middle of a developed forest should be planted.  Outside the question of the rights and wrongs of <Col N="289" /> the type of land, there are questions of fire hazards and so on with a small plot like this in the middle of a valuable forest.  Having given every consideration to what the Deputy conveyed to me, I find myself constrained to agree with the judgment of the forestry officials in this matter.</P>
