    <Title>Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Bill, 1959&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister on the Second Stage of this Bill quoted the New Zealand Commission's report as adequate proof that the fears of reliable medical men regarding the possible disastrous effects of sodium fluoride on the human system are false and empty and without justification. As the Minister quoted at considerable length the New Zealand Commission's report, I, Sir, should like to quote three criticisms from people who are in a position to criticise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quote, in the first instance, a letter from Mr. George L. Waldbott, M.D., Michigan, U.S.A., a letter which has been published and which was addressed by Mr. Waldbott to His Excellency, the Governor General of Wellington, New Zealand.  He says, <Col N="228" /> concerning the New Zealand report which the Minister holds in such high esteem:</P>
    <P>The Report is characterised by opinions of biochemists, health officials and statisticians who have had relatively little or no experience with individual patients.  Nevertheless they are looked upon as experts on the purely medical aspect of fluoridation; their personal opinions are accepted as though they were facts.</P>
    <P>Dr. Heinrich Hornung's letter which has been widely propagated for flouridation promotion contains hearsay evidence blatantly contrary to the facts.  My research on fluorosis encompasses a large body of thoroughly worked-up case studies.  They now include extensive laboratory and biochemical studies with thorough follow-up.  To corroborate my findings and rule out other diseases, I habitually seek the advice of consultants who are recognised as highly competent in their own speciality.</P>
    <P>The Report quotes one sentence and half of a second sentence of my published statement making it appear that the second sentence was reproduced in full.  From the photocopy of the complete statement, it is clear that the facts are distorted by a partial quote taken out of context.</P>
    <P>That is said by a man who is quoted now by the New Zealand Commission. He rushes into print addressing a letter to the Governor General of Wellington, New Zealand, pointing out that he has been deliberately misquoted by a commission set up by the New Zealand Government which the Minister put before us as gospel truth which cannot be contradicted.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The important research by Dr. William Ramseyer of Cornel University and that of Dr. Alfred Taylor, Research Scientist at the University of Texas, is unceremoniously brushed aside: the first, by use of a memorandum; the second, by referring to Dr. Taylor's preliminary findings instead of the final <Col N="229" /> results of his highly valid experiments on 645 cancer-prone mice, which conclusively proved that fluoride at one part per 1,000,000 shortens the life-span by about nine per cent. Such valid research cannot be refuted by mere opinions.</P>
    <P>It certainly cannot be refuted by the Minister quoting from the hastily-arrived at decisions of the New Zealand report.</P>
    <P>Another criticism of the New Zealand report comes from J. F. Gwyther Richards, M.B.B.S., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.  He says:</P>
    <P>The report of the Royal Commission I regard as trivial and superficial because there can be in New Zealand no real experts on the total effects of sodium fluoride on human physiology.</P>
    <P>It would take 20 years of intense investigation to assess even in part the ramification of such a measure and it not infrequently happens that the unexpected side issue ultimately assumes supreme importance and dominates the situation.</P>
    <P>It takes great care and much time to make such investigations and the Commission's decision failing such investigation is worthless.</P>
    <P>Sir Ernest Marsden, President of the Royal Society of New Zealand, says in regard to the report:</P>
    <P>The Royal Society of New Zealand could usefully advise the Government on scientific matters such as fluoridation.  What is scientific opinion on fluoridation?  It would be most appropriate that the Government should ask us.  That is better than asking the department which is involved.  The Commission appointed by the Government, to study the desirability of fluoridation had only one scientist on it, so that its report is not really a scientific report at all.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that if the New Zealand Commission was serious about studying the whole effect of fluoridation it would certainly have called upon such a competent body of scientists as the Royal Society of New <Col N="230" /> Zealand.  They were ignored.  One scientist, himself a public health official, is the only person to have given any scientific evidence before the New Zealand Royal Commission.  That is sufficient, if not to cause us to reject all that is said by the New Zealand Commission, at least to make us have considerable doubts about it.  Certainly the Minister will have to go much further than quoting as justification for his Bill the report of this Commission which has been questioned by people who are in a position to question it.</P>
    <P>One wonders why water, a necessary commodity, is chosen for the purpose of passing this poisonous substance into the human system.  We all must have water.  If the human being has not got water he dies.  The human being can do without milk; he can do without vegetables; he can do without sweets, butter, jam, cakes and several other things which he voluntarily decides not to have.  The highly objectionable thing about fluoridation of water supplies is that any person living in a community which has a piped water supply must consume that public water supply if he is to live at all.  He has no choice in relation to the intake of sodium fluoride into his system unless of course he is lucky enough to be able to sink a well on his land.</P>
    <P>I might be prepared to go some way with the Minister in his efforts to fluoridate the public water supply if at the same time the Minister would introduce a scheme whereby the State would give a 100 per cent. grant to any person wishing to sink a well on his or her land and also if the Minister would provide the necessary facilities for people living in flats and tenements in our cities.  Of course the Minister would not dream of such an idea.  He wants to deny people the right to make a selection themselves. He objects to the phrase &ldquo;mass medication&rdquo; but that is precisely what this is intended to bring about.  This system of compulsory fluoridation of the water supply is deliberate mass medication.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his address said that those who oppose the fluoridation of the public water supply on ethical <Col N="231" /> grounds are unable to quote any authoritative opinion against this type of public medication.  I had hoped I might have been able to lay my hands on a copy of an encyclical of His Holiness Pope Pius XII but it is on record that when he was addressing an international conference of medical men&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not on record at all.  The Deputy is now about to misquote the Holy Father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not yet heard what I want to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Deputy is going to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad to think the Minister had taken note of what the Holy Father said but I shall remind him of it.  The import of what he said was that it was morally wrong to have mass medication, that it was morally wrong to subject the person to a course of medical treatment which he or she did not want, so long as the person was not suffering from a communicable disease which might do harm to his fellow human beings.  Of course if a person has some disease which is liable to affect the rest of the population, we are obliged to see to it that the public authority protects the rest of the community from that disease.</P>
      <P>However, it is an entirely different thing when a person has a hole in his tooth.  You cannot get a hole in your tooth from talking to another person with a hole in his tooth.  That is not something that can be passed on from one person to another; it is something that arises from the structure of the person himself.  Even if a mother has a whole mouthful of bad teeth or rotten gums she still will not infect the child born into the world.  It is not something which can be carried from one person to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that she had gums and bad teeth, would that not be reflected in her offspring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Bad teeth as the Minister correctly pointed out, can have the most damaging effect upon the whole human body, but we <Col N="232" /> have ways and means of reducing the effect.  It would be better for the Minister to encourage people to go more frequently to their dentist and to extend the free dental treatment available.  That is the kind of thing to which we should direct our energy and on which we should spend public money instead of laying out vast sums on fluoridation equipment and in injecting fluoride into the public water supply.  There are other ways of giving people fluoride if they require it at all.  This substance is of no use except from birth to the age of 16 years.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be stupid to spend this money when only one-seventh of the people alive in this country will benefit by it and then only for a short period of years.  It has been established that of the sodium fluoride put into the public water supply 99.99 per cent. will never be taken into the system of children; it will be washed away or consumed by people to whom it is of no use whatsoever.  Six-sevenths of .01 of the sodium fluoride will be consumed by adults and it will be harmful to them.  The remainder will be used for washing crockery and clothes, for sprinkling gardens, washing cars and for industrial purposes generally.  In Nebraska, in the United States, it has been calculated that it would cost $30,000 a year to fluoridate Omaha City water supply.  Of that only two dollars worth would be used by children, assuming that they still drink their proportionate share of water.  Only two dollars worth to the children&mdash; whom the Minister and myself want to benefit&mdash;at a cost of thirty thousand dollars per annum!  Only two dollars worth of that water would be consumed by the children.</P>
      <P>Again, in America statistics show that at present only one part in 1,500 parts of the public water supply is used for drinking and this fraction will continue to diminish with industrial use.  I am quoting from &ldquo;The Case Against Fluoridation&rdquo; by Dr. Robert Newton.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...not more than one-seventh of the part drunk is imbibed by young children who might benefit from the <Col N="233" /> fluoride.  Thus, about 99.99 per cent. of the cost of fluoridation is simply money down the drain.  Little wonder that Water Commissioner Ford estimated that New York City could supply fluoride tablets free of charge to families with young children at a fifth of the cost of a fluoridated water programme.</P>
    <P>Who were the main advocates of fluoridated water?  The manufacturers of fluorine and the manufacturers of sodium fluoride.  It is a perfectly natural commercial urge of theirs to want to see people buying 99.99 per cent. more sodium fluoride than is needed for the good of their children's teeth.  Many a shopkeeper would be delighted to sell 99.99 per cent. more than people needed; he would make a colossal profit.  The manufacturers of fluorine and sodium fluoride have made millions of pounds; they have done very well but they have done better than they deserve because, even if we were to give sodium fluoride to children, we need only spend a minute fraction of the amount spent in the past.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that when introducing the Bill the Minister did not give any figures of the cost of installing the fluoridating equipment or of the annual cost to the citizens.  I am informed that the cost per head of the population of flourinating the water supply in Dublin City will be about 6d. per head per annum.  I have no doubt the Minister will tell us that the rates will be increased only by a couple of pence but considering that only about one in ten citizens are ratepayers that means about 3/- on a ratepayer per annum.  That is the cost of fluorine alone; it does not include the capital cost of putting in the equipment nor does it take into consideration the fact that fluorine has a corrosive effect.</P>
    <P>Artificial fluorine has a much greater corrosive effect than natural fluorine in water.  It has been established in several countries where fluorine was put into the water system that some of the equipment was corroded with the result that they got an incorrect and an uneven distribution of the fluorine water supply.  Because of this, after a <Col N="234" /> period of years, you are faced with spending far more money on the replacement of equipment.  As far as I know no technical or engineering estimate in this regard has been obtained here.  Certainly no serious study has been undertaken in this country in relation to the damage which will be caused if we start tricking around with this most dangerous and corrosive substance in the pipe lines.</P>
    <P>Again I put it to the House that if sodium fluoride has a corrosive effect on steel, copper, iron and lead, what effect will it have on our poor bodies? Is it not more than likely that if it has this effect on something as strong as iron, steel and lead, it will have a corrosive effect on the human body over a period of 50 years?</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from a considered opinion regarding fluoridation of the public water supply&mdash;the opinion of the principal Water Commissioner of New York City which contains more than twice the population of this country.  In that city they have carried out an intensive research into fluoridation for over 20 years.  We have done it for a few years but we have never carried out an intensive study. We appointed a commission which read a few reports but which took no evidence and invited no evidence from those in the country who were competent to express an opinion.  I quote from a letter of Water Commissioner Ford dated 13th March, 1956:</P>
    <P>Under the City Charter, the Commissioner of the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity is charged with the responsibility of maintaining the purity and wholesomeness of the city water supply. The matter of purity has a direct bearing on the people, and involves the determination and evaluation of the tolerance of suspect, hazardous or toxic substance.</P>
    <P>The department has extensive laboratories staffed by reputable scientists and competent sanitary engineers, with a massive library in which is contained over 5,000 references on the subject of fluorides alone.  We have continued to study and evaluate the <Col N="235" /> effect of toxic substances as related to water supply.  The matter of fluorides has been under our scrutiny for over 20 years.</P>
    <P>The addition of fluorides to the water supplies is not coupled with the concern of maintaining or improving the quality of the water or making it safe.  No one has suggested that dental caries is a water-borne disease or that water is a cause of dental decay.  No satisfactory reason has ever been advanced to show why everyone in a community must be compelled to risk life-long extraordinary exposure to the toxic action of fluorides, particularly when safer, more effective and more economical ways of administering fluorides for caries prevention in children's teeth have been pointed and are available.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Ford continues:</P>
    <P>Whatever the merits of fluoridation, it would not concern us as a department if the question of water supply safety were not involved. But we are concerned, and, like yourself, in all conscience, our concern is primarily with the safety of the water supply for each and every individual of our entire population of 8,000,000 people throughout the City.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the fluorides are extremely toxic substances, and evidence exists to show that even at the recommended level of one part per million of fluoride in drinking water, people in fluoridated communities have been harmed.  A very small percentage among a population of 8,000,000, sensitive to the chemical and adversely affected, would constitute a seriously significant number of persons harmed.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>We know of reputable, independent medical authorities throughout the United States and in the local area who have found evidence of fluoride damage to persons living in fluoridated communities.  These medical authorities disagree with the <Col N="236" /> fluoride hypothesis, and they have raised grave questions with respect to the safety of the procedure for an entire population which includes the young, the old, the susceptible, and the infirm as well as the healthy.</P>
    <P>No one has made a claim that the ingestion of fluoride can be of benefit to the teeth beyond the formative years of childhood.  Because of this, and for reasons of safety and economy, this Department has proposed that the City distribute fluorine tablets through health stations, free of charge, for parents to administer to children.  The cost to the City, ascertained at less than 25 cents for a thousand days' supply for each child, would be less than one-fifth of the cost of a fluoridated water programme.  Tablets (a pharmaceutical grade in contrast with the commercial by-product used in water fluoridation), would provide an exact procedure, under control, to be taken only by those during the formative period of their teeth.</P>
    <P>Fluoride, besides being a toxic substance, is not all excreted when taken into the system, a significant percentage remaining cumulatively. Fluoridation of the drinking water at any level of concentration is a very indiscriminate procedure, since children drink widely-varying amounts of water, each according to taste, physical activity and seasonal variation of the year.  The daily intake of one child often differs greatly from that of another who may drink milk, fruit juices and soft drinks in abundance.</P>
    <P>How then, will each child receive its appropriate share of water having a given concentration in parts per million of fluoride?</P>
    <P>The problem of managing the control of dosage of fluoride chemical to obtain uniformity throughout a gridwork of more than 5,000 miles and tunnels involving different sources and pressure gradients, as in the New York system, is formidable. None of those who have made statements to the contrary have ever had the experience nor do they possess knowledge of what the exact result <Col N="237" /> would be.  Our concern and responsibility in the department is to provide the people of our city with a dependable supply of the purest and safest water possible.  No one can guarantee similar safety to all the people in the city of New York under a programme using the water supply as a fluoride vehicle.</P>
    <P>The people of the City of New York are entitled to know the risk they are being asked to assume before endorsing a programme involving so many questions yet unanswered.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the forum on the subject of fluoridation is not as open as it should be, even among professions. Although this reply to your letter is written at length, it is impossible here to do more than call attention to the complex nature of your fluoride proposal.  There has been too much of mass hysteria, blind following and lack of objective thinking by too many people on both sides of the question.  We believe the serious nature of what you are proposing and supporting deserves all of your objectivity in inquiry and thought, and a good look at all the facts.</P>

Is he a medical man, a dentist, a bio-chemist, a physiologist? Is he anything except a politician?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I shall be able to find the qualifications to which the Minister refers, but, as the Minister may see, I have done some considerable research in the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I shall find out for the Minister and advise him.  I am only too anxious to help him as he obviously has not done the same amount of research as I have in this matter.  Commissioner Ford is the head of the Public Water Department in the second largest city in the world and his duty, imposed on him by statute of the State of New York, is to supply a safe and pure water supply and he, having considered all the submissions put to him by the engineers and the scientists who advise the New York City Water Supply Department and who have carried out 20 years' research and examined 5,000 references on the matter, is that he should not fluoridate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants any additional qualifications, I shall be only too glad to ascertain what they are and give them to him.  If the Minister wants some expert opinion on the water, I would refer him to the following, seeing that he is so anxious to get the best opinion: Sir Arthur Amies, Professor of Dentistry in Melbourne; Sir Stanton Hicks, Professor of Physiology, Adelaide; Dr. Robert Newton, formerly Director of the Biology Division, National Research Council, Canada; Dr. Dymond, Minister of Health, Ontario, Canada; Dr. H.M. Sinclair, Reader in Human Nutrition in Oxford &mdash;I hope the Minister is taking a note &mdash;Dr. Dagmar Wilson, British Research Worker on Fluorides; Professor Steyn, Pharmacology, Pretoria; Doyen René Fabre, Dean of Pharmacy, Paris; <Col N="239" /> Professor M. Dechaume, Stomatology, Paris.</P>
    <P>There is then a man whose name and qualifications I hesitate to pronounce, but he is Dr. Beusch, Obermedizinalart, Frankfort-on-Main; and there are also the following: Professor H. Theorell, Medical Nobel Institute, Stockholm; Professor U. von Euler, Physiology Karolinska Institute, Stockholm; Professor P.H. Phillips, Chairman, Subcommittee on Fluoris, U.S. National Research Council; Dr. J. Forman, Past President of the American College of Allergists, Editor of <i>Clinical Physiology</i>; Professor J. Earle Galloway, Toxicologist, Drake University, Iowa; Professor C. McCay, Animal Nutrition, Cornell University; A. C. Ford, whom I have previously mentioned, Commissioner; B. C. Nevin, Director of Laboratories of New York Department of Water Supply, and C.G. Dobbs, Senior Lecturer in Mycology, University College of North Wales, Bangor.  There are others I could quote for the Minister if he again provokes me to help him with some other authorities.  I shall be only too glad to give him and his Department all the information at my disposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted various countries in which fluoridation programmes are now in operation but what he did not mention, of course, is that in many of these countries which he quoted, more people had rejected fluoridation than had accepted it.  In fact, in communities where it was in operation, less than six per cent. had voted in favour of it, and the rest of the people had never been given an opportunity of making a choice.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Canada and I shall, therefore, refer to the decision of the Ontario Health Minister, Dr. Matthew B. Dymond, to whom I have previously made reference. I shall quote now from a leading article in the <i>London Free Press</i>, of London, Ontario, Canada, of January 1st, 1959.  The writer of this leading article says:</P>
    <P>At least one prominent London orthodontist will join me in rejoicing <Col N="240" /> that Ontaria's new health minister, Dr. Matthew B. Dymond, opposes fluoridation of municipal water supplies.  This is a subject in which I have been intensely interested and on which I have written before.  I hope this will be the last time I have to write about it.  The Supreme Court of Canada has already forbidden Metropolitan Toronto to add fluorine to its water supply and, with this statement by Dr. Dymond, I expect the subject can now be dropped in this province at least.</P>
    <P>The Minister would endeavour to persuade this House and the Irish people that Canada has accepted fluorine in the water supply as proper, and yet the Supreme Court of Canada and the Minister for Health of the State of Ontario, which is larger than this country of ours, both decided that it was improper to put fluorine in the water supply.</P>
    <P>I shall quote further from Dr. Dymond.  He says:</P>
    <P>Although I believe that fluorides are beneficial on the basis of what I have read, I respect the doctors who say they aren't.  The doctors who oppose fluorides are not crack-pots... Fluoridation of water supplies is a &ldquo;hit and miss&rdquo; proposition because some people drink eleven glasses of water a day while others drink only one.  When I prescribe treatment for my patients I prescribe a stated amount.  It is not possible to prescribe a stated amount of fluoride by introducing it into the water supply.</P>
    <P>In fact, the only way in which the Minister could prescribe for the people would be to make it an offence to drink any less than a particular quantity of water, or any more than a particular quantity of water, but if the Minister were to prescribe that, he would be in trouble with the Medical Association and goodness knows, he is in trouble enough with them.  What would happen if he were to be prosecuted for prescribing? &mdash;but that is what he and his Department are doing. They are compelling every local authority in the country to prescribe <Col N="241" /> for the people&mdash;not even to prescribe after examination of the people but without looking at them.  What would happen if complaint were made in this House about a dispensary doctor prescribing a cough bottle for a roomful of people who were coughing, without looking at their chests or lungs? Would he not be struck off the register? Mind you, that is what the Minister and the Government are asking us to do, to prescribe for the Irish people without making an individual examination, which I always understood medical ethics demanded as the basis of any prescription.</P>
    <P>I shall return to Canada and quote further from the <i>London Free Press:</i></P>
    <P>Dr. Dymond has put his finger firmly on one of the most vulnerable spots in the arguments of the fluoridationists.  With an astonishing disregard for scientific technique, they have said, in effect: &ldquo;We want to add sodium fluoride to our drinking water so that children under 12 will have fewer dental cavities.  No matter how much or how little fluoridated water they drink, they are sure to get just the right amount of fluorine for their teeth.&rdquo;  No other medication since Hippocrates has ever been dispensed in such fashion. Even so common, harmless and universally-used drug as aspirin has to be used in specific dosages.</P>
    <P>To my mind, a most significant statistic is that in a number of communities the number of dentists has increased after fluoridation of the public water supply.  If the arguments of the fluoridationists are true, how does it come about that there is more demand for the service of dentists after the introduction of fluoridation? It might be wondered why a large body of dentists are in favour of fluoridation, but I think the answer is quite simple.  The effect of fluoridation is to postpone dental caries, and any dentist will tell you it is easier to manage a patient in his middle or late 'teens than it is to manage a child from six to 12 years. It is perfectly simple.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there are any <Col N="242" /> dentists in this House but if I were a dentist, I should prefer to work on an adult who could control himself in the chair, rather than try to work on the teeth of young children who would snap at my fingers and roar and shout their heads off.  Of course it is much easier to operate on someone who will keep his mouth open, no matter what the pain, than on children who are difficult to control.  That is a perfectly understandable reason, but I do not think the convenience of dentists is sufficient to justify the harm we might possibly do to people who are compelled to take a dose of fluorine for their life-span of 50 or 70 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister also quoted Sweden as a country in which there is a fluoridation programme.  He did not, of course, point out what I pointed out last night, that the Swedish Parliament in November, 1959, voted against more fluoridation programmes.  I think it is most improper of the Minister to put a gloss on his side of the question by saying that Canada and Sweden have introduced fluoridation, when, in fact, in Canada, as I pointed out, the cities of Ontario and Toronto are against it.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted the report of the Royal Swedish Medical Board in support of his programme, against which I should like to quote an article from Goteborge Handels in Sweden on Monday, 24th November, 1958.  It says:</P>
    <P>The Medical Boards proposition concerning fluoridation of drinking water is unacceptable; this is the only conclusion to be drawn from the treatment of this subject at the exhaustive public hearing.  When three medical faculties and one dental college advise against the proposition, taking further steps along this line is out of the question. Added to the medical doubts are the misgivings on a legal basis.  As the Circuit Court of Skane and Bleking&mdash;</P>
    <P>I should mention the circuit court in Sweden is equivalent to our High court; there is only one court above it, the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>&mdash;points out, it is doubtful whether <Col N="243" /> enforced medication through public water lines can be considered permissible, under existing jurisdiction. One thing is certain: the necessary confidence in the programme cannot be mustered at this time.</P>
    <P>The danger is that, if we direct our public health and sanitary authorities to introduce this scheme, knowing full well that a large and sensible proportion of our people are opposed to it, the confidence of the Irish people in public health authorities will be destroyed.  That would be most regrettable.  In view of these opinions, these doubts on the part of competent people who have no axe to grind, unlike the propagandists for fluoridation who have an axe to grind&mdash;they have their own businesses, and profits, and naturally they are interested in them and are anxious to promote the idea&mdash;the Minister should reconsider the matter.  These medical experts and these impartial judges are worried about the proposition.  In the light of such worries, the Minister would be doing a serious injustice to the Irish people&mdash;would, in fact, be cruel to them&mdash;in asking them to accept compulsory fluoridation of public water supplies.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to refer to yet another Swedish opinion&mdash;the opinion of Professor Hugo Feorem, bio-chemist and Nobel prize winner.  On 1st March, 1958, he made the following submission to the Royal Swedish Medical Board:</P>
    <P>As far as is known the toxicity of the fluorine ion is due solely to its inhibiting effects upon many enzyme systems.  In assessing the role that these enzyme inhibitions may play extreme caution is called for, as a large number of unknown factors enter here.  The example of lipase inhibition by fluoride in such small amounts as 1 part in five million... may be taken as an illustration.</P>
    <P>Swinging back again across the Atlantic Ocean, we have the opinion of five heads of departments and senior consultants in New York hospitals published in the <i>New York Times</i> on <Col N="244" /> September 20th, 1959.  These eminent medical men say:</P>
    <P>We can see no justifiable reason why everyone in the city should be needlessly subjected to any degree of life-long risk such as is created when a known poison is added to water.</P>
    <P>These opinions are, I think, deserving of as much consideration as is anything the Minister has said.  In Norway, another country quoted by the Minister, two elderly ladies, fearing the effect fluorine might have upon their rheumatic complaints, took the matter to the Norwegian Supreme Court and the decision of that court was that it was against the law of Norway compulsorily to fluoridate public water supplies.  If there are any few pockets of compulsory fluoridation still left in Norway, it would appear the public health authorities implicated are acting contrary to the law and are leaving themselves liable to prosecution, and possible damages, so long as they continue to fluoridate public water supplies in the teeth of the decision of the Norwegian Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>On the face of this evidence, I can only describe as irresponsible that portion of the Minister's speech in which he quotes these various countries as evidence of justification for the infliction on our people of compulsory fluoridation of public water supplies. What can we do to improve the situation here?  I have no hesitation in stating that I am utterly and completely opposed to the compulsory fluoridation of water supplies.  So far as this House is concerned, we have a duty to ensure that we spread, over as large a number of people as possible, the responsibility for taking this decision.  Ethically, I still think it is wrong that any local authority should fluoridate a public water supply unless every consumer in the area is in favour of such fluoridation.</P>
    <P>Fluoridation is a form of compulsory medication which some people would not wish to have.  We, in Fine Gael, are taking the stand that it is desirable to extend responsibility and bring it closer to the community, the parish, and the family level, in order <Col N="245" /> to allow those who have a reasonable objection to approach their local authorities so that each local authority can examine the matter in the light of its own needs and in the light of the incidence of dental caries in its particular area of jurisdiction.  That is why I urge on the Minister that he should not go further than the report of our own commission which recommended the introduction of the enabling Bill.  Why should he set himself above the collective wisdom of all our public health departments?  If he accepts an eanbling measure he will at least be making a worthwhile gesture towards those who have reasonable objections to this highly obnoxious proposal.</P>
    <P>As Deputy M.J. O'Higgins pointed out, the Minister may fear that if he makes it permissive rather than mandatory few, if any, local authorities may adopt fluoridation of public water supplies.  But that is all the more reason why he should make it permissive and not impose it compulsorily. If local authorities, which are composed of representatives of the people, feel they should not fluoridate public water supplies, that is a very good reason for not doing it.  If the Minister were to introduce a new section authorising local authorities, unwilling to fluoridate public water supplies, to provide fluorine tablets for children, he would at least be providing fluorine for those children who are supposed to benefit by it and he would also be enabling local authorities to help children while, at the same time, not endangering the health of others.</P>
    <P>There is a section in the Bill which provides that regulations made by the Minister shall be laid on the Table of the House and shall be binding unless rescinded within the next subsequent 21 days of either House of the Oireachtas. I refer to Section 8.  I am not clear whether that includes any Order by the Minister that a particular health authority shall fluoridate its water supply.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter for the House. It seems to me it is intended to apply only to regulations he may make with regard to equipment, the amount of <Col N="246" /> fluorine to be put in the water, or the manner in which the fluoridated water is to be distributed.  I do not think it covers a Ministerial Order that, say, Tipperary County Council should fluoridate all public water supplies within its jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It is most desirable that the Minister should include Orders of that nature within Section 8 of the Bill, so that it will be open to some member of the Dáil to move that a particular area be omitted from the effect of a ministerial Order.  Such a provision is not contained in this Bill.  I am sure it is contained somewhere in the local government code.  I am not too sure what sanction the Minister has in relation to health authorities who might refuse to obey his order.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority, I should far rather suffer the dismissal from office of a local authority rather than be a party to a scheme such as is proposed in this measure.  I feel the dignity and integrity of the individual must be preserved.  This Bill has one clearly-declared intention, that is, the intention of invading the human system, irrespective of the consent of the person, with a certain quantity, but an uncontrolled quantity, of a very dangerous substance.  On that account, the Minister should not lightly disregard the valid opinion of some most competent people who have spoken and written and campaigned against the compulsary fluoridation of water supplies.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to figures quoted by the Minister in relation to America. He says that some 44 million people in America to-day have compulsory fluoridation of water supplies in their community.  The Minister was speaking last April.  The statistics available to me from the <i>Nursing Mirror</i> for July, 1960, show the figure as 32 million&mdash;12 million less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was speaking in April last; I am speaking on figures for July.  The tendency in America is for the people to reject fluoridation.  The figures for 1958, for instance, show that in that <Col N="247" /> year communities totalling about 220,000 people accepted the fluoridation of public water supplies while 250,000 people rejected it.  The tendency the world over has been for communities to reject the fluoridation of water supplies (1) when given the opportunity of doing so, and (2) where fluoridation has been introduced without their consent.</P>
      <P>In New Zealand, to which the Minister referred at great length, several local authorities got the boot from the electors, when they got the opportunity, after they introduced the fluoridation of water supplies.  If one believes in democracy, in fair play, in Christian principles, one must reject as improper this proposed mass medication without the consent of the people.</P>
      <P>Some other figures that will no doubt interest the Minister come from Australia in February, 1960.  In the city of Chinchilla, Queensland, they refused fluoridation by a three to one vote.  In consequence, fluoridation will not be tried in the capital city, Brisbane, or in the second city of the State, Toowoomba.  Millions of people throughout the educated and civilised world have rejected fluoridation.  The fact that a larger majority has rejected it than accepted it should give us some serious food for thought and ought to discourage us from introducing it at this stage when so many people are doubting it.</P>
      <P>Suppose we admit for one moment the principle that the public authority has the right to put something into water other than something which will provide a supply of safe and pure water, where will it all end?  I quote from Professor John Davidson of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  He says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where trace of arsenic occurs, the people are said to be free of streptococcus boils and pimples.  In the vicinity of tin mines there are traces of oxide of tin in the water supply and the people are free of staphylococcus infections; when the water contains magnesium sulphate the people and cattle are not troubled by constipation; and where <Col N="248" /> the natural water contains a trace of fluoride the children are said to have fewer cavities in their teeth.</P>
    <P>It does not follow that we should resort to mass medication with all these chemicals because our natural water supply is free of them.  Strychnine is poison which is used in cough bottles for the cure of sore throats and the cure of chest complaints.  Is it safe, then, to put arsenic, oxide of tin, magnesium sulphate, fluorine and strychnine&mdash;the devil knows what&mdash; into water merely because some people believe it will discourage or cure various disorders?  There is no end to what we may be starting if we admit for one moment that fluorine should be put into the public water supply.</P>
    <P>It is no answer to say that we cannot put anything else into the water without coming back to the Dáil. There are very few medical men in the Dáil and the rest have to go on whatever research we can.  Not every Deputy or councillor will take the necessary trouble or has the time, the disposition or the capacity to consider matters like this.  I believe it should not be done on the strength of the Minister's introductory speech which is typical of the arguments of fluoridationists.  They believe in putting up Aunt Sallies and then shooting them down.  That is a most entertaining exercise, if you have nothing better to do, but it is not the kind of scientific opinion which ought to be put before us and before those who are not in a position to judge.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully ask the Minister not to take umbrage or offence at anything that may be said against the principle of the fluoridation of water supplies.  It is not meant by me as offensive.  Anything I have said or quoted is in the hope that I may urge the Minister to have second thoughts and that he will go so far with us as to make this Bill a permissive and not a compulsory Bill.  Very few local authorities have yet considered this matter.  Very few of our health departments have had the time or opportunity to consider the matter fully.</P>
    <P>I do not accept as conclusive the opinion even of our own commission. <Col N="249" /> It contains several worthwhile people but it is most significant that it did not take evidence and statements from people in a position to help them.  On that account, we cannot accept this as conclusive or binding.  The Minister should not go any further than their recommendation that it should be a permissive and not a mandatory Bill.</P>
    <P>I shall end as I began by quoting the <i>Richmond News Leader</i> of Monday, 27th October, 1958.  It is the article to which I referred last night where a person successfully took an action in the court for assault because, when he went into a store in that city, he was sprayed by an assistant with eau-de-cologne. It was held by the court that the storekeeper or manager had no right to assault the person by spraying him with any substance whether or not the substance was believed to be harmless. So long as the person objected to the spraying of the eau-de-cologne on him it was a serious assault and the court awarded damages and costs.</P>
    <P>There is this much to be said for eau-de-cologne.  It will evaporate after a while.  It will provide some kind of a nice perfume and may give a person a refreshing feeling on the parts of the body on which it is sprayed but at least it will evaporate and will not do any harm.  We are doing something far more serious.  We are compelling our people to take constant and repeated doses of a poison which builds up inside the person's system and which he can never get rid of.  If it is wrong ethically and in law to assault a person by spraying eau-de-cologne on him, it is a thousand times worse to put into his system, against his will, a poisonous substance which will stay there and which, it has been established beyond doubt, effects death in cancer cases.  It has a bad effect on pregnant women.  It is a poison which cannot be got out of the system.  It creates mental disorder. It has a whole string of known disastrous effects and God only knows what effect it would have over a period of years if this dangerous corrosive substance is put into the human system.</P>
    <P>This article concludes as follows and I would conclude on the same note:</P>
    <P>The city has a right to put <Col N="250" /> chlorine in public water, of course, because chlorine kills contagious organisms.  The city can require vaccination against smallpox, because the child with smallpox is a terrible danger to other children. The city can compel its residents to keep property well-drained and free of rats, because mosquitoes and rats menace everybody but these public health programmes deal with contagious diseases.  You can't catch a cavity in your tooth.</P>
    <P>What has become of this country's professed ideal of the voluntary society?  Why isn't this fluoridation program put on a voluntary basis, with fluoride tablets distributed through the schools to those who want them?  A free and independent people ought not to submit so tamely to the gratuitous ministrations of a bunch of professional wowsers whose logical reasoning runs as follows: &ldquo;I say this is good for children; therefore everyone must take it.&rdquo;  That is sorry logic, and it is sorry political philosophy too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this measure, we should have before us the general position of dental health of the country.  I think it true to say that we must be one of the most backward countries in Europe as far as dental treatment is concerned and that is not because we have not got a sufficient number of dentists because I understand it is generally accepted that in Britain they will not be able to catch up with the number of dentists they require there for at least 20 years at the present rate of output in the profession. While it can be agreed that dental caries are not contagious, at the same time we should not minimise the tremendous ill-effects on general health of bad and rotting teeth in children or adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan has very eloquently expounded his case but I think his enthusiasm has run away with him. All those ailments and aggravations of health which he attributes to chlorine poisoning could just as well be attributed to dental decay.  So many children in this country have bad teeth <Col N="251" /> that every mouthful of food they take into their digestive organs is poisoned. That affects eyes, ears, stomach and the whole health.  I welcome this Bill if for no other reason but that it focuses attention on the necessity for more care in dealing with the care of the teeth.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the remarks, one would feel that the Minister and the Department are deliberately and without due consideration jeopardising the health of the nation.  I, for one, am slow to believe that of any Minister in any Government in this country and I am certainly slow to believe it of any Department of State either.  I think we are very far behind most countries in Europe in the matter of dental health.  Certainly we could learn a lot from the Scandinavian countries in regard to the care of teeth. I wonder how much less our bill of costs for general health and hospitalisation would be if we had a better standard of dental health.  I hope Deputy Ryan did not mean one thing he said.  I think it was an unfair reflection on the dental profession to suggest that one of the reasons why they might support this is because it would make their job easier in dealing with adults rather than with children. I do not think that is true.  I hope he did not infer that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was carried to its logical conclusion, you could say the same about the medical profession and about a good many of our established institutions.  I hope the Minister will be fortified by history.  I do not think there was ever any worthwhile advance in medical science that did not meet with the most violent opposition from people whom one would have assumed would know better.  In my own time, I remember the outcry in my district against the pasteurising of milk.  We were practically told by certain sections of the community that pasteurised milk would poison everybody.</P>

As I have already said, I feel that it will serve a good purpose if it focuses attention on the need for more care in dealing with dental health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan has left very little for anybody to say.  I cannot avoid complimenting him on his very exhaustive contribution this morning and for the unlimited pains to which he has gone to provide evidence in relation to the case he was making&mdash;evidence that was very forcibly substantiated from the quotations he gave from the various authorities.</P>
      <P>The more one hears this Bill debated, the more one becomes confused. That confusion naturally arises because of the little knowledge we have of this whole question.  The Bill is unique in so far as it is the first Bill providing for fluoridation of our piped water systems.  It is unique, too, in the fact, as I stated already, that we have no personal knowledge or experience of fluoridation.  The whole case for it is based on all we hear of results abroad, and there again it is unique because the fluoridation of water systems is still in the experimental stage in other countries.  The Minister bases his whole case on evidence from various bodies in other countries and the Opposition bases their case on doubt and fear.  Because of lack of knowledge, the Opposition feel they have a responsibility to discharge before they could support a Bill of this kind, and feel they need to be thoroughly acquainted with all the pros and cons connected with fluoridation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pure Water Association of Ireland has disseminated some literature in connection with fluoridation and their evidence cannot be discounted. Many of the people in that body are persons of high standing in the country.  They are people who give <Col N="253" /> their time gratuitously and voluntarily, for no personal reason whatsoever, and they point out the dangers inherent in the fluoridation of public water supplies. Therefore, though the Minister bases his case on reports from abroad, I believe we are perfectly entitled to base our case on the fears we have, and on the evidence put forward by associations here and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister introducing the Bill six months ago, I was very impressed by his speech.  At that time, I had an open mind on the matter, but, from what I have heard and learned since, I feel we are premature in providing for fluoridation because it is something which has not been tried out fully.  The Minister has told us that fluoridation of water supplies can arrest dental decay in the under 10 age group.  I accept that, but what about the consequences in after life on people who will be drinking fluoridated water from their early years?  Nobody can say what these consequences may be. We also must realise that this is not a cure; it is a means to arrest dental decay.  Undoubtedly we are all concerned, as is the Minister, about the dental health of our people, but would it not be better to spend all the money involved in implementing this Bill and all the money that will be spent by local authorities on providing fluoridated water, on research into our whole dietary scale, into the foods we consume, because it must be these foods that are the cause of dental decay?</P>
    <P>How is it that people in other countries are not so prone to dental decay as we are?  Two years ago, it was my privilege to be closely associated with a Spanish student studying for the priesthood in this country.  He spent five years in a college here and what amazed me about him was the magnificent teeth he had.  Not a single one of them showed any sign of dental decay and I asked him how it was that he was able to preserve them in such a perfect fashion.  He gave me no reason.  He had never considered the matter at all.  He had his teeth from childhood and they were as perfect as the first day they appeared in his gums.  Why can we not have that <Col N="254" /> in this country?  Why can we not arrange our diet to provide safeguards against dental decay, other than the safeguard contemplated in this Bill?</P>
    <P>There is an old saying, oft repeated, that an apple a day keeps the doctor away, and I believe that hard fruit, eaten raw by children, could be a great deterrent to dental decay.  Apart from the cleansing effect that an apple in its raw state has, I believe that the coating of the teeth enamel by the acid in the apple has a safeguarding effect on the teeth.  I do not know what dental conditions in Spain are, and whether dental health there is as good as in the case of the individual I had the privilege of being associated with here, but I should like to ask could we not do a little research in that respect? Have we not got the physicians and dentists to do that?  Why are we so prone to ape other nations?  Have we not got the genius, the experts and the efficiency to do a little research for ourselves and satisfy ourselves about the merits and demerits of this contemplated fluoridation of our water systems?</P>
    <P>Since this Bill has been deferred for six months following its introduction, I believe it could very well be deferred for the next six years.  If it becomes law, each local authority will be discussing the pros and cons of fluoridation and we shall have conflicting views on it, a good deal of agitation, plenty of resolutions and deputations seeking to meet the Minister.  Why run the risk of all that confusion and doubt? The Minister is a little precipitate in this matter and, in all earnestness, I appeal to him to defer the Bill until we have a clearer conception of our obligations.</P>
    <P>We could do a little experimentation on our own and I ask why should we leave all the experimentation to other nations to do for us?  Can we not take the initiative ourselves?  It is a simple domestic matter in which there will be no political kudos to be gained and, in the absence of professional knowledge and experience, we cannot form adequate opinions at the moment. We can only depend on what we hear and read from other nations, but, even in them, there is no such thing as <Col N="255" /> unanimity in their approach to this question.  It is foolish to rush into this and the Bill could very well be shelved for a time, until we have fully considered the matter and are in a position to give our convictions with greater emphasis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons I rise to speak is that this Bill has been misrepresented by the Opposition as one the Minister is trying to shove down the necks of our people, saying that everybody should adopt the sections in it dealing with the fluoridation of water.  Surely, instead of that, it is a Bill which the Minister has introduced as the result of advice from his medical advisers? I have received pamphlets from the Pure Water Association and have even brought the members of it to meet the senior officials dealing with this matter and surely anybody with any common sense, in the House or outside it, must know perfectly well that no Minister of State and no medical adviser in the Department of Health will go so far as to recommend a particular proposal unless they are certain it is for the benefit of the people as a whole?</P>
      <P>Everybody is entitled to raise objections and give his points of view but recently I was at a meeting of the Dublin County Council and I resented very much some of the speeches I heard there.  The speakers against the Bill referred to the Minister almost as if he were a dictator and, when one has that vicious, uncharitable and complete misrepresentation of the facts, it is very hard to approach a measure of this kind in a calm, cool atmosphere and examine what is good in it as being designed to save the teeth of our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Healy's statement that many of the ills of our children are brought about by bad teeth.  This Bill was brought in by the Minister after serious consideration and on the advice of people who should know something about the subject.  In many rural areas where <Col N="256" /> there are wells of one kind or another, we have people drinking water which is not purified.  In such areas, we must do what we can to protect our children from dental caries.</P>
    <P>I do not like the approach by the Opposition who say that the Minister is forcing this on us.  The Minister has introduced the Bill after serious and careful consideration.  Surely no Minister would do anything which he thought would injure any of our people?  I have listened to the views expressed by my friends in the Pure Water Association.  They are entitled to their views and I asked them a good many questions.  One of them is a good personal friend of mine over a long number of years.  However, if we are not to accept the recommendation of our own experts that the Minister should introduce a Bill to eliminate dental caries, why have such experts at all?  I am not satisfied that the fluoridation of water will injure anybody, but the Minister is an intelligent man and I do not think he would be responsible for doing anything which would injure anybody.  I have every confidence in what he is doing, and I believe it is worthy of consideration by our people.  There is no use in saying the Minister is forcing this down the necks of the local authorities. If we had another Minister, an Opposition Minister, introducing something for the benefit of our people, it would be worthy of serious and charitable consideration.</P>

I resent very much the implication that this is the Minister's Bill.  That feeling is being created abroad and it is very unreasonable.  It is not fair to the Minister or to his Department.</P>

That is just exactly what we are asking the Minister to do.  If he will do that, we are prepared to agree to the Bill.  I take it Deputy Burke will act and vote with us in this matter, in view of his declared intentions? The problem is that the Minister says he will not allow the local authorities to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Pardon me.  I said that Opposition speakers on local authorities were completely misrepresenting the facts as we know them and that the proposal was being attacked in a vicious and unreasonable way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Deputy Burke said that this Bill was worthy of the serious consideration of the local authorities.  That is the very thing the Minister does not propose to allow.  That is the bone of contention between us.  I have strong views that if it is morally wrong for Oireachtas Éireann to fluoridate water, it is wrong for anybody else to fluoridate water.  However, I do not think a moral issue is here involved, but I think in a free society, you have to have some regard for the feelings of the people and that unless you have such regard, the law will fall into disrespect.</P>
      <P>This Bill is founded on the report of a commission set up to consider this question in the light of our circumstances in Ireland, and paragraph 41 of this report states:</P>
      <P>The Council is in doubt as to whether local authorities have the necessary statutory authority to add fluoride to public water supplies. It recommends the introduction of any legislation which may be necessary to enable local authorities to discharge this function.</P>
      <P>That is what the commission recommend. This Bill goes far beyond that. This Bill seeks, through Section 2, to give the Minister power to direct local authorities to fluoridate the water supply, if he thinks they ought to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan this morning has stated the case in its extremest form against fluoridation but there are a great many people who sympathise with Deputy <Col N="258" /> Ryan's view.  I think we have got to have regard to this fact in a free society&mdash;the fact that a great number of us think a certain thing is good for our neighbour does not give us the right to thrust that good upon him. Even if a great many people here feel that parents would be well advised to require their children to consume fluoride over and above whatever quantity of those minerals are to be found in their normal diet, I think it is a bad principle to go on to say that because that happens to be our opinion, we claim a right to enter the bosom of every family in the country and impose upon them, for their own good, what we think is good for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan made the necessary distinction today between the addition of chlorine to water for the protection of the public against infectious or contagious diseases and its use for other purposes.  There is a very wide difference in principle between measures directed towards the prevention of the spread of infectious disease and measures directed to the objective of preventing dental caries in the young.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong case to be made for the consumption of fluorides by children.  The views arrived at ultimately by the commission that we set up here are probably right but I think it is going too far for Dáil Éireann to arrogate to itself the duty of compelling the people to accept the validity of the conclusions of that commission.  I think the commission has indicated to us the right course, that is, that we should pass enabling legislation here which would permit the local authority, if the community for which it is directly responsible desires it, to fluoride its own water supplies.</P>
    <P>It has to be borne in mind that even if this Bill passes and these facilities are made available more than half the population will not have access to a fluoridated water supply at all because in all rural parts of Ireland where there is not a piped water supply the provisions of this Bill cannot operate at all, so that we are dealing with a relatively limited question, that is, the town and city communities which have piped water supplies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> I do not want to cover all the ground Deputy Ryan covered this morning but I cannot withhold a certain meed of sympathy from the case he makes which is: &ldquo;Whether you agree with me or whether you do not, you have no right to force on me or my children something to which I take the strongest possible exception for no better reason than that you believe that if you fluoridate the water you may protect some children from the early incidence of dental canes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If you are arguing in terms of strict logic you can say: &ldquo;If you object to Dáil Éireann doing that, why do you not object to the local authority doing it?&rdquo;  If a moral principle were involved, the rules of strict logic would necessarily apply.  I do not think there is a moral issue involved. It is a question of freedom and sound democratic practice and, in those circumstances, the nearer you can get to the community which is to be directly affected by a procedure of this kind the less objectionable the procedure becomes.  If the Waterford Corporation or the Ballybay Urban District Council, who are in close contact with the people whom they serve, reached the conclusion that in the special circumstances obtaining in their areas fluoridation of the water supply would be a substantial benefit, they would be able to stand over that but it is a hardship if the Waterford Corporation, the Limerick Corporation or the Carrickmacross Urban District Council strenuously objected on behalf of the people whom they represent to the fluoridation of their water supply that it should be in the power of a Minister in the Custom House to send down an order directing them to do it although the people strenuously object to it and urge that it should not be imposed upon them.</P>
    <P>I do not think you can ignore the views which Deputy Ryan mentioned of an eminent medical authority who pointed out that in certain areas, where there are tin mines, it was suggested that certain staphylococcic infections were rare and that in other areas where there were different kinds <Col N="260" /> of mineral deposits other kinds of common infections were rare.  The House will remember that that authority said: &ldquo;If you are going to adopt the fluoridation policy, why should not you go on to add tin, copper and everything else to the water?&rdquo;  There is that danger that we could reach the stage in which this House would claim the right to give us a whole wide variety of medication through the public water supply.  That is an unsound principle.</P>
    <P>There is the difficulty which I do not wish to conceal that I cannot isolate any fundamental principle here which would coerce us one way or the other.  I am obliged then to look round for a practical solution of the problem so exhaustively raised by Deputy Ryan and which concerns a not inconsiderable number of our people.  The only practical solution of it that I can discern is the one proposed in the report of the Commission we set up and that is that we should make it possible for the local authority to fluoridate its own water supply but that we eschew the temptation to impose that reform upon them.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister elected to take the bit between his teeth and go far beyond the recommendation of the Commission itself. With the evidence before them that in many parts of the world fluoridation has been rejected by local communities, it seems a bit extravagant for the Government here to propose that the decision for or against in this country should be centred in the Custom House.</P>
    <P>If there is a principle involved at all here, it is the principle of excessive bureaucratic control.  We have local authorities; we maintain them and I think it true to say that in general principle we should avoid transferring the powers of those local authorities to the Custom House.  As I understood it, that was the general philosophy of all Deputies here.  I do not know if there is any parallel for the proposals contained here giving the Minister power to direct the local authority to do something which the local authority itself feels it should <Col N="261" /> not do and, in so far as this should be quoted as a precedent for further action, I think it is a bad precedent.</P>
    <P>Our position on this Bill is, therefore, clear.  If the Minister is prepared to alter the provisions of Section 2 which give him the power to direct the local authority in this matter and to substitute for that power a discretion in the local authority to fluoridate or not to fluoridate as it may think best, we shall not oppose the Bill.  If mandatory authority is to be established to direct a local authority to do what it itself thinks it should not do in regard to a matter of this kind, we oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition has said that he sees no reason for compulsion in regard to the action which the Government propose to take.  I cannot agree with him in that conclusion.  The high incidence of dental caries is itself a compulsive element which cannot be ignored.  The incidence of dental caries is so abnormally high that it does not leave us with any real option but to take some action.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition now proposes that we should await the decision of local authorities.  I cannot follow him for a moment in his suggestion that working through local authorities is more democratic than working through the central Government. That could be justified only if one accepted the assumption&mdash;I think wrongly&mdash;that central Government was not a democratic body but that central Government was bureaucratic and undemocratic.  I, for one, do not accept that and I do not think the Leader of the Opposition in his heart of hearts accepts it either.  Why we should throw this back to the local authorities and expect them to have any more information or any greater wisdom we have, escapes me.</P>

      <P>I have the greatest respect for local opinion in Carrickmacross, or Dún Laoghaire for that matter, but if the Government had to ask people individually and collectively whether they were in support of a scheme before introducing or passing a measure, there would be sheer chaos. As I see it the purpose of a Government is to lead and to govern and not to be going back to the people asking: &ldquo;If we do so-and-so, would you approve?&rdquo;  We have been given, as any Government is given, a mandate to govern and if the people at any stage feel that the mandate has been exceeded they have their own remedy. I do not accept that any Government which is worthy of its task would keep on throwing its responsibility back to the smaller groups.  In this case I am very much afraid we would be giving in to small pressure groups only and not to any reasonably large body of public opinion as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition has objected to the fact that the Bill will give the Minister power to direct local authorities.  I do not agree with him in his interpretation of the report of the Commission.  The report of the Commission simply states that the statutory powers of the local authorities at the moment would not enable them to carry this out and that such statutory power would have to be given to them to enable them to do it. I do not regard that as a recommendation that the Bill should not make it compulsory for local authorities.  It simply states that, with the best will in the world, they are not able to do it at the moment.  We propose not only to give them the statutory authority to do it but to give them a statutory direction to do it.  If we believe that is a good thing to do, surely that is what a good Government would do rather than say: &ldquo;We believe this is a good thing for you to do but we leave you <Col N="263" /> to make up your own mind as to whether you will do it or not.&rdquo;  We do not do that in regard to any other question of health legislation, and this is a purely health matter.</P>
    <P>I do not support either Deputy Ryan or the Leader of the Opposition in their differentiation between chlorine and fluorine.  As far as I know as a layman chlorine is not normally found in water supplies as they are given to us by the Almighty, whereas fluorine is found in ordinary water supplies in many parts of the world.  There is no objection by the Pure Water Association or anybody else to the addition of chlorine where this is found necessary or desirable.  Therefore I can see no reason why there should be any objection to the addition of fluorine which is a natural element of water supplies in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I have not heard from anybody any definition as to what he means by pure water.  I am only a layman in this respect but I should imagine that the only real form of pure water would be condensed water but nobody expects to get that.  All water supplies contain chemical elements of one sort or another.</P>
    <P>What impresses me most about this Bill is that this is not a final decision except in so far as it is to be brought into effect generally throughout the country as soon as possible, but it is not a decision taken for all time.  There is a provision quite clearly in the Bill whereby the local authorities will have to keep a careful check on the incidence of dental caries in children to see if the fluoridation of water supplies has the desired result.  I have no doubt in my own mind that, if this careful analysis of health statistics is carried out as it must be carried out, and if those statistics do not show that there is a reduction in the incidence of dental caries, this whole scheme will be abandoned; if other adverse effects on health are discovered there again I cannot anticipate for a moment that any Minister for Health would continue with the fluoridation of water supplies.</P>

      <P>No, not for a moment. That is a complete misinterpretation of what I said.  At least, I hope I did not say it, because certainly I did not mean that.  What I said was that if by any chance a careful analysis of health statistics were subsequently to show that some adverse effects on public health had been discovered, the scheme would have to be abandoned. I should not be as happy as I am with this Bill, if it were not for the provision that these analyses of health statistics will have to be maintained in this connection.  That appears to me to be the final safety measure for overriding any possible objection. The objections are only possible ones, and remotely possible at the very most, whereas the benefits appear to the technical people who composed this commission to be certain.  I cannot imagine that this commission of technical men, including dentists, scientists and engineers, can all have been so completely misled by the evidence which they considered.  If we set up a commission which is a well-qualified commission, we are taking a grave responsibility on ourselves if we disregarded what they tell us.</P>

      <P>The amount of public interest in the fluoridation of water supply is almost nil.  There is the Pure Water Association, a very small group, which feels very strongly but it is a very small minority group.  Although I am not a member of a local authority now, I have met quite a number of people and nobody cares twopence as to whether the water is fluorinated or not and I do not see any reason why they should.  Nobody will notice any adverse effect.  They will not notice any taste or anything else and all chemical evidence goes to show that it can have only beneficial results.  The safeguards are there; the scientific evidence is there; and there is a way out if there is the least danger of the slightest adverse effects subsequently discovered.  I do not anticipate that there will be any adverse effects, but with the careful check on results, I am perfectly happy and I support this Bill without any reservation whatever.</P>

      <P>If I were asked why it is that I found it necessary to provide in Section 2 of this Bill that it should be mandatory upon the local authorities to take a step which I think is essential for the protection of our children and for their health and for the health of future generations, I would have found ample justification for it in the speech which has been made against the Bill by Deputy Ryan.  That speech was a jumble of irrelevancies and of reckless rhetoric.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He opened by saying that the issue before the House was a simple one, as to whether we were going to permit the people to drink pure water or to ingest a deadly poison.  Now, that is not the issue, for the simple fact is that pure water, if continuously ingested, would of itself be highly injurious to health.  We do not drink pure water in this country, nor, as far <Col N="266" /> as I know, do any people on the face of the globe drink pure water.  They drink water containing all those trace elements which are present because of the manner in which the water percolates through the soil.</P>
    <P>Here is a sample analysis of the drinking water consumed in Dublin. There were in it 80 parts to 1,000,000, of solids in solution; seven hundredths of one part in 1,000,000 of albuminoid ammonia; and two hundredths of a part in 1,000,000 of free ammonia.  It does not contain nitrous nitrogen but that probably is contained in water from a second source. It contains a trace of nitric nitrogen and it contains, so far as it is taken from the Liffey, 10 parts in 1,000,000 of chlorides, 10 parts in 1,000,000 of sulphates and some traces of oxygen, absorbed from permanganate solution. In the case of water supplied from Vartry, we have again 50 parts per 1,000,000 of solids in solution: we have one-tenth part in 1,000,000 of albuminoid ammonia; we have three-hundredths of a part in 1,000,000 of free ammonia as nitrogen.  There are 13 part per 1,000,000 of chlorides. There is a trace of sulphate and .8 part in 1,000,000 of oxygen absorbed from permanganate solution.  Therefore, the water we are drinking in Dublin is not pure.  It is noticeably as you will see from that, devoid of any fluorine content but it contains chlorine.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Ryan was speaking, I asked him what about chlorine.  He said we were proposing to add a poison to water and I asked him what about chlorine and was not chlorine a poison. Deputy Ryan replied that no, it was not.  Well, any person who as a schoolboy did elementary chemistry will know that chlorine is a deadly poison and that it was in fact the main constituent of most of the poison gases used during the first Great War but we take&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan who objects to getting a trace of fluorine in this pure water is quite content to ingest 13 parts chlorides in 1,000,000 parts in the water he drinks in the city of Dublin and when I asked him why he takes that line, he said we added the chlorine in order that we may kill some organisms which otherwise might be dangerous to health.  So he is quite content to allow the people of Dublin and the people of the urban areas of Ireland to drink water which contains a significant proportion of organisms in a state of putrefaction and he stands up here and opens his speech against the Bill with the words that the issue is as between pure water and a deadly poison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue is not between pure water and a deadly poison; the issue is, as I have already said, whether or not we are to take steps which have been universally recommended by competent bodies who have heard the <Col N="268" /> evidence for and against the proposal to add fluorine to water where the natural waters are deficient in that element&mdash;to add it, as I have said, in a minute degree.  It is between those who would prevent this addition being made and those who wish to ensure that this preventive prophylactic measure will be adopted.  Such efforts have been defeated elsewhere by the kind of demagoguery that we have listened to from Deputy Ryan last evening and this morning.</P>
    <P>The issue, in short, is whether we are to take steps to prevent the occurrence of this horrible disease among our children.  It is a horrible disease, nothing less than the erosion of human bone and tissue; it is a horrifying and horrible disease which brings suffering, ill-health, and a great many economic evils in its train.  The issue, I say, is whether we will take steps, simple and effective steps, to prevent the occurrence of dental caries among our children and adolescents, or, are we to be prevented from taking them by the type of argument we have listened to from Deputy Ryan?  Let the House see how that type of argument will prevail over the findings of highly-qualified persons.</P>
    <P>When I was introducing this Bill on Second Reading, I was at great pains to make the House as fully informed as I could of the findings of competent bodies which had investigated this problem of dental caries and its prevention. I think the findings of those bodies are conclusive, and not merely conclusive, but, having regard to the history which attended the efforts of those who had previously endeavoured to give effect to these findings, coercive upon any person charged with responsibility for the health of the nation to endeavour to see that when he was presented with a report from a similar body that the findings of that body would be given effect to and that they would not be defeated by the type of speech we have heard from Deputy Ryan.</P>
    <P>Let us see how a speech of that kind can operate.  I have in mind the speech of Deputy Manley.  He said that when he heard me speak in introducing this <Col N="269" /> Bill he was greatly impressed by the case I made, but when he was approached by members of an organisation established to prevent the fluoridation of public water supplies and when they put before him the same sort of case as Deputy Ryan made here, he began to wonder&mdash;saying to himself that he had little knowledge of the subject&mdash;whether he was justified in supporting the Bill.  That is what the opponents of this measure trade upon&mdash;that those whom they can approach, and buttonhole, those whom they can persuade in the half-hour at a meeting, have little knowledge of the subject: Ignorance and conscience.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley went on to say that we ought to be fully acquainted with the subject.  This is a complex scientific subject; it is a problem which is widespread and on which there has been a great deal of scientific research. It is not something that has been suggested here for the first time nor has it been developed merely over the last 15 years.  I shall show in due course that this problem has been the subject of numerous and close investigations for almost three-quarters of a century; but it is only in the past 15 years that the results of these investigations, experiments and researches have come to be applied in a controlled way.  Therefore, this is a subject which it would be quite impossible for an assembly such as this, which is not composed of scientific or professional men&mdash;and much more so, a county council or urban district council or a health authority which again is not composed of persons who have a specialised knowledge of this matter&mdash;to become thoroughly acquainted with, as Deputy Manley said he wished to be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley said he was greatly impressed by the persons Deputy Ryan quoted.  Undoubtedly he was impressed because, like myself and like everybody else he has little scientific knowledge to guide him.  But every one of the scientists and the doctors quoted this morning by Deputy Ryan have appeared before these commissions of investigation that have been set up elsewhere and their evidence and their theories have been rejected, and in some cases their <Col N="270" /> good faith has been impugned by these bodies.</P>
    <P>I point to Deputy Manley as an example of how a conscientious person carrying a certain measure of responsibility and wishing to discharge it adequate can be influenced by the sort of propaganda against fluoridation which was conducted here and which we heard from Deputy Ryan. Deputy Manley asked why could we not postpone taking action in this matter for six years or more.  The reason is that we have a duty, a responsibility to the children of this nation.  We have a duty and a responsibility to the adolescents of the nation.  Here is what the dental survey carried out in 1952 indicated. This was a survey of dental caries in Ireland carried out in 1952.  It showed the following to be the position among those examined.</P>
    <P>In the age group five to six years, only 4.3 per cent. of the children had complete dentitions free from caries; in the age group seven to eight years, only 1.4 per cent.; and in the age group 12 to 13 years 1 per cent.  In other words, 99 per cent. of our adolescents are afflicted with dental caries. There is a simple way of ensuring that those who are born now will not have to carry the burden of misery which those conditions reflect through their childhood and afterlife.  We can protect the majority of them if we take urgent action in relation to this matter.  That is the issue&mdash;whether we are going to continue to neglect the teeth of our children, and by doing so impose a burden of ill-health upon the great majority of those concerned for the rest of their lives, or whether we are going to take measures to protect them which are simple, have been shown to be effective, and are very inexpensive. That is the issue.  It is not an issue between deadly poison and pure water.  It is simply the issue of whether the members of this House feel they are competent to discharge their duty to the people who send them here, or whether we are content to pass the buck to some county council or some urban district council, and leave them to bear the responsibility, as they will probably do, of neglecting <Col N="271" /> to safeguard the teeth of the children of the country.  That is the issue.</P>
    <P>I, at any rate, am prepared to carry my share of the responsibility.  I did not come to that decision lightly.  My approach to this matter was probably the same as that of the Leader of the Opposition in the first instance, that this was a matter of whether perhaps we should stop at not compulsion exactly, but whether we should stop at making it difficult for people not to have water containing an adequate amount of fluorine.  I had a great deal of hesitation in coming to the decision to which I ultimately came. I gave it a great deal of thought; and I have been twitted here, because I did not act immediately on the report of the commission.</P>
    <P>I came to the conclusion that if the recommendations of the consultative council set up by my predecessor&mdash; and I want to praise him for setting it up&mdash;were to have any beneficial effect upon the health of this nation, I should take the responsibility of asking the Dáil to give me the powers to require the local authorities to add a small trace, a minute trace, of this essential element to the piped water supplies. I had some doubts about the position of the people living in the community who do not want, or profess not to want, to have this substance added.  I should hate to, and I do not want to, ride rough-shod over them, but after all, they live in the community and they cannot ask or expect the remainder of the community to refrain from protecting their children against the onset of this disease, when there is an almost absolute moral certainty that the rest of the community can do this without inflicting any injury upon those who dislike the procedure.</P>
    <P>Having made myself familiar with the investigations carried on elsewhere by authoritative bodies, and having come to the conclusion that the piped water supplies could be fluoridated without causing harm to anyone, I said to myself: &ldquo;Am I going to allow the purpose of my predecessor when he set up this consultative council, and the purpose which the consultative <Col N="272" /> council had in mind when they made their recommendations after having studied the matter thoroughly and searchingly, to be frustrated by having the farrago of nonsense we listened to this morning from Deputy Ryan repeated at every county council, every urban district council and every health authority throughout the country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The experiences we have heard about in New Zealand and parts of U.S.A. show what really is the moral to be drawn from what happened in those countries.  The findings of the most competent persons who could be found to investigate this problem were thrown aside at the instance of people who made the sort of speech we heard from Deputy Ryan this morning.  In New Zealand and in Sweden when the voters were told falsely that their choice was between pure water and deadly poison is it to be wondered at that they did not choose the deadly poison?  When I saw what had happened elsewhere to the recommendations of the most expert commissions who had investigated the problem I came to the conclusion that this was the place, here in the Dáil, where this matter could best be discussed.  I felt that if, in our collective wisdom, we arrived at the conclusion that there is a sound case for fluoridation of the water supplies, then it would be our duty to carry that conclusion into practical effect, our duty to require those, to whom we entrust the duty of providing our people with water supplies, to provide water which will at least have a beneficial effect upon the disease that is rampant among us, rampant to the extent, as I have shown, that 99 per cent of our adolescents suffer from it.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal this morning from Deputy Ryan about this scientist and that one.  I could deal with every one of them and I could point to what was said about some of them&mdash;about Dr. Ramseyer, Professor McCay, and Dr. Waldbott. Every one of them made his case before the New Zealand commission or other commissions and the evidence they submitted and the <Col N="273" /> theories based upon it were rejected, and rejected because of a reasoned case against them.  The Commissioners did not just say: &ldquo;We do not believe.&rdquo;  They pointed out the flaws in the theories and arguments. I think the best way of dealing with the points made by Deputy Ryan is to take one of the reports of one of these commissions and read the most significant findings in it.</P>
    <P>I shall start with the Expert Committee on water fluoridation which was set up by the World Health Organisation, an organisation to which we are subscribing and to which all the civilised nations of the world are subscribing.  It is an organisation which has at its disposal ample financial resources and can command the assistance of the most expert opinion in the world upon any matter it may wish to investigate.</P>
    <P>The Expert Committee&mdash;I do not know whether it is necessary to give the members; the House can take it from me that they are all men of world eminence&mdash;have many cogent arguments to advance.  I shall give only the significant parts of the Committee's report on this problem.  The report starts off by pointing out:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dental caries is one of the most prevalent and widespread diseases in the world.  It is not restricted to any specific age, class or economic status, nor is it peculiar to any country or race.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, of course, could have been said 15 years ago about tuberculosis, before antibiotics came into vogue.  People say that these control studies have been under way for only the past 14 or 15 years; let us remember that antipolio vaccines have not had such a long trial either; neither have the antibiotics.  But antibiotics have been largely responsible for the fact that what can be said at the present time about dental caries can no longer be said about tuberculosis.  The report goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The consequences of the disease can be particularly serious both in childhood and in adolescence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some Deputies would appear to think <Col N="274" /> that we are talking about simple toothache, about normal&mdash;if there is such a thing&mdash;pain, about a period of suffering through which every child is supposed to go as part of the natural order of things.  This Expert Committee points out that the consequences of dental caries can be particularly serious both in childhood and in adolescence:</P>
    <P>Impaired mastication is the direct cause&mdash;</P>
    <P>There is not one qualification about this.</P>
    <P>&mdash;of digestive diseases and secondary infection from a septic mouth may have far-reaching effects on general health.</P>
    <P>Anybody listening to Deputy Ryan this morning making light of this disease, which the expert committee regards as one that carries most serious consequences and one that has most serious reactions upon the health of the individual, must be at a loss to reconcile Deputy Ryan's pronouncements with the considered opinion of experts in their own field.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Throughout the world dental decay represents an economic drain upon both health services and individuals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having pointed out, first of all, that early detection and treatment of dental caries is effective in controlling the disease, and its results, the report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Even in those countries with the highest ratio of dentists to population, however, no more than one-third of the needs of the people in this respect are being met.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, one third who are well off enough and affluent enough to have their own private dentist and the very poor who can avail themselves of the limited public dental services; they have some chance of securing treatment. The rest of the community must do without or with the bare minimum.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is inconceivable therefore that the control of dental caries by treatment methods alone can be <Col N="275" /> accomplished on a world wide basis in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>This then is the conclusion which this world expert committee has arrived at; that we must find some other way of controlling and preventing dental caries other than relying upon methods of treatment alone.</P>
    <P>As in the case of any disease, the ideal solution of the problem of dental caries is prevention.</P>
    <P>They go on then to refer to the efforts being made to prevent this disease by various means, means which have been advocated here&mdash;by oral hygiene, stringent dental control, by the banning of sweets, fermentable carbohydrates, and so forth.</P>
    <P>While some of these methods are effective on an individual basis, their application on a public health or population wide basis, however, has been, on the whole, disappointing since no one of them fulfills the requirement of being widely acceptable and practicable in application.</P>
    <P>Having said that, they point out that they are driven back to considering the question of the potential value of fluorides.</P>
    <P>Historically, it is of interest that the empirical use of fluorides for the prevention of dental caries can be traced back to the last quarter of the 19th century.</P>
    <P>It is not a case, then, as I have said earlier, of something having been thought up and put into practice in the last 15 years.  This matter has been under investigation for almost three-quarters of a century.  They go on to point out:</P>
    <P>The origin of today's concept of fluoridation as a preventive measure is directly attributable to the observations made in connection with another dental disease called mottled enamel.</P>
    <P>That is not, I think, a really very serious general disease.  It is sometimes disfiguring, but it has not anything like <Col N="276" /> the same consequences as dental caries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is produced by fluorides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; they admit that.  They say it was the investigation of the relationship between fluorides and the mottling of dental enamel that directed attention to the very significant fact to which I am just coming.  They say:</P>
      <P>The very mild mottling of teeth found in communities where fluoride is in the range of 1½ parts per million is of no cosmetic signicance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I hope the Leader of the Opposition will note the words &ldquo;cosmetic significance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>&mdash;and can be detected only by careful dental examination as a light white flecking of the enamel.</P>
      <P>They say later, however:</P>
      <P>Imperfections of enamel development occur frequently and may be caused by a wide variety of factors.</P>
      <P>This is not of very great significance at this stage, but, if this controversy is prolonged much further, I venture to predict that you will certainly hear of the appalling effect fluorides have in conducing to the mottling of dental enamel.  The Commission in its report points out that the imperfections of enamel development occur frequently and may be caused by a wide variety of factors.  Therefore, excessive fluoridation is not the sole cause&mdash;and, mark you, I say &ldquo;excessive fluoridation&rdquo;&mdash;of mottling.</P>
      <P>They say:</P>
      <P>In reporting the studies on mottled enamel an impression that the difficulty was accompanied by a low prevalence of dental caries was noted.  This impression stimulated further studies on fluorides in drinking water as a factor in dental health.</P>
      <P>It is with those studies that our present knowledge of the subject begins.  The W.H.O. experts go on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> Wide variations in the enamel according to the fluoride content of communal drinking waters in many countries in the world provided exceptional opportunities for studying and determining the relation between the prevalence of dental caries and fluoride concentration.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Ryan speak at length about how this fluoridation process has been based on the conclusions derived from a few experiments concentrated within a few years; that, really, there had not been enough investigation into this whole problem to tell us whether we were doing right or wrong in adopting this measure.  Deputy Manley admitted he had greatly been influenced by that type of argument.</P>
    <P>Here is the Expert Committee of the World Health Organisation telling us that on the contrary:</P>
    <P>Wide variations in the naturally occurring fluoride content in communal drinking-waters in many countries of the world provided exceptional opportunities for studying and determining the relation between the prevalence of dental caries and fluoride concentration.  Notable among these countries is the United States of America, where more than 3 million people live in communities where the natural fluoride concentration of the drinking-water is 1.0 p.p.m. or greater.</P>
    <P>So we are embarking upon a scheme which has been subjected to a great deal of research and investigation.  As the Expert Committee found:</P>
    <P>These studies demonstrated that there was an inverse relationship between the fluoride level in the water and the incidence of caries. With low levels, the caries was severe, but with about 1 p.p.m. fluoride children had only one-third as much caries as had those of the same age in areas where there was very little fluoride in the water.  With levels of more than 1 p.p.m. fluoride there was very little further reduction in caries.</P>
    <P>They went on to say:</P>
    <P>The pattern of the initial series of <Col N="278" /> investigation has been followed by a long and increasing list of independent investigators in other parts of the U.S.A. and in many countries of the world.  These countries include Argentina, Canada, England and Wales, Greece, Hungary, India, Kenya, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Union of South Africa, and U.S.S.R.  With a remarkable degree of uniformity, the different observers reported the fact that there is an inverse relationship between the prevalence of dental caries and the fluoride concentration in drinking-water up to approximately 1 p.p.m.  This fact was important.</P>
    <P>First of all, a remarkable degree of uniformity is observed, and then the establishment of a co-relation which the experts conclude is important.</P>
    <P>Maximum dental caries benefits were associated with a concentration of fluoride which is below the minimum threshold established for mottling of the teeth or dental fluorosis.</P>
    <P>The public health significance of the striking difference in caries prevalence among children in fluoride and fluoride-free areas was further enhanced by a study of adult populations which demonstrated that the effect of fluoride continues into adult life without any appreciable diminution with age.  Groups of adults aged 20-44 years were examined in an area where the water contained 2.5 p.p.m. fluoride and compared with similar groups in a fluoride-free area.  It was found that in each group studied, and up to 44 years of age, caries experience in the fluoride area was only about one-third as much as in the non-fluoride area.</P>
    <P>Deputies heard Deputy Ryan this morning and I think Deputy Manley, too, to some extent, saying that after all this fluoridation was only going to be beneficial for a few years; that it was true that it would defer the onset of dental caries; but that the advantages and benefits of the treatment would not be carried over into adulthood. But here is what this Expert Committee had to say: that the beneficial <Col N="279" /> effects are carried over and continue into adult life without any appreciable diminution with age. Then they go on to say about this &ldquo;deadly poison&rdquo; that Deputy Ryan was so rhetorical about this morning:</P>
    <P>As a logical sequence to all the knowledge which had been gained, it was decided in the USA. in 1944 to add fluorides to some water-supplies as a means of preventing dental caries.</P>
    <P>The potential significance of the dental effects of fluorides in drinking-water stimulated broad interest in the physiological effects.</P>
    <P>Fluorine in a combined state in nature is found almost everywhere throughout the world, and is a constituent of certain minerals found in rock and soil.  There is a substantial volume of literature reporting the world-wide geographical distribution of fluorides contained in domestic water-supplies where a fluorine dental-caries relationship has been found.</P>
    <P>The Almighty must be very wicked for, according to the Deputy Ryan, He proposes to poison one part of the world's population by ensuring that through the structure of this our earth a great many people will have to ingest much more than one part per million of fluorine every time they take a drink of water.  Again, as the Commission points out, fluorine is also found in teeth and bones and in many of the foods which are commonly eaten.</P>
    <P>I said in my opening speech that if anybody wanted to live on a diet free from fluorine, he would have to confine himself to beets and cauliflowers, and make certain that these were cooked in distilled water.  The Commission go on to say:</P>
    <P>It had been established, too, that the use of drinking-water containing several times the optimum fluoride concentration does not affect skeletal development or height and weight; that most of the fluoride ingested is eliminated; that fluoride has an affinity for calcified tissues and especially for teeth; that <Col N="280" /> the first signs of having used drinking-waters contaning fluoride during the period of tooth formation are found in the teeth; and that the rate of bone fractures among young adult males is no higher for those using fluoridated drinking-water than for others.</P>
    <P>I think that disposes most effectively of certain of the arguments which we heard from Deputy Ryan this morning.</P>
    <P>Then the report proceeds:</P>
    <P>The controlled fluoridation of community drinking-water supplies was started in 1945, at Grand Rapids, Mich., USA., and shortly afterwards at Newburgh, N.Y., USA., and Brantford, Ontario, Canada.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The controlled fluoridation&rdquo;, not the mere natural fluoridation, of community drinking-water supplies was started in 1945.  That is the origin of the 15 years we have heard about.</P>
    <P>In each case, fluorides were added to the water to bring the concentration up to 1.0-1.2 p.p.pm., and for each fluoridation city a control area was selected.  These studies were planned to extend over a period of 10 years so that the deciduous dentition and most of the permanent dentition would be subjected to fluoride during the whole period of development and calcification, and would be exposed for some years to caries-attack.</P>
    <P>This was the procedure adopted:</P>
    <P>Detailed dental examinations were carried out on children between 4 and 15 years of age before fluoridation started and were repeated each year.  Dental caries experience in the fluoridation areas was compared with that in the control areas, and also with caries experience among similar groups of children in Aurora, I11., a natural fluoride area with 1.2 p.p.m fluoride in the water.  This was done to determine whether the added fluoride was as effective in reducing dental caries as fluoride which occurred naturally.</P>
    <P>This was the result:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> Reports of the results after 10 years of controlled fluoridation in three cities, two in the USA and one in Canada, show a remarkable uniformity. The prevalence of dental caries in the permanent teeth of continuously resident children who had used the fluoridated drinking-water throughout life was decreased by some 60 per cent....</P>
    <P>It will be recognised from this that if we had had the fluoridation process in operation here during the past 15 year the incidence of dental caries among boys and girls of 12 and 13 years of age in our cities, towns and villages would now be lower by almost two-thirds.  Surely that is a very considerable fact to place against any of the statements which have been used here by Deputy Ryan?</P>
    <P>The report goes on:</P>
    <P>The results obtained in the three studies confirmed the hypothesis that the use of drinking water with 1 p.p.m. fluoride produces identical dental and general effects whether the fluoride occurs naturally or is added by mechanical means.</P>
    <P>Dental caries experience in the teeth of children born prior to fluoridation was also appreciably reduced.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>Observations on growth and development, calcification of bones, elimination of fluorine in the urine, dysplasia of the teeth, gingivitis, hearing, sight, and blood were made in one or more of the study projects...</P>
    <P>I do not want to go through all those because I am sure the House would be bothered unnecessarily.  Several copies of this Report will be made available in the library.  Here is one passage, however, which I must quote:</P>
    <P>In this section, those biological properties of inorganic fluorides that are reasonably well established are described in general terms to furnish evidence that the knowledge <Col N="282" /> of the effects of fluorides is sufficiently extensive and detailed to guarantee adequately the safety of water fluoridation.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Manley who made a thoughtful speech&mdash;a speech, I think, which showed he was really disturbed, will read this report and ponder on the significance of that.  After all, these persons who are competent to judge do know a great deal about the subject.  Nobody in the world knows everything about anything but these well-informed and expert-persons do say that the knowledge of the effects of fluorides is sufficiently extensive and detailed to guarantee adequately the safety of water fluoridation.  Then they go on to deal with another point which I think was referred to by Deputy Ryan in his conclusion.  They go on to deal with this:</P>
    <P>No evidence of enzyme inhibition by fluoride is known in persons ingesting fluoridated water with concentrations optimal for dental health.</P>
    <P>We all know the important part bacteria and enzymes play in the digestive processes.</P>
    <P>They then go on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Oral bacteria in media containing 1 p.p.m. fluoride in <i>vitro</i> have shown no reduction in acid production&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They then proceed to say how fluorides are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and how they are with almost equal rapidity evacuated therefrom.</P>
    <P>They then give another finding which, I think, I ought to quote having regard to the statements made by Deputy Ryan:</P>
    <P>No effects whatsoever have been detected on the mineral metabolism, specifically of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium, when the drinking water contains 1 p.p.m. fluoride.</P>
    <P>They further say:</P>
    <P>An increasing body of evidence testifies to the absence of any effect on somatic and psychic growth of children in areas in which drinking <Col N="283" /> water contains optimal amounts of fluoride.</P>
    <P>Then they proceed to deal with all these bogies about the effects of fluoridisation upon certain conditions with which Deputy Ryan regaled the House this morning.  I think, again, that it would be only fair to the House that I should not burden them with these. passages I can assure the House that they are conclusive and that they can be studied in the Libary.  The report proceeds:</P>
    <P>The most convincing evidence of the safety of water fluoridation comes from the numerous population groups (3 million in the U.S.A., 0.5 million in England) who have drunk naturally fluoridated water containing 1 p.p.m. or more during their lifetimes.  In these groups water-drinking has been, of course, uncontrolled, and there have been well and ill babies as well as healthy young adults and frail elderly people.  Medical practitioners and specialists in these areas have never detected and defined a systematic aberration in health of any kind related to the fluoride consumer (except mottled enamel in endemic areas).  Large-scale epidemiological tests are lacking.  The long-range detailed paediatric study of the Newburgh-Kingston children, including observations on growth, blood count, X-ray of bones, etc., offers convincing evidence of the normal health of children drinking 1 p.p.m. in their water.  The Bartlett-Cameron survey, a 10-year longitudinal study of 168 individuals, demonstrated no adverse health effects with even 8 p.p.m. in the drinking-water, although tooth mottling and a low incidence of osteosclerosis were found.  Mortality and morbidity rates are comparable for fluoridated and non-fluoridated population groups: the mortalities from five leading causes of death-heart disease, cancer, cerebral accidents, nephritis and liver cirrhosis&mdash; were the same in 32 pairs of American cities, one of each pair receiving fluoridated water, the other not.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> All these findings fit together in a consonant whole that constitutes a great guarantee of safety&mdash;a body of evidence without precedence in public health procedures.</P>
    <P>That is the finding.  That is what exhaustive investigation by the most expert committee that could be brought together in the world has found in regard to this process which Deputy Ryan wishes us to believe has been foisted upon the medical, dental and public health professions by interested persons for the most venal motives.</P>
    <P>This is the summary which the Committee of Experts give of their findings:</P>
    <P>Dental caries is one of the most prevalent and widespread diseases.</P>
    <P>There is no hope of controlling the diseases by present treatment methods alone.</P>
    <P>Among the numerous preventive methods, the fluoridation of drinking-water is the most promising.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness, safety, and practicability of fluoridation as a caries-preventive measure has been established.</P>
    <P>1 p.p.m. fluoride has been shown to give maximum benefits: first, by epidemiological studies where fluoride occurs naturally in the water, and, secondly, where fluoride has been added at optimum concentrations through mechanical means.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of controlled fluoridation programmes are now in operation in many countries.  Some have been in progress for the past 12 years, so that conclusions are based on experience.  No other public health procedure, during the initial stages of its application, has had such a background in time or extent.</P>
    <P>The biological effects of fluoride have been described in nearly 3000 clinical and experimental reports in the past 20 years.  This literature is not only extensive but of broad scope.</P>
    <P>Then they say a few other things which I do not think I need bother about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> But they also go on to say this:</P>
    <P>Growth and development, somatic and psychic, are normal in children drinking water containing 1 p.p.m. fluoride.</P>
    <P>The formation of teeth and even their resistance to caries and their appearance are improved when water containing optimal concentrations of fluoride is consumed.</P>
    <P>Over 3 million, people in the USA, over half a million in England, and large population groups in other countries have, during their life time, consumed water containing 1 p.p.m. fluoride or more. Mortality and morbidity rates for five leading causes of death are comparable for cities in the USA with fluoride and non-fluoride public water-supplies.  No relation between fluoride and arthritic changes in bone has been found, nor have confirmed cases of allergy to water containing 1 p.p.m. fluoride been described.</P>
    <P>The addition of fluorides to public water-supplies has proved to be similar to other routine mechanical procedures widely employed in waterworks practice.  Suitable equipment has been developed, reliable analytical procedures are available, and appropriate safeguards have been established.</P>
    <P>No other vehicles or techniques for the prophylactic application of fluorides can at present replace the fluoridation of drinking-water as a public health measure.  Where water fluoridation cannot be used, research into other vehicles and improved methods of local fluoride application should, however, be encouraged.</P>
    <P>There is a summary of their conclusions. In submitting this Bill, I think I can rely on that report, on the very exhaustive investigation of the problem by the Royal Commission of Inquiry set up in New Zealand, and alst but not least, on the findings of the Consultative Council on the Fluoridation of Water Supplies set up by my predecessor, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>I would ask any person who has <Col N="286" /> been influenced by the sort of thing we heard here, alleging ulterior motives on the part of dentists, alleging that some people were making millions of pounds out of this fluoridation process, charges made so recklessly by Deputy Ryan this morning, to consider the names of the people who signed the report of the consultative council, to consider their eminence in our society, to consider their established reputations and ask if these gentlemen, who heard the evidence and the statements made on behalf of the Pure Water Association by its chosen representatives, who heard everything that Deputy Ryan said this morning, could be swayed by the unworthy motives that Deputy Ryan seems to ascribe to every person who has been driven to the conclusion that for the benefit of the nation, for the benefit of future generations, we ought to require those who supply water to the people to supply it in a form which will make it an effective preventative against a very serious disease.</P>
    <P>These men are eminent in their own walks of life.  They were chosen by my predecessor as persons who were competent to advise him and on whose judgment he was confident to rely.  I accept absolutely his position and view in that regard.  The report of the consultative council has shown that its members have given a great deal of time and much care to this matter, and it also shows that our position in regard to caries is among the gravest in the world. When I got the report, I had to ask myself: &ldquo;Am I going to allow their efforts to go for nought?&rdquo; I had to ask myself: Am I going to have a decision on this matter, which affects the general health of our people, from the responsible authority, that is, this House, this legislature?  And as the Minister chosen by the majority in this House to carry responsibility for our health services, am I going to shoulder that responsibility: am I going to try to make these findings effective, or am I going to pass the buck to county councils and some obscure district councils and say: &lsquo;You are responsible; you will be responsible for defying the sort of demagogy which will be <Col N="287" /> hurled against you.  You will be told that you will be responsible to the people if you put this &lsquo;deadly poison&rsquo; (sic) into their pure water. You will be responsible for defying the ethical principle involved in this matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The commission had the ethical aspects of this matter examined and their findings were that they were advised that such a problem did not arise in this context.  Notwithstanding, Deputy Ryan this morning trotted out an Encyclical of the late Holy Father in regard to quite a different matter. If he had his way we may be sure that he would strive to mislead the urban councils in the same way, and that the Encyclicals of the Pope would be used for a vile purpose, to defeat something for the welfare of our children.  I think that it is up to the House not to facilitate that sort of campaign, that it should carry its responsibility, as I am prepared to carry mine.</P>
    <P>As regards control, I want to make it clear that there are safeguards against the unwarranted abuse of powers given to the Minister by this Bill.  It is implied in Section 6 that he must conduct certain surveys, before making fluoridisation compulsorily, he must see that surveys are conducted periodically, so that, before any public water supply is fluoridated, he shall see to it that a survey is conducted as envisaged in Section 6.  There is also further provision in Section 8 that the regulations requiring authorities to fluoridate their water supplies will be laid on the Table of the House and I shall guarantee they will be laid there in ample time to allow the House to consider them.  That is as far as I can go to meet the points which were made by the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

    <Title>Irish Steel Holdings Limited Bill, 1960&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The House is aware of the purpose of this Bill.  It will be recollected that, in advance of its introduction, the House on 22nd March, 1960, and 19th July, 1960, voted a total of £1,500,000 to enable the Minister for Finance to purchase shares in Irish Steel Holdings Ltd., and thus put that company in a position to purchase plant and put other work in hands in connection with its expansion plans.</P>
      <P>It is, no doubt, known to the House that the company was incorporated in 1947 to acquire the assets of Irish Steel Ltd. and maintain the steel works at Haulbowline as a going concern. The company has been financed by bank accommodation, of which £150,000 is guaranteed by the Minister for Finance, by a loan of £150,000, similarly guaranteed, and by the trading profits of the company since its inception.</P>
      <P>The company operates open hearth furnaces to produce, largely from native scrap, mild steel ingots and billets which are then converted by rolling into angles, rounds, flats and squares.  Flat and corrugated galvanised sheets are produced from imported sheet.  The soundness of the industry has been confirmed by the successful progress of the company over the past ten years.  Accumulated net profits up to 30th June, 1959 are over £600,000 and the assets of the company were valued by outside valuers at nearly £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years, the company has been considering plans for development and expansion of the industry and latterly has pursued its investigations with consultants employed for the purpose.  Proposals were drawn <Col N="289" /> up and tenders obtained from firms of international standing.  These tenders form the basis of the company's statement of costs.</P>
    <P>The main proposals are:</P>
    <P>(a) increase of ingot output to 80,000 tons per annum of 30 cwt. ingots from the present figure of 23,000 tons per annum of 3 cwt. ingots.  This will involve the installation of a new 60-ton furnace, the improvement of two existing 37-ton furnaces and extension of scrap handling;</P>
    <P>(b) installation of a new 750 mm blooming mill and a new 650 mm large section mill, with the necessary ancillary gear to roll billets, blooms, sheet bars and large sections;</P>
    <P>(c) rearrangement and mechanisation of the existing merchant bar mill to improve its rate of working and to enable it to feed a wire rod mill;</P>
    <P>(d) installation of a modern wire rod mill;</P>
    <P>(e) completion of an incomplete sheet mill already in the company's possession.  This mill was acquired in an incomplete condition from Irish Steel Ltd., the company's predecessors.</P>
    <P>The output and efficiency of working will be increased by these means and the range of products extended. The 80,000 tons of ingots per annum will give about 65,000 tons per annum of end-products, of which it is intended to dispose as to 45,000-50,000 tons on the home market and 15,000-20,000 tons on the export market.  The company's successful experience in the export market encourages confidence that in normal conditions there should be no difficulty in securing export outlets for whatever portion of production is not absorbed in the home market. This confidence is shared by the export agents who handled the company's previous export business.</P>
    <P>On the basis of carefully and conservatively derived costs of production, the company has reached the conclusion that its delivered prices should be competitive with those for imported steel when the plant is working at its true efficiency and planned output. Employment in the expanded steel-works is expected to be over 700 persons <Col N="290" /> at peak periods, or 200 more than at present.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the total cost of the work and plant necessary for this implementation of the company's development and expansion programme will be of the order of £3½ millions.  It is proposed to provide the sum necessary, less £99,000 which the company will provide from its own resources, by the purchase of shares by the Minister for Finance.  In addition, the company will require working capital and for this purpose the Bill empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to guarantee borrowings by the company not exceeding £500,000 at any one time.</P>
    <P>I think that there will be general agreement that this successful industry should be fostered and encouraged to expand.  Its importance from the point of view of providing employment is apparent from the figures I have already quoted.  Quite apart from questions of employment, however, the steel mill at Haulbowline fills a gap which would otherwise exist in our industrial capacity.  It produces a basic product, principally from indigenous raw materials, and represents a valuable insurance against our being deprived of essential supplies of steel should we be unable to obtain supplies from foreign sources at any future time of international difficulties. Furthermore, we may hope that the existence in this country of this basic stage of the steel industry with its special skills and technologies will be a favourable factor in the development here of the engineering and other steel-using industries.  For all these reasons, I confidently recommend the Bill to the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said in his introductory remarks, the work being carried on by Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. at Haulbowline is a desirable project.  We support the proposal to continue and expand the capacity of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. which has been providing not only good employment but producing mild steel ingots and billets of satisfactory high quality. It is, I think, ten or 15 years since I <Col N="291" /> visited the Haulbowline works and since then the company has continued to make progress.  Like others, I was impressed by the skill and efficiency with which the undertaking was carried on.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from the published accounts that the company has been trading successfully.  It strikes me, however, in view of the satisfactory financial results which have attended the operations of the company, that the company might out of their own resources provide a larger sum than £99,000.  As I understand the Minister's remarks, the expansion programme will be of the order of £3,500,000.  I have here before me the accounts which were presented for the year ending June, 1959.  At that stage, the company had reserves of the order of over £300,000.  I gather from the Minister's remarks now that they have available a sum of £600,000; and it does seem, in view of the quite considerable reserves, that the amount being provided by the company is relatively small.  That aspect of the financial arrangements might receive consideration.</P>
      <P>There is also the general question of whether an undertaking of this sort should secure its capital by inviting public subscription.  This matter was referred to here, I think, in July, and I do not know whether it has since received any further consideration. While many of the projects which are assisted directly by the State benefit from the various National Loans which are floated, there is, I believe. a psychological advantage in getting the public to understand that, when subscribing for a particular undertaking, they are contributing directly to a named project.  That, of course, has been the case in respect of the E.S.B. and C.I.E.  Whether this particular undertaking is sufficiently well established to undertake a similar procedure is a matter on which the Minister may be able to give us information. Generally, we are satisfied with the work which is being carried on there.  Not only has the undertaking of Irish Steel Holdings at Haulbowline produced satisfactory goods but the management of the company reflects credit on all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> I note in the main development proposals that one of the projects is the completion of an incomplete sheet mill which is in the company's possession. That mill was shown to me on the occasion on which I visited the place and I am glad to see that the proposals envisage the completion of that work and further development.</P>
    <P>There is only one other question on which I should like some information from the Minister.  Have the export agents who handle the export business of the company access to world markets generally or are they restricted to any particular sphere?  I believe that in an undertaking of this sort access to the widest possible sphere of activity is desirable.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the project and wish the development every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very happy in seeing these proposals brought in here today to be put through the House.  There is no doubt that when the steel works were first started in Cobh, Cobh was a derelict town and had been a derelict town from the time that the British left Haulbowline. Over a long number of years the only activity in Haulbowline was an auction of scrap and machinery every three or four months.  That was the sole activity in a place where employment had been given to 1,000 to 1,500 people during the time the British had it as a naval base.</P>
      <P>When I hear Deputy Cosgrave allude to capital by public subscription, I cannot forget that capital was brought into this firm by public subscription at the start.  I am wondering what has happened the shareholders who invested their money at that time.  Many of them were very poor people who endeavoured to help out at that period by putting their little all into the industry.  What is their position today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do know that the firm went bankrupt at least twice.  On at least two occasions I had to go to the present Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, to get money from him to keep the industry going.  The gap it filled in the economy of this <Col N="293" /> country during the years of the emergency cannot be forgotten.  We would have been absolutely without iron or steel for agricultural machinery and other necessary purposes had it not been for Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>We were very fortunate in the manager who took charge of the industry over the past number of years.  Mr. Christy Fitzpatrick who took it over after its bankruptcy brought it to a level of which any industrialist could be proud.  Mr. Farren has followed in his footsteps and has made a very good job of the industry.  Now, thank God, it is being expanded.</P>
    <P>Is it visualised that we are to continue to import black sheets for the purpose of galvanising them there and selling them here or are we to get the famous sheet mill completed and have black sheets produced?  I recollect when another industrialist thought of starting a corrugated iron industry here he was informed by the late David Frame that he could not go to England for black sheets because he had got a licence to make them in Haulbowline. That was in 1936.  It is a pretty long time since the Department of Industry and Commerce gave a licence for the manufacture of black sheets in Haulbowline. There is the amusing state of affairs that black sheets are imported from a cartel in Britain to which we have to pay through the nose; these sheets are galvanised and sold to the Irish people.  There is a supposed grant to agriculture, which is actually a grant to cover this, in the form of grants for the erection of hay barns and so on, on condition that Irish galvanised iron is used.  It is time that that ended.</P>
    <P>I have a very distinct recollection, because I took a considerable part at that time in the negotiations, that we wrote to Belgium for an option on black sheets.  The reply was that they could not supply us because the trade in the Irish Free State had been handed over to the British Steel Combine.  We also wrote to Krupps and got the same reply.  It was only on the intervention of our late esteemed friend, Mr. Hitler, that <Col N="294" /> Krupps were induced to tender.  The tender from Krupps for black sheets in 1936 was £4 10s. a ton under the tender of the cartel.  I wonder if that condition of affairs still prevails and whether we are paying through the nose to a cartel for black sheets and then pretending to give a grant to farmers for putting corrugated iron on haybarns.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, be very anxious, now that we are expanding in that line, that the sheet mill would be finished and that black sheets would be turned out there instead of being imported from Britain.  In view of other discoveries that we have made in regard to our agreements with Britain recently, I do not think we owe them anything such as paying them excess prices for raw materials or semi-manufactured materials.  That is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>I certainly would like to compliment the Government and the Minister. This is not the first occasion on which the Taoiseach has come to the rescue as far as Irish Steel Holdings and the livelihood of the large number of people employed there are concerned. This is a well-run firm.  The workers are decently paid.  Its success is a commentary on the arguments of those who are so anxious to get back to private enterprise and who speak of private enterprise at various stages. This is run as a State concern and the figures show it is run at a profit.  Along with that, it is run efficiently and gives an enormous amount of employment in a town and in an area which needed it badly.  We can all compliment the management who have brought about that happy condition of affairs.  As the representative of that constituency for more than 30 years, I wish to congratulate them.  I remember when this project started.  Private enterprise tried twice and failed and the State made a success of it.  I compliment the Minister and the Government on this step to expand the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>One must support anything that is instrumental in providing further employment. However, there are certain provisions in this Bill about which I do not feel <Col N="295" /> quite happy.  In the first instance, I should like to ask the Minister if this is a private or a State company.  I assume that it has directors; in any case, it must be partially a private company because it has been in existence for some time.  Assuming it is a private company, is it the policy of the Government to nationalise private companies, because looking into this Bill, that is what appears to me to be happening?  The statement the Minister has read out indicates that this company shows a profit of £600,000 a year and that the assets are £1,000,000. Why is this company, in respect of the very laudable expansion it wants to make, unable to go on to the public market like any other private company and secure the funds that are so necessary for its advancement?</P>
      <P>Yesterday there was an announcement that a loan of £15 million was being floated.  Looking into the Bill here, I see that the Minister for Finance may take up shares to the extent of £4 million.  It is very possibly a fact that the £4 million of State money is not to be invested in this company, but in the Bill there is power for the Minister for Finance to expend £4 million on Irish Steel Holdings, Ltd.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that we have only two Cork Deputies in the House to hear about the great benefits being conferred on Cork county.  We in Wexford, the constituency I have the honour to represent, have some slight interest in Irish Steel Holdings.  Some years ago, the two agricultural firms there approached me to ask if I would go to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and ascertain if it was possible for these firms to buy their steel on a free market.  They told me that they were allowed to buy steel on a free market in Belgium, the United Kingdom or wherever else they could buy it, provided they were exporting, but for home production, they had to buy from Irish Steel Holdings and they had to pay as much as 30 per cent. more for their raw material from Irish Steel Holdings than the price they could have bought it for outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this happened long before the <Col N="296" /> present Minister's time, but I made a very reasonable approach on behalf of the firms in my constituency that they should be allowed to buy on a free market.  They assured me that if they were allowed to buy on a free market they would be able to continue what they were then doing, exporting on a free market themselves without any protection whatsoever.  That was refused by a Fianna Fáil Minister, and, in case the limited number of Fianna Fáil Deputies here should take exception to what I say, I hasten to assure them that it was subsequently refused by the Minister who succeeded the Fianna Fáil Minister.  The net result was that these two old Irish firms in Wexford were forced to look for a protective tariff.  Up to that time, they had been exporting on a free market and had been able to export to the British market.  They were working without any tariff and they are no longer able to do that.  Irish Steel Holdings had the benefit of that. These firms had to buy their raw material from Irish Steel Holdings.</P>
    <P>I wonder if I came to the Minister for Industry and Commerce tomorrow and said that these companies in Wexford, based largely&mdash;in fact based entirely&mdash;on home raw material, were in a parlous condition and wanted assistance on a big scale, such as Irish Steel Holdings got, would we get it or not.  Any enterprise that provides employment in the unhappy situation in which we find ourselves at the moment is eminently desirable.  I notice that 700 people will be employed, which is 200 more than before.  These steel works were erected on the site of the old dockyard when it was closed, causing a considerable number of people to emigrate.  As Deputy Corry stated here, at the time it was created it supplied the necessary raw material which up to then was not available.</P>
    <P>However, every time I open a newspaper or every time I listen to a speech by a Minister of this Government, from the Taoiseach down, I hear the argument&mdash;and of course it is a sound argument&mdash;that, in present world conditions of free trade and liberalisation of trade in other countries, <Col N="297" /> we must be competitive in our exports.  Here is an industry with profits of £600,000 and assets of £1,000,000.  I do not know if this is a private company but I believe it is and if it is a private company, surely it could get this money on the public market.  There is a limited amount of money available for State enterprise. The more money got by private industries on their own initiative, the better.</P>
    <P>Supposing the £4 million in this Bill is utilised and this company says: &ldquo;We require the Minister for Finance to take up that amount in full within the next 12 months&rdquo;, it will make a very big hole in the loan.  It is also possible that the banks may find themselves having to interest themselves in this loan, thus absorbing available funds.</P>
    <P>I wonder is this a move in the right direction.  I can understand any Cork Deputy who may be listening to me taking exception to what I say.  I can appreciate that it is every man for himself.  First of all, is this a private company?  If it is a private company, is it a wise move to place it under what is virtually State control, to guarantee the loans and give it money?  It is further embodied in the Bill that the money is to be voted out of the Central Fund.  If the money is not paid back, it is in the Bill that the Oireachtas will vote the money to see that the State is not at a loss.  Is it not, in effect, saying: &ldquo;We know you want to expand and we know you want to give further employment; therefore we will give you this money&rdquo;?  Could not any other company in the State come to Dáil Éireann and submit that it is entitled to the same terms?  I wonder is it a good thing in the first instance to encourage a private company to become a State company as we are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering also if it is a good thing to give a company, even though it is providing increased employment, a more or less blank cheque up to a ceiling of £4,000,000 to expand as much as it <Col N="298" /> likes.  Could we not reasonably say that every other company which is giving useful employment could ask for the same amount of money?  The Minister may say that they can get the money from the Industrial Credit Company but the money is limited. The money available within the State coffers is provided by the people and is limited in amount.</P>
      <P>I have always been an advocate of private enterprise and I wonder in this case, where a company are showing such excellent returns&mdash;and also not forgetting what I said about the Wexford company&mdash;and where they are already getting considerable benefit from the State, if we are wise to give them all this money.  I should like to have the Minister's clarification on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I welcome this Bill.  The industry is an essential one in relation to production and availability of steel.  In the early stages, of course, private enterprise was associated in a very big way with this new enterprise, but everybody understands that in that period there was a difficulty in getting up-to-date equipment and perhaps also the amount of technical knowledge available in the country was not such as to make for the desired success of the industry.  Consequently, changes had to come and the Government had to take over, in a very big way, a financial interest in the concern, if it was to survive.  Not only has it survived and supplied a large part of our essential steel material but it has established a very successful export trade, even to far-off lands.  It gives considerable employment not alone to people from Cobh but from the whole of the harbour area and we can welcome the further expansion proposed by the Minister by reason of the fact that a modern shipbuilding yard has been started nearby, so that it will have a market available for at least some of its products.  As time goes on, it may be able to supply much more of the needs of that shipbuilding industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is like the E.S.B., Bord na Móna and other projects of that kind.  It is too big an industry for private enterprise. <Col N="299" /> Furthermore, the more big projects of that kind take from the available public funds, the less public funds there will be for an extension of private enterprise.  But it is really such a large and important industry that the Government are wise in the steps they are taking now and I am sure the Bill will have the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the points in the order in which they were raised.  The first matter I have to deal with is the question by Deputy Cosgrave about the £600,000 the company might have been presumed to have available to help finance this undertaking. As the Deputy will remember, in the opening part of my speech, I said that the company showed a profit of £600,000 up to 30th June, 1959.  The new plans had not then been formulated and that £600,000 was the figure before deduction of taxation.  Taxation reduced that figure to £400,000.  At that time, as the Deputy will have learned from my opening remarks, there were available to the company two sums of £150,000 each raised from different sources and each guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  So, with the £400,000, after tax, at June, 1959, available added to the £300,000 to which the company had access by way of loan, there was £700,000.  Of that £700,000, it had in the meantime ploughed back about £100,000 into fixed assets and the balance of the £600,000 was being used in the meantime for working capital.  There are, of course, as liquid assets available for contribution to the present development plans&mdash;again, as I announced, £99,000&mdash;which were duly contributed to the £3½ million to be made available for the capital undertaking by the Minister for Finance and the £500,000 by way of working capital that the Minister is also providing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Cosgrave, I also was very impressed when I went to visit Haulbowline Island for the first time for the purpose of looking over the steel mills.  I went there before the plans were presented to me and prior <Col N="300" /> to their presentation to the Government. Naturally, I was anxious to familiarise myself as much as I could with many of the technical terms I have used in introducing the Bill and with the operations, so far as I could become familiar with them, so as to be in a better position to explain it, not only to the Government but to the House at a later stage.  What particularly struck me was the obvious enthusiasm, not only of the directors but also of the executive and technical staff and of the workers.  I am satisfied in my own mind, having regard to their record up to that date, and to the enthusiasm they were showing, that their plans have a very good chance of being successful.</P>
    <P>May I say at this stage to Deputy Esmonde that it is not a private company? I am sure the Deputy did not want me to interrupt him because he was glad to get his old conservative teeth into this rather socialist bone. He can take my assurance, as I am sure he knows, that it is not a private company but a company formed by the Minister for Finance.  It has three £1 shares which are divided among each of three directors, who are serving or former civil servants.  There are at the moment two serving civil servants and one former civil servant on the board.</P>
    <P>It was a private company before Irish Steel Holdings Limited came into existence; it was then Irish Steel Limited and, as Deputy Corry says, the company failed and its affairs were put into the hands of a receiver.  At that time, among some other debts, the company owed £69,000 to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for a trade loan advanced to them. That, in turn, had to be paid by the Minister for Industry and Commerce into the Exchequer.  When the assets were taken over, some £125,000 was paid for them and of that sum, the £69,000 which was owed by way of trade loan was paid into the Exchequer. From that date it became a State company and it still continues as such.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have no personal knowledge of the circumstances of the company prior to that take-over but <Col N="301" /> since then, through many difficulties, it has succeeded very well to the point that it established for itself an export market, even though a small one, which it holds to the present day.  One of its bigger export customers happens to be as far away as New Zealand and that in itself, I think, is a good test of the quality of the work done at this steel mill.</P>
    <P>Before passing from that I should refer to another point made by Deputy Esmonde, that if the two iron product factories in Wexford were given opportunities for free trading they would have a substantial export market.  The position is that we have a very liberal import regime and the manufacturers can buy their raw materials from any part of the world subject, of course, to their not being available on the home market. These are all materials destined for export markets and there is no difficulty for any manufacturer in procuring such raw materials or semifinished products from any part of the world so long as they are to be re-exported in finished form.  Therefore, there is no impediment to the Wexford companies in regard to the import of raw materials or semifinished products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has missed the point in what I said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to it. So much for the export side.  The Deputy went on to say that so far as the home market was concerned, they felt they could compete successfully with any imported manufacturers if they had permission to get their steel sheets and bars in the cheapest market.  I think the protection afforded to Irish steel prevents that because they are obliged, in so far as the Irish company can supply them, to buy from Irish Steel.  But I think the policy was well founded because, until such time as we could get the basic industry established here, the Wexford companies would have to depend on imported raw materials or semi-finished steel for the success, or even the continuance, of their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in the opening statement, <Col N="302" /> the existence of Irish Steel and the more favourable we make it the better the prospects will be for existing iron product manufacturing companies to continue in operation and the better will be the opportunities for new manufacturing companies to come into existence.  While there are irritants, and while there may still be irritants for some existing companies, I think in the long run the policy crystallised in this Bill is in the national interest.</P>

      <P>But they must pay more for the steel they buy in Cork than they would have to pay if they imported it.  That puts up their cost of production.</P>

      <P>I cannot deny that but at a time when world conditions were such that the Wexford companies were unable to get steel from abroad they had steel from the home industry which is largely based on the smelting or processing of steel from scrap arising on the home market.  It would, of course, be ideal if we could smelt all in this country and one does not know when that day may come, but we are not in any way unique in our present mode of operation because I think almost every steel industry in the world, with the possible exception of those in the U.S.S.R., have to depend on scrap arriving on the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry suggested that there was some form of cartel which restricted the production of Irish steel in corrugated sheets.  I know nothing about that but my remarks to Deputy Esmonde would apply there, that Irish Steel were not confined to the British market for the material from which they fashion corrugated sheets at Haulbowline.  Apparently, he said, Messrs.  Krupps of Germany tendered at a lower price than that at which the British company that had been supplying Haulbowline were able to tender but they were not even then&mdash; and I do not know how many years ago that was&mdash;confined to either British or German markets.  They could get sheet steel from any part of the world at competitive prices. Fortunately, now with the completion <Col N="303" /> of the sheet mills which these plans envisage, the manufacture of corrugated iron will go back a couple of stages, that is, we shall be making our own sheet and bars as well as blooms in the blooming mill and then later it will be fitted with ingots for the purpose, ultimately, of making our own sheets.</P>
    <P>I think whatever difficulties arose in the supply of black sheet in former years will no longer prevail when the sheet mill has been completed.  I do not think any other points were raised that call for a reply but I am glad that the Bill has met with such a good reception.  It is just what I expected. I am sure we all wish the plans now outlined in the company's proposals will be successful and will come to fruition at an early stage.</P>

      <P>That is a point that I overlooked in my reply.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to it today and also when the Supplementary Estimate was before the House last July.  Consideration was given to the manner in which the capital necessary would be provided and it was decided, after close examination, to provide it in this way, but there is in the Bill&mdash;I think in Section 4&mdash;provision whereby the Minister for Finance may dispose of his shares should a flotation by way of public issue ever become desirable. It is possible that stage will be reached and I think, as in the case of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, it would be a desirable stage as it would take this activity out of the category of State enterprises.  When a favourable time is deemed to have come, I am sure consideration will be given to the possibility of using the powers conferred on the Minister for the disposal of his shares as set out in Section 4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of the Bill is to continue for a further period of three years the rate remission provisions of Part II of the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1954.  The Bill also provides for a new method of calculating the county demand on the Buncrana Urban District Council in the year 1960/61 and subsequent financial years, the extension of the period of exemption from rates on new or improved farm buildings from seven to 20 years, and the reduction by one-half of the rates levied on half rents by county councils.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Act of 1954 provided for the granting of a two-thirds remission of rates for a period of seven years on the valuation of new buildings and on the increase in the valuations of existing buildings that were enlarged or improved where the work on the construction, enlargement or improvement was begun and completed between 27th July, 1953, and 26th July, 1956.  The Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1956, extended this period up to 31st March, 1960.  The remission so provided applies to all buildings, including hotels, shops, factories, offices and dwellinghouses, which do not qualify for a remission of rates under any other Statute.  Where a building is enlarged during the prescribed period and in the revised valuation following that enlargement, earlier improvements or additions are taken into account, the remission will also apply to those earlier improvements and additions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this legislation is to expedite works of building or construction to which the rate remission provisions of other statutes do not apply and the execution of which might otherwise be delayed.  From this point of view it appears to be desirable to continue for a further period of three years the rate remission provisions of the Act of 1954 and Section 1 of this Bill provides accordingly.  It <Col N="305" /> is estimated that the number of buildings which receive rate remissions under these Acts amounts to about 1,500 premises each year.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for the amendment of Section 14 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852.  The Act of 1852, provides that no hereditament or tenement shall be rated in respect of any increase in value arising from the erection of any farm, outhouse or office buildings for a period of seven years.  This exemption provision has been interpreted as applying also to the enlargement or improvement of such farm buildings. In present circumstances, when many farmers are effecting very desirable improvements in farm buildings, particularly in connection with the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, there is a good case for making a further concession in the rating of such buildings. It is accordingly, proposed in Section 2 of the Bill to extend the period of rate remission provided in the Act of 1852 to 20 years in respect of farm buildings which are erected, enlarged or improved between 1st April, 1960 and 31st March, 1963.</P>
    <P>As a result of the revision of all rateable hereditaments which was carried out in Buncrana urban district in the year 1950 at the request of the then urban district council, the total valuation of the urban district increased from £7,563 at 1st March, 1950, to £11,445 at 1st March, 1951. This steep increase in valuation resulted in a corresponding increase in the demand levied on the urban district council by the Donegal County Council.  A provision was included in the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1954, which was intended to bring the valuation of the urban district for county demand purposes in the year 1954/55 back to what it was estimated it would have been if no general revision had occurred and only normal increases had taken place.  That Act provided for an increase in valuation of £330 each year until, in the year 1963-64, the county demand would be based on a valuation of £11,520, after which the ordinary basis of valuation would apply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> This provision did not afford the intended degree of relief because the estimate of a normal annual increase of £330 was not realised.  The average annual increase in the valuation over the past nine years has, in fact, been only £93.  The result has been that the county demand on Buncrana is now considerably more than it would be if the general revision had not taken place.  It has been estimated that to date Buncrana has lost up to £16,000 by reason of the 1950 revision.</P>
    <P>The position of Buncrana <i>vis-a-vis</i> urban districts generally was further worsened by Section 50 of the Local Government Act, 1955, which provided for calculating the county demand on urban districts on the basis of net valuation and not, as hitherto, on the basis of gross valuation.  This provision was to the advantage of urban districts generally but a special provision was included to the effect that, in the case of Buncrana, the county demand should be assessed on the gross valuation, thus preventing that urban district from gaining the benefit conferred on urban districts generally by the 1955 Act.</P>
    <P>The Buncrana urban council have been pressing strongly for amending legislation to give them relief in respect of the disproportionately heavy impact of the county demand on their district and the Donegal County Council have supported their request.  Section 3 of the present Bill is intended to meet their application for such relief. The Bill provides that for the year 1960-61 the county demand on Buncrana will be calculated on the basis of 70 of the net produce of a rate of a penny in the £.  This will have the effect of placing Buncrana in the position in regard to the county demand in which it is estimated it would be if the general revision of valuations requested by the then urban council in 1950 had not been made and only normal increases in valuation had taken place.  For the year 1961-62 and the subsequent years the fractions proposed are .71, .72, .73 of a penny and so on until in the thirtieth year the fraction will be .99.  The result of this will be to spread over a period of 30 <Col N="307" /> years from the year 1960-61 the effect on the county demand of the abnormal increase which resulted from the 1950 revision.  The immediate effect of the proposed legislation would be to reduce by approximately £3,700 the county demand on Buncrana for the year 1960-61.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the granting of rate relief on half rent valuations in county health districts. Under existing legislation, a person receiving a rent in respect of a hereditament exempt from rating under Section 63 of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1838, used for charitable or public purposes is liable to be rated in respect of half such rent&mdash;called the half rent.  In county boroughs, boroughs and urban districts, rates are assessed on a fraction only of such half rents.  The fraction is 50 per cent. in urban districts and boroughs, and in the county boroughs it varies from 22 per cent. in Dublin to 60 per cent. in Waterford.  The existing legislative provisions in regard to the rating of half rents are anomalous.  Where an owner pays full rates on the half rent, he would, in fact, suffer a loss in cases where the county rate exceeds 40/- in the £.</P>
    <P>While I am aware that in a large proportion of cases, the tenant, by arrangement, pays the rates, I feel there is a strong case for granting rate relief on these half rent valuations. Section 4 accordingly provides that for a period of 10 years from 1st April, 1960, half rents in county health districts shall be assessed on half their valuation only.  This Bill is a temporary Bill and it would not be appropriate to include in it general provisions dealing in a permanent way with the rating of half rents.  It is hoped that before the expiration of this 10 year period the general question of the rating of half rents will have been fully examined.</P>
    <P>Local Government legislation granting remission of rates in one circumstance or another has been, in operation for the past 40 years and has always been on a temporary basis.  The Bill proposes to continue the temporary nature of the legislation so that <Col N="308" /> it will be subject to review from time to time.  In present circumstances, the impetus these rate remissions give to building projects more than compensates for the extra levy it places on the ratepayers and I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the high rate now demanded by local authorities, any Bill which relieves the burden on the ratepayers is welcome. For that reason principally, we welcome this measure.  This is a Bill to continue an Act passed in 1954, which was also at that time regarded as a temporary measure.</P>
      <P>We are glad the Minister has seen fit to amend the Valuation Act of 1852.  As he rightly pointed out, the farming community have now to expend considerable sums in improving farm buildings because of the regulations laid down for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and also in order to comply with the regulations under the Health Acts.  This expenditure is a heavy burden.  Under the 1852 Act there was a remission for seven years on such buildings.  That remission is now being extended to 20 years.  That is something which is very welcome and I hope that it will encourage the farmers to continue enlarging and improving their buildings.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the rate known as the &ldquo;half rent&rdquo; in county health districts.  I took this matter up with the Minister and I am very grateful to him for making provision in this Bill to deal with the matter.  In county health districts where the poor rate exceeds 40/- the owners of premises suffered a loss because of the operation of the half rent system. Urban areas were in a different category. Under this Bill both the urban health districts and the county health districts will be brought into line. That is something which will encourage people to let houses, for charitable purposes, which would be exempt from rates in ordinary circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special section of the Bill deals with Buncrana.  The necessity for this section shows how careful members of local authorities should be.  In or <Col N="309" /> about 1950 Buncrana, of its own volition, sought a revision of the poor rate.  Now the Minister is introducing a section in this Bill to undo the harm these gentlemen did at that time.  We are glad he has found a method whereby he can come to their assistance. My efforts in 1954 were unavailing. This section will give relief to the ratepayers of Buncrana.  At the same time, after a period of 30 years they will be paying full rates on their valuations.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else to which I wish to refer other than to repeat that any measure which relieves the burden on the ratepayers is always welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it achieves a number of things as far as the ratepayers are concerned.  There will be relief for those who are trying to rid their herds of bovine tuberculosis and who are compelled to incur very heavy expense in doing so.</P>
      <P>With regard to the &ldquo;half rent&rdquo; problem, solicitors and house agents will tell you that in counties like Donegal, where the rates in the £ are over the £2 mark, owners of properties are actually at a financial loss.  Even if they do not have to carry out repairs, they are at a loss.  If they have to carry out repairs, the property is a complete liability.  Because of that, it is good to see this new section designed to remedy the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing Section 3 to remedy the position in Buncrana.  As has been pointed out, that position was brought about through the action of the local authority some 10 years back.  It was unfortunate a decision was taken at that time.  It was unfortunate that the Valuation Office were so expeditious in carrying out the recommendation of the local authority.  In 1954 an effort was made to remedy the situation but because building had slowed down the annual increase of £330 was not reached.  The increase in valuations from a total of £7,000 to a total of £11,000 militated against building progress.  The 1954 Act fell <Col N="310" /> short inasmuch as it failed to put the ratepayers back into the position they would have been in had no revaluation taken place.  The Minister completely remedies the position by Section 3 of this measure.  He bases his calculations on the actual average increase over the last number of years and he has arrived at a figure of £93 per year average increase.</P>
    <P>He has got round to basing the rate on .7 of 1d. rather than on 1d., increasing by one hundredth of 1d. for the next 30 years.  That solves a very serious problem.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the provision and I am sure it will be appreciated by the local authority.</P>
    <P>I want also to mention that Donegal County Council although they are losers in that they will now get less money by way of county contribution, in the interests of justice backed the claim of Buncrana. They felt the previous action was unfair and should be remedied.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a number of good things in this Bill.  As far as Buncrana area is concerned, he has done a very good job indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all of us are pleased that the Buncrana problem, which all of us have known about for the past ten years, has been fixed up to the satisfaction of the Minister, Deputy O'Donnell, Buncrana Town Commissioners and the Donegal County Council.  I have no wish to interfere in the local affairs of County Donegal.  I am sure the Minister asked himself, as I now ask myself, how all this happened and what will be the end of this sort of business.  The question arises what value can we place on the valuation of the Valuation Office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a simple situation where the Buncrana Urban Council request the Valuation Office to revise or examine the valuation of the town of Buncrana and they increase it from £7,500 to £11,500.  That is regarded by the citizens, and I suppose rightly so, as unfair in relation to the county payment; they pay much more than their share in relation to what other people pay.  I am certain the Minister has no responsibility <Col N="311" /> for the Valuation Office.  I think it is probably the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It must give us all food for thought that this sort of thing can happen and that the Minister for Local Government has had to provide special legislation to undo what the Valuation Office did.  The Minister is perfectly right in doing this but the Government and the Minister for Finance should pay a little more attention to the problem.</P>
    <P>I am entitled to ask that the valuation in respect of any premises be re-examined and if necessary revised by the Valuation Office.  Could I not therefore in respect, say, of Gorey which is governed by Town Commissioners, request the Valuation Office to revise the valuation of every house and business premises in Gorey and put them in the same spot as Buncrana?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The request might be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and possibly this Minister or some future Minister would have to introduce legislation to correct a wrong done to the people of Gorey as was done to the people of Buncrana.  I do not know if the Minister has any comment to make on that.  The Valuation Office is not the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government even though he has a lot to do with it and many of the decisions of his Department impinge on it.  He is responsible for this legislation to relieve certain ratepayers in respect of new constructions, reconstructions and additions.</P>
      <P>The Buncrana business was a mess; whose, we do not know.  The Valuation Office protest they did their job in accordance with the rules and regulations by which they are bound.  However, they did it in such a thorough way that the people of Buncrana were mulcted for rates to such an extent that the Minister for Local Government now has to come with legislation to undo what the Valuation Office did in 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to <Col N="312" /> amend the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852.  That Act provided that farm buildings would be relieved of rates for a period of seven years after they were constructed.  Under Section 2 of this Bill it is proposed to extend the period of rates remission to 20 years in respect of farm buildings erected, enlarged or improved between 1st April, 1960, and 31st March, 1963.</P>
      <P>I think you will create a very unhappy situation if you provide this relief for a period of 20 years for one man's farm buildings while the man who has collaborated with the Department of Agriculture to improve farm buildings last year or the year before finds he is entitled only to seven years' remission.  The man who has been hanging back is rewarded for his reluctance to collaborate by getting a remission of 20 years.</P>
      <P>The farm buildings scheme came into operation in 1949.  The Department of Agriculture had been pressing very hard on every farmer to take advantage of that scheme to improve his buildings and a great many of them did.  I think in the financial year ended 31st March, 1957, nearly £800,000 was paid out in grants in respect of farm buildings.  Very considerable sums have been spent practically every year since 1950. Would it not seem more equitable to provide that farm buildings erected since, say, 1949&mdash;when the farm buildings scheme was introduced by the Department of Agriculture and farmers were exhorted to collaborate with that Department in the improvement of their buildings&mdash;should enjoy this 20 years' remission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great difficulties that every Minister for Agriculture experiences is to get farmers to avail of schemes designed for the improvement of the industry as a whole.  No more unfortunate impression could be created upon the public mind than that those who hang back do better than those who show the way.  In respect of these schemes, it was a matter of great importance to me when I was Minister for Agriculture, and I do not doubt it is a matter of great importance to my successor, to find in every parish some enterprising person <Col N="313" /> to demonstrate the value of a scheme by availing of it and showing its benefits to his neighbour.</P>
    <P>On behalf of these people, who are the cherished friends of any Minister for Agriculture, I suggest the Minister should consider providing that the 20 years' remission which in the Bill is available in respect of buildings erected, enlarged or improved between 1960 and 1963 will apply to farm buildings erected, enlarged or improved between, say, 1st April, 1949, and 31st March, 1963.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large, the speakers mainly from the Opposition benches have in general terms welcomed the various provisions of this Bill.  A few questions were raised.  Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Opposition, questioned the advisability, fairness, or justice of the rates remission for 20 years.  He asked why it is not possible to give this remission of 20 years to those who have already built, for instance, during the years back to 1st April, 1949.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be fully alive to the fact, naturally, that this problem presented itself to me during the course of the investigation of what might be done and the changes we were about to make.  First of all, we must have regard to the fact that rate remissions, whether they are new provisions or merely a continuation of that which existed in the past, are designed to encourage new building of various kinds and in this instance encourage new buildings on farmsteads and out-offices of the farmsteads throughout the country.</P>
      <P>It is also quite evident, of course, that those already built do not require the encouragement of this improved rate remission to get them into existence.  They are already there. Secondly, the bovine tuberculosis regulations are also making demands which are of pressing and urgent need on many of our farmers throughout the country.  You cannot ignore those demands and, at the same time, make people build more in order to make the improvements called for.  That was one of the arguments, and I think a fairly sound one, advanced as to why we should try to further encouragement by rate remission on these buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It still leaves unanswered the question why we should not apply this back to the buildings commenced last year, the year before or 20 years ago. It is fairly evident in all these matters of grants or remissions, aid or assistance of any kind by any Department that the question of a dateline is one which has to be decided definitely one way or the other.  No matter what <Col N="319" /> dateline is decided, or has ever been decided in regard to benefits of this or any other nature, there are always those who have just missed by a day, a week, a month or a year and naturally enough they think they should get the benefits but the fact is that, no matter how far back one goes, there is always the person who, the year before or the day before, would have been entitled to benefit and who feels he should be included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes if you went back 30 years but the period is 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be just the same.  We have to go back to the original idea which is encouragement, the underlying motive in all these remissions, to promote new building, not to encourage it 20 or 30 years from now but within the three years from the 1st April last to the 31st March, 1963; in other words, to give encouragement within that period to erect certain buildings which we feel are necessary but which, without this encouragement, might not be undertaken. That is fundamentally the real case for the remissions, as it has been in other remission Bills in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest that those who have already built are deserving of this concession is no doubt a ready argument and quite an appealing one, but the fundamental principle comes first and that is to provide encouragement to do something that is not yet done.  That is what we are trying to do here and that is why we cannot go back 5, 6, 10 or 11 years and give this remission to those who already enjoy, and for some years past have been enjoying, the facilities of improved buildings which, possibly due to their circumstances in <Col N="320" /> those years, they were able to provide, whereas those who have yet to build possibly could not build because they had not the resources or because they may have feared the impact on their rates as the result of new building.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish also raised a point concerning the Valuation Office.  As he said, the Valuation Office is not my concern or that of my Department.  It is under the Department of Finance. The Deputy made the point on the question of Buncrana that the provision we are now making in this Bill &mdash;one which he entirely and fully agrees is necessary &mdash; nevertheless shows a fundamental weakness in that it never should have happened, and that the Valuation Office would need to be brought to book to some degree about the matter and that, more or less, under existing law there is possibly some responsibility for the situation that has existed there.  However, let us not forget&mdash;I do not think any other urban council in future will forget it&mdash;that it was the urban council members who brought this about in the first instance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and without their efforts, without their resolution covering the entire area for a revision of valuation, it could not have happened. It was not due to the initiative of the Valuation Office so that while one might show, as Deputy Corish has said, that some rather ridiculous position may obtain in, certain circumstances as a result of a flaw in the working of the Valuation Office, nevertheless I do not think that, in the case of Buncrana, we can put the blame on that Office.  Rather, we should put it where it belongs and where it has long since been placed, fairly and squarely on the shoulders, not of the entire members of the urban council in Buncrana in 1950 but on the shoulders of members who, by recorded vote, not only on one occasion but also on a second occasion, confirmed that they wanted this thing done.  It was a split vote of four to four, with the chairman's casting vote in favour of it to make it worse.</P>

No better sense was displayed by those four people on the second vote than was displayed in the first and they confirmed their own downfall.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill containing miscellaneous provisions in respect of a number of unrelated matters affecting the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>The main purposes of the Bill are:</P>
      <P>(i) to authorise the increase to £120 m. of the present statutory limit of £100 m. on the expenditure which the Electricity Supply Board may incur for capital purposes other than the electrification of rural areas;</P>
      <P>(ii) to authorise the increase to £32 m. of the present statutory limit of £30 m. on the expenditure which the Board may incur on the electrification of rural areas, and</P>
      <P>(iii) to provide for the assumption by the Minister for Lands of certain functions at present exercised by the Minister for Transport and Power and of certain new functions relating in each case to the fisheries vested in the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>Other matters provided for include:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) removal of the limit of £25 m. on the amount which the Electricity Supply Board may borrow by the creation of stock or other forms of security;</P>
      <P>(ii) the clarification of the Board's powers in relation to fisheries and of the arrangements for compensation for interference with fishing rights;</P>
      <P>(iii) matters relating to the form of the Board's accounts and appointment of members of the Board;</P>
      <P>(iv) increases in pensions of the Board's supperannuated staff; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> (v) establishment of a superannuation scheme for wholetime members of the Board.</P>
    <P>In the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1953, details were given of the Board's programme for the increase of their generating capacity from 629 Megawatts to 1,042.5 Megawatts by 31st March, 1961.  The cost of completing that programme, including ancillary transmission and distribution equipment, but excluding work chargeable to rural electrification, was then estimated at £53.5m., and to make full provision for the programme would have entailed raising the authorised limit of the Board's capital expenditure for general purposes to £120m.  The Act of 1954 authorised capital expenditure by the Board for general purposes up to £100m.  It was intended that further provision would be made when the need arose, that is to say, when the total of the Board's expenditure and commitments was nearing this limit.</P>
    <P>The 1954 programme envisaged the addition of 413 Megawatts to the Board's generating capacity during the following seven years.  This programme was based on the assumption that the demand for electricity would continue to increase at the rate of about 13 per cent. per annum, then prevailing.  This rate of increase did not continue however and it became necessary to curtail the programme early in 1956.  Later the rate of expansion in demand showed a tendency to recover and the provision of some of the capacity which had been postponed was undertaken.</P>
    <P>At present the installed generating capacity of the Board is 728 Megawatts and further plant, which I will describe in a moment, will be commissioned between now and 1964. Planning for the expansion of generating capacity must commence many years ahead because it takes up to five years to bring a new power plant from drawing board to full operation.  The generating plant requirements of the Board for the years from 1964/65 onwards were approved at the beginning <Col N="324" /> of this year and a new programme of construction for the five years to 1968/ 69 has been settled.  The programme from 1964 to 1969 is based on an estimated growth in the consumption of electricity at an average rate of seven per cent per annum.  This was the rate of growth in the two years 1957/58 and 1958/59.  Consumption in the year ended 31st March, 1960 was about 10 per cent higher than in the previous year; this higher rate of increase is attributable substantially to specific industrial requirements of a non-recurring nature, particularly the new oil refinery.  The Electricity Supply Board are keeping a close watch on the trend of demand and the programme will be subject to alteration if the trend of demand warrants it.</P>
    <P>Before the first plants in the new programme come into operation in 1964/65, the Electricity Supply Board will have brought into commission in the meantime at Rhode, Co. Offaly, and Bellacorick, Co. Mayo, 80 megawatts of new plants, all of which will use milled peat.  This will increase the total generating capacity of the Board's plant to 808 megawatts.  The new programme envisages the addition of a further 340 megawatts of which 160 megawatts will be fired by milled peat and 180 megawatts by oil, and provides for the absorption by 1968/69 of the annual output of all the bogs which are at present considered economically usable for the generation of electricity.  Oil-fired stations will be sandwiched between peat-fired stations so as to ensure maintenance of electricity supply in a year in which weather conditions were very adverse for either turf or water generation of electricity or both. To ensure continuity of bog development and employment by Bord na Móna, the oil stations will be used only to the extent that water and peat generation is insufficient to meet demand.  For the development and exploitation of the bogs in connection with this programme, it is expected that Bord na Móna will provide additional employment for up to about 1,000 men each summer falling to about half that number in winter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> All the more important rivers have already been harnessed for electricity generation.  Stations on the remaining rivers would be uneconomical in present circumstances, having regard particularly to the high initial capital costs and current high interest rates. The Electricity Supply Board, however, are continuing to collect data and investigate other rivers with a view to possible later development for hydro generation.  The Board have in operation a 15 megawatt generating station at Arigna using native coal and considerable quantities of native coal are also used at Ringsend station.  Although the use of nuclear energy for generating electricity is not foreseen in the immediate future, the Board is keeping in close touch with developments in this field.</P>
    <P>The programme of capital expenditure other than that for rural electrification approved by the Board already exceeds £100 million and they will require shortly to enter into commitments exceeding the present statutory limit of £100 million.  The Board have, therefore, requested that the limit should be increased to £120 million, which they consider the minimum necessary to cover expenditure and commitments for the next four years or so.</P>
    <P>The Bill raises by £2 million to £32 million the total amount which the Board may spend on the electrification of rural areas.  It had been estimated that a total of £30 million would be sufficient to complete the scheme but a wider response in some areas than had been provided for has resulted in increased expenditure and it is now expected that by the time the scheme has been completed, in about another two years, expenditure will approach £32 million.  As the scheme nears completion, the rate of progress has slowed down slightly but, nevertheless, forty areas were completed in the year ended 31st March, 1960, and the same number is expected to be done in the current year.  At 30th September, 1960, 708 areas had been completed and there were only 84 areas in which work had yet to commence. The raising of the limit of £30 million to £32 million involves increasing <Col N="326" /> the total amount of the subsidy which may be paid to the Board by £1 million.</P>
    <P>The Board, in their annual report for the year 1959/60, point out that when the programme of rural electrification was decided upon, it was accepted that it would be an unremunerative service and that a 50 per cent. capital subsidy by the State was the minimum necessary to enable the scheme to be initiated.  The alteration in State policy in relation to subsidy in 1955, resulted in the Board having to bear capital expenditure amounting almost to £9.5 million which it had expected to be met by subsidy and this, as the report indicates, has involved a continuing burden of more than £500,000 per annum on the finances of the Board.  Moreover, the rural areas now being developed are the more uneconomic areas and the subsidy of 50 per cent. of the capital cost, which was restored in 1958, is not sufficient to enable supply to be provided except at a continuing loss to the Board.</P>
    <P>The aggregate of losses on the Board's rural account in the past five complete years has amounted to £2.73 m.  The loss in the latest year was £888,000 and this figure is expected to increase still further.</P>
    <P>Surpluses on non-rural account have helped to offset the losses on rural electrification, but a nett deficiency of £195,000 in the Board's revenue emerged in the year ended 31st March, 1958.  The nett deficiency in the following year, that is, in the year ended 31st March, 1959, was £99,000.</P>
    <P>In the year which ended on 31st March, 1960, the surplus on the Board's non-rural account fell short of the rural deficit by well over £500,000 and, as a result, the Board showed an overall deficiency for the third successive year, the sum involved, in that year, being £433,000. The Board, accordingly, indicated that to put their finances in order an increase in charges would be necessary.</P>
    <P>The statute clearly sets out the duties and responsibilities of the <Col N="327" /> Board in circumstances of this kind. It is entirely the responsibility of the Board under Section 21 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, to ensure that its revenue will be sufficient to meet outgoings.  In discharge of this responsibility, the Board recently announced an increase in charges which, I understand, will add approximately five per cent. to its total revenue.</P>
    <P>The amount of the increase and the decision to apply it are entirely the responsibility of the Board, and I have no statutory function in the matter.  I have been struck, however, by the fact that the average price per unit for all electricity sold by the Board in the year 1959/60 was only 36 per cent. above the corresponding price in the year ended 31st March, 1939.  This compares with increases in the costs of gas, oil and coal over the same period ranging from 145 per cent. to 218 per cent. and with increases of 164 per cent. in the consumer price index, 232 per cent. in the wholesale price index, and nearly 230 per cent. in average earnings per week in industry.</P>
    <P>The comparisons I have quoted and indeed the general record and reputation of the Electricity Supply Board reflect the efficiency and devotion to the public interest with which the Board and their staff have discharged their responsibilities.  The Board are not complacent, however, and take every opportunity to increase efficiency further and reduce costs.  I am glad to know that in these respects, the Board, like other forward looking organisations, are making use of modern techniques such as work study.</P>
    <P>The limit of £25 m. on the amount which the Electricity Supply Board may borrow from the public by the creation of stock is being withdrawn. When the Board was first authorised to seek finance from the public, under the 1954 Act, a statutory limit was set to the amount which the Board might so borrow.  Experience has shown that this limitation is unnecessary and the present opportunity is being taken to <Col N="328" /> remove the limit.  The prior consent of the Ministers for Finance and Transport and Power will, of course, continue to be required to each public borrowing operation by the Board.</P>
    <P>Under existing provisions the Board have made two issues of stock totalling £15 million.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for the assumption by the Minister for Lands of certain powers and functions in relation to the fisheries vested in the Electricity Supply Board.  Some few provisions in existing legislation in regard to the Board's fisheries provide for the consent of the Minister for Transport and Power in certain cases, but, in general, the Minister for Transport and Power has no function in regard to the Board's fisheries nor has he available to him the information and technical advice which he would require to deal with any matter which may arise in regard to them, either in the Oireachtas or elsewhere.  It is desirable, therefore, that the Minister for Lands, to whom the necessary information and technical advice are available, should be more closely associated with the administration of the fisheries and that the occasional questions which may arise should be dealt with by that Minister.</P>
    <P>In the administration of the fisheries under their control, the Electricity Supply Board have concentrated mainly on the development of angling and commercial salmon fisheries and commercial eel and oyster fisheries.  The position in regard to the trout and coarse fishing under the control of the Board has, accordingly, been under consideration by the Minister for Lands.  Under existing legislation, the Board have extensive powers in the matter of awarding leases of trout and coarse fisheries but have comparatively rarely exercised these powers and, in the opinion of the Minister for Lands, the rights which the Board find possible to grant are inadequate to enable the lessees to develop these fisheries in a proper manner.  The Minister for Lands desires that, in any case where it would be in the national interest for the Board to grant a lease in respect of trout or coarse fishing to <Col N="329" /> the Inland Fisheries Trust or some other suitable body, he should have power to influence the Board in the matter.  He considers that angling for trout and coarse fish should be on an agreed plan, in the devising of which he will seek the advice of a joint Committee representative of his Department, the Inland Fisheries Trust, Board Fáilte and the Electricity Supply Board.  If the development of particular fisheries can best be achieved by leases of certain waters, the Minister for Lands should be in a position to indicate the term of years the lease should run so as to allow of adequate development and protection in each case.  The Minister for Lands has made it clear that in the matter of leasing of Electricity Supply Board fisheries, the object would be to ensure as far as possible the full development of these fisheries.  In this, due regard would be given to the salmon fisheries and their primacy recognised.  I am satisfied that the arrangements now proposed will not compromise the management responsibility laid on the Electricity Supply Board and a provision has, accordingly, been included in the Bill to meet the desire of the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>There are also three minor provisions in the Bill to repair defects in the legislation relating to the Board's fisheries:</P>
    <P>(a)  New Fisheries arising in E.S.B. waters:</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation, the Board have powers to manage fisheries which they have acquired but they have no general power to manage new fisheries which have arisen, mainly in the reservoirs of hydro-electric schemes.  Construction of the schemes was bound to destroy existing fisheries by submersion in the reservoirs and otherwise, and the Board had no option but to acquire them under Section 7 of the 1945 Act.  On the basis that the fisheries would be destroyed no provision was made for their management. New fisheries have arisen and it is now proposed that the Board be given power to arrange for their preservation and maintenance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> (b)  Compensation for interference with fisheries:</P>
    <P>The destruction of fisheries interfered with the livelihood of a number of persons employed in fishing and Section 18 of the 1945 Act was designed to provide for the payment of suitable compensation to them. The measure of compensation laid down in the Act is such as is considered reasonable for total loss of profits or earnings and all persons who have so far received compensation under that Section did in fact suffer total loss of their profits or earnings.  The Act did not, however, provide for partial compensation for persons whose profits or earnings were merely reduced but not extinguished.  The establishment of an electricity generating station on a river may not immediately affect the earnings of such persons, but progressive diminution in the run of fish, attributable to the establishment of a hydro-electric station, may later occur and the earnings of such persons may be reduced.  To provide for the case of such persons, the Board is now being authorised to pay compensation to them in proportion to the measure of their loss and to make further payments to them in the case of any subsequent losses until the total of payments reaches the compensation appropriate to total loss of earnings.</P>
    <P>(c)  Board's title to Shannon Fisheries :</P>
    <P>The purpose of the third minor provision in regard to fisheries is to repair a defect in the Board's title to the Shannon Fisheries.  It was intended that the Shannon Fisheries Act, 1938 would transfer these fisheries <i>in toto</i> to the Board but the relevant provisions were not effective to transfer any State-owned fisheries which might have existed in the waters of the Shannon.  The present Bill proposes to confirm the title of the Board to all fisheries in the waters of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board, being the first of our semi-State bodies to be set up, were inevitably burdened with some unduly rigid procedural obligations which later experience has shown <Col N="331" /> to be unnecessary.  Two of these are being modified in the present Bill. Firstly, the cumbersome procedure which requires members of the Board of the Electricity Supply Board, on the occasion of any alteration in their remuneration or allowances, to resign and be re-appointed, is being abolished.  Secondly, it is proposed to abolish the requirement that the Minister for Transport and Power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, should prescribe by regulation the time, place and method of conducting the audit of the accounts of the Electricity Supply Board, the accounts to be furnished to the Minister and the accounts to be published and put on sale.  Modern practice has been to allow the responsible Minister to give an informal direction in such cases, and it is now proposed to bring the position of the Electricity Supply Board into line.</P>
    <P>Further provisions of the Bill will allow the Electricity Supply Board to grant to their pensioners increases similar to those allowed to public service pensioners in 1959 and 1960.</P>
    <P>The opportunity of the present Bill is also being taken to bring the legislation in relation to the superannuation of whole-time members of the Board of the Electricity Supply Board into line with legislation, enacted since the passing of the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, in regard to the superannuation of whole-time members of the boards of semi-State bodies.  The Bill provides that the Minister for Transport and Power, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may make a scheme or schemes covering the superannuation of whole-time members of the Board.  The schedule to the Bill sets out details of matters to be provided for in any superannuation scheme made under the provision.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend this Bill to the House.  The Electricity Supply Board is one of the oldest of our semi-State bodies and one of the most effective.  The success which has attended its efforts over the years, on which the management and staff deserve our most sincere congratulations, <Col N="332" /> has in large measure contributed to the economic advancement of the nation in general.  The enactment of this Bill will enable the Board to continue their good work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The House generally will welcome the proposals in this Bill which provide statutory authority to increase the borrowing powers of the Electricity Supply Board so that it may continue its development programme. I have no doubt that there is general recognition throughout the country that the Electricity Supply Board has played a most significant part in the economic development of the country.  So far as I am aware, it was the first State company established here.  Not alone has it pioneered the way in that sphere, but, as the body responsible for the general electricity supply since the Shannon Scheme was established, it has played a unique part in the economic development of the country.</P>
      <P>The Board and the staff deserve the commendations which the Minister has expressed, as well as the many commendations they have received on numerous occasions for the skill with which they have applied themselves to the development of the electricity network which has provided light and power to an ever-increasing extent.</P>
      <P>There is general recognition that the Electricity Supply Board is efficiently and competently managed.  That being so, it is to be expected that all the actions and decisions taken by the company have been taken on the basis of the most careful and competent consideration.  It is a fact that the recent announcement that E.S.B. charges were to be increased came as a shock to the public generally.  For that reason, the public expect the E.S.B. to continue to make every effort to effect economies wherever possible and keep costs to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I anticipate that that is so, there are certain figures in the published accounts which were circulated earlier for the year ended 31st March, 1960, which require some comment and probably some elucidation.  On page 24 of the Annual Report for the year ended 31st March, 1960, particulars <Col N="333" /> are given in the appendix of the performance of generating plant for the year ended March, 1960.  This may be a technical matter and there may be certain reasons for it, but in view of the fact that losses were incurred and that as a consequence the charge for electricity has to be increased, it is pertinent to examine these figures in order to ascertain if any avoidable expenditure was incurred.  I notice in that Table that for three stations, Portarlington, Allenwood and Lanesboro, the total expenditure on sod peat amounted to £1,265,000 and on the figures which were quoted, the equivalent fuel of either coal or oil used in the stations of either Marina and Ringsend would have cost a sum of £400,000 less.  Similarly, in the case of milled peat at Ferbane which amounted to £599,433, an equivalent fuel cost at Ringsend would have amounted to about £120,000 less.  It is significant that in the plant load factor which is mentioned there, a higher contribution from the turf-fired stations I have mentioned was made. The plant load factor for Portarlington was 63.5; that for Allenwood, 59.2; Lanesboro was lower, 29.9.  However, in the case of Ringsend and Marina, one was 39.1 and the other was 32.8.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, it is necessary on particular occasions in the case of an excessively wet year to have available stand-by facilities which enable either oil or coal-fired stations to be put into production, but it does seem from the figures quoted that the production costs were higher because of the use of turf-fired generating capacity. While everyone is anxious to see the maximum possible development of our own resources and the development of electricity from these resources, it does seem that in the case of a very large generating programme and in circumstances in which losses have been incurred, according to the accounts, over a period not of one year but of three years running, which will mean in the near future an increase in charges, the most careful consideration should be given to the switching into production of generating capacity which involves an increase in the cost of production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> On the basis of the figures which I have quoted and on the comparative costs of electricity generated from either oil or coal, it appears to me that the additional fuel costs which were incurred in 1959-60 amounted to something in the region of £600,000. That, in a total generating capacity such as the E.S.B. has, may not seem a very significant figure.  But when account is taken of the actual losses and the fact that it is possible to switch in and switch out as the case may be with peat stations, very serious consideration should be given to the question of using the low cost generating capacity.</P>
    <P>There is no better case for subsidising one form of power here than there is, as has been repeatedly said, for subsidising public transport, and from the figures quoted it appears that turf-fired generating capacity is bearing, or securing to some extent, a subsidy from the other stations.  I should be glad if the Minister would have that matter examined because, as I say, if essential costs of production increase, and there, is no way of avoiding them, at any rate the public should understand the need for increased charges.  If, on the other hand, as appears from the figures I have quoted, that in the year ended 31st March the load factor from the turf-fired and milled peat stations appears to have been heavier and the cost was consequently higher, the public are entitled to some explanation.</P>
    <P>The other matter about which I thought the Minister might have given more information was in regard to the future generating programme.  As I noted the present generating programme is based, as it must be based, on a certain number of years ahead in view of the length of time which it takes to plan a scheme from the drawing board stage to actual production. In that connection, I thought the Minister gave us very little information. It would be interesting to ascertain from the Electricity Supply Board what consideration has been given to the question of providing electricity from atomic energy and what comparative cost figures are <Col N="335" /> available on the cost of the production of electricity from such stations.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I understood, because the Electricity Supply Board were represented on a committee established to consider the offer made by the United States Government to provide a nuclear reactor, that these matters were the subject of study by the Board's technical advisers.  In view of the pending completion of the hydro-generating station programme and the projected schemes of development for further peat stations and also the coal-fired stations which have been established at Arigna, it seems we are in sight of reaching the end of the generating capacity from existing resources.  It is, therefore, important to consider what are the possible prospects from atomic energy.</P>
    <P>The changes in regard to the provision of increased pensions for members of the staff, which are included in the Bill, will be welcomed generally. It is also desirable to make suitable arrangements for pension proposals for full-time members of the Board.  I have no doubt that the skill and ability which has characterised the development of this undertaking since its establishment will be reflected in the further progress of the Electricity Supply Board.  For that reason we welcome the proposal to extend the authority of the Board to increase its capital programme because the money which has been invested in this undertaking has not only been employed to the maximum possible extent but has reflected itself in a general economic improvement throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Cosgrave has already indicated, the Fine Gael Party is only too happy to give its support to the proposals in this Bill.  At the same time, we feel we have an obligation to sound a note of warning and to ask for some caution in relation to any activities of the Electricity Supply Board which may contribute to the rather serious and disappointing losses which the Board has shown in recent years.  We appreciate that the principal reason for the Board's losses has been the distribution of electricity in <Col N="336" /> some rural areas where it is uneconomic to do so and where it can only be done at a prohibitive cost to the consumer.</P>
      <P>We are all anxious that the amenities of modern civilisation, by way of light, heat and power, should be communicated to all our people, but I have the feeling that we are at the stage in relation to rural electrification where it would be much wiser to stop the extension of the rural electrification scheme and substitute a scheme of bottled gas such as has been promoted in the Aran Islands. I think this is particularly desirable since I understand we are now in a position to supply our needs of bottled gas from our own oil refinery.  Therefore, it would be every bit as patriotic to provide light and heat by bottled gas as by electricity which in recent years has been coming from imported fuels.</P>
      <P>We are all glad of course that the Electricity Supply Board is taking up such a large percentage of Bord na Móna's output.  It is an excellent thing that our power industries should be co-operating with one another to use our own native sources of power.  We must, however, be sensible in relation to this, and we should not do so where the price we are asked to pay is too heavy in proportion to the return.  There are times, of course, when we would be compelled to pay an uneconomic price even in relation to our own resources, but there are other times when other fuels are available and when it is very bad policy economically to use a disproportionate amount of a costly fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On more than one occasion in this House I have been attacked, and I hope I shall not provoke another such attack today, when I have argued that it was unfair that urban areas should be asked to pay for some economic activity down the country.  No matter how desirable it is to keep our people on the land, no matter how desirable socially, economically and culturally speaking it may be to keep our people distributed <Col N="337" /> throughout the provinces, I feel we are imposing an undue burden on one section of the community when we ask them consistently to subsidise uneconomic industries and activities in other parts of the country.  It is undesirable that we should do so, certainly when the cost is as enormous as it now is on the people who live in cities and towns, when one adds up the various things they are subsidising, such as transport and, in recent years, obviously fuel and power.  It is an unnecessary burden on the urban community that they should be asked to pay £500,000 a year, that they should be asked to pay an extra five per cent. on their electricity bills, when there appears to be a reasonably cheap form of fuel for heating, lighting and cooking in bottled gas.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the E.S.B. may not want to undertake a new scheme of bottled gas as it is a separate function which has nothing to do with the production of electric power; but I am quite certain that there are ample private interests in the country only too ready to embark on a co-operative scheme to supply bottled gas.  I should like to see that kind of thing encouraged, principally because it would be more economic and, secondly, because it would remove the unfair burden from the remaining consumers of electric power.  It is something which deserves more attention and I should certainly like to see it being done.  It is not a question of trying to deprive the E.S.B. of some necessary moneys or investments they need; it is simply trying to make the best of our resources and not to do something patently uneconomic, when there is a reasonable alternative available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I think it is very important that the idea which Fianna Fáil appear to be anxious to promote that rural electrification has created a deficit in the E.S.B. should be dissipated. There was a slight deficit in the total account of the E.S.B. up to the end of the year ending 31st March, <Col N="338" /> 1958, as set out in paragraph 12 of the Minister's speech where he speaks of a net deficiency of £195,000.  The net deficiency in the following year, the year ending 31st March, 1959, was £99,000 and it is in that context where the Minister had been speaking of rural electrification and the increased capital necessary for it that the Minister mentions these deficiencies.</P>
      <P>In a large undertaking like the E.S.B., of course one can attribute a net deficit to anything one likes but I think before determining that rural electrification is the source of that deficiency in the Board's accounts, it is right to have regard to the fact that a policy decision was taken by the Taoiseach, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, to give priority to the user of turf in the power stations of the country.  The result has been that with the increased power station erection for the use of turf as fuel, we have had a parallel programme of stand-by stations based on oil or coal. That parallel system is necessary in order to ensure that in any season when turf cannot, be won in sufficient quantities, the whole electricity system will not break down, but the fact is that it means a vast additional capital expenditure which has to be financed for the stand-by stations which spend a great deal of their time idle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can fairly estimate that the increased capital cost of these stand-by stations would be approximately £500,000 a year which is a charge that would not fall on the revenue of the E.S.B., if these stations were used to their full capacity, instead of being used exclusively as stand-by stations. A number of other policy decisions have been taken from time to time which have involved the E.S.B. in substantial additional overhead charges and we have the sod peat stations at Portarlington, Allenwood and Lanesboro. I think it is reasonable to estimate that the fuel cost which in these stations amounts to about £1¼ million, produces a volume of electricity which could have been produced for approximately £800,000 if the electricity was produced through using oil or coal. Probably the milled station in Ferbane, which had a fuel user in the last year, <Col N="339" /> I think, of about £600,000 produced a volume of electricity that could have been produced for less than £500,000 at Ringsend.  Then, there are the small stations, Skreen, Milltown Malbay and Gweedore which produce a volume of electricity which, I believe, might have cost £120,000 less, if it had been produced at Ringsend or one of the other big oil or coal burning stations.</P>
    <P>I imagine that it is not unreasonable to say that the user of turf, sod turf, milled and hand-won turf, as fuel for the various peat stations that have been erected, has involved the E.S.B. in an additional cost of £600,000 or more per annum.  That was a policy decision taken by this House, but if you add to that the approximate additional overhead charges of £500,000 for interest, depreciation and repayments in respect of the standby stations which we are not using but which we must have to provide against the possibility of a seasonal shortage of turf, you must face the fact that the E.S.B. are finding from their resources more than £1,000,000 a year to help Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>As the Minister says, that provides employment for 1,000 men at the peak of the season, falling to 500 men at the lowest period of the turf-winning season, but this House should face the fact that there is a substantial additional building programme in hand and I understand we are to provide plant to produce 160 kilowatts from milled peat in the future. For all that production, or for the greater part of it, additional stand-by plant will also be required.  Nearly half of that total capital investment will be idle but will remain a substantial charge on the revenue of the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when this House comes to ask itself whether the provision of electricity to the rural areas of Ireland is the source of the net deficiency in the E.S.B. accounts to which the Minister referred, we ought to bear in mind that the charge for burning turf as a fuel in our stations involves a burden on E.S.B. resources of something over £1,000,000 per year, and <Col N="340" /> that actually, omitting the item of £500,000 depreciation and interest and repayment for the excess generating capacity which we have to maintain, the increase in costs for fuel alone comes to something between £600,000 and £650,000 per annum.  That may be good policy or it may be bad policy, but one thing is certain; it is the main source of the deficiency in the accounts of the E.S.B. and it is a charge which, so far as I know, this House entered into with its eyes wide open.  Having done that, it would be a deplorable thing if we forgot our own decision in that regard and proceeded to attribute the deficiency to the provision of amenities to the rural community in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The conditions of the rural community in Ireland at present are such that a large part of the population are evacuating the country.  The investment we have made in bringing the amenity of electric light and power to the houses of people on the land, I believe, is a very valuable investment for the nation as a whole.  I believe it is a charge the E.S.B. could have borne upon their revenues with no difficulty whatever, if they had not been asked to undertake the additional charge of supporting the finances of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind now that the vast bulk of the output of Bord na Móna is consumed by the E.S.B., and it is consumed on the basis of Bord na Móna informing the E.S.B. what the turf cost and the price Bord na Móna expected to get for it.  That charge is then incorporated into the costs of electricity and communicated in due course to the consumer in town and country, through the medium of their bi-monthly bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister might well examine this whole question of how far this business of building to excess capacity should be pushed or how far the interests of the nation would best be served by using our existing capacity to something nearer its maximum than we are at present doing.  It is a very complex and highly technical question as to how far this can be done, but when we are borrowing money at <Col N="341" /> six per cent. and charging £99 for 100 per cent. of our loan, the time has come to consider carefully how we are spending it.  We ought to spend it productively and to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>I believe we have enough equipment to generate all the electricity we shall want for the next ten years, and I believe the additional expenditure now envisaged for increasing that capacity is largely unnecessary.  At one time, we were told to go on building, on the assumption that the demand would increase by 13 per cent.  That was quickly found to be a mistake.  I should be interested to hear from the Minister what are our present estimates of the annual increase in the demand for electric power, and how are they related to the programme which we have in mind for building and construction for the next five or ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of rural electrification being uneconomic has been mentioned here.  I agree, of course, with what Deputy Dillon has just said, that it is most essential that we should give to the rural community all the amenities possible in order that we may hold them on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system adopted in rural electrification appears to have been to divide country districts into certain areas. One finds constantly that when an area has been electrified and power has been extended to it, there are half a dozen people in that area who were entitled to the power but were left out and told it would be uneconomic to give them a supply.  That has not happened in one area only.  In my constituency, whenever the E.S.B. have been working in an area and have gone, we always find a few people who have been told that although they are in the area they cannot have the power.  That appears to me to be definite discrimination between one section of the community and another.  One often finds that people in a particular area are really much closer to another area, but for some reason or another, whoever drafted the maps or plans originally, <Col N="342" /> decided these were the frontiers that were to exist.</P>
    <P>I suggest that is a matter which requires investigation.  In that way, quite a number of people have been excluded from those benefits.  I think it is true to say that the more people there are enjoying the benefits of electric power, the more likelihood there is of their settling down on the land and remaining happy and content there.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which appears to me to militate greatly against people taking electric power. The amount they will be charged is calculated on the square foot capacity of the buildings on a holding.  I know quite a number of people scattered throughout rural Ireland who would have taken the power and, therefore, made the area more economic, because they would have raised the percentage considerably, if they had been permitted to put in the lights they wanted, perhaps one in the kitchen and one in the dairy outside, but the charge they would have to pay is rated on the entire building. There are quite a lot of farms on which there are buildings which are very little used but, in spite of that fact, if they want the power, they have to pay for it in proportion to the room space.  That is a matter the Minister might investigate.</P>
    <P>We are now expending more capital on the development of the E.S.B. Deputy Dillon has queried whether we have possibly enough power at our disposal for the next 10 years.  I do not know whether or not that is the case. I presume the Minister will tell us what the position is when he comes to reply. I believe that when rural electrification is finally completed there is bound to be redundancy of personnel.  Naturally, a certain number will be necessary to cope with wear and tear, and the repairs that will need to be done. In any money we guarantee, we should ensure that the expenditure of such money will maintain the fullest possible employment.  I should hate to think that we might come to the end of rural electrification and that considerable numbers employed now would find themselves facing the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> Power should be utilised to the fullest possible extent.  As against most other countries, we have practically no central heating at all here.  We live in one of the dampest climates in the world.  Nobody can gainsay that after 1958 and this year so far. The Minister should consider a nationwide scheme of central heating.  There are many public offices which burn imported fuel.  They could be turned over to local power.  Will the Minister tell us if there is sufficient power available now, or if there will be sufficient power after the expenditure of these moneys, to make it possible to introduce electrical central heating in all Government offices, in hotels, and other buildings?  Such a central heating scheme would provide employment and would absorb any potentially redundant power.  I should be grateful if the Minister would deal with my fear of redundancy in employment. I should also like him to deal with the possibility of there being unutilised power available for consumption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to thank Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Dillon, and others, for the helpful and constructive way in which they made their observations on the Second Reading of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked what had been ascertained in the last few years with regard to the cost of atomic energy.  The answer is very simple. All countries have slowed down in their nuclear power programmes because of the very, very high cost per unit.  There will have to be a considerable reduction in cost, and many more things will have to be done, before a country in our position, with the raw material now available for producing power in quantity, could undertake any nuclear power scheme.  A nuclear power station at the moment would be very much more expensive than the small power stations we have for our electric generating system.  Some explorations and investigations have been carried out recently, which may bring down the cost of small power stations.  Until progress is made in that regard there is no intention on the <Col N="344" /> part of the E.S.B. or the Government to instal a nuclear power station here. There is, however, a section of engineers in the E.S.B. who are engaged in constant study of this matter.  I have asked them to report to me the moment they see any change in the general situation which would necessitate Government consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan raised the question of comparative cost and referred to the fact that urban consumers subsidise rural consumers.  Of course, that raises the whole question of rural versus urban in our economic picture.  In practically every country, because of the cost of providing electrical current over a widely scattered area, there is an element of subsidisation inasmuch as rural consumers could not possibly afford to pay the economic cost of the current provided for them.</P>
    <P>We have, too, a peculiar problem here.  It is one with which I am sure urban consumers have sympathy. Perhaps, it is some characteristic of the race, but we have a more widely disseminated rural population than any country in Europe, with the exception of Sweden.  The number who live in clusters of fewer than 200 persons is far greater as compared with the total population here than in any other country in Europe with, as I have said, the exception of Sweden.  As everybody knows, we are not, to use a trite phrase, villaged in the same manner as other communities are villaged.  Because of that the cost of rural electrification casts a heavy burden upon the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ryan should know, the Government have provided a subsidy to help to meet that situation.  I am not sure what the present figure is but, at a recent date, it was calculated that, if rural electrification were to be economic, the rural subscriber would have to pay a permanent annual charge equivalent to some 12 per cent. of the total cost of installation. That does not include generation.  It is simply the installation and distribution factor only.  The Government provides a subsidy which enables the E.S.B. to instal electricity in rural areas so that the annual charge represents <Col N="345" /> a little over four per cent. of the total capital cost of installation. The E.S.B. selects areas where the global return on cost of installation will not represent less than a charge of four per cent., and the Government subsidy helps to make up the difference of eight per cent.  That is a general principle and to depart from it would create a state of chaos.</P>
    <P>It is obviously much more economic to have engineers and workers moving from area to area carrying out collectively a campaign of rural electrification; the E.S.B. and the Government will then be in a position later to decide as to what is to be done about those who are not joined up because, even with the aid of a Government subsidy, they would be an uneconomic proposition in so far as installation is concerned if additional charges were not paid.  In spite of all that, as has been indicated, the E.S.B. is losing on rural electrification.  There is, undoubtedly, an element of subsidisation to the consumer, but that is rather in tune with what goes on in other countries having regard to the general relation of the rural to the urban community, where there are apt to be transfers of payments of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the question of excess capacity in the E.S.B. as a result of having a high proportion of turf stations.  At the moment, because of the increase in consumption, there is no absolute excess capacity in the E.S.B., none whatever.  I particularly asked the Chairman of the Board that question in order that I could come before the House at the time of the Estimate this year.  There had been various suggestions and there was a debate in the House on a former occasion during which accusations were made from one side to the other with regard to this matter.  All this is history. At the moment there is no excess capacity.</P>

      <P>Several of the stations are not working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that if consumption increases at the rate of seven per cent. <Col N="346" /> per annum the E.S.B., cannot always put a station completely into operation in order to achieve a given supply of current.  It must move by stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bound to say I do not understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to explain that with a seven per cent. increase it may not be possible to put an entire station into operation within any given period of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not excess capacity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is excess capacity for a short time.  I am speaking of full-time excess capacity.  Another problem is the peak load that takes place at various times of the year. There can be a tremendous peak load on a winter's evening when it is very cold and the heat is turned on and people start to cook the evening meal. Take, for example, the proportion of very large-scale industries which work in shift and help to level out to some extent these peaks.  The hitherto low level of industrialisation does not help the E.S.B. in the matter of sudden peak loads that occurs at certain times of the day and involves a certain amount of excess capacity which is quite inevitable in the situation.  I want people to understand the position.</P>
      <P>In so far as the policy of the Government is concerned, this House in general is in favour of making use of our turf deposits for the generation of electricity.  Employment is at present given to about 6,500 persons and that will rise to 7,000 persons within the next few years.  Because we have these raw materials at our disposal, because of the employment given and because of the favourable balance of trade which results from our using our own raw materials for producing power we believe that is good policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that Deputy Dillon and Deputy Cosgrave have been slightly confused in regard to the cost of the most modern type of processed turf in relation to the total cost of electricity.  If the Table in <Col N="347" /> the Annual Report of the E.S.B. for the year ending 31st March, 1960, is examined, it will be seen on page 24 that the total cost per unit of electricity, which includes interest and depreciation on capital, in respect of milled peat, is 1.056 pence per unit and in the case of Ringsend Station it is 1.043 pence per unit.  In the case of the Marino Station&mdash;the last two using coal or oil&mdash;the cost per unit is 1.168 pence.  In the case of the North Wall station, using oil, the figure is 1.516 pence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The North Wall station works at about 30 per cent. capacity.  It is a stand-by station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all times of the year.  In 1959, to which this Report refers, in spite of the dry season, there were periods of the year when the power stations were working at full blast.  It has been shown that milled peat is an extremely economic fuel.  We are passing from the time when we could provide only sod-peat.  In five to eight years from now there will be an additional number of milled peat stations in operation.  At the same time, we shall be introducing another cheap fuel, Irish made oil, into the system. The two together, with the water power we are still able to provide, will, I think, produce current at a reasonably economic price.</P>
      <P>When people look back on the history of the E.S.B. generation programme, I do not think it will be said that in the long run we have, in any way, been impeded either in regard to agriculture or industrial production through the use of our native resources for electric current. Stand-by stations are necessary, irrespective of what fuel is used, so as to meet peak demands.  We have to face that situation in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope a greater volume of power <Col N="348" /> will be used for industrial purposes. That has the effect of reducing the unit price and in certain circumstances, if the industries operate by shifts and avoid very high peaks, the use of the station is more economic.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde spoke about the disemployment that may be caused as a result of the ending of the intensified rural electrification programme. The Deputy may be assured that a very large number of the people employed on rural electrification are organised by areas.  When an area is completed they lose their employment. There are other people for whom employment will, we hope, be found in what I believe will happen, namely, the development of a second scheme of rural electrification on a different basis.  There are still others that can be drawn into the service of the E.S.B. through its general expansion.</P>
    <P>Gangs of workers are employed by the E.S.B. in an area on a purely temporary basis.  When the rural electrification scheme has been completed there, they naturally go out of employment.  The engineers go into an adjacent area and recruit a new group of workers.  The situation is not as serious as it might seem on paper.</P>
    <P>Subsidies for central heating are a novel idea.  I do not know if there is any case to justify the development of a form of grant for central heating, as such.  It is impossible for me to say anything at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the original rate for storage heaters were restored I am sure that would be a very substantial contribution.</P>
