      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the number of extra jobs provided in 1959 as a result of the Government's scheme for economic expansion.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Economic Expansion does not purport to be a detailed plan based on predetermined production targets but, rather, an outline of the more important contributions to economic development proposed to be made by the State, the underlying principle being that the private sector will continue to be the principal source of new productive projects.  It is not possible to evaluate the effect of the Programme in the manner suggested in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>I am, however, satisfied that in 1959 there was an appreciable increase in insurable employment.  Insurance stamp purchases in the nine months ended 31st December, 1959, were 670,000 higher than in the corresponding period in 1958.  This is equivalent to an increase of 17,179 in the average number of insured workers per week during the nine months.  Even when allowance is made for the altered position under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1958, the average number of insured workers employed per week has shown a very considerable increase.</P>

      <P>The guaranteed minimum prices for Grade A and Grade B 1 bacon pigs are fixed on a dead-weight basis, the minimum prices being 230s. per cwt. dressed carcase weight for Grade A, and 225s. per cwt. for Grade B 1. Grade A pigs must be within the carcase weight range 127 lb. to 168 lb., inclusive, and Grade B 1 pigs within the range 169 lb. to 175 lb., inclusive, there being prescribed fat measurements also in each case.</P>
      <P>Farmers in County Wexford, as elsewhere, are assured of the foregoing minimum prices for bacon pigs of the required standard.  The prices for pigs below that standard are affected by the lack of demand for bacon from such pigs on the home and export markets.</P>

The Company has the development of the Airport under constant review.  At present the Company has a major project on hands in the provision of a hangar for jet aircraft.  It is expected that the hangar will be completed by December, 1960, by which time Aerlinte will be operating jet aircraft.  Most of the new construction works at Dublin Airport are, however, carried out by my Department. Works at present in hands include the construction of a terminal for the new air-car-ferry service, which will be opened next month.  Other work includes the lengthening of two runways to accommodate the larger aircraft now being used by airlines operating at the Airport.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has decided to open three new routes in the immediate future, namely Shannon-London, Dublin-Cherbourg and Dublin-Leeds-Bradford. In furtherance of their sales development programme, the Company intend to open sales offices at Frankfurt, Zurich and possibly at certain other centres.  A flight despatch office has recently been opened by the Company at Shannon and their existing handling services there will shortly be extended.</P>

So far as we can see at present, the business will consist of the following: First, Supplementary Estimates already circulated and perhaps some more to come; the Broadcasting Authority Bill, all Stages; the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, all Stages; the Oireeachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Bill, all Stages.  We hope to conclude the Committee Stage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill and to complete consideration of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Bill, and also to deal with the remaining Stages of the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Bill and the Hire-Purchase (Amendment) Bill and to take the Second Reading only of the Rent Restrictions Bill.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Bill has been comparatively short. Questions were raised, some of a specific nature and some of a more general nature to which I think I ought to refer in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the specific questions raised came from Deputy Sweetman in which he made a complaint about conditions which certain manufacturers benefiting by the protection impose as far as the distribution of their goods is concerned. There is, as Deputies know, protective duty in force in respect of textile goods but there is also provision whereby a certain amount of these goods is permitted to be imported free of duty under licence.  In many cases there is also attaching to the import free of duty of these goods a condition that the person importing these goods <Col N="915" /> must purchase a certain proportion of similar goods from Irish factories.</P>
    <P>The complaint made by Deputy Sweetman, so far as I could understand it, was that in some cases these factories which benefited from protection insisted that all their output should be purchased by the consuming public, by wholesalers or retailers, through one agent.  I should like to assure him that there is certainly no condition of such a nature attaching to any import licences issued by my Department.  If there is any restriction imposed by any manufacturer in the case of a specific item I should like to hear from him what that case is and if he gives me the necessary particulars I shall have it investigated.  Even though he did not identify any manufacturer or any commodity yesterday, I did, in the time intervening between yesterday and today, try to find out whether there was any specific case in which my Department had a complaint and I could find none.  Therefore, even though Deputy Sweetman is not here, I shall invite him to give me particulars of his complaint and I can assure him I shall have it investigated.</P>
    <P>The other specific matter raised was in connection with the duty imposed last year on medicinal tablets.  The duty in this case, as in most other cases, was imposed for the purpose of protecting a worthwhile Irish industry and, as in all cases, there was no prior consultation with other interests. I think the practice is well established and well understood that in the case of the imposition of a new duty there is no consultation with other interests for obvious reasons, the most obvious being to avoid attempts to stock up in advance of the imposition of the duties.  The complaint was made that there should have been prior consultation with medical opinion or with pharmacist opinion but that was not done in this case either.</P>
    <P>In cases where duties are imposed and advice of a technical or professional nature is necessary for my officials, that advice is usually available from official sources.  In the case of the medicinal tablets the advice sought was from the Department of <Col N="916" /> Health who have qualified medical men and qualified pharmacists on their staff who are able to give whatever advice is necessary.</P>
    <P>The same procedure was adopted in this case as was adopted by the last Government when they imposed a duty on injection solutions.  The same advice was sought and the same action was taken on that occasion.  That was in 1955.  There were fears expressed then from medical and pharmacist sources that there might be some hardship or that there might be some difficulty about people not getting the type of injection solution to which they were used or for which they had a preference.  These fears were expressed by medical authorities and by pharmacists.  In practice, however, the fears proved to be groundless. Ever since that duty was imposed no difficulties have come to the knowledge of my Department.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of the duty imposed on medicinal tablets there were fears expressed originally, largely by distributors of medical preparations. These distributors were, in the main, people who were agents of foreign companies who used export these tablets to this country.  Fears were also expressed by Deputies by way of Questions put on the Order paper and supplementary questions.  On these occasions I was able to assure the Deputies that no hardship was envisaged. In the event, I understand no problem that was not capable of being overcome has arisen.</P>
    <P>One of the objections raised at that time was that the prices of Irish tablets would be higher than those of corresponding imported tablets.  At the time of the imposition of the duty, the firm that made application for the duty gave an undertaking that they would not increase their prices beyond the current levels and they were able to show to the satisfaction of my Department that their prices ex-factory corresponded to the British ex-factory prices.  If there had been increases in the prices of the Irish commodity over and above a reasonable amount beyond factory prices, it is something that is capable of being remedied by the purchaser himself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> I also assured the House that, as regards tablets that were not being manufactured or were not to be manufactured by Irish companies, there would be no difficulty about procuring the necessary licences for the importation of these tablets duty free.  That, in fact, has been the case in general.  No problems have arisen that have not been capable of being surmounted and there have been no protests from medical sources in particular. In recent months there seem to have been no complaints expressed about difficulties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the problem of a person who had a preference for a particular type of tablet even though there might have been no difference&mdash; and certainly that would have been generally known&mdash;between the components of the home-manufactured tablets and the imported tablets. Nevertheless, that person did express a preference for a particular imported tablet and believed that the imported tablet was better for the ailment from which he suffered.  I should like to assure Deputy Dillon that even such cases have been taken into account. There is no import duty whatever on lots of tablets up to 100.  Therefore, if anybody has a preference for one tablet rather than another and finds that tablet is not being manufactured in this country, even though a similar tablet is, that person can go to his usual channel of supply and procure in lots of 100 as often as he likes, the particular tablet for which he has a preference.  I think that answers any fears Deputy Dillon might have in that respect.</P>
    <P>He also raised the question of testing and of standards.  There is a system well-established in the Department of Health whereby the pharmacist staff carry out inspection of premises in which tablets are made in Ireland.  The principal manufacturer here has attained a very high standard.  His factory is regularly inspected and in fact he has invited medical representatives to visit the factory and they have done so from time to time.  In each case, I am given to understand, they were fully satisfied with the standards <Col N="918" /> maintained, with the quality of the products and with the hygiene of the premises.  There are standards formally laid down in the British Pharmacopoeia and in the British Pharmaceutical Codex for medical preparations. These formulae apply here and it is an offence to sell any tablets that are identified in the Pharmacopoeia or in the Codex which do not comply with these formulae; so we can be satisfied that, in general, the question of testing and of standards is well safeguarded in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne raised the question as to whether the drug list issued by the Department of Health of medical preparations for use by authorities under its control or under its aegis will in future contain Irish-made drugs and tablets.  I have not any control over the content of these drug lists but I am informed in general that the imposition of this duty makes no difference to the practice which has obtained hitherto.  In particular, I should like to comment on the point made by Deputy Russell that patients who go to dispensaries which are central dispensaries for the distribution of drugs complain that since the imposition of this duty they have not been able to get the particular tablets which they feel are best for them and which they have been accustomed to take. Again, I am told that no change has been made in the administration of the Health Acts in the dispensing and supply of particular drugs in dispensaries throughout in the country.  I am also assured by the Department of Health that in so far as there is a need for a particular type of tablet which requires to be imported even though it is made here, the local health authority usually makes provision to have it available to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I interrupt the Minister to ask does that mean that these medical preparations on which there is duty will now be available as heretofore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that is the position&mdash;that no change has taken place.  Deputy Ryan painted a rather eloquent picture of the adverse effects <Col N="919" /> of this duty and accused me, if not the House in general, of committing murder. He conveyed that it had been proved to the satisfaction of certain medical practitioners that the same chemical or medical reaction has not been forthcoming from certain preparations in the case of Irish products.  I am not aware that there has been any such case and I am reasonably certain that if there is it would have come to the public notice much sooner than yesterday.  I can only assume that Deputy Ryan was making a debating point rather than stating facts.  I would remind him that when making a contribution in this House he is not doing so in the atmosphere of a University debate and that the content of what he says rather than the manner in which he delivers it is what people here heed. I can only discount what he says in the absence of any proof or any experience of what he states to be the case.</P>
      <P>To leave that for a moment, I want to answer another specific question asked by Deputy Sweetman.  He asked how many persons were employed in the manufacture of the commodities covered in the Orders scheduled in this Bill.  In the time available to me I have made an attempt to assess that number and I have it here as 1,532 persons.  Of the 28 commodities concerned&mdash;these are manufactured in Dublin and throughout the rest of the country&mdash;the number of factories in the country other than in Dublin is 15.  I think that answers Deputy Sweetman's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to the more general points raised in the debate&mdash;it was suggested that this Bill coming now when there is so much talk about free trade areas and the common market is somewhat of an anachronism.  Import duties have been imposed where necessary and are being maintained where necessary for the protection of native industry against competition and in many cases against competition that is deemed to be unfair from abroad.  I should like nobody to get the impression that we are in any way unique in this respect.  Every country in the world has its protective code, has its tariff and quota restrictions.  In fact <Col N="920" /> in some respects, and certainly in the matter of quota restrictions, we are more liberalised here than most European countries.  If we take imports from Britain as an example&mdash; and Britain is our major source of supply&mdash;it may be of interest to mention that only a small proportion, about 10 per cent. of all the goods coming into this country, are subject to the payment of protective duties. There are, of course, revenue duties on other goods but these are in a different category completely to protective duties and are analogous to excise duties and purchase tax which operate in other countries.  As regards quota restrictions 90.2 per cent. of our imports are liberalised so that quotas or other restrictions do not apply to even 10 per cent. of our imports.</P>
    <P>There can be no denying that were it not for our code of protection we would not, and could not have had the degree of industrialisation and industrial employment that we have achieved in the last quarter century. In that period many industries which formerly exported goods into this country&mdash;particularly British goods&mdash; have by reason of that protection policy, established factories here giving useful employment and in many cases they have found that it was good business. They found they can produce here as efficiently, and in some cases more economically, than they are able to produce in their original location.</P>
    <P>It was complained yesterday that the maintenance of protection gives no incentive to efficiency or to the reduction of prices.  This is a very old complaint.  It may have been true in some cases but I think in the light of present developments it is no longer true.  As the home market becomes saturated&mdash;and this point has been reached or is being rapidly reached in most cases&mdash;there is more competition internally.  Therefore, that in itself tends to increase efficiency and reduce prices between one firm and another. Certainly, it tends to induce firms to seek markets abroad for their goods in order to procure the necessary expansion of their industries.  The spectacular increase in our exports of industrial goods in the past twelve <Col N="921" /> months, amounting to 40%, is, I think, an illustration of the truth of the assertion I make.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that even in the cases of industries which enjoy protection and which have virtually a monopoly of the home market, very often these are our most successful exporters.  They are amongst the industries that can compete most successfully in foreign countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the need of the tariff then if they are so competitive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. Deputy Russell complained that the percentage of some of our tariffs was unduly high.  I know he did not intend to create the impression, but the impression might be created that the prices of goods on the home market are dearer than the prices of imported goods by as much as the tariff itself. That is not true in any case.  In many cases goods are available to the Irish public at prices which are equal to or only marginally higher than the prices of foreign goods on their home markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I questioned two of the tariffs on the list which both provided for a tariff of 75% and I asked could the Minister reconcile such high tariffs with efficient manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be able to answer that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I commented on the actual prices at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases&mdash;in the two cases the Deputy mentioned, for instance &mdash; there are fairly high <i>ad valorem</i> duties and in other cases&mdash;I forget if they are on the list of duties involved in this Bill&mdash;there are relatively high minimum specific duties as well.  But the necessity for that is to create protection for goods that are manufactured here on a comparatively small scale and in respect of which an unduly high degree of imports would have very adverse effects on home production. <Col N="922" /> For example, in the case of textile goods &mdash; I am not suggesting there is any specific duty; there may be in some cases&mdash;one end-of-the-season clearance sale or the proceeds of one bankruptcy sale of a big foreign firm which would come in here even on payment of the duty could be put on sale at prices much lower than that at which the Irish mills could produce economically and, therefore, could come to the extent of flooding the market with what would amount to practically a year's output of the Irish mills.  In such cases the consequences of unemployment would be very serious.  Therefore, it is only reasonable to ensure that certain types of goods, by reason of being protected by a high <i>ad valorem</i> duty or a minimum specific duty, would be able to compete with such odd lots that might be put on sale in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>A quota system would help in the operation of it certainly. Deputy Sweetman suggested that irrespective of any international commitments there should be a gradual reduction of tariffs in any case.  The policy of the Government in this respect has been clearly stated in the White Paper on Economic Development.</P>
      <P>A quotation of the relevant extract on that will illustrate what I mean:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that there can be no place for weak or inefficient industries. Even where only the home market is involved, it must be accepted that such industries place a burden on the economy generally and render other industries less able to meet foreign competition.  Hence, it must now be recognised that protection can no longer be relied upon as an automatic weapon of defence and it will be the policy in future in <Col N="923" /> the case of new industries to confine the grant of tariff protection to cases in which it is clear that the industry will, after a short initial period, be able to survive without protection.</P>
    <P>The gradual reduction of tariffs as advocated by the Deputy is an exercise that, in the context of a suitable free trade agreement, we would be quite willing to undertake.  We have not found such a free trade area so far. It has been suggested that, in introducing this Bill, I might have indicated to the House what the industrial policy should be in the light of movements towards free trade in Europe. I would have thought that our position has already been made abundantly clear in this respect.  It is well understood, I think, that there are, in the context of the Common Market Agreement and the Rome Treaty, no attractions for us in joining this group and in being subject to the full implications of the obligations that joining would impose upon us.  Neither is there a sufficient degree of attraction for us in the Outer Seven.</P>
    <P>I think it is generally appreciated now that the countries associated with Britain in the Outer Seven are seeking, by reason of their association with Britain, to get facilities for imports into Britain of goods on the basis that we already enjoy, and they will procure that only after a period of years and a gradual reduction of tariffs as between themselves.  At present, therefore, there is no inducement or advantage beyond what we already have in joining the Outer Seven.</P>
    <P>In the context of the complaint made originally that this policy of protection is not conducive to promoting efficiency or reducing costs, I might mention that even in the Common Market, which is an association of some of the most industrialised countries in Europe, they are seeking to establish for themselves what is known as a common external tariff so that the industries within the group will be protected against foreign competition.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this point I would also like to refer to the fact that we are <Col N="924" /> still members of O.E.E.C. and, while under the aegis of O.E.E.C. there were negotiations for the establishment of the wider Free Trade Area, we were a party to these negotiations and our special position, as examined by working party No. 23, was recognised in that whatever agreement might ultimately be made we would be entitled to a longer period over which we would be required to reduce our tariffs than the more industrially advanced countries.  We, as I said, are still members of O.E.E.C. and we are a party to the new development that this organisation has under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Twenty Nations Trade Committee will have its first meeting on the 29th of this month.  That is the committee that will examine the immediate trade problems in Europe, possibly the differences, that divide the Six and the Seven, and the trade relations that will be observed at least for some period to come amongst these 20 countries.  We shall be represented at that meeting and our views have been put forward to the four wise men who are undertaking a review of the construction and the future of O.E.E.C. itself as an organisation. So, to sum up, the introduction of this Bill is by no means an anachronism.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of duties in the light of present day developments is not conducive to inefficiency.  Rather, as a result of the imposition of duties which has been followed by the establishment of industries in this country to a point that manufacture for the home market has reached, or is reaching saturation point for many commodities, there is that degree of competition internally which makes for greater productivity and reduced prices.  Also by reason of the necessity to seek expansion in export markets there is the further incentive to make industries more competitive, and in the recent past we have ample evidence that they are being more competitive in the realms of world competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister one question before he concludes?  He made reference to the fact that there is in operation in the Department an arrangement by which, when a person <Col N="925" /> is not able to get all his textile requirements from home sources, he can be required to purchase a certain quantity of his requirements from home sources and, on the understanding that he does so, he may then obtain a licence to import the remainder of his requirements free of duty.  That has been the practice in the Department and I presume it is extant today.  I should like the Minister to confirm that there is no obligation on the person who gets a licence to import textile commodities to purchase those commodities from a firm dictated to him by the person who supplies the goods from Irish sources.  In other words, once he buys a certain quantity of goods on the home market he is entitled to buy his imported commodities anywhere he likes, and from any trader he likes, and the supplier of the Irish goods cannot require him to buy goods from any particular supplier of the imported commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I raised in a slightly different way. If in fact there is only one manufacturer of a particular commodity, the person concerned is bound to buy the product of that particular factory.  I never suggested that there was any condition included in the Minister's licence.  That is not what I said. What I said was that the person concerned is bound to buy so many yards of that particular commodity in the home market, that that particular commodity is manufactured only by one factory, and that that one factory will not sell to anyone except through one named agent and, accordingly, the person who wants to import has to purchase through that one named agent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister there is an obligation on him that where he is making a provision in the licence that a particular amount of one commodity is to be purchased before an import licence can be obtained, if there is only one factory producing it he must say that it must be purchased through at least such a number of agents as the purchaser may select, and the factory is not entitled to name one person through whom the order must be channelled, <Col N="926" /> as is being done in this case.  I did not suggest, and do not suggest, that the Minister is making it a condition in the licence.  It is the factory that is doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>I do not know of any case in which that is being done and when the Deputy was absent from the House I invited him to give particulars of any case he knew of and I shall have it investigated.  In reply to Deputy Norton, the position has not changed.  There is no compulsion on anybody to buy the content of his import licence from any particular source.  All the Department does, if a person satisfies it that he has bought a certain quantity of the goods from the home source, is give him a licence to import a certain other quantity of these goods and he can get them wherever he likes.</P>

    <P>The House will note that the amount sought by way of Supplementary Estimate is a token amount.  The purpose of this token is to give the House an opportunity of considering proposals in relation to the future accommodation to be provided for University College, Dublin.  I shall begin by outlining as briefly as possible the events which led up to the present position.</P>
    <P>The Catholic University of Ireland had been founded in 1854 by the Hierarchy, but as no part of it, except its Medical School in Cecilia Street, was officially recognised, it languished, especially after the departure, in 1858, of its illustrious first Rector, John Henry (afterwards Cardinal) Newman.</P>
    <P>When, in 1908, the National University was established in response to some seventy years of agitation on the part of the Catholic hierarchy and the Catholic population generally for a State-recognised University at which attendance would be compatible with their religious principles, the new University found the Cork and Galway College buildings already available, as for half a century they had been in existence as &ldquo;Queen's Colleges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Catholic University of Ireland, surviving as a non-recognised teaching institution under the title of University College, Dublin, was still installed in the two houses now known as Newman House, but with its Medical School in Cecilia Street so flourishing that the students at that School outnumbered all the rest combined.</P>
    <P>When the 1908 Act incorporated University College, Dublin and the Queen's Colleges of Cork and Galway in the newly-established National University, the Dublin College began its new phase of existence in 1909 with Newman House, Cecilia Street Medical School and the Examination rooms of the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; University <Col N="928" /> styled the Royal University, the last a purely examining body which had been set up by the Government in 1879.</P>
    <P>In 1909-10, the University College. Dublin, student total was 530.  At that time, it was thought that the maximum number of students would never exceed 1,000 and plans were completed in 1912 for a building in Earlsfort Terrace for that number.  The first war, however, intervened, and only in 1919 were the present facade and the Science side of the quadrangle completed, that is, less than half the building contemplated.  In 1926, the Albert College and part of the College of Science were made over by the Government to University College, and in 1931 the old Medical School at Cecilia Street was transferred to a temporary building at Earlsfort Terrace. Since then until the present academic year, when it became necessary to make some internal adaptations in order to avoid a breakdown, no further building construction was carried out at Earlsfort Terrace.</P>
    <P>During the 30-year period 1909 to 1939 the number of students in each of the three Colleges was increasing slowly but fairly steadily.  The Dublin College had in 1938-39 reached the figure of 2,230, the Cork College 928 and the Galway College 669.</P>
    <P>The numbers in the three Colleges in the current year are Dublin, 4,472; Cork, 1,448; and Galway, 926, and these increases during the last 20 years are the cause of the present difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is not, however, to be taken from the juxtaposition of the figures for 1938-39 and those of the current year that the rate of growth during the last twenty years has been steady and uniform in all three Colleges.  In University College, Galway, the figure for 1953-54 was 936 and since then has remained more or less static.  The University College, Cork, figure for 1953-54 was 1,143 and is now 1,448, thus showing a tendency to move upwards.  The figure for University College, Dublin, however, keeps climbing steadily and rapidly.  In 1953-54 it was 3,528, in 1954-55 it moved to 3,703, in 1955-56 to 3,855, in 1956-57 to 4,072, in 1957-58 to 4,401, in 1958-59 <Col N="929" /> to 4,480 and in the current year to 4,772.</P>
    <P>A clearer focus on trends is perhaps given by recent figures for whole-time students in each College, which are as follows:</P>

    <P>The result of all this has been a continually increasing pressure on accommodation in each of the three Colleges up to the middle fifties, with a certain stay of demand since then in the Cork and Galway Colleges, but with the grip ever tightening on University College, Dublin and every prospect of its tightening further.</P>
    <P>In face of this situation, several queries at once present themselves. The most obvious of these is whether we are turning out too many graduates. That does not admit of a simple answer, for we could, for example, be turning out too many Arts graduates while not turning out enough Science graduates.  Leaving aside for one moment the relative output in the several Faculties, we find that our total number of University students from Ireland, which is about 8,000, is roughly in almost the same proportion to the total population of the State as is the case in England and Wales, Scotland, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries, with all those other countries having had the same problem of increasing numbers, but straining every nerve to increase University attendance still further.  Britain, for example, has about 120,000 University students at the moment, but hopes to have 170,000 by 1965.  Australian Universities expect an increase of over 100% during the next ten years on the 36,000 students they already have.</P>
    <P>The increase in University student numbers is therefore not confined to this country, but is a worldwide phenomenon.  A characteristic of it everywhere is that it is only in the last ten years that the quietly expanding pre-war flow of students into universities has suddenly become a <Col N="930" /> torrent.  Everyone will recall that the twenties and thirties were a period when even the highest qualified graduates had difficulty in securing employment and even after the war, in 1948, grave fears were authoritatively expressed in Britain that that country would soon find itself with more physicists than it could employ. Now, 12 years later, no scientist or engineer need find himself unemployed for one day there.</P>
    <P>In respect of this demand, especially for scientists and engineers, but also for all kinds of graduates, which has suddenly made itself felt throughout the world, our own country is still in comparatively quiet waters on the edge of the torrent.  For that reason, perhaps, some of us who have left our student days behind may perceive only dimly that what has been happening is that to the unexpected demand for graduates, arising directly, but with a kind of delayed action, from the war, but having its roots in a complex of historical, social, economic and other causes, the response of youth everywhere has been instantaneous.</P>
    <P>As the demand was unforeseen, so was this response unforeseen.  To put the thing in a nutshell, the universities of the world, many of which had spent centuries in a semi-slumber, have, in a few short years, and, one may suspect, to their own surprise, been thrust, willy-nilly, into the forefront of national, and indeed international, endeavour, and have thereby attained an importance which has not been theirs since the end of the Middle Ages.</P>
    <P>Although our overall proportion of University students would appear to be fairly normal or at least only slightly under normal, a second query might be whether the relative proportions of students in the various Faculties are of the right order or whether we are turning out too many B.A.'s or B.Comms. or scientists or doctors or agriculturalists or veterinary surgeons or engineers or architects or whatever it may be.  The answer to that is that while at the moment the National University output of Bachelors <Col N="931" /> of Arts, Bachelors of Commerce, Bachelors of Science, Bachelors of Agricultural Science, and Bachelors of Dairy Science is sufficient to meet the demand, there is no significant surplus of these graduates and comparatively little emigration from among them.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps not generally realised that our secondary schools, for instance, employ almost 3,500 graduates, mostly of the Faculty of Arts, and that the normal loss by retirements and the increasing numbers of secondary pupils call for more and more of these graduates.  If I may digress here for a moment, I should also like to inform the House that, despite criticisms one hears from time to time of the situation in our secondary schools, 89 per cent. of our recognised secondary teachers are University graduates, a percentage that, as far as my Department is aware, is by far the highest in the world.  I mention this in no spirit of complacency, but as a simple fact to show that the position in our educational system is not so black as it is sometimes painted.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of the output of graduates, the great majority of the fifty or so electrical engineers from the two electrical engineering schools, the larger one in University College, Dublin, and the smaller one in University College, Cork, find employment at home.  I understand that of the some 40 electrical engineers who graduated last June from University College, Dublin, 30 found immediate employment in the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>Although our electrical engineers are in very keen demand abroad, the great majority of them are absorbed by the E.S.B., the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Bord na Móna, the Office of Public Works and other public and private concerns.  It is true that some of the best graduates in electrical engineering do elect to go overseas for experience and further training, but many of these return later with the fruits of that experience.</P>
    <P>All this applies also to the 40 or so mechanical engineers who are turned <Col N="932" /> out annually from University College, Dublin, which with the exception of a small section of such work in Bolton Street College of Technology, is the only mechanical engineering school in the State.  Chemical engineers also are produced by University College, Dublin only, but the output is only about six per annum, as the demand for them here is still slight.</P>
    <P>Our main graduate export appears to be doctors from the five medical schools and civil engineers from the four civil engineering schools.  The National University produces annually about 170 doctors and Trinity College about 60.  It may be surmised that 100 of this total emigrate.  Of the civil engineers, about 40 from University College, Dublin, about 15 from the Cork College, about 25 from Galway and about 30 from Trinity College, it may be surmised that over 50, or about half the total, emigrate.  We could probably therefore do better and less expensively with a lesser number of medical and civil engineering schools, but the question would be which College or Colleges would be prepared to give up its school.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is the penalty of our graduates' unrestricted access to Britain and virtually unrestricted access to the United States and Canada and to the high remuneration there that if we are to have a sufficiency of doctors and engineers for ourselves, we must produce more doctors and engineers than we can absorb.  There are also some 60 dentists who graduate annually from the three dental schools in Dublin and the dental school in Cork.  Perhaps half of these emigrate.</P>
    <P>There is also a certain amount of emigration among architects, of whom 25 or so are produced annually, about 20 of these from University College, Dublin, and about five from Bolton Street College of Technology.  We may well be overproducing architects and I shall return to this problem.</P>
    <P>Of the well over 100 science graduates produced annually, it is not precisely known how many emigrate, but we do know that we could use many more of these in the secondary-schools than care to seek employment <Col N="933" /> there.  Of our over 500 science teachers in, these schools, only about 50 per cent. are University graduates in Science.  Let me assure you, however, that that 50 per cent. is a relatively high figure by comparison with most countries.  Science graduates everywhere are not inclined to teach in view of the glittering prospects for them in industry.</P>
    <P>Of the 40 or so veterinary graduates produced annually by University College, Dublin, I need not speak, for that they are badly needed is fairly obvious.</P>
    <P>The over 100 commerce graduates from the National University Colleges find employment in business, or in the vocational schools, where of the total 360 or so graduates almost two-thirds are Bachelors of Commerce.</P>
    <P>Of the annual 60 or so agricultural graduates produced from the Albert College, the great majority have so far found employment with the Department of Agriculture, with county committees of agriculture and in the vocational schools.  In fact, at one stage, for lack of graduates in Agriculture, my Department had to institute special courses of training in order to have a sufficiency of rural science teachers.  As far as I know, neither is there any great emigration among the Dairy Science graduates, who are produced by University College, Cork only.</P>
    <P>It is worthy of note that the pattern of the number of students in the various Faculties varies little throughout the three Colleges of the National University.</P>
    <P>By and large, it would appear that the three Colleges are not producing more graduates than we need, except in the case of doctors and perhaps civil engineers, and in a few minor Faculties.  There is certainly no great surplus in the Arts Faculties and fortunately no great emigration so far in these.  The emigration that does occur among graduates is of course part of the pattern of emigration at all levels. The general situation as to graduate emigration has, I think, been well put by one of the members of the Commission <Col N="934" /> on Building Accommodation Needs where he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission has considered this aspect of University education and decided that if, as we all hope, some day in some way the economy of the country can be placed on a healthy progressive basis, we will need at least as many technical graduates as we are now training, and not to have them when they are wanted would be a greater loss than training them now for export.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the production of even a surplus of technical graduates &mdash;and, I would add, especially of Science graduates&mdash;is a calculated risk we must take if we believe that the country has a future.  I would add also that not only if we are to progress industrially and economically, but also, if a world crisis comes upon us, we shall have to look to our own graduates, for we have no right to expect, nor are we likely to receive, expert assistance from any except those whose roots are in this country.</P>
    <P>On the supposition, however, that there are too many University students, particularly at University College, Dublin, the suggestion has been made that the College authorities should take measures to restrict entry. In the light of the circumstances I have indicated, restriction of entry in the present age is a very debatable point, the more especially since the annual increase in University College, Dublin for some years has included a marked increase in entrants to the Faculty of Science.</P>
    <P>In fact, however, the Colleges have taken such steps, in so far as lay in their power to do so.  All three National University Colleges have for a number of years limited entry to their engineering schools to students who had obtained honours in Leaving Certificate mathematics or who had qualified in an equivalent special examination held by the Colleges. Some years ago all the Colleges limited likewise the number to the medical faculty.  Similarly, the shortage of accommodation has imposed severe restrictions on the intake of the Dublin and Cork dental hospitals.  In addition.  University College, Dublin <Col N="935" /> and University College, Cork have rigorously limited the number of Students they will accept from outside Ireland.  At the moment, there are in University College, Dublin only 325 from outside Ireland, out of a total of 4,772 students.</P>
    <P>Beyond that no College could go, as any raising of the standard of entry is a matter for the National University, not for any individual College.  Since any raising of the standard of entry must apply equally to all three Colleges, its effect could be, not to alter to any significant degree the flow of numbers into University College, Dublin, but to divert from the National University generally the students concerned and also perhaps incidentally to have a serious impact on the finances of the Cork and Galway Colleges.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to speak at such length before coming to the kernel of the matter with which the Supplementary Estimate is concerned but discussion of University education is infrequent and, when attempted, is often necessarily conducted without any comprehensive knowledge of the relevant facts.  Accordingly, it seems to me that this is a suitable occasion on which to let the House and the country have some kind of general idea of the position.</P>
    <P>I shall therefore give one more set of important facts in connection with the accommodation problem in University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>A view that is sometimes put forward is that the pressure on that College could be eased if some means were found of directing away from it to the local Colleges the flow of students from outside the Dublin area, if, for example, the students from the Munster and Connacht counties were not allowed to come to Dublin, and had to go to the Colleges situated in their own provinces.  This suggestion takes no account of parents' rights, but even if such a solution were in some way possible, it would have no significance in relation to the continually increasing pressure on the accommodation in University College, Dublin, for the number of students attending that College from without a radius <Col N="936" /> of 30 miles from Dublin has during the last ten years been decreasing.  During that ten years the number of students there from anywhere outside a 30 mile radius from Dublin declined from 1,902 in 1949-50 to 1,727 in 1955-56.</P>
    <P>It arose to 1,920 in 1957-58, but fell again in 1958-59 to 1,839, a lower figure than that for 1949-50.  A graph would show the total number of students moving sharply upwards in the last ten years, with the line for the Dublin hinterland moving parallel to that, but the line for the students from outside the Dublin area horizontal for most of the period and dipping towards the end of it.</P>
    <P>From these figures it is clear that the sole source of the increasing pressure on University College, Dublin, is that College's own hinterland, that is, Dublin city and the area within 30 miles thereof.  The whole thing is therefore fundamentally a question of distribution, not of student population, but of the population generally.  This will be more readily appreciated when it is considered that the Dublin hinterland is in the heart of the province of Leinster, which, together with the three counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal, contains more than half the population of the State.  As the last census showed a steady drift of population towards Leinster, it appears to be unlikely that the number of students seeking admission to University College, Dublin has yet reached its maximum.</P>
    <P>The above, I think, establishes clearly that there is very urgent need of additional accommodation in a College which started out fifty years ago with 530 students and has now almost exactly nine times that number, with an additional almost 300 students every year to which it cannot, and at this stage of the country's development, should not refuse admission.</P>
    <P>At this point it is perhaps fair to ask why was the problem of increasing numbers not faced until a short time ago.  I believe I have already answered that.  Neither the College authorities nor successive Governments can fairly be blamed for not <Col N="937" /> foreseeing what almost no one throughout the world foresaw&mdash;a sudden and rapidly increasing need for, and therefore pressure on, University education.  For example, it was only three years ago that the Australian Government decided to set up a Commission on its University problem, at almost exactly the same time as our Commission on Accommodation Needs.</P>
    <P>In point of fact, at quite an early stage the University College, Dublin authorities had an inkling of the shape of things to come, for they made a number of efforts in the late forties to acquire property in the vicinity but unfortunately they were then working on an overdraft and so were unable on those occasions to exceed the bids of rival purchasers.</P>
    <P>When all the property available at the time in the contiguous area had passed under the hammer and when the open ground further out on the south side of the city was gradually being taken up, the College took steps to extend its sports grounds at Belfield and approached the Government for the necessary capital therefor.  This the Government provided, but on the clear understanding that it was not thereby to be taken as agreeing in principle to the transfer of the College to those grounds.</P>
    <P>In 1951 the College Governing Body, despite their anxiety to remain on the present site, became finally convinced that the number of students would shortly be so large as to preclude the possibility of their being catered for in the Earlsfort Terrace area and in November of that year passed a unanimous resolution that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Governing Body is of opinion that the best interests of University College, Dublin require that new University College buildings be erected on the lands owned by the College at Stillorgan.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Following examination by successive Governments of this proposal, a Commission was set up by the Government in 1957 to inquire into the accommodation needs of the Constituent Colleges of the National University.  That Commission, with a Judge of the <Col N="938" /> Supreme Court as Chairman and the other members selected from business and administrative circles outside the Universities, in its Report of May last found unanimously that all three Colleges require a great deal of further accommodation and, with a reservation of a special kind by one of its members, that there was no reasonable alternative to the transfer of University College, Dublin to the Belfield site.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the members of the Commission at the commencement of their investigations to the question of the Belfield site can best be told in the Commission's own words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We began our work by seeking for a solution of the College's accommodation problem in the vicinity of the main College building at Earlsfort Terrace.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every circumstance indicated to us that that was the proper course &mdash;the necessity for maintaining the physical unity of the College, the College's place in the city and its proximity to libraries and the galleries, the avoidance of disturbance to the life of the College which would occur if the College were to be moved, and considerations of economy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is thus seen that the Commission was very much alive to the great desirability of the College remaining, if at all possible, on its present site. After one and a half years' labours, however, during which it held thirty-three meetings, visited twenty different institutions, both at home, in Britain and on the Continent, and received evidence from numerous home and foreign experts and interested parties, it found itself forced to the conclusion again in its own words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the English and Danish Universities we visited, we found that the authorities were dealing with problems similar to the problem of University College, Dublin. We met administrators and, in some cases, architects and building officers. We discussed the solution of the Dublin problem with them. Everything we heard of the experiences of these other universities has <Col N="939" /> indicated to us that the right solution of the Dublin problem&mdash;and the only final solution for it&mdash;is to transfer the College, the entire College, to a new site of adequate size.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The advice we received in these universities unanimously supports that view.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the question of the College remaining on its present site by means of compulsory acquisition of the surrounding properties and the Commission's study of this aspect of the matter I shall speak presently, but before doing so there is one other alternative, raised in a reservation, as I have mentioned, by one member of the Commission, of which it is my duty to treat.</P>
    <P>That fundamental point, as the member concerned expressed it, which has also been mooted from time to time by other persons and parties interested in the University problem, is the possibility of some kind of integration or amalgamation of University College, Dublin and Trinity College or of their courses.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is not a new one.  It has been put forward in different forms on many occasions during the last century.  My own view of it is this.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the severest test of the character of the Irish nation was when for many generations the great majority of the people, although, as they showed in their own way, thirsting for education, chose illiteracy and ignorance for their children in preference to the only State-provided system of primary, secondary and university education then existent in the world, which was on offer to them at the cost of an abjuration of conscience.  No nation exists in a contemporary vacuum.  We are all in part what our forefathers made us, and that ordeal of the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries has a bearing on the present day.  It is, I believe, a result of that terrible choice that was imposed upon the forebears of the majority of us, that present generations of Irishmen are possessed of a peculiarly delicate and scrupulous sensitivity in relation to the right of <Col N="940" /> parents, whether they be of the majority or minority religion, to have their children provided with a schooling that will be compatible with their religious principles.</P>
    <P>While of course it would not be practicable for one single child or three or four children of whatever the minority religion might be in a particular locality to be provided with the type of school that would be in accord with the parents' choice in conscience, my Department, in accordance with the policy of successive Governments, has, as is frequently admitted on all sides, set a very high standard in its provision for special facilities enabling parents of the minority religion to send their children to the type of State-provided school they choose.  I hope that that standard will always be maintained.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the principle which I have mentioned I could not be a party to the creation of a position in which parents of any religious denomination, either that of the majority or minority, who seek University education for their children, should find themselves with no alternative to the placing of their children, in violation of conscience, in a particular educational institution.  That principle is enshrined in Article 42 of the Constitution, which lays down:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To me that means that it shall not thus oblige them either directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>It is not my function to be the keeper of any other man's conscience, but it is my duty, as Minister for Education, to respect with the most scrupulous care the consciences of our citizens, both of those of the majority and minority religions.  To the letter and the spirit, therefore, of the principle of the non-forcing of conscience, laid down in the Constitution, must be subject any question of a re-apportionment or redistribution or amalgamation or <Col N="941" /> rationalisation, or whatever it may be called, of faculties or courses throughout the four University Colleges that may at any time arise.</P>
    <P>Having said that, let me say also that I believe that there is a place and a due place among us for all four Colleges.  Each of them I believe, has its own appropriate part to play and its own contribution to make to the building of the nation.</P>
    <P>I come now to the vexed question of compulsory acquisition of buildings and lands in the neighbourhood, of Earlsfort Terrace.  To this problem the Commission devoted an enormous amount of thought and labour, and I take this opportunity of thanking sincerely its Chairman and members for their work generally.  As I have said, they started off with the conviction that the College should, almost at all costs, remain on its present site. Details of the Commission's study of the problem of the space potentially available and of their study of similar problems pertaining to other Universities are to be found in their Report where it is shown how, step by step, they were reluctantly forced to the conclusion that even in the direction of the canal the blocks of property concerned could not be acquired within a reasonable period except by the exercise, in large measure, of compulsory powers.  &ldquo;We would,&rdquo; they state, &ldquo;hesitate to recommend the granting of compulsory powers. The disturbance to homes and to business would be too great.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Commission considered also the possibility of compulsorily acquiring the south side of St. Stephen's Green and the east side of Harcourt Street as far as Hatch Street and also an extension of the College into the block bordered by Lower Leeson Street, Adelaide Road, and Earlsfort Terrace and reached the same conclusion.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that without compulsory acquisition single buildings in the vicinity could be acquired from time to time as they fall vacant, in the same way as single buildings or sites are occasionally purchased by industrial or business concerns.  This suggestion, however, ignores the fact <Col N="942" /> that there is a distinction between buying a single building or site for a particular purpose, with no intention of going beyond that, and the planning of a University College which must comprise many buildings.  A University College, with its complex inter-arrangements for the united teaching of subjects to students in various Faculties, cannot be planned haphazardly in bits and pieces as they come into the market, and in addition, there is no guarantee that any particular building or site will be up for sale within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>Actually, the total potential area that could thus be acquired, even by compulsory means, would not exceed about fifty acres.  If we compare this with the plan for, say, Manchester University, with its 4,500 students as against University College, Dublin's 4,770, with numbers growing in both institutions, we find that it is proposed to provide for Manchester University a site of 100 acres.  Liverpool University, with 4,000 students, has had reserved for it a development area of 60 acres.  It is true that both these Universities are to remain within their cities, but for the reason that alternative sites could not be found within less than fifteen and seven miles respectively from the city centres concerned.</P>
    <P>The University of Birmingham, which plans for 5,000 students, has at present a site in the city centre and a site about three miles therefrom.  It is at the moment actively planning to move the entire University to the suburban site of 400 acres.  Nottingham University, which looks forward to having 4,000 students, is situated on the outskirts of the city, and has had its site there enlarged to 300 acres.  The Technical University in Copenhagen, with 2,300 students, is, the Commission reports, planning to move from its present substantial buildings erected between 1932 and 1954 on a confined city site to a suburban site of 180 acres.  Queen's University, Belfast, with 2,700 students, has sites totalling 87 acres.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion that has been made is that the additional accommodation required might be found by the <Col N="943" /> erection of high buildings on the Iveagh Gardens site.  The Commission did not overlook this possibility, but the expert advice they received was to the effect that the Iveagh Gardens would be wholly inadequate for the gross floor area of 600,000 square feet, that is, roughly 13 acres, that is considered by the Commission to be the College's additional requirement, as against the Iveagh Gardens area of only 8.5 acres; (2) that high buildings obviously require a considerable area of open space around if they are to cater for large numbers of students; (3) that high buildings as well as being in this case out of character with existing buildings and the surrounding neighbourhood, are generally considered not suitable for the ordinary purposes of a University; (4) that between four and eleven stories the price of building tends to be uneconomic; and (5) that the cost of multifloor school buildings can be nearly twice that of buildings of the same capacity but of more orthodox height.</P>
    <P>The Commission's final conclusion, after thorough investigation of all these matters, was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The difficulty in the case of University College, Dublin has been to find for the College's accommodation problem a solution which will maintain the general physical unity of the College.  We think that it is essential to maintain that unity. Without this unity and the opportunity of mingling together which it affords to students and professors of the different faculties, the College would lose what is one of the most valuable attributes of a University. It would in our opinion be no solution of the problem to build the College's additional accommodation requirements (450,000 square feet net)&mdash;(which is the equivalent of 600,000 square feet gross)&mdash;on the Stillorgan Road site and to leave the rest of the College at Earlsfort Terrace and Upper Merrion Street. This would divide the College, make it less than a university, and seriously affect the quality of the students.</P>
    <P>Since there is not enough ground <Col N="944" /> in the vicinity of Earlsfort Terrace for the additional buildings which the College needs for its requirements now and in the future, it seems to us that there is no other solution for the problem but to build a new College, and to build it as close to the centre of the city as a site can be got which will be big enough to prevent the recurrence of this problem in 25 to 50 years.</P>
    <P>The 250 acre site which the authorities have already acquired at Stillorgan Road is such a site, and we have little doubt that it would not now be possible to find a site as suitable.  The greatest commendation of the Stillorgan site is that it offers a final solution for the College's accommodation problem. The site is big enough to provide for every likely extension and development.  It affords an opportunity of re-uniting with the general student body agricultural students of the 3rd, 4th and postgraduate years.  There is room for the erection of halls of residences or hostels, and some residential accommodation is generally considered a desirable feature of university life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should perhaps add here that it has not been suggested, nor is it the intention of the Government, that halls of residence or hostels should be supplied by State aid.</P>
    <P>The Government have studied the Report and the entire problem with great care and the conclusion they have reached is that, apart from the question of comparative cost, with which I shall deal in a moment, they could not agree to compulsory acquisition of the area concerned, for homes, habitations, hotels, hospitals, shops, commercial and industrial establishments and other educational institutions have their rights as well as universities, that in any case compulsory acquisition is no simple process, since in justice it must entail a tribunal of appeal, and therefore that it could not be implemented in any short period of time.</P>
    <P>It would seem also that, taking everything into consideration, and in particular the unpredictable nature of the demands that may be made in the <Col N="945" /> future by the necessity of further provision for the teaching of various branches of science, perhaps some as yet undiscovered, we must look at the problem with some vision.</P>
    <P>There is one further very important point, the cost.  It may be objected that the disturbance arising from compulsory acquisition would count for less than the cost of the transfer, but in fact it is very doubtful if this would be so.  The cost of an outline scheme of compulsory acquisition of even part of the minimum area required for building might go something as follows:</P>

    <P>This estimate of nearly £8,000,000, which has been kept low in respect of the items that must remain a matter of conjecture, compares with an estimate of nearly £7,000,000 for the Belfield project.  It would be impossible to say at this stage that the relative costs would work out precisely as here suggested, but it seems reasonable to conclude, at the very least, that the capital cost of a city development would be not less than that of the proposed suburban development and that, after all has been done and said, a city development would not give a final solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>On the estimate of nearly £7,000,000 on the Belfield project, I should perhaps add that it is not, as would appear to be supposed by some, the intention of the Government to write out a cheque for £7,000,000 the morning after the Dáil should have agreed in principle to the proposal. There would be the question of site development, the question of architectural competitions for perhaps the lay-out generally and for the various blocks of buildings.  I am authoritatively advised also that even if the work were in full swing, it is extremely doubtful if it would be physically possible to spend £500,000 <Col N="946" /> a year in Dublin on any single building project.  There must also be taken into account the no small matter of the requirements of the other Colleges which the Commission has reported are also pressing.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I cannot see how, despite the strong recommendation of the Commission, it would be physically possible to transfer the College entirely within, at the very least, twenty years.  I should perhaps mention incidentally in this regard that I am informed that the expenditure concerned would have a fifty per cent. employment content for the building and ancillary trades of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The intention of the Government if the Dáil passes the present Supplementary Estimate and thereby agrees in principle to the transfer to Belfield, is to relieve immediate pressure on University College by providing on the Belfield site, in such a way as to interfere as little as may be with potential alterations in the general lay-out, a building that will house the senior sections of the physics and chemistry departments.  That is absolutely essential, for if such a building is not provided immediately, in the autumn of 1961 up to twenty honours graduates in science of that year will be unable, simply for lack of accommodation, to proceed with a postgraduate course, and that position will worsen in each succeeding year.</P>
    <P>This eventuality would be a most serious matter in this technological age, and would be particularly undesirable in this country, for if there is a weakness in the structure of the work of our universities, it is that, by comparative standards, our number of higher degrees is low.  Its greatest danger, however, would be to discourage brilliant students from entering the science faculty and so to discourage the teaching of science in the secondary schools.  How this situation in postgraduate science has come about may be seen if we examine the number of entrants to the Faculty of Science in the College during the last six years.  For many years the number of entrants remained static at <Col N="947" /> about 80; in 1955-56 it jumped to 100, in 1956-57 to 124, in 1957-58 to 151, in 1958-59 to 194.</P>
    <P>By what must in the circumstances be regarded as a fortunate happening, the number fell in the current year to 175, by reason of more entrants than usual electing for other faculties.  If the rise had continued this year it is probable that it would not have been possible to cope with it.  These increases were due to many causes which could not have been foreseen. A principal reason, however, was the increasing numbers taking science subjects in the secondary schools. There could be no question of discouraging this, but rather of encouraging it.</P>
    <P>It might be suggested that the <i>impasse</i> in regard to the teaching of postgraduate science could be resolved by establishing, as a temporary measure, a system of shifts between the various groups of students.  Apart, however, from the fact that some of the junior classes comprise approximately 300 students, it will upon consideration be realised that the work of postgraduate science students is not open to the expedient of shifts, for such students are dealing with experiments that do not permit of the moving of the apparatus concerned for perhaps months at a time.</P>
    <P>In view, therefore, of what might fairly be called the desperate position of University College, Dublin, in regard to postgraduate teaching of science, the Government set up an interdepartmental committee to inquire into how the immediate problem might best be met.  That committee, after full consultation with the College authorities concerned, came to the conclusion that it is necessary to provide immediately a building for senior science work, at an estimated cost of £250,000, and that temporary laboratory buildings for this special purpose at Earlsfort Terrace would later yield such a small salvage value for other purposes that their provision there could only be regarded as wasteful. The Government has accepted this view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> Of this sum of £250,000 the College agreed to find £100,000, and the first step towards finding the remainder is the present motion asking for a token amount for the purpose and the ratifying thereby by Dáil Éireann of the Government's agreement in principle, as already announced, to the transfer to the Belfield site.  The College could then proceed immediately with the erection of the building.</P>
    <P>I have devoted the greater part of my statement so far to University College, Dublin, as that College, being in the worst plight, is the subject of this Supplementary Estimate.  It is not, however, to be taken thereby that the Government has lost sight of the Commission's recommendations for the Cork and Galway Colleges.  Before going further with this point, however, I should like to say that many people, including, perhaps, sometimes members of the Colleges themselves, are inclined to think of each of the Colleges as an abstraction rather than as in essence a body of Irish students who must be properly provided for.  In bringing forward this what might be called emergency measure for University College, Dublin, I am not thinking of what part of the country that College is located in, but that it serves more than half the total body of students from Ireland, including all our agricultural, mechanical engineering and chemical engineering and the very great proportion of our electrical engineering, veterinary and architectural students.</P>
    <P>Once this rescue operation, as it might well be called, is taken for the Dublin College, there are a number of other problems which call urgently for consideration by the Government. First among these will be, as I have said, the accommodation problem in the other two Colleges upon which the Commission reported.  Then there is the question of whether a University Development Committee, composed of persons with wide administrative, business and technical experience, as recommended by the Commission, should be set up, and of course there is, as already mentioned, the question of architectural competitions for the <Col N="949" /> lay-out and for the various blocks of buildings that will be required.  On these matters no decision has as yet been taken, but I hope to bring them formally before the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, there are a number of other problems of our higher education on which I have something to say and on which the Government has taken a particular decision.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the matter of Vocational Committees providing professional courses parallel to those provided by the University Colleges.  This is a development which for some years has been a cause of much concern to my Department, since, for one thing, it is the Minister's responsibility to see that there is no needless duplication of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Part of the trouble there is that there is a rung missing in our educational ladder inasmuch as there is no official channel for the talented and determined vocational education student to proceed via the National University to a degree in his own subject.  I was glad to notice from a resolution I received recently from the trade union authorities that they too have taken cognisance of this problem. I may add that when, in accordance with the rules of O.E.E.C., of which we are a member, the provision for the teaching of science in our schools and Colleges was examined last year and when representatives of the Department and of other interested parties were summoned to Paris in November last for what is called &ldquo;a confrontation&rdquo; on the subject, one of the points underlined by the O.E.E.C. examiners was this gap in our system.</P>
    <P>For my own part, without trying to pre-judge issues which I intend to submit to another tribunal, I think that, while it is rather the function of the vocational schools that may be concerned, to produce technicians, a matter in which, incidentally, we are weak, than to produce professional people, every child of sufficient talent, be he poor or rich, in any type of school should have the opportunity of climbing right to the top of the educational ladder.  The nation needs the services of all the talent it can find.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> That is not to say that I believe in the 11 plus or 12 plus or any other plus method of selection.  The fundamental disadvantage of the plus systems at an early age is that they tend to crystallise schooling, and so society, at an early age into two classes, the professional and the strictly technical, with little or no hope of escape from the strictly technical class for the boy or girl who has once been segregated. I would think that any dividing line of the sort, if it must be, should not take place till the age of about 17 or 18, and that at that point there should be a channel for the really good and determined higher technical student from the vocational school to the University.</P>
    <P>It was understood generally up to recently that this could not be done within the framework of the constitution of the National University, but I am glad to say that my Department has recently been informed by the authorities of University College, Dublin, that they believe that there need be no fundamental difficulty in waiving Latin, which is not a vocational school subject, and, if necessary, its alternative, a modern continental language, in the case of vocational school students who are of a proper standard otherwise and who desire to continue their studies towards a technological Degree.</P>
    <P>If that were to come about, there is no barrier to vocational committees awarding scholarships to the university to suitably qualified students. Moreover, it is my intention, as recently indicated to the House, shortly to introduce a much more comprehensive scheme of scholarships to secondary schools, vocational schools and universities than the present one.  In the circumstances I have mentioned, therefore, it would be possible for a vocational school student to enjoy such a university scholarship also.</P>
    <P>There may be a case, also, of course, for vocational students to continue at professional level in higher technical schools, but, however that may be, I think that, apart from its being in the national interest to cultivate <Col N="951" /> the best brains of the country, it is of fundamental importance socially that the student who may not have had the means to follow a secondary school course but who by ability and determination makes his or her way through a suitable course in a vocational school to the very lop level should have the possibility of enjoying the advantages of the intellectual and social climate of a University.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Universities themselves I believe this to be extremely important.  Anyone who looks at our university system in a broad way must be struck by a certain paradox that pertains to it.  The paradox is that while, for instance, there has been a certain amount of opposition to the idea of transferring University College, Dublin, from the city to Belfield and while there are campaigns for University Colleges at new centres, the University Colleges are, on the whole, not so popular as they might be, if we are to judge by the somewhat exiguous assistance they receive locally.  The new place and new importance of Universities in the nation's life has not caught the imagination of our people as it has elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The main reason for this, in my opinion, is that, since our Colleges are almost entirely dependent on State grants, which in our circumstances must be relatively small, and on students' fees, they tend to appear as the preserve of the children of the well-off.  The poorer citizens, who generally are the majority, are, therefore, inclined to take the view that the University is not for their children and so means nothing to them, except that they have to pay for it all.  This view, is, of course, incorrect, for although the State contributes to University education, the parents contribute more, by way of fees, lodgings, books and so on, and the State benefits thereby from the parents' sacrifice.  That argument is rather involved, however, for the man who would have no hope of sending his child to the University, but if it were generally understood that the child of even the poorest, if he is of sufficient ability, would have <Col N="952" /> the opportunity of, as I have termed it, climbing right to the top of the educational ladder, that would be a tremendous uplift to the morale of the whole country.</P>
    <P>Another problem which for a number of years has given my Department a certain amount of difficulty is the allocation from time to time to the four University Colleges of annual grants.  When increased grants are being made, it has been the endeavour of the Department to try to arrive at as fair and just an apportioning as possible of the sum available.  Many considerations arise in that regard.  Up to the present the main basis of comparison between the needs of the several Colleges has been the most recent figures available of the total income of each College per student, but with due regard also to the minimum needs of each College in the matter of overheads, to any special responsibilities or commitments in a particular College and to the relative expenses of particular provision in any one or more of the Colleges.  This method of comparing the needs of the Colleges is naturally very much an <i>ad hoc</i> one, and it is hardly fair to ask a Government Department to advise its Minister on a basis that must be at least to some extent arbitrary.  I think the time is coming when in the effort to meet the growing demands some guiding principles of allocation would be useful.</P>
    <P>A third pressing problem is the claims of some provincial centres for a University College.  To that there is no facile answer one way or the other.  Only a thorough examination of facts and figures in the context of the national economy, resources and needs would bring to light whether there is a real problem in this respect and, if so, how best it might be solved.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other such problems which call for investigation, and accordingly I propose shortly to set up a Commission to survey the field of higher education and make recommendations on problems such as I have mentioned and other relevant matters.  Let me hasten to add that the establishment of that Commission <Col N="953" /> does not preclude rescue operations, as I have called them, in relation to the accommodation in any College pending the Commission's Report. Any such Commission of course would in its deliberations be subject to the principle laid down in Article 42 of the Constitution to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>One final word.  Universities are of their nature very expensive institutions. A University student costs the State here more than three times the cost to it of a secondary school pupil, but in fact the income per student of Irish University Colleges is only one-third of that of similar British institutions. There is no use in pretending that we can ever emulate that level of financial support for our University Colleges&mdash;though of course we may expect to be called upon by them for a good deal more assistance than at present&mdash;but we have at least one great resource on which we can rely. We are blest in that God has endowed our race with a plenteous supply of brains.</P>
    <P>If, standing firmly on our own feet, we use those brains properly we can hope to cooperate with all and hold our own with the best.  But, as my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, pointed out recently, while this is true, it is true only so long as the other fellow has not adopted new techniques.  For the training of our youth in those new techniques and for education in the humanities (including the sciences) that will balance and guide to good purpose the use of these, we look to our University staffs for the same devotion as in the past.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the Universities have suddenly been flung into the forefront of national endeavour, and I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to their staffs for the fine work they have been doing for a great many years in what must be conditions of great stress, often in classrooms and laboratories which in point of suitability were far below standard. From these they have given our young State its teachers, scientists, agriculturists, engineers, doctors, dentists, <Col N="954" /> architects, economists and administrators, all of a quality comparable to that provided in other countries far ahead of us in wealth and resources. What is really extraordinary about all this&mdash;but not surprising if we recall that the Irish have a certain genius for improvisation and that adverse odds call out the best side of the Irish character&mdash;is that so far our graduates can hold their own in any part of the world.  That this is so the keen and constant demand for them from overseas is the best evidence.</P>
    <P>I started this with the mention of Newman, who was the apostle of knowledge as its own end.  It is to be feared that during the course of the speech I have lapsed from that ideal and have placed all the stress on the technological aspect of higher education. That was because I was thinking mostly in terms of our national survival and progress.  Let me end, however, by quoting from the Report of the Committee on Australian Universities. I do not apologise for borrowing the extract, as it seems to me to be of universal application.  The quotation reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the function of the university to offer not merely a technical or specialist training but a full and true education, befitting a free man and the citizen of a free country. This is becoming harder, too, and the demands of a modern technical training use up so much time and energy on the part of both teachers and students that the wider ard more fundamental aims of a fully rounded education may seem sometimes to have fallen into the background. But it is important to the interests of the country, and of humanity, that they should not do so. It has been becoming more and more clearly and widely recognised of recent years that the world simply cannot afford that its highly soecialised professional men, technologists and scientists should not also be fully educated as rounded human beings. It sometimes seems that while we have been advancing at a formidable speed in our knowledge of technical matters, we have if anything been falling behind in our understanding <Col N="955" /> and appreciation of human values. We can handle machines and physical nature beyond the dreams of previous generations, but we handle ourselves, our families and our fellow human beings in general no better, and perhaps less well, than our fathers did before us.  Many of the most serious problems in the world to-day are moral problems and are problems of human relationship. The need for the study of humanities is therefore greater and not less than in the past.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I offer my congratulations to the Minister on his comprehensive contribution of a character not usually associated with a Supplementary Estimate of £10.  In special circumstances, we overlook that idiosyncrasy and gladly confine ourselves to congratulating him on a justifiable marathon.</P>
      <P>It is important, before I deal with other matters, that we come to the heart of this matter at once and so I recall what the Minister said in the course of his speech:</P>
      <P>Of this sum of £250,000 the College agreed to find £100,000, and the first step towards finding the remainder is the present motion asking for a token amount for the purpose and the ratifying thereby by Dáil Éireann of the Government's agreement in principle, as already announced, to the transfer to the Belfield site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say on behalf of the Fine Gael Party that we approve that decision.  This whole matter of the building of an adequate University College, Dublin, appears to be one of those questions which has, in my judgment, become unnecessarily clouded by furious acrimony when, as I see it, none is necessary at all. As the report of the Commission presided over by Mr. Justice Ó Dálaigh records, members of that Commission themselves saw more than one possibility and at one stage of their deliberations leant towards the aim of erecting the necessary buildings in or around the existing Earlsfort Terrace site.  It was only after protracted <Col N="956" /> inquiry and anxious thought that they came to the conclusion that that simply was not a practical policy, for the reasons set out in greater detail by their reports.  Then they came to the conclusion that if the unity of the University College were to be maintained, the transfer to the new site at Belfield was essential and that in the existing circumstances the best site is the site available at Belfield.</P>
    <P>I apprehend that I may draw down upon my head the furious acrimony of both right and left if I point out to those who are now bitterly opposed to the proposed transfer that their position is fully understood and that everybody interested in this matter has a certain sympathy with their point of view.  The College authorities themselves at an early stage sought to extend the Earlsfort Terrace premises to a degree that would make provision for all that was anticipated as being necessary in the future.  They turned with reluctance from the hope of achieving that end.  The people, and they are responsible people, who signed this report of the Ó Dálaigh Commission, also felt great sympathy with those who would wish to keep the premises in or about St. Stephen's Green and Earlsfort Terrace but they also, after a study of the facts, were persuaded that the thing was not possible and so recommended Belfield to us.</P>
    <P>I would urge on those who feel passionately that that conclusion should not have been reached that they should not recklessly charge everybody who has been convinced of the necessity of transferring the University to Belfield of bad faith, of folly and of worse.  All we are doing is trying to do our best and to arrive at the right conclusion.  I would also say to certain people who resent the intrusion of <i>Tuairim</i> and other interested parties in this controversy, not to condemn such public-spirited persons as nothing but &ldquo;nosey-parkers&rdquo; and mischief makers.  They have a right to their view, too.  I do not agree with the view that it is now practicable or desirable to locate the new University College in or around Earlsfort Terrace. I do not think it is practicable or desirable. I never did.  In that, perhaps, <Col N="957" /> I differ from others.  It is important to make up our minds that it is neither practicable nor desirable.  If it is either impracticable or undesirable, then we should not attempt to do it.</P>
    <P>In that connection, Sir, it is right to remind the House that in the trials and tribulations of human life only too often do we discover by bitter experience that the best is not infrequently the enemy of the good.</P>
    <P>If we are never to do anything until we are certain that we have reached the apotheosis of perfection that, I suggest, is the classic &ldquo;<i>philosophe du complet</i>&rdquo; which ends in nobody doing anything at all because he makes up his mind that it is unworthy of him to put his hand to anything which is not the closest, which is not, in fact, an absolute approximation to the omniscience and omnipotence of God, which is given to none of us.  Therefore, the best we can do is to come as near the ideal as we can, and the essence of common sense is to discover clearly the distinction between the practical approximation to the highest perfection and the impracticable fatuity of arguing oneself into incapacity for any kind of action at all.  I am quite satisfied that argument has been carried as far as it is now desirable to do, and our Party is prepared to support the principle referred to in the paragraph which I have quoted from the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters mentioned by the Minister in the course of his observations to which I shall now refer though I am not prepared, nor could I reasonably be expected to be prepared for as wide a discussion as would be suggested by the Minister's speech.  I am making no reflection whatever on the administration of the Rules of Order but, if I attempted to make a speech like that on a Supplementary Estimate for £10, pandemonium would have broken out in which my long experience of proceedural matters would have been tested to save my skin.  However, I do not propose to pursue that line of thought but I would like to turn to page 2 and to read the modern gloss <Col N="958" /> on a story of which I have some knowledge. The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>In 1909-10 University College, Dublin's student total was 530.  At that time it was thought that the maximum number of students would never exceed 1,000...</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister he is labouring under a pathetic illusion if he accepts any such fallacious belief but the men of that day had learned the bitter lesson that in this troubled world, and in the much more troubled world they were working in, they had to reconcile themselves not infrequently to seeking, not even the second best, but to rejoice when their efforts achieved for our people the second worst.</P>
    <P>They were fighting then to get our people the right to higher education and they got it and they had no apprehension there would flow from their efforts and those that came after them the opportunity we now have to expand what they set on foot to meet the needs of our people.  It was their confidence 50 years ago in the capacity and prospects of our people that put us all where we are to-day.  I only hope this generation to which we belong will be worthy of that generation that went before them and, with the same confidence and the same hope for the future of this country, will provide now for the expansion which they foresaw but which they were not in a position fully to attain because they were pleading the cause of higher education in Ireland, not in Dáil Éireann, but in the British House of Commons.</P>
    <P>I hope that we in our own Parliament will be able to do as well for our children, and our children's children, as they in the foreign Parliament were able to do for us who are here.</P>
    <P>I do not want to seem critical of the Minister for he was critical of himself in his concluding paragraph, but I did feel that there was something of desecration in beginning with the lofty thought of Newman and then treading so dusty and dreary a technological path as he condemned us to follow. But, I understand his problem, and suffice it to say that while I welcome his recourse to the Antipodes for a <Col N="959" /> peroration I would have thought the Minister for Education might have found in Newman's own work a suitable conclusion to his observations.  I shall content myself by saying that I would have had more interest in a peroration from Newman than what he gave us but if that is the best the Minister could do I am glad he gave us that, rather than abandon us in the forest of technological matter through which he led us in the course of his address.</P>
    <P>At one stage the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>If I may digress here for a moment, I should also like to inform the House that, despite criticisms one hears from time to time of the situation in our secondary schools, 89 per cent. of our recognised secondary teachers are University graduates...</P>
    <P>Would he permit me to digress for a moment to ask him while that statistic may be true, what help is it that secondary teachers should have a Degree in Commerce and be teaching Greek?  Perhaps if the Minister would look into that he could give us greater reassurance than merely by the process of counting heads?  Perhaps if he would inquire, when he comes to deplore the scarcity of secondary teachers, whether his problem might not be greatly relieved if he would waive his present requirements that every secondary teacher in Ireland must satisfy his Department that he is capable of teaching through the medium of Irish.</P>

    <P>This seems to me to be the language of insanity.</P>
    <P>How is it a penalty on our people to be free to go where they want to go and to be welcome wherever they want to go so long as there is no compulsion upon any of us to go?  How can any rational being describe it as a penalty upon us that we have free access to Great Britain and virtually free access to the United States and Canada, where the remuneration is so high that if we are to have a sufficiency of doctors and engineers for ourselves that we must produce more doctors and engineers than they could absorb? Is this not going to extremes of chauvinistic insanity?  What is the purpose of a university?  Is it not to provide higher education for our children? What is the purpose of a man's life? Is it not to use the faculties God gave him to the greatest honour and glory of God wherever he can?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of what our aim should be to enable our children to do.  It is one of the purposes of the university to give them access to knowledge, to expand and give them an opportunity of developing the faculties God gave them for the purpose of using them to the best possible advantage, and also, as Deputy Vivion de Valera said, to save their souls to the honour and glory of God.  But surely a student going into a University is the primary consideration?  They are not fodder in any chauvinistic or nationalistic view.  There is no reflection on a man if he believes he can use his faculties abroad better, if he goes where he can best use them. It is greatly to be rejoiced at if more of our own graduates find an opportunity <Col N="962" /> to use the gifts with which they have been endowed in this country but it is not a subject of lamentation and not a grievous penalty that the world is open to them wherever they want to go.</P>
      <P>There is not a country in Europe that would not give its right hand to be able to describe as its infinite good fortune what the Minister for Education pleases to describe&mdash;I take it in a distracted moment&mdash;as a penalty under which our people labour.  I have made reference to the statement that science graduates everywhere are not inclined to teach, that there are greater opportunities in industry.  It does not make their prospects any more glittering to them if they have to go through the pretence that they are able to teach through the medium of Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir, the Minister dealt with it at considerable length.  I sympathise with the Minister in having to envisage all possibilities but it causes me some twinge of anxiety to hear an Irish Minister for Education say that we had too many University students.  Can there be such a thing as too many students provided we are certain that all of them are capable of benefiting from higher education?  I do not think the case has ever been made that we are putting into the Universities of this country a miscellaneous bunch of unqualified undergraduates.  I have heard those allegations made about certain State Universities in the United States, that the preliminary <Col N="963" /> sifting of material is not adequate and the result is, you have a not inconsiderable number who really get no benefit at all.  But here, if anything, the matriculation standards, certainly of the National University of Ireland, are of a very exacting character.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances can we contemplate the possibility of our having too many undergraduates?  I think not.  I think the process of sifting here is, if anything, too rigorous and I gather that the Minister himself feels this is so.  This is a subject with which I have the deepest sympathy, that the time is overdue when we should be able to make it true in, this country that the child of any parents who are poor, if he has the capacity to benefit from a University education, should have the course laid open to him by a suitable system of scholarships and endowments where the resources of the parents would otherwise forbid access to the University for him.  So that I take it that that phrase the Minister used may be regarded as a momentary aberration on the part of the Minister.  In our circumstances I cannot conceive of the contingency he envisages arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then went on to deal with a matter which I think is very relevant to our deliberations on the fundamental issue involved in this Supplementary Estimate.  He spoke of the fact that there is room for the erection of halls of residence, and some residential accommodation is generally desirable in or close to the University, which is a feature of University life.  That is an extract from the Commissioners' Report.  The Minister said, I should add, that it was not the intention of the Government that halls of residence should be supplied by State aid.  Why?  Why does the Minister exclude that possibility categorically?  I think there would be a very considerable lessening of apprehension on the part of many of those who doubt the wisdom of the Belfield project if it were made abundantly clear that there was an early prospect of residential accommodation for students in the University <Col N="964" /> or in hostels on or adjacent to the campus.  Why should that not be a legitimate part of the whole scheme?</P>
    <P>We might consider whether hostels should be run by the University as the residential colleges of Oxford and Cambridge are run or the residential part of Trinity College, Dublin is operated, or we could consider circumstances whereby hostels would be run by religious for the accommodation of young men and young women in suitable premises as has been the custom in U.C.D. to which quite a number of such hostels are attached.  But why should there not be the possibility, if it were thought desirable, of the Government giving some advances for the construction of such hostels, if and when it was possible to find sites for them on or adjoining the campus?  I believe the campus is of such dimensions that it is not at all impossible that room could be found upon it for suitable hostels.  If they are to form part of the general building complex and of the architectural scheme envisaged I do not see why we could not at least consider assisting suitable bodies to erect them.</P>
    <P>I am told that if the existing hostels that we have had had to bear the capital cost of building they would have been closed down long ago.  Most of them have been provided by gift, or bequest, of one kind or another, and their operating costs correspond pretty closely with the income they are able to collect from the students.  Therefore. if we anticipate providing adequate residential facilities for those who need them&mdash;that is to say, students coming from some distance or students having no friends or relatives in the city with whom they can live&mdash;it may be impossible to get the necessary hostels erected unless the possibility of State aid is envisaged.  I would urge the Minister carefully to consider that matter before a final and irrevocable decision is taken upon it.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say about this project.  I wish it well.  I hope it will be a success.  I am quite convinced it will be.  But I make this most earnest appeal: there is no project, however admirable, which is not in some degree <Col N="965" /> stultified if it is born in an atmosphere of raging acrimony.  There is room for differences of opinion here, but it will be to the interests of every aspect of this problem if those who differ will agree to differ, freely conceding, one to the other, that, having examined the problem with the best wit that we individually and severally possess, we have come to our conclusions with the largest measure of honesty we are in a position to command.  I do not think the opponents of this scheme are actuated by malice or an evil desire to frustrate.  I think they have just come to the wrong conclusion and I am prepared to say that I am not satisfied that they have always had the patience to examine home every aspect of the problem on which they have publicly expressed a view.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that they may charge against me and those who think with me a similar fault.  All I can say is that I have talked as much as have most Deputies about it, with those who agree with me and to those who disagree with me.  I have read the reports; I am fully conscious of the fallibility of people who write reports, which, by their bulk and dullness, are almost unreadable, and people who write reports which, by their colour, format and style, are almost like a best seller, or who write reports which are delightfully illustrated but not always convincing.  I have read them all and tried to give them value.  All I can protest is that I, and my colleagues who agree with me, have reached our conclusions not without careful and deliberate thought.</P>

If these perilous paths are to be attempted I will leave the intrepid adventure to the Deputy.  I have already bearded the lion once in his den, and only a foolish man would <Col N="966" /> attempt to do that twice on the one day.</P>
      <P>One last word to the Minister: courage.  In 1909 and in 1910 they did not tell the British Government that they hoped to have it in 25 years; they said, &ldquo;We want it now.&rdquo;  They got it.  We have not to make that stipulation on any foreign authority. If I had to choose between buying secondhand machinery from abroad to equip an activity, the output of which is highly problematical, and finding the capital to provide University education under tolerable conditions for a half of the student body of Ireland, I would choose the University. I think it will be a great reflection on the country if we cannot put this through in ten years at the outside.  I deplore the suggestion that it will take 25 years.</P>

In that sense the extension of the educational opportunities of our people is a task forever but, in the strictly limited job we have to do here of building University College, Dublin, on the campus at the Belfield site, I should like to think I would see it finished.  I should like to think that as the oldest undergraduate, perhaps, of that institution I would be given the opportunity of sauntering through its leafy bowers, and rejoicing in a work well done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> At the outset I should like to refer to a matter introduced by Deputy Dillon.  He referred to the Irish language. I do not intend to dwell very long on the subject, but my comments have a bearing on the Estimate before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I respectfully submit, however, that the point I wish to make has some relevance. Under the first Chancellor of the University in the summer of 1910 the eagerly awaited decision was taken to make the Irish language and literature obligatory at matriculation on all students of Irish domicile.  That regulation took effect in 1913.  Deputy Dillon cannot quote Scripture to suit his own purposes all the time.  On the one hand he praises the men who went before the present Senate of University College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the House that the foundation of the National University was based on love of the language and love of Irish culture.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Deputy was and I hope he appreciates it as I do at my age.  I disagree with the Minister when he says that this project should take twenty years but I should have prefaced my remarks by congratulating him on making such a lengthy speech without taking even a drink of water.  I know that he has gone to a great deal of trouble in this matter and that he appreciates the seriousness of the position of University education in this country, which, in my humble opinion, is in an appalling state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say to the Minister that I do not think he was being completely <Col N="968" /> honest with the House when he mentioned that period of 20 years?  Why did he not say that it was all a question of finance?  If it is a question of finance he should let us know and if it is not a question of finance I cannot see how it could take 20 years to complete the proposal.  Such a statement is a reflection on the capabilities of the engineering and building professions in the country.  It should not tax our ingenuity to spend seven million pounds in four years.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister that he cannot expect the Irish taxpayer to bear this entire burden.  We are at present possibly taxed to the limit of our capabilities and I think that we should utilise our borrowing powers to get the money from the World Bank, of which we became a member some years ago.  The repayments to the World Bank would be far lighter than if we attempted to raise all this capital from the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I think the most serious aspect of the reports is this question of the 20 years' period.  Suppose we accept that principle, let us see where we will be as far as University College Dublin is concerned in 1965.  We have it beyond yea or nay, on the evidence of the various Professors who appeared before the Commission, that this is a question of the most extreme urgency, that the present situation is a critical one.  The only immediate action proposed to be taken is that we give a grant forthwith of £250,000 on the recommendation of an inter-Departmental Committee subject to the College authorities raising £100,000 from their own resources.  That grant deals only with the Faculty of Science. What is going to happen in the meantime?</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is anyone in the country who studied the project and read the report of the Commission who will not agree that the only decision left to the Government was to build at Belfield.  When a Government sets up a Commission, it is not necessarily bound to accept the findings of that Commission but anyone can see that to depart from the recommendations of the Commission in this <Col N="969" /> case would be a complete waste of time.  Why go to a solicitor and pay him for advice if you have made up your own mind beforehand?  A lot of people do that and get a kick out of it.</P>

I advocated that at a symposium in the Shelbourne Hotel and I was castigated over it and misquoted by the Revd.  Alfred O'Rahilly. Not alone did he misquote me in the publication called <i>Hibernia</i> but he took my words out of their context and gave them a completely different meaning so as to change completely what I had said.  He ended up by pointing out the danger of the line of thinking of certain politicians of the present day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to the Minority Report.  I advocated a tie up between University College, Dublin and Trinity College subject to religious guarantees being given to the satisfaction of the heads of both religious denominations.  The position of the National University is that it is a Catholic University.  I know that some members of this House, before this debate is over, will have a crack at the Bishops and also at the views of other speakers in this House. I have had many a crack at the Bishops myself but not on questions of faith or morals, not that my morals are above reproach.  Those were matters of a semi-political nature however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do accept the fact that, in regard to such matters as education, the Bishops of the Catholic Church have every right to put forward their views and I shall accept without reservation their recommendations.  I am bound to do that.  This, then, is the Catholic <Col N="970" /> University of Ireland which we are discussing tonight.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Dillon misinterpreted an extract from the Minister's speech.  Unfortunately, I have not a copy of the speech before me.  He adduced that the Minister meant that it was a penalty on certain of our children who qualify at college to have to emigrate.  Was that the suggestion of the Deputy?&mdash;that the word &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; should not have been used by the Minister, that, in fact, it was not a penalty?</P>

      <P>The right to go anywhere.  My interpretation of the Minister's statement was that the penalty was that the Irish taxpayer was paying for the export of graduates from this country to foreign lands &mdash;in order words, that we are subsidising work which could well be done in Canada, Australia and other lands. I quite agree with the point the Minister made.  He said that there are instances of graduates going abroad to get post-graduate experience and returning to this country, and that the country reaps the benefit of their specialised knowledge in certain instances.</P>
      <P>It would be impossible in the short time at our disposal to go into all this. The House should be given a week to discuss this Supplementary Estimate. In my humble opinion it is the most important Estimate to come before the House for many a long year.  There are many aspects of the Estimate.  It is difficult to speak without having a copy of the Minister's speech.  There are some sentences that one would have to read five or six times to see where the comma was.  &ldquo;All the charms of all the Muses often flowering in a lonely word.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not make any reference to one matter and he may do so in replying.  I want to know if remuneration or allowances are a matter for the Senate of the National University.  Great play is made of the interpretation of the term &ldquo;allowance&rdquo;. However, Deputies have now <Col N="971" /> been made the guinea pigs in that matter and it may be used elsewhere. The Minister might refer to the question whether it is the Senate that fixes the remuneration or salaries of the professors and lecturers because, unless these salaries are stepped up very greatly, unless the leaders of the respective professions and the Deans of the Faculties are paid a proper salary befitting their office, I am afraid we shall not continue to get the best type of person.</P>
    <P>For some peculiar reason best known to himself, the Minister made no reference to the College of Surgeons and other institutions of that nature where some citizens qualify in certain professions.  The Minister referred to the number of graduates in Medicine. Were those figures in respect of the National University alone or did they include all graduates in the State?</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed the sentiment, which was endorsed by Deputy Dillon, that every child in this country should have an opportunity of University education.  That, of course, is &ldquo;a consummation devoutly to be wished&rdquo; but there again we must be practical.  I have not heard the Minister or Deputy Dillon say how that could be achieved.  I certainly have no solution.  We are told that every child who goes to the University costs the taxpayer £400 to £500.  We taxpayers&mdash;taxpayers from the 1st of next month&mdash;will be paying £400 to £500 for every student in a University.  It has been calculated by the excellent body, the <i>Tuairm</i> sub-committee, that with the building of Belfield that could be put at £1,000 per head, to be borne by the taxpayer.  Therefore, it is only wishful thinking at the present time to suggest that every child who wishes to go to a University should be able to do so.  I do not think that that could be possible even if the scholarship limits were widened.  For instance, at present many brilliant children cannot go to a University because some local authority, in its wisdom, decides by nine votes to eight that they will give only six scholarships instead of eight as the rates are too high.</P>
    <P>That problem must be tackled very <Col N="972" /> quickly.  Is it wise to tackle it quickly if it means increasing the numbers coming to Dublin?  It will take 20 years to build Belfield.  What am I leading up to?  I have said that it will take 20 years to build Belfield and that an extension of the scholarship scheme may increase the numbers going to University College, Dublin. I am told that the number at University College, Galway, is static but that Cork is on the increase.  Where is the Minister's solution?  We are told that Earlsfort Terrace is like a sardine tin, that no more can be fitted in.  What will happen in the next five years? Does the Minister not feel in his heart that there is a little outpost of civilisation&mdash;<i>Urbs antiqua fuit studiisque asperima belli</i>&mdash;an ancient city versed in the arts of war and learning&mdash; where, indeed, a university existed long before any of those that we are discussing today was established, in Mungret College, as Deputy Dillon knows, or should know?</P>

      <P>I must compliment the Minister for investigating the whole position of University education. However, it is a great pity that when the Government were setting up the 1957 Commission on University Education the terms of reference were not wider.  I do not think anyone else seems to agree with that idea but perhaps the Minister when he is replying will give more details as to what the terms of reference will be in respect of this Commission on University Education which the Government have decided to set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the time or the place to speak about the claims of Limerick to a University.  The Minister has cut the ground from under me and, I suppose, my colleague Deputy Russell by announcing the setting up of this Commission.  I have no doubt that if I go into detail on the claims of Limerick to a University on this Supplementary Estimate you.  Sir, would suggest that in due course I should appear before the said commission <Col N="973" /> and propagate my views there. However, there are other places such as Waterford; they need a University there, maybe.</P>

However, having gone into this question, I am satisfied in regard to Limerick's claim. Every Deputy has received a copy from the Limerick University Project Committee of their report and their very convincing figures.  I have here a list of resolutions in support of Limerick's claim for a constituent college.  There are three pages in it which, with your permission, I should like to include in the official report in the form of a tabular statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think both the Minister and Deputy Dillon are incorrect in their references to residential accommodation.  This report shows plans prepared by U.C.D. architects and it shows in the Belfield estate provision for hostels.  In the capital sum estimated by the experts who gave evidence before the commission the cost of these hostels was taken into consideration.  Am I correct in saying that that is one of the recommendations in the report which the Government have turned down?  The <Col N="974" /> Minister might say in reply that the lay-out plan shows hostels or the &ldquo;campus&rdquo; as Deputy Dillon calls them.  I do not know why there is no residential accommodation.  The Minister was quoting Newman.  There is another quotation I could give from Newman to the effect that a University is not a University unless it is residential.  That is what he hoped for and that is what he aimed at eventually in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Where will the 5,000 students live? Supposing 3,000 of them are living elsewhere, does the Minister think the other 2,000 can live in digs around the Ballsbridge area?  According to an American congress man that was supposed to be growing into a slum. Where are these students supposed to live?  If you have a railway station you have trains; if you have a greyhound track you have hares; if you have a publichouse you have beer; if you have a University you should have accommodation.  I hate the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo;; I hate the word &ldquo;campus&rdquo; too.  The word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; should be &ldquo;struck from the record.&rdquo;  The impression I have is that a hostel is a kind of nissen hut where you make tea on a primus stove.</P>
      <P>We should have a University with proper residential accommodation. One would expect that would be possible with an expenditure of £7 million or whatever the cost will be. I had hoped we would have got a breakdown of this figure.  I should like a ruling from you on this.  The Minister is seeking only £10 to-day but we are dealing with an expenditure of £7,000,000.  Will the Minister be coming back with an itemised account of the expenditure in due course?  Are we to-day voting a sum of £10 or £7 million?  I would appreciate a ruling from you on that.  I want to know, before we decide on this, whether we will be given the breakdown of the expenditure of this sum which, in my opinion, is a very reasonable thing for this House to ask the Minister in respect of such a colossal amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred very briefly to the claims of University College, Cork and University College Galway.  The <Col N="975" /> requirements of U.C.G. were put forward by Monsignor de Brun, Professor Mitchell and the other members of the governing body in U.C.G.  Professor Atkins and members of his staff gave evidence about the requirements of University College, Cork and the financial implications involved in those requirements.  Are we giving the Universities that money <i>in toto</i>?  Are we giving U.C.D. and the other Universities all their requirements or are we going to cut down on their requirements?  If so, we should like to know how much and also why.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the fact that it is very difficult to limit or control the admission of students to faculties. I cannot see why.  The Minister's suggestion, I think, is that if a student passes his matriculation he should be entitled to go on for any faculty of his choosing.  That is reading too much into the Constitution and protecting the free will of our citizens a bit too much.  What about protecting the taxpayer for a change?  The Minister tells us that fifty per cent. of the doctors and engineers emigrate.  Is every taxpayer to continue, when Belfield is built, to contribute £1,000 for every student who wants to be a doctor or engineer?  We are exporting fifty per cent of those to Canada, Britain or the United States.</P>
    <P>I am 100 per cent. with Deputy Dillon when he says that it is a great thing to educate our children and that if emigration is inevitable and if we have the type of people who will emigrate in any case we should not send our young people out as serfs, slaves or lackeys but as educated people with a Degree that will enable them to earn their living.</P>
    <P>I think it only reasonable that the Minister should interfere in this question and express his views which I am sure will be respected by the Senate of the National University.  The Senate have acted before in this regard.  In certain instances they have said that there are only say, 52, vacancies in engineering and the first 52 are taken&mdash;either on Leaving Certificate or the College Entrance and they get the places.  Surely we <Col N="976" /> can control admission to the Medical School and the Engineering School? If we export 50 per cent. of our graduates surely it would be reasonable to say we must cut down the numbers admitted by say 25 per cent. That would not be asking too much. I think a direction could be given.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not make&mdash;and this is a very important point, in my opinion&mdash;any reference to any change or possible change in the 1908 Universities Act or the Charter of the University nor did he say that it was proposed to make any change.  I could understand it if the Minister said that he was making that question one of the terms of reference of the commission which he proposes to set up but I do not want to leave this matter and then find that because the Charter is framed as it is that the possible setting up of a University in Limerick or of certain faculties would be frustrated because of the failure to change either the Charter or the 1908 Act.  Perhaps the Minister would let us have some information on that point.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister has not said if he proposes any changes in the Senate or in the method of administration of the National University at present or in the future.  Whoever pays the piper should be able to call the tune.  I am not suggesting State intervention; I am not a Socialist, although, perhaps, I may have some Socialist leanings, on Social Welfare and Health, but I seriously think the representation of the State at present on the Senate of the National University is inadequate.  If I am correct the Government nominates only four members.  I am very glad that representation of the Universities has been continued in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Restored, continued and abolished.  While University representatives might be able to put the University point of view and while they might put down motions of interest and help to the University that would also be of assistance to the elected members of the House, I still think that the Government should have <Col N="977" /> greater representation.  If you look up the attendances at the meetings of the Senate you will see very interesting figures.</P>
      <P>Not everyone can attend these long-drawn-out meetings.  Persons may be interested only in one or two specific matters relating to their own sphere of activity or points that they might be interested in on behalf of the Government or on behalf of the Minister for Education so as to advise him on certain aspects&mdash;I do not know.  I think one solution would be to give each of the Governing Bodies more power, as I advocated for the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;the analogy is a bit strained&mdash;to give the local officer of Social Welfare discretionary power. I think the Governing Bodies of the Constituent Colleges in Cork and Galway&mdash;I do not know about Maynooth; perhaps it would be in a different position&mdash;should control their own affairs rather than have them coming up here and being outvoted, possibly, by vested interests or people with more representation.</P>
      <P>I could speak very strongly about the National University but I do not want to abuse my privileges here.  I was not very satisfied about the Visiting Commission.  What happened about that?  Surely that is all part and parcel of this Estimate.  I never fully understood what it was about and I do not know whether they found any injustices, inaccuracies or anomalies or&mdash; to put it crudely&mdash;anything &ldquo;hookey&rdquo;. I saw some report in the papers, in the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i> the other day, to the effect that this commission's report was in the hands of the Government.  It specifically referred to the appointments of certain professors and lecturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have made my point sufficiently.  The State should have more representation on the Governing Bodies and on the Senate of the National University itself; as composed at present, I think that body is completely unwieldy.  I have no doubt that there are some of the most eminent men in the country on the Senate of the National University; most of the professors and lecturers in the various Constituent Colleges are outstanding <Col N="978" /> men but you have some peculiar characters&mdash;we have them here also&mdash; and most eccentric people as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not concluded on the last occasion when dealing with the question of closing hours.  Without any acrimony, the case I put to the Minister is that it seems the whole body of opinion throughout the country, with the exception of the Minister and members of the Government apparently, is directly opposed to the proposal in the Bill.  When the bulk of opinion is directly opposed to it, I think the Minister is unwise in pushing it.  Apparently the trade themselves are not in favour of it.  Not a single representation has been made to me or to any other Deputy I know of in favour of the Minister's proposal. The Minister would be wise to leave <Col N="979" /> the hours exactly as they are.  I do not want to introduce any note of bitterness but one must take notice of public opinion, especially when the public take the trouble of bringing their opposition to this measure to the notice of Deputies.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy described certain sections of the people as pressure groups and so on.  On second thoughts I decided to pass that over.  In my opinion, it was an ignorant and uninformed remark and it certainly was not fair comment on the matter.  The Minister would be wise to yield to public opinion on this occasion.  The Minister has not made a case for it himself.  Nobody I heard made a case for it.  Definitely there is no demand for it up and down the country, either by the licensed trade themselves or their customers.  Everyone is satisfied with the present hours and the Minister would be wise in meeting the public demand.</P>
      <P>One of the very purposes of this House is to make laws that suit the people.  Only a foreign Government in occupation of the country would deliberately try and impose their will in complete violation of the wishes of the people.  The reason the Minister himself has been sent here is to do the things the people want. Definitely some reform of the licensing laws was necessary.  In the section of the Bill with which we are dealing the Minister is outraging public opinion.  He is taking a foolish step, a step that has not been asked for by any section of the people concerned. While I would be very sorry to introduce anything like bitterness, politics and so on, the Minister would be wise, I think, to meet the wishes of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that one of the Minister's answers will be that the Commission set up to inquire into the matter has recommended this proposal.  Might I respectfully submit two points on that?  First, while they may have had reasons at the time, about three years have elapsed since the Commission met and made their recommendations. The second is that no matter what the Commission recommended <Col N="980" /> at that time public opinion is now very emphatic on the point that the Minister's proposals are not the correct ones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise in support of the amendment I have tabled on this Bill.  In plain words, it proposes that the closing hour be 11.30 in Dublin county and the rural areas.  I am proposing that because it is and has been the general custom in the country for people who want a late evening's drinking to avail of the facilities of the 12 o'clock midnight closing hour.  I have been impressed very much by the case made by Deputy Blowick.  This seems to be a most unpopular Bill.  It seems to please nobody.  The alteration in the hours appears to threaten and upset the trade.  The total abstinence associations have written thousands of letters to their Deputies complaining that they dislike the Bill.  Church leaders have spoken out against the proposed alterations contained in the Bill.  It has been opposed very vigorously by a substantial number of the publicans and is also opposed by the staffs working in these licensed premises.  In addition to all those interests, the general public, who are interested in the facilities available under the licensing laws, are also not satisfied with the proposals in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I consider that these proposals will not improve the existing arrangement. That is the very point made by Deputy Blowick.  Generally speaking, the existing arrangement in regard to the closing hours of licensed premises has worked well and has proved to be satisfactory.  Of course, there will be cranks who will speak long and loud in support of one attitude or another in relation to the closing hours, but we must take the outlook of the average man.  No responsible body in Ireland has asked for this Bill in its present form.  There has been no public outcry against the licensing laws as we know them at present. Compare the example we have of the outcry of the public clamouring for a revision of our road traffic laws.  We have not that kind of clamour or outcry in respect of the licensing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> Some people are critical of the existing licensing laws because they are not enforced in the same way everywhere. There are reasons for that and they were revealed in a statement made by a very prominent person some months ago.  However, the fact remains that the law is there and can be enforced and, if it is enforced as it stands, I believe the general public will have no reason to complain.</P>
    <P>Who wants this Bill as it stands? I cannot think of anyone.  In his statement, the Minister indicated that he had an open mind on the matter and that he would be guided by the views expressed here in the House.  I do not think he has heard any expression of satisfaction from the members of the Dáil who have spoken.  We remember the abuses which resulted from prohibition in the United States, and the bootlegging which followed, caused by those who wanted to indulge in intoxicating liquor when they were deprived from having that amenity.</P>
    <P>It was said by some of the interested organisations that this Bill proposes to give longer drinking hours. If it does propose to give longer drinking hours at the same time it seems to interfere with the traditional trading hours, and there will be an upset in the trade if the new arrangement of hours affects those.  I am suggesting to the Minister that it is well within his powers to shelve this Bill now.  It is not the first time a Bill was introduced in this House, debated, and dropped.  For instance, there was the Valuations Bill, around 1945, and after a considerable amount of argument and debate that Bill was shelved and we have not heard about it since.</P>

My proposing 11.30 p.m. was done on the assumption that the Minister will insist on putting through some kind of a licensing Bill. The traditional closing hour for many licensed premises outside Dublin City is 12 midnight, and this Bill proposes to put an end to the midnight closing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the existing laws that the closing time is 12 o'clock.  The premises which had the right to remain open until then will now find themselves in the position of being obliged to close at a much earlier hour but, if we look at the traditional closing hours in the city, they have been 10 p.m. in the winter and 10.30 p.m. in summer.  I consider that a minor amendment of the existing laws would meet our modern needs, and I do not believe that this Bill will change the taste and habits of our people, and if the closing hour is changed, we must consider what the consequences will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of compensation has not been mentioned in the Bill.  It proposes to put a number of people out of business, people who were engaged in trading up to 12 midnight.  Then-premises were purchased at high cost, and costly alterations and improved amenities were provided in them.  They were purchased on the basis of certified <Col N="983" /> trading figures, the turnover figures between 10 p.m. and 12 midnight. They were the figures that mattered when such premises were changing hands.  They are mostly situated in remote areas and they cannot expect to do any kind of early evening trading. There must be some population in the vicinity of licensed premises if it is to do substantial trade in the early hours of the evening and these premises I speak of will now find themselves on the same basis as City premises.</P>
    <P>In other words, there will be a uniformity in the closing hours for licensed premises in these remote areas, where there is no local population, and for licensed premises in the city, and the premises in the remote areas cannot expect to do any kind of trade when the city premises are open at the same time.  They cater for the person who wants to enjoy a drink later in the evening, for instance, for private social parties.  They could avail of the amenities and the organised management of such premises which would not be available in shebeens or clubs to which people would be obliged to go if there is uniformity in the closing hour.  These people I speak of can at present get a reliable drink in areas outside the city, but in the ordinary way, in a club or private dwelling house, they will not have drink served in an orderly way in which it can be diluted with the traditional minerals.  You can have the example of the person who likes ginger ale to dilute his drink and it is not available.  He has to take club lemon or club orange in that spirit, but in the well-organised premises they can have their drink properly served up to them.</P>
    <P>This Bill is intended to stop late evening trading at premises which cater for this aspect of public enioyment. It is proposed that they will be closed at least one hour earlier than they had been closing but this one hour will represent approximately half of the traders' turnover and if they have to stop here in Dublin City and County&mdash;I am speaking of them mostly because the rural areas are able to speak for themselves&mdash;you will have <Col N="984" /> a position where we shall have the carefree gaiety of Dublin city and county, the gaiety associated with this city and enjoyed by visitors and residents, destroyed.</P>
    <P>You may have Dublin city by the change of these hours turned into a disreputable night club city.  It is a very happy city as it is.  The proposed hours will drive people into back rooms, sheds and various places, to bottle parties and the rest, where they can have drink instead of in an ordinary regular well-managed licensed premises.  You will have them drinking in badly lighted smoke-filled dens of iniquity.  That is the kind of life that you can expect in a city which is suddenly to have taken from it the kind of carefree gaiety associated with Dublin city and county, not alone in the minds of people in this country but also in the minds of people visiting the city.  In fact the amenities available in the matter of the licensing hours are commented on very favourably by people who come here on holidays.</P>
    <P>I consider that we should not fiddle with the hours characteristic of the evening life of Dublin City and County. The present arrangement caters for persons wishing to enjoy this late evening drinking.  There is very little difference between it and the city closing hour but it does make all the difference to the social life of the people who enjoy these amenities.  It is better to have this facility made available to them through well-controlled and well-managed services such as are provided by these very luxurious licensed premises right around Dublin city.</P>
    <P>It is possible that illicit trading may result from the shortage of hours caused by the reduction proposed in this Bill.  If we are to have illicit trading, we shall have the improper drinking arrangements which I mention &mdash;the bottle parties and the tragedies that follow them.  I might mention in relation to this proposal that it will be equally difficult to enforce any laws provided in this new Bill as it has been to enforce the existing laws.  You will always have the position where it will be difficult to enforce the laws but <Col N="985" /> that is the very reason penalties are imposed if they are broken.</P>
    <P>We have a situation which is not catered for here&mdash;the matter of closing time.  Heavy penalties should be imposed on customers who refuse to leave licensed premises at closing time.  It must be agreed that the customer who refuses to leave at closing time is just as guilty as the publican who encourages him to stay. Indeed, I do not know of any publicans who encourage their customers to stay after the closing hour.  It is usually that they are persuaded because of their friendly attitude to the customers to allow them to stay on.  I think there is a duty on customers who go into licensed premises to get out of them at closing time instead of putting the publican in the position that he almost has to use force to get them out.  The present hours are reasonable.  Why should we make closing time earlier?  Surely it cannot be contended that 12 o'clock is a very late hour?  We have the example of bottle parties carried on into the small hours of the morning and these are the parties that usually result in casualties.</P>
    <P>I am proposing in this amendment, to meet the Minister to some extent, that 11.30 be the closing time. People have their radio programmes and television programmes going up to 11.30; the clubs have plenty of visitors.  Listening to radio and television is part of the social life, which the people enjoy but, as I say, the closing time for these public services is 11.30.  There is the other aspect of this closing time; I suppose I am entitled to mention it at this stage.  It is proposed to give licences for dances up to 3 a.m. and reputable traders are to be deprived of their midnight closing time.  They have a staff to employ, they have business premises to keep up and they have taxes to pay.  These dances which are run only occasionally compared with licensed premises which must be run as a business regularly, are to be licensed until 3 a.m.  It seems to be most unfair to the traders who are to be prevented from remaining open until midnight.</P>
    <P>In support of the hours which I <Col N="986" /> have mentioned I should like to quote a letter circulated by the Irish Country Vintners Association.  I think the attitude of the trade to this matter is shown very clearly.  It has been considered by the licensed traders of all Ireland, and as I say they reached a decision.  The letter concerned, unfortunately, is undated. However it was circulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  This letter is from T.S. O'Dwyer, Honorary Secretary, Irish Country Vintners Association, Collinstown, Killucan, County Dublin.  It reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Deputy&mdash;A general meeting was held in Dublin on January 12th attended by town and country traders from the Twenty-Six County areas outside the county boroughs. The following motions were passed:</P>
      <P>(1)  It was unanimously agreed to form the Irish County Vintners Association in the Twenty-Six Counties, outside the County Boroughs.</P>
      <P>(2)  While a great many publicans believed that 12 o'clock midnight was the most suitable hour all the year round, all associations and traders present unanimously agreed that there should be no earlier closing than 11.30 p.m. all the year round.</P>
      <P>(3)  As life in the various counties and rural districts is completely different to those in the city, it was unanimously agreed that there should be a later opening for the areas outside the County Boroughs.  We feel, as the traditional closing hour is 12 midnight, any earlier closing will result in shebeens, drinking in crowded homes and private cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  In their official report of the recent Intoxicating Liquor Commission, all the commissioners (21) after hearing exhaustive evidence unanimously decided that the areas outside the County Boroughs should have 11.30 p.m. <Col N="987" /> closing hours on weekdays all the year round.</P>
    <P>I am,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Sgd.) T.S. O'Dwyer,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Hon. Secretary.</P>
    <P>That letter is relevant because it deals with the areas to which I propose this amendment to apply, namely, Dublin County and the rural areas generally.</P>
    <P>Another situation can arise if this change of hours is implemented. People who have been accustomed to visiting certain premises will be obliged to change their ways and go to other premises.  Is it fair to interfere with the private lives of such people by forcing them away from one premises to another?  This proposal of uniformity of hours was recommended on one occasion by a narrow majority of the Intoxicating Liquor Commission.  That majority was secured because of some misunderstanding. It had the effect, in fact, of reversing a previous majority decision in favour of the differential which exists.  Those traders who will be affected feel very badly about this proposal.  They believe that the manner in which that narrow majority was secured should be fully and fairly investigated, especially in view of the earlier majority decision in favour of the differential.</P>
    <P>These new hours will inevitably lead to abuses in relation to illicit drinking and to all the tragedies that follow from such drinking.  It must be admitted that there is a high moral standard in regard to drinking in this country and that is due mainly to our well-managed and well-organised licensed premises.  The same cannot be said with regard to private bottle parties, clubs and shebeens.  It has been suggested that late evening drinking has caused road accidents.  If one examines the statistics one will find that in the majority of accidents there was no question of any drink of any kind.  In Northern Ireland there is an earlier closing hour than we have here.  Out of a population of 1,000,000 there were 5,000 accidents <Col N="988" /> in one year.  In the same year, out of a population of close on 3,000,000 we had only 4,000 accidents.  It is quite obvious that the advantage lies on the side of the Republic as compared with Northern Ireland.  Again, the time at which most accidents occur is between 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock in the evening.  That would not seem to bear out the argument that drink is an important single cause of accidents.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a very significant statement was made by a prominent clergyman.  He alleged that the Guards have been instructed not to enforce the licensing laws in certain areas; he said that if the Guards dare to enforce the laws they are threatened by the local T.D.s that they will have them transferred to some other area. There would seem to be some ground for these remarks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already mentioned that the licensed traders and their staffs are well satisfied with the existing hours.  I would like to mention also that people were invited to give evidence before the Commission over the radio and through the newspapers.  Despite all these encouragements to members of the public only six members of the general public volunteered to give evidence.  That proves that the public in general are not dissatisfied with the existing licensing laws.  For that reason I am urging the Minister, if he is not prepared to accept the amendments, to so amend the Bill himself that it will leave the existing closing hours as they are.</P>
      <P>It has been stated in evidence by the Gardaí in relation to this matter that licensed premises in County Dublin are well conducted and are closed on time. The Gardaí should know because it is their responsibility to enforce the existing licensing laws.  We have had a statement in evidence from Deputy Commissioner Quinn in which he indicated that not one fatal accident took place in the last three years which could be attributed to the existing closing hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only associating these points with the question of closing.  Efforts were made to create in the public mind the impression that late drinking was the cause of a large number of accidents.  That argument has won sympathy from people who do not know the facts.  I am putting up these facts to show that there is no proper basis for that argument and that whatever case can be made for earlier closing it cannot be made on the basis of road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall conclude on that point.  I think that the proposals in the Bill are unreasonable, unjust and unfair to a number of reputable traders who will be put out of business if the hours proposed are adhered to and even if they are reduced below the time of <Col N="991" /> 11.30 p.m. which I have mentioned in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to intervene at any great length in this matter but I think the Government would be wise if they made the closing hour 11 p.m. all round.  They have done it for eight months of the year and if they made it 11 p.m. all the year round I think it would be very satisfactory.</P>
      <P>My main reason for getting up is to repudiate a ghoulish attack which has been made on two dead men by a Deputy in this House.  The statement was made that a Garda Sergeant was transferred from County Dublin for doing his duty.  That is not a fact. The fact is that a complaint was made about the manner in which that barracks was run.  The late Commissioner of the Garda fully investigated that complaint and told me himself that he had no option but to send that sergeant away from the station he was in.  I do not know what evidence was given but the inquiry was an ordinary disciplinary inquiry held by the Commissioner and I was assured by that Commissioner, the late Mr. Kinnane, that he had no option but to send that sergeant to the country.</P>
      <P>The Deputy who made that statement said that it was my late colleague, Deputy Fogarty, who was responsible for that.  He was not.  The Commissioner would never listen to any Deputy who was trying to shift a man for doing his duty.  It has not happened in the time of the present Minister for Justice.  I was Minister for Justice for 12 years and it did not happen in my time either.  The same Deputy made the statement that the present Assistant Commissioner, Mr. Quinn, would prove what he said.  He would do no such thing.  He must be well aware of the facts and is probably better aware of them than I am.  I got up to refute that ghoulish attack on two honourable men who are no longer alive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I found it necessary to put forward an amendment to insert in line 15 of the Bill, before the word &ldquo;June&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;May&rdquo;, and that that should apply to the rural areas as a whole.  We are trying to extend the tourist trade.  We have been trying to entice people to this country before the three months of June, July and August.  The rules in regard to closing hours could be applied to the five months May, June, July, August and September.  You could leave it at summer time, that is, the tourist season.  That would serve not only tourists but the ordinary people in the county boroughs or rural areas, towns, villages, and so on.  I am sure that the Minister will have no objection to that because it is a matter of only an extra month.  It will suit everybody and I understand that it is agreeable to all who are interested in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the closing hours, I speak only for myself.  Nobody has brought any pressure to bear on me to agree with the closing hours provided in the Bill or to suggest any <Col N="993" /> other hours.  I consider that the closing hours as they were were quite suitable.  From 10 a.m. until 10.30 p.m. should be quite long enough for anybody to get whatever drink he or she wants.  Some of the statements made in the House would suggest that we are a nation of people who want long periods in which to drink.  I do not think tourists come here to soak themselves in drink.  They have quite sufficient facilities in their hotels or wherever they stay for drinking.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into detail.  I am expressing my own personal view.  I have heard people discussing this matter.  They were not publicans.  I do not go out for a drink late at night unless, perhaps, I meet a friend. I prefer to treat people in my own house.  Some people have a habit of drinking late at night and after closing hours.  They should not be facilitated.  I am very glad that under this Bill, once the public houses are closed, they will not be reopened until the proper time the following morning.</P>
    <P>I agree also that the <i>bona fide</i> trade should come to an end.  That may affect certain people in the suburbs of Dublin.  They should have been able to foresee, when they set up in such a trade, that a time would come when the trade would cease.  That is a problem they must deal with in their own way.  From what I have heard of the <i>bona fide</i> houses in the vicinity of this city I have no doubt that they have made a good profit during their period of operation to compensate them for any ill effects they may suffer by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I suggest that during the period of summer time, the five months I have named, the closing hour should be 11 p.m.  I am opposed to 11.30 closing.  In order to go half-way with the Minister, I would suggest 10.30 and 11.  I think Deputy G. Boland made the same suggestion.  The Minister said that he was open to suggestions if agreement could be reached.  Personally, I believe that that is as far as we should go and I think that would be the view of publicans and various other people. My own personal view is that the hours should remain as they were.  I <Col N="994" /> recommend acceptance of my amendment, to include the five months of summer time.</P>

      <P>I would prefer Deputy Palmer's speech to Deputy Rooney's speech in which Deputy Rooney referred to a resolution passed by the Irish County Vintners Association during the course of which they recommended that the closing hour in the country should be 12 midnight.  It must be said that these people represent a considerable body of opinion.  I am not saying for the moment whether I agree with what they say or not.  I am merely pointing out that they cannot be regarded as an unrepresentative body.  There has been considerable representation also from the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.  If Deputy Palmer did not receive copies of resolutions from various branches of that Association, I cannot say the same thing.  I received not less than eight of them from various branches of the Association in County Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said before but I feel it only right to say again that so far as my constituency and county are concerned, that is not the case.  I should like to add that, in my opinion, based, first, on my own observation, secondly, on my discussions with publicans, thirdly, on discussions with wholesalers who supply <Col N="995" /> them and, fourthly, on discussions with representatives of the ordinary public, that there is considerably less drinking being done to-day in the West of Ireland than at any time previously.  There is less drunkenness and fewer cases of excessive drinking in the country, as a whole and in the part which I know well, than at any time before.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the new hours as laid down in the Bill, or whatever hours we eventually agree on will affect that downward trend in any way.  It has always been my personal belief that, if opening and closing hours were abolished altogether and publicans were told they could open any time they thought they might be able to make a profit, there would be still less drunkenness and still fewer cases of excessive drinking than now. I believe a time will come when such a law will be passed for everybody's benefit.</P>
      <P>The figures over the last few years might not appear to bear me out but it should be remembered that there has been a very big increase in tourism in this country since the war. It is clear from our revenue that the number of tourists is rapidly increasing. As a result, the amount of drink which is being consumed by tourists and which, of course, is included in the returns of the amount of drink consumed as a whole is covering up the fact that there is less drinking being done by the Irish themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the mere fact that we are now proposing to &ldquo;extend&rdquo; the hours in the evening means that we are giving twelve and a half hours instead of twelve hours for drinking.  Is it suggested that people go into a publichouse at 10 in the morning and stay there until they are pitched out at 10.30 in the evening?  What kind of nonsense is that?  If you go to any publichouse in a small rural town at 11 in the morning or at 3 or 4 in the afternoon how many people will you see there?  If there are people there are they not buying cigarettes or matches or something else?  Certainly in the West of Ireland in the summer months from May until about the end <Col N="996" /> of September they will drink after their day's work.  Having cleaned up they do not arrive into town until 9.30, 10 or sometimes 10.30 in the evening, and it is whatever length of time between then and the closing hour we fix that they will have for enjoying a drink.  I fully appreciate that these conditions do not apply in Dublin or in any other city or borough.</P>

      <P>That is the reason why there is such great difficulty in trying to frame proposals that will suit Dublin and Cork and at the same time suit the western seaboard.  It is virtually impossible, and if we accept that the principle of uniformity is a good one&mdash;and it has been accepted by all Parties though not by every member of the House and certainly not without reservation&mdash;we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that both the people in the country areas and the people of Dublin will have to do without some of the proposals they would like to have seen in their ideal liquor Bill.  I do not believe there is any such thing and I do not believe that any hours we now decide upon will be satisfactory to everybody or to every association.  All we can do is to attempt to strike a happy medium. Being a countryman, I should like to see the hour fixed at 11.30 p.m. all the year round which I consider a happy medium, certainly as far as the country areas are concerned.  I am backed up in that by the representatives from the Twenty-Six Counties outside the boroughs and by the experience of everybody who knows anything about conditions in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument which may be legitimately used against those who regard long opening hours as an incentive to drunkenness is the experience of other countries who have very curtailed hours and who have what, to our way of thinking, would be regarded as unnatural laws as, for instance, Australia where in some States the closing hour is 6 p.m.  My Australian friends will not, I hope <Col N="997" /> object if I refer to what they themselves call the 5 o'clock swill, or object if I say that the Australians are well known to be hearty and able drinkers. They admit that themselves but I merely quote them as an example to show that legislative attempts to curtail the hours to an extent which does not meet with the wishes of the majority of the people are bound to fail.  Therefore, if we are to succeed at all, we must try to fix hours which will meet with the approval of as many people as possible.</P>
    <P>I also believe&mdash;I have to look away from the Chair at the moment&mdash;that some publichouses should not be allowed to open at all unless they conform to certain minimum requirements regarding sanitation, and so forth.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Palmer's amendment which is to extend the late opening during the months of June, July and August for the period of Summer Time.  In introducing the Bill the Minister differentiates between what we may describe as summer months and the rest of the year because it is provided in the Bill that public-houses shall remain open during these three months until 11.30 and until 11 o'clock during the rest of the year.  I think the Minister should go a bit farther. We are endeavouring to extend the tourist season and I assume that the reason for differentiating between summer time and the rest of the year is because we have a number of tourists in the summer.  For instance, the month of September is a month which attracts a considerable number of fishermen to this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Nobody knows better than the Minister and Deputy Flanagan that we attract many tourists for May-fly fishing and also in April we have a number of tourists here because, except on rare occasions we have the festive season of Easter in April, and very often it coincides with the period of Summer Time.  If the Minister extends the 11.30 hour for the period to Summer Time he would facilitate visitors to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the last speaker.  The opposition to the late closing hours was that people had enough to drink from 10 in the <Col N="999" /> morning until 10 at night but people do not go into public houses at 10 o'clock and stay until 10 at night. I am not referring to the city of Dublin because I know nothing about it; I am referring to rural Ireland.  If Deputies on both sides of the House agree that Dublin should have earlier closing hours, well and good.  In rural Ireland 11.30 is early enough and I am prepared to accept that hour.</P>
      <P>We are inclined to forget that the major seaside resorts are on the southwest, west and north-west coasts, with the exception of Bray, Wicklow, Arklow and a few places like that.  We must remember we are 25 minutes behind Greenwich mean time.  In other words, we have at least a half-hour more daylight in the west.  As Deputy Palmer pointed out, I think, visitors do not come here to drink.  They come to fish, play golf, see the scenery, and go on hikes and they do not come back to their hotels until dusk.  They are entitled to, and they want to have a drink then.  I think 11.30 is very reasonable and I appeal to the Minister, so far as rural Ireland is concerned, not to give way on this matter.  He should stick to 11.30 and I ask him to extend it for the period of Summer Time and I suggest that it should be no earlier than 11 o'clock for the winter.  I cannot speak for the city and if city Deputies on all sides of the House suggest that public-houses should close a half-an-hour earlier than in rural Ireland, I would agree&mdash; it is a matter for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be an answer.  That is why we have this Bill. All over the country they are closing when they like and it is only in order to get respect for the law that the Minister wisely introduced this measure.  We secured no respect whatever for the licensing laws.  Instead of extending hours, in my opinion this Bill is curtailing them.  It will create some respect.  I know that the decent publicans of the country are anxious to close at a reasonable hour and 11.30 is reasonable, in my opinion, whereas 10 or 10.30 is not.  Publicans do not want to remain open until 12 or 1 a.m. <Col N="1000" /> We must think also of the unfortunate farm-labourer who during the Spring or the Summer is working every minute of daylight and he must have some refreshment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say they cannot afford it every night but they can afford it on certain nights when they go to the local public house. I think it was Deputy Corry who said it was their club.  They go on certain nights for two, three or four pints&mdash; whatever they can afford&mdash;but they cannot go until daylight is gone.  There are no trade union hours so far as farm labourers are concerned and God controls their hours of work.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble; some officials think that they can fix hours which do not coincide with the hours nature prescribes for farm work but the farm labourer is the first to appreciate that if needs be, he must work until 11 o'clock if he is to suit his employer and if he can help his employer he will do that.  He will stay until 11 o'clock because the majority of labourers are decent men who know when their employers are in &ldquo;a jam&rdquo; and want to help.</P>
      <P>It is for these people I am appealing. Give them an opportunity to get some refreshment just as others do when finished work.  In Dublin a professional man leaves his office at 5 o'clock, say, and goes in for three or four drinks before the evening meal. The unfortunate man in rural Ireland has no such opportunity until he gets home and gets washed and brushed. It is probably 10 or 10.30 by the time he gets to the public house and the amount he drinks is controlled by the amount of cash in his pocket.  If he has only 10/- to spend it is immaterial when he spends it so long as he is permitted to get in, but I am afraid if he is forced to take away a naggin or so in his hip pocket and probably drink it on the road, it is there that the damage is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support the amendment to <Col N="1001" /> include the month of May for late closing hours.  In doing that I think we would be doing a considerable amount of good for the tourist industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Palmer's amendment seeks to increase drinking hours.  I begin to wonder if we have lost the ability to reason or to count when we get Deputy after Deputy solemnly telling us that the present proposals do not provide for longer drinking hours.  I am afraid Deputies are making those remarks with their tongues in their cheeks.  If the present legal drinking hours were properly enforced they would not make that type of remark.  The statement that the proposals do not call for longer drinking hours must be viewed in the light of the state of affairs which has been admitted by every Deputy, including Deputy O'Donnell, to exist, namely, that the licensing laws have not been enforced or observed.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell was good enough to state he does not have any particular knowledge of the position in Dublin city and that he was speaking for the rural areas.  Deputy Séan Flanagan also dealt with this matter from the point of view of the rural citizen.  For many years the situation has existed here in which we had different hours for the licensed trade in the city and county borough areas and the rural areas.  To a great extent it is because of that fact that contempt of the law has been shown on all sides.  That has been contributed to not only by those paid to enforce the law but by those who solemnly legislate in Leinster House. I do not think there is any case for allowing licensed premises in the country and in the small towns to remain open until a later hour than those in the cities.  The case for opposing the proposed extension of the hours is as valid in the rural areas as in the cities because it is based on this simple proposition: are we to have no real regard for the interests of the community as a whole and are we to have no real regard for the position of those who attend to the alleged pleasures of the people who want to drink?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell spoke about <Col N="1002" /> tourists.  Thousands of tourists go no further than the east coast.  They all do not go fishing.  They all do not go to the West.  Many come to Dublin and the east coast resorts only.  Many of them are members of Irish families coming back here on holiday.  I do not think anyone has ever established that the reason they come here is because they want a drink.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is accepted as incidental that they may take a drink when they get here, no great case can be made for altering the law of the land merely on the basis of some incidental happening, yet that appears to be what we are doing.  Deputies from rural areas have been weeping salt tears about farm labourers. Deputy O'Donnell talked about a man's ability to drink being dependent on his ability to pay for the drink he consumed.  He suggested that at the end of the week a farm labourer might have 10/- or thereabouts to spend on drink.  Can any Deputy explain to me in simple language how a farm labourer with any family responsibilities could have 10/- for drink out of their present miserable wage of about £4 per week?</P>

      <P>I am afraid the city Deputy does not understand rural life, but the city Deputy can count.  The city Deputy can subtract 10/- from £4 and get £3 10.0.  One wonders how far that would take any family to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to extend the hours to 11.30 p.m. or 12 midnight.  Deputy Flanagan, I think, made some mention of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.  I am not a member of that Association, but I do not happen to drink.  Many Deputies here, both those who do not drink as well as those who do, appreciate the part this Association has played in bringing about less drinking amongst the youth of Ireland.  Its example and influence has been felt throughout the length and breadth of the country, both in <Col N="1003" /> the cities and small towns as well as in the rural areas.  An increasing number of Irish boys and girls are either members of that Association or are following its example and advice by refraining from undue indulgence in liquor.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Deputies in the House will agree with me that that is a good thing.  I think it is and, as long as I think it is good, and if Deputies agree with me that this development over the years is a welcome one for the benefit of the Irish nation, I believe we in this House should not lightly do anything which would undo that good work which has been going on, quietly and persistently, over the years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan tells us that there is less drinking in the West of Ireland.  Of course, there is less drinking in the West of Ireland because there are less people there now.</P>

      <P>Aside from the other effects stemming from those who support the Pioneer Association and other bodies, there is the physical fact that the West of Ireland has been losing its population year by year, and obviously there should be less drinking except, of course, from the point of view of drinking indulged in by tourists.  People who come to visit this country treasure more than anything else the spirit of hospitality, the spirit of friendliness, that they meet with in our cities and towns.  I do not mean by hospitality the connotation usually applied to that word. One can be very hospitable to a guest without offering him liquor.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be getting away from the amendment which deals with closing hours on weekdays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the position of tourists who may be here during weekdays.  The point was made that tourists were an inducement, a basis, and a good sound reason why the amendment should be approved by the House but, on that point, I want to <Col N="1004" /> say that I do not believe extending drinking hours will attract any substantial number of tourists.  Even if there were a case made for treating tourists as a special case I still feel it would not be of any great advantage to the country to extend the hours of drinking in order to attract a greater number of them.</P>
      <P>The effect of the proposal to increase the opening hours on weekdays to a large extent would dislocate ordinary family life in the City of Dublin, in Cork, and in my opinion, throughout the country.  I would suggest to Deputies participating in this debate that there is someone other than the drinker, someone other than the person who sells drinks, who must be considered.  At an earlier stage reference was made to the burden and hardship caused to those engaged in supplying drink, and when I refer to that aspect of the matter I am not only thinking of the people employed in licensed establishments.  Their problem, of course, would be serious enough because an extension of the present hours, on the lines suggested in the amendment, would mean that the workers concerned would not be able to leave their places of employment for at least anything from half an hour to an hour after the hour mentioned in the amendment.  In places where they are served by public transport that service would have ended before they were able to leave their work and they would have to use other means of getting home to their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to say a word about the family publican, the person running a business on his own, and the effects of longer opening hours on his family. Surely he is entitled to have some rest and recreation as well as everybody else?  Surely people like him must not be condemned to remain at the beck and call of their customers to a very late hour at night?  The suggestion has been made that it would be a good thing if the public houses remained open all the time, but I wonder would Deputies think it very nice if a decision were made that this House would sit day and night?  I think we would be very much annoyed about it, and to <Col N="1005" /> suggest that there should be no hours and that the matter would then resolve itself does not make sense.  Surely we have passed the stage that, just because somebody wishes to enjoy himself, other people must be very seriously inconvenienced?  If there were no hours surely the ordinary living habits and family domestic arrangements of many people engaged in the trade would be upset?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell told us about the farm labourer having to work until a late hour at night.  As far as I can see, as an ordinary city Deputy, year by year changes are taking place in the agricultural industry. Year by year there has been a slow increase in the use of mechanised implements used in agriculture and, year by year farm labourers, and even the farmers themselves, are gradually reaching the point where their continuance in the old traditional way of dealing with agricultural problems will no longer permit the industry itself to function.  Even on many of the richer farms today the farm labourer, to a certain extent, can be classed as a semi-skilled worker operating various types of mechanical and electrical appliances, and even to a person who only occasionally visits rural areas it is apparent that the incidence of farm labourers, not only being required, but having employment available to them in the evenings throughout the year, is very slight indeed.</P>
    <P>Even in the harvest when in many cases the work is done by contract and the farm labourers may not be involved, it is only during this short period of the year that these farmers are affected.  The only thing that emerges from this proposal is a suggestion that drinking hours should be longer.  I agree with Deputy Seán Flanagan that the people do not necessarily drink during all the hours that publichouses are open, that the average citizen does not go in at 10 o'clock in the morning and stay until 10 o'clock at night.  Possibly Deputies here will agree with me that in the city of Dublin the bulk of the tourists who come here may have a drink in the morning but most of them try to go to the seaside and if they have a <Col N="1006" /> drink or two in the evening they are quite satisfied.</P>
    <P>The proposal to have longer drinking hours on weekdays does entail drinking at a later hour and because it has been suggested that this hour of 11, 11.30, or even 12 o'clock, does entail that, the proposal will in my estimation cause serious hardship on those concerned with the supplying of liquor to the public, and to their families.  It will also affect the position of the ordinary citizen who takes a drink.  I have adverted before to the fact that the existing hours as they apply and are applied in the city of Dublin do have the merit that the drinker in winter time knows that the public house closes at 10 o'clock and knows that in summer time it closes at 10.30 and when the proprietor or the assistant says it is time to go, in the majority of the cases people are happy to finish their drinks and wend their way home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I would agree with is that I have not seen any evidence or demand for the extension of the hours.  I should like to conclude by saying that we agree entirely that the people engaged in the business for the purpose of making a livelihood have a case to make.  They have made representations but, having listened to their representations, we have the responsibility to express our view as to whether or not it is a good thing to extend the present hours on weekdays. In expressing that point of view, regard should be had by everyone concerned to the various aspects of the matters I have mentioned: (a) whether there has been any concerted or strong demand for an extension of the hours on weekdays, (b) whether or not it is correct that such an extension would cause hardship to those employed in the trade or to the family publican and (c) whether the extension of the hours will have an adverse affect on the ordinary family life of citizens both in the city and the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people in this country are fairly reasonable and amenable to suggestions <Col N="1007" /> and advice, but should the hours of drinking be extended as suggested, there would be in my opinion an immediate demand that additional hours should be worked by other categories of workers.  In the city areas particularly there would be an immediate demand on those engaged in public transport, upon many of those employed in picture houses and an immediate demand on those at present employed in restaurants where no liquor is sold and who normally can close their doors around 10.30 at night having satisfied their last customer&mdash;a demand that these places should remain open longer.  If we are to introduce a system in which the public houses in both city and rural areas are to open until 11 or 11.30, I feel that there will be an immediate demand that other services should also be extended so we are dealing not only with the question of those directly concerned in this Bill; we are dealing with a very large section of the community and it seems to me that, in the absence of incontrovertible proof that there is any necessity or demand for these extended hours, this House should refuse to grant them.</P>
    <P>I want to just make one final point. A suggestion was made by Deputy Seán Flanagan that if there were no restrictions on hours there would be less drinking; in other words, that if a publican were entitled to have his lounge bar, his private bar or snug open day and night there would be less drinking.  I submit to the House that the position of a person engaged in the supply of liquor whether as a publican, an assistant or an hotel proprietor, is very different from the position of those engaged in many other sections of the distributive trade.  In the case of other trades, if a shopkeeper wants to close his shop, at least he could in any case close that shop.  If he was a shopkeeper, who had dealt with his customers in a courteous and polite way the people would probably arrange to come earlier or on the following day.</P>
    <P>Can you, on the other hand, imagine the situation where at 11, 11.30 or 12 o'clock at night a public house is full, <Col N="1008" /> there is no legal obligation on the publican to close, and he says to the customers, some of whom maybe would have a deal more than was good for them: &ldquo;Look boys, I am fed up. I am going to close down and go out&rdquo;? I wonder what would the result be?  I think he would be a very brave publican, because he would not even have the protection of saying: &ldquo;I have to close; I am compelled by law to close.&rdquo;  He would have to deal with these people on the basis that he wanted to close.  If that situation is repeated <i>ad infinitum</i> in the city and rural areas I am afraid we will have no police force large enough to deal with the position.</P>
    <P>This proposal of overall longer hours is merely a face saver.  The <i>bona fide</i> traffic had to be dealt with.  Instead of facing the issue on that basis, the Minister has provided for an extension of drinking hours on week-days. Though most people have been guilty of flouting the law so far as drinking is concerned, the general public would have much more respect for this Parliament if we decided, at the instance of the Minister, to put an end to the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, and leave it at that.</P>

      <P>Listening to this debate one would think that the Coalition Government had not found it necessary to set up a Commission to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquor and bring about some uniformity in the trade.  One would think equally that the present Government, having received the report of that Commission, which sat for nearly a year, had taken no cognisance of the recommendations made, recommendations based on the evidence given by interested parties.  That Commission was a responsible and representative Commission.  Certain recommendations were made, and those recommendations are the concern of both sides of this House; and, as a result of those recommendations, the Government have submitted a measure for the consideration of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be generally accepted that outside of the city of Dublin the proposals suggested here are generally acceptable, with perhaps minor <Col N="1009" /> amendments.  Dublin is the cause of all the contention.  Our other cities are such that one hour's travel brings one out into the rural areas.  There is no difference whatever between the city centre and the county area and no good reason can, therefore, be advanced for a differential as between the two.  Dublin, however, is a big city with a large population.  If Dublin wants a differential as between city and county, why not give it to them, but only to an extent to which it will not clash with the interests of the country as a whole?  At present there is a differential.  At present licensed houses do not open in Dublin until 1.30 p.m. on Sunday.  In the country licensed premises open at 1 p.m.  There is a differential at the moment.  Why not continue the differential? If Dublin wants to be individualistic why not deal with affairs in Dublin in accordance with the wishes of Dublin representatives?</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin talked about the country areas and the advent of machinery.  Has he ever gone out and seen that machinery working into the late hours of the night to save the harvest?  Hours in country districts are exceptional so far as work is concerned.  Whether or not the farmer has machinery, the work has to be done; the crops have to be sown and saved.  The licensed trade in the country is mainly a family business.  The family works to accommodate their customers and not so that the customers will have longer hours for drinking, or anything like that.  The argument that the hours are exceptional does not hold because people can now drink until 12 o'clock at night if they travel 3 miles from their domiciles under the <i>bona fide</i> licensed trade.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to be members of temperance organisations or any societies they like.  These bodies are admirable in their own way.  One of the attractions which this country has to offer to tourists and others is not just the hospitality and friendliness of the people and their way of life; one of the greatest attractions is the freedom which exists in this part of the country.  Laws should be devised in <Col N="1010" /> accordance with the requirements of the people, and their wishes.</P>
    <P>The proposal is to make the hour 11.30 p.m. for four months of the year and the suggestion is that that should be extended to the summer months. Now 11.30 p.m. is really only 10 o'clock by the sun.  There is full daylight. Why not let the people work or relax during those daylight hours and afterwards meet together for the purpose of exchanging views, discussing fairs, prices, and the hundred and one other things in which they are interested? The more freedom people have the less cause there will be for complaint.  People naturally obey laws if the laws are reasonable.  If we accept the provisions in the Bill, giving Dublin a differential, if Dublin wants a differential, and giving uniformity over the rest of the country, we will, I think, be doing what the people want.</P>

      <P>The Minister emphasised two underlying principles when he introduced this Bill: (1) the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade; and (2) uniformity in closing hours.  I understood those principles were accepted unanimously.  Tonight, there appears to be a tendency to drift away from those principles and to introduce extraneous matters.  We are all anxious about the tourist industry.  No tourist comes in here merely for the purpose of drinking.  All tourists are anxious to fall in with our customs just as our people are anxious not to offend when they go abroad.  Extending the hours during which people can drink will not entice tourists in here.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;drunkenness&rdquo; has been used here.  I have never liked that word.  I would resent anybody accusing our people of having a tendency towards &ldquo;drunkenness&rdquo;.  I am very jealous of our good name.  We should be very careful that that word is not bandied about unduly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that this Bill is here shows the necessity for controls in this country and our aims should be to see that these controls would be as effective as possible and at the same time that they would be the least irksome. A good deal has been said about disrespect for the law.  It has been said that that disrespect has arisen out of <Col N="1011" /> the <i>bona fide</i> trade, out of the fact that a person can go three miles out into the country and drink all he wants while the person living next door to a public house dare not go in to it. That fact has made it impossible for Gardaí to enforce the law and it has made the people look on the law as a farce.</P>
    <P>I am entirely with the Minister when he says that the <i>bona fide</i> traffic should be abolished.  That traffic has given rise to abuses and these abuses are growing and will continue to grow with the advent of the motor car.  What is wrong with having uniformity of closing hours?  We should remember that in the Six Counties the closing hours on weekdays is 9 o'clock and there is no opening on Sundays.  We talk about closer integration between the Six Counties and ourselves and I think we should be prepared to make some sacrifice here in order to conform to conditions there.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating that we should close at 9 o'clock, but I say that the hour of 10.30 p.m. is late enough and that it should be the closing hour for the whole year round.  There is not a licensed trader in rural Ireland today who would not gladly forego the extension which he is allowed on week-days to open on Sundays.  Opening for a limited time, from 12.30 p.m. to 2 o'clock, and for a short time in the evening, would do away with a great many abuses.  Drink becomes a habit, and if the people are to be curtailed in their drinking hours now, they will soon conform to the habit of earlier hours and will become accustomed to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister at first said that he was not accepting these amendments and then he said that he had a certain sympathy with Deputy Russell's amendment.  Later he said that he would not agree to any of the amendments. I have listened to the whole debate and I must say, with all due respect to the Minister, that a much more forceful case has been made for the amendments than was made for the Bill itself.  The Minister said that all the old arguments had been trotted out and that nothing new had been said.  The old arguments were trotted out because they are irrefutable, <Col N="1012" /> because they still have force and because there is no argument against them.  They still hold good.  The Minister's defence is that the Bill embodies the recommendations of the Liquor Commission, but we must remember that the Commission itself had divided views and that two members of the Commission signed the majority report against their own better judgment in the interests of compromise.</P>
    <P>It is natural that there should be diverse views in this House.  I appreciate the fact that our Leader told us that we were free to debate the Bill and to vote on it as we wished in accordance with our views and experience.  That was an admirable permission to be given to us; it is a pity that it was not given all around so that we could get a true assessment of the views of this House and of the conviction of members with regard to the closing hours.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke said that I was a Puritan in this matter.  It is nonsense to talk of Puritanism in regard to a trade that can carry on from 10.30 in the morning to 10.30 at night.  I do not know what Deputy Burke meant because I have no personal interest in this matter at all.  Mention has been made here of pressure groups and we all got letters from different organisations but nobody approached me about this Bill.  I did get two letters from local Pioneer Associations after I had spoken on the Second Stage of the Bill but they did not affect me in any way.</P>
    <P>If there are pressure groups operating here and if Deputies are being approached, I think it wrong that that should happen.  The day that this House gives way to pressure groups is the day that democracy will fail in this Parliament.  We should approach this matter according to our own convictions and our own experience in the matter.  Life is changing very much in this country and certain conditions exist today that did not exist years ago.  It is our youth about whom we are most anxious, particularly those who may have to go abroad.  If they go abroad, having developed drinking habits here, it can be a disaster for them and a stain on the fair name of our country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> Deputy Corish mentioned the tendency there is for all our activities to drag on late into the night and I agree wholeheartedly on that.  That fact is obvious having regard to the hours at which this House sits.  I often wonder why it is that this House does not sit at 10.30 a.m. and work on for reasonable hours.  At that time men's minds would be much fresher. There is the tendency that all our social activities drag on later and later into the night.  If we are to have later opening hours, we shall find our social engagements going on longer and later to the detriment of our people.  Anybody who has to sit up for late hours knows that his efficiency is impaired the following morning. We all know that from personal experience.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain all dances are over at 12 o'clock and I cannot see why our people could not develop the habit of holding their dances earlier and finishing them at a reasonable hour. That would be all for the good of our social life and for the good of our young people.  If you are to have extended hours, you will have to consider the young people going to dances at night.  They will go into licenced premises and what condition they will be in when they reach the dance hall I hate to think.  I dread what would happen.</P>
    <P>Nobody has anything to fear from this Bill.  I have asked people in Cork and its environs who take a few drinks each night and they all tell me that the hours are far too long and that 10.30 p.m. should be the latest hour for closing on weekdays throughout the year.  I was very edified on hearing that.  Even those who drink late at night maintain that the hours are too long, that if the temptation did not exist they would not drink late into the night and spend their substance which is needed in the home.</P>
    <P>I suppose there will be a Traffic Control Bill introduced in the near future.  There will probably be references to drink on the occasion of that Bill.  To my knowledge and to the knowledge of Deputies from the south of Ireland, there were three cases of manslaughter in the courts there <Col N="1014" /> recently and in all three cases there was very glaring evidence that drink was involved.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that conditions here changed considerably in the last 30 years.  What obtained 30 years ago would not do at all now because of the increased travelling facilities.  Therefore, there should be insistence on respect for the licensing laws and the controls should be as effective as possible.  That may cause a little annoyance for a short time but the amendments, if accepted, will prove very useful and effective and will redound to the credit of our people and our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that so many groups have ever been concerned about any Bill as are concerned about this Bill.  There have been Bills of vital national importance in connection with which I tried to get the views of my constituents and interested persons.  I had to go out and look for them and in many cases the persons concerned did not know that legislation was going through the House.  This Bill is being treated as of great national importance.  I do not accept that view but I do accept the view that the licensing laws require amendment. At the outset, my view was that it was not the duty of the State to lay down the hours, that that was a matter to be worked out between the employers and trade unions.  If that were the case in Dublin and there were no restrictions as to hours the trade unions would lay down proper conditions for the workers and very few publicans would find it profitable to remain open after 11 p.m.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of shift workers.  There is a world tendency towards shift work and working around the clock.  With the advent of free trade in Europe, shift work may become an essential feature of life in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a bus driver who leaves his bus in Donnybrook after his last journey and feels like a drink. The State says he cannot have one because his bus is not garaged before 11 p.m., that if he wants a drink he <Col N="1015" /> must take it before he garages his bus or take one home with him.  If people drank for the sake of drinking, drinking should be abolished, but the majority of people drink for the sake of the social intercourse that goes with it.</P>
    <P>I thought at first that the next best thing was uniformity.  As I see it, the rural areas were anxious to remain open until 12 as they are doing now and the workers in the city public houses were saying that 10.30 p.m. would do.  A compromise was reached on 11.30, as recommended by the Commission.</P>

      <P>Yes, for the four months of summer, and 11 o'clock in winter.  I believe that a half-hour differential would not bring about the abuses that have been mentioned with regard to the <i>bona fide</i> system.  The city has grown beyond the <i>bona fide</i> areas.  Some people who transferred from the city come back to their old public house in the city where they meet their friends.  The fact that there is only a half-hour differential may lead them to take their drinks locally, which would be a good thing.  They could go out half an hour later, which might suit them better.  They could go to the local picture house and they could have a drink locally, and so on.  If there were a half-hour differential I cannot see people in some of the public houses in the streets off O'Connell Street getting into their cars and charging out to Templeogue, Goatstown or Coolock for the sake of ten minutes extra drinking time.  That would be absolutely ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people engaged in the <i>bona fide</i> trade have told me that the big rush is not when the city houses close; that Saturday night is their big night; that people start coming out about 9 o'clock; that there is no mad rush out such has has been described here. People just say, &ldquo;Saturday is our night out.  We will go out to Goatstown or somewhere like that and have a few drinks and come home at 11, 11.30 or maybe 12&rdquo;.  Most of the <Col N="1016" /><i>bona fide</i> houses around Dublin have been extremely well done up and have excellent amenities.  Some of them serve very fine meals.  Even if there were uniformity, many of these houses would still get a lot of trade because they are very attractive places.  At the same time, a compromise which would satisfy the workers in Dublin, the publicans and the rural people, of 11 in the city all the year around and 11.30 in the country all the year round, would be acceptable to everybody.</P>
    <P>I realise that the State is responsible for the welfare of the people.  My first view was that I did not think that this was a matter for the State to regulate.  I was very much in a minority in holding that view.  There was a long series of letters in the papers pointing out that there was more alchoholism on the Continent, where there is unrestricted opening. My answer to that is that you may have more alcoholism where the children drink wine instead of milk but it is very seldom that one finds a drunken man and, if one does meet one, you may bet your life he is a tourist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  My own view is that a man may drink a couple of pints of stout but as soon as the barman says, five minutes before closing, that the next should be the last one, the man says that he could never rush a pint, that he will have a small whiskey and he will have two or three or as many as are in the round.  If people do get drunk in public houses it is invariably in the last ten minutes.  That is why I thought that if a man could go into a public house and drink all night the factor that would decide his hours would be the money in his pocket. That is not to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that Sunday hours are not being discussed now but only the weekday hours.  I had a letter from the Reverend S.J. Dargan of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association of the Sacred Heart, dated March, 1960.  I had a letter on 2nd February, in which he made a mistake.  He sent <Col N="1017" /> me a corrected letter.  If it were the first letter I would say he would agree with the extended hours.  However, in the third paragraph of his corrected letter he points out that their representative on the Commission used all the influence he could, and he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>However, most of the main principles which we advocated were adopted in the Majority Report, and while our representative never wanted the prolonged hours advocated by other commissioners and pressed to have the hours shortened, he signed the report, taking into account the fact that unless he did so, there was danger that another and a less desirable report would be adopted as the Majority Report.</P>
    <P>In other words, I believe that the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association has achieved everything it sought at the outset.  The closing hour is a little bit later than they had in mind but their views are incorporated in the majority report to a greater extent than are the views of other people represented on the Commission.  At the same time it is quite obvious from the paragraph I have read that the main concern of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was to abolish the <i>bona fide</i> system as we know it to-day. I have not had the opportunity of finding out what their views are regarding the half-hour differential.  I think Deputy P.J. Burke suggested it earlier on in the debate.  Having thought about it I believe it would be a very good thing.  The amendment in the name of Deputy Rooney refers to rural areas.  It does not specify half an hour differential but that is the line along which I am thinking at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is probable that figures relating to accidents have already been given.  The Deputy who spoke previously referred to the closing hour in Northern Ireland as being 9 p.m.; I believe that sometimes it is 10 p.m.  In Northern Ireland there were 5,000 people killed or injured on the roads last year.  While the closing hours in the Republic are 11 p.m. in the city and 12 midnight outside the city, there were 4,500 people killed or injured, notwithstanding the fact that we have a much greater population. <Col N="1018" /> That, of course, defeats the argument that the <i>bona fide</i> traffic is causing a road hazard.  In the Republic in the last ten years ending December 31st last, 2,653 persons were killed in road accidents and in the last year alone in Britain 6,520 persons were killed in road accidents.  The position in London is that you can drink legally for 24 hours in the day, depending on where you are.</P>
    <P>That brings us back to the question of shift workers and other people in particular occupations.  Some consideration should be given to people in areas such as Ringsend where there are bakeries and several factories where employees work in shifts.  There is also the bus depot, and so on.  Some facilities should be afforded to such people leaving off work to assemble and chat about their day's work and have a drink before they go home probably to their breakfast and then bed.  The State says they may not have these facilities which are enjoyed by people working in ordinary jobs.  The shift worker and the man who works at night is probably doing more in the national interest than the man in the 8 to 6 job.  It is certainly a strain on his family and an upset to his household affairs, and it is a great pity something cannot be done to provide facilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>I was looking over the history of the licensing laws of this country.  The 1836 Intoxicating Liquor Bill provided that public houses must close at 9 p.m. on Sunday until 9 a.m. on Monday. That was amended in 1860 to read &ldquo;from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.&rdquo;  The 1872 Act laid down that public houses must close on Sundays, Good Friday, Christmas Day before 12.30 p.m. and between 2.30 and 6 p.m. and at 10 p.m. and on all other days before 6 p.m. and after 11 p.m.  There was a small variation in hours and a judge had certain discretionary powers in regard to licensing and could permit some houses to remain open until 12 midnight if a good case was shown for that, provided such houses opened one hour later than their competitors.</P>
    <P>Here again we see that the difference between the rural community and the city community was prevalent 100 years ago, and this difference, to my <Col N="1019" /> mind, still exists.  I believe the half-hour differential would meet the majority view.</P>
    <P>A great number of views have been expressed on this Bill.  I did not refer to holiday resorts at all.  I myself like to go to a North County Dublin seaside resort.  Having a wife and children, I like to go there in July because it is bright in the evenings up to 9 or 10 o'clock.  It is difficult to get the children to bed before that time and by the time my wife is ready to accompany me to the &ldquo;local&rdquo; to have a drink it is usually 11 p.m.  It is now provided that even in these holiday resorts you must be out of the public house by 11.30.  It was 12 o'clock heretofore.  A great many Dublin people go to Portmarnock, Malahide, Skerries, Rush and other places for their holidays.  It is their only luxury, the one thing to which they look forward from year to year.</P>
    <P>They are faced with the same situation&mdash;by the time they can get out to have a drink it is 11 or 10.30.  I would like the Minister to consider these matters before the Report Stage. I agree with the view that we must try to do away with the <i>bona fide</i> trade as it exists at present but at the same time I do not believe the small differential would renew any of the abuses of the past and therefore I would earnestly ask the Minister to consider the question before the Report Stage and perhaps an amendment could be agreed upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed my opposition to the extended hours provided for in the Bill on the Second Stage.  I see no point in repeating Second Stage speeches as I am afraid so many Deputies appear to be doing.  One can repeat the arguments against the proposals under discussion <i>ad nauseam.</i>  I am intervening now to inquire if the Minister has caused any inquiries to be made as to the possible effect of these extended hours on the cost of living, in particular on the prices of beer and spirits.  Organised workers in the licensed trade in Dublin&mdash;and they are very highly organised&mdash;have <Col N="1020" /> made it very clear that they are not prepared to operate the extended hours without increased pay.  Indeed it is expected that it will be necessary for the ordinary medium or large-sized public house to employ extra staff to operate these hours.</P>
      <P>The point of stout, which is the stable or national drink, at present costs 1/6d. which is quite a high price. I anticipate that as a result of these proposals the price of the pint of stout will very probably be raised within a year or a year and a half to 1/8d. or 1/9d.  I think there is no doubt that the price of a bottle of stout in the Dublin area will be raised to 1/- or 1/1d.  This is a very serious aspect of the matter which the Minister should consider very carefully.</P>
      <P>There is absolutely no demand from the Dublin public for opening hours in the summer until 11.30 at night.  I was very pleased to hear the last speaker, Deputy Lemass, and Deputy MacCarthy who spoke previously, suggest that Dublin is entitled to the half-hour differential and that the Minister can, in fact, give effect to his intention of doing away with the <i>bona fide</i> trade by keeping the public houses in Dublin open until 11 p.m. and leaving the 11.30 p.m. closing hour in the rest of the country.  I would urge him to do that if he can see his way to do so.</P>
      <P>I think the Bill falls down on the imposition of uniform hours on Dublin City and the country.  By no stretch of imagination can one draw any parallel between conditions and requirements in Dublin City and in isolated rural areas like West Cork, Kerry and the West of Ireland, where a very fair case can be made for extended hours.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made to-night of tourists.  Many, including myself, have already expressed our views on that point.  I fail to see why we should be expected to prostitute ourselves for the benefit of the tourist.  The tourists who would come to us for drink could scarcely be very many and we would be better off without them.  Before the Bill leaves the House I trust that the Minister will see his way to drop the proposal providing for the 11.30 p.m. closing in Dublin in the summer.</P>

      <P>We must bear in mind why we must now spend time on this legislation.  It is because of the pressure groups in Dublin who influenced previous legislation.  It is because of the differentials that were allowed then in favour of Dublin and other cities that we have the flagrant disregard for the licensing laws throughout the country.  I have heard a lot of &ldquo;tripe&rdquo; from Dublin Deputies. We were told about shifts, that the unfortunate men have to work after hours and late at night and that the buses will not wait for them, but there are about 100 public houses just outside the limit open every night until 12 o'clock.  They have workers employed and I never heard an argument from anyone about how those workers get home, but we have complaints from the pressure groups in the cities.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at Deputy Manley's attitude on early hours.  Surely the Deputy remembers the words of the national poet:</P>
      <P>The best of all ways to lengthen our days</P>
      <P>Is to steal a few hours from the night, my dear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have laws respected in this country we must remember that there has been no law so far as the licensed trade is concerned for the past 20 years. The legislation passed here was so rotten that nobody would or could respect it.  The results of that were given here by Deputy General MacEoin when he was Minister for Justice, when he told us what the position was in rural Ireland in regard to enforcement of the law.  We had that position then and we have it still; the law is completely ignored.  I have examined this matter as closely as I could.  There is a law in the country governing Summer Time; are we now to have a differential in that?  The law in regard to Summer Time treats as Summer Time the period from April to October.  Why not fix our legislation for the same period instead of two or three or four months, introducing another differential?  If we are to have Summer Time let us have it in accordance with the recognised Summer Time and not have a summer <Col N="1022" /> time brought in for this particular piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>That is how I look at the amendment framed by Deputy Palmer.  I think it is a very wise one.  We spent a lot of time going into this matter in the Intoxicating Liquor Commission and we were as reasonable as we could be.  The main object was to secure uniformity of hours.  If this House had any sense it could have solved practically this whole problem 12 years ago.  As Deputy Manley said, all that was looked for at that time was the couple of hours enjoyed by the &ldquo;buckshee&rdquo;<i>bona fide</i> fellow travelling out the three miles.  That is what this House refused 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin talked about the difficulty in regard to the employees in the trade.  This House got an opportunity of closing the doors of these licensed premises from Saturday night to Monday morning on the occasion of the second Bill I brought in here, but they trotted around the Lobby and voted against that too. They wanted to keep on the differential of the city man being open while the country boy was compelled to close.  That was one of the biggest insults ever offered to the rural community. It would be a good job if somebody took Deputy Larkin down the country and let him see the hours which the rural community have to work.  I guarantee that if he went down tonight, despite all the mechanisation he would still find plenty of fields in which there are tractors with their lamps lighting endeavouring to make up for the period of the wet weather.  Those people have their rights as well as the Dublin people. I have yet to learn that the Republic is confined to Dublin city alone, but that is what is looks like here.  The rural community have put up with this injustice for too long.  To the credit of the Garda, when they saw the injustice being perpetrated on the rural community, they would not fall in with it.</P>
    <P>I do not know what to say about the suggestion in regard to differentiation. The definite purpose for which the Commission was set up was to get uniformity of hours, and <Col N="1023" /> I think we should adhere to uniformity of hours now.  We have too much of this slipping in something for Dublin. Honestly speaking, I do not think even the Dublin people want it.  If there is any objection in Dublin City to opening after 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock, there is nothing to stop their organisations coming together and agreeing between themselves that they will close at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock. Let them do that but do not let them enforce their hours on the rest of the country.  We have no intention of putting up with it.  We have put up with it long enough.  It took 12 years to convert this Dáil to what is ordinary common sense.  I do not think a position exists now in which any pressure groups can exercise pressure on the rural representatives in this House to have the whole situation changed once more and the differential again introduced in regard to hours.</P>
    <P>I should like to support what Deputy Lemass said in regard to shifts.  This particularly concerns us in Cobh.  Some allowance should be made where men have to go to work at 8 o'clock at night and do not come out until early in the morning.  Such men, particularly those engaged in laborious work, men handling pig iron and standing over furnaces from 8 o'clock until 3 in the morning, should have some opportunity of taking a drink without breaking the law.  Some regulation should be made in their own areas under which that could be given to them.  I can see that the pressure groups are working as hard as ever.  I note that though they succeeded with their pressure 12 years ago, they were significantly silent when there was a proposal to close the Dublin city public houses on Sundays.</P>

      <P>The great pity about this Bill is that the entire House has not approached it in the same spirit as the Fine Gael Party.  Our Party are leaving it to the judgment, intelligence and commonsense of its members because they realise that a matter of this kind is one on which it is hardly possible to get all round agreement. On the question of the hours of closing on weekdays of licensed premises, <Col N="1024" /> I have yet to hear from the Minister for Justice, from any Deputy or from any interest outside the House any reasonable grounds for an extension of drinking hours.  I want to oppose bitterly, strenuously and determinedly anything in this section which will give an extension of drinking hours either in the city or the country.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the <i>bona fide</i> trade is about to end.  I have no sympathy whatever to offer to those interests who are asking members of this House to make the case that they have expended large sums in modernising their premises and making them attractive so that people may be able to drink in them until a late hour. Those people have already made sufficiently large sums of money out of the sins of unfortunate people without deserving any consideration from Deputies.  Who goes in to drink in the <i>bona fide</i> houses?  Is it the labouring men of the city or the country?  Is it the working class people?  It is the well-to-do people in their high-powered cars, displaying their jewellery and fur coats and probably drinking with other men's wives and <i>vice versa.</i>  The welfare of the entire community, and particularly that of the younger people, should be our primary concern and not that of any vested interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask whether any Member of the House can give a genuine reason as to why there should be longer drinking hours, or why the present hours should be extended by one second, much less an hour or an hour and a half.  The Minister for Justice tells the House, and indeed many Deputies, like the last speaker, brazenly admitted that a law passed by Dáil Éireann cannot be enforced in the country by the Garda Síochána.  There has been an admission from Deputy Corry a few moments ago that the Garda know that the laws are wrong and for that reason they are not going to enforce them.  I would like to hear from the Minister for Justice if that is the position and whether the Garda can take it upon themselves to determine whether laws should or should not be carried out in any particular area, and whether it is to be left to their own discretion to put the laws <Col N="1025" /> into effect given to them by this House to administer.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that the Garda are closing their eyes to the breaking of laws by licensed premises.  In my own constituency in the village of Shinrone there is a particular Garda officer watching his wristlet watch to see if he can catch a public house open five minutes past closing time, and reports of proceedings in the local district court can verify that.  I agree, however, that in other districts probably the Garda may have no reason to be quite so alert as they have in certain areas but, before going any further, I would like to ask the Minister for Justice to deal with this matter of the enforcement of the laws by the Garda.  To give the excuse that the licensing laws cannot be carried out effectively is all trash because, if we were to accept that as a fact, there are other laws just as unpopular which could not be enforced.</P>
    <P>The income tax laws are being carried out and enforced and they are no more popular than the licensing laws. The dog licensing law is enforced, though probably it too is not received with acclamation.  The School Attendance Act may not be popular with some sections of the community but nevertheless the law in that respect must be enforced.  People may not be clamouring to pay wireless licence fees but, nevertheless, the law says they must be paid and they are paid but here we have a particular law covering licensed premises, in which it has been admitted by the responsible Minister that in present circumstances it is not possible for the Garda to enforce it.  That is a horrid and disgraceful admission and it is a sign of weakness in any State for any admission of that kind to be made.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of talk about tourists and to some Deputies they seem to be the main concern in pleading for longer drinking hours.  The tourist industry is probably our best and most important after agriculture, but I do not know the tourist who comes into the country for the purpose of spending late nights and early mornings in public houses.  Tourists come here from Northern Ireland where the <Col N="1026" /> public houses close at 9 o'clock, sometimes 10 o'clock, and where there is no opening at all on Sundays.  That is the law of the Orangemen's Government and the Unionists' Government. Tourists come from England where the licensed premises are closed much earlier than here.  Tourists also come from the United States where one-fifth of the States, by option, are dry.</P>
    <P>During the great Olympic Games in Australia when sportsmen from all over the world arrived in Melbourne there was no such thing as an extension of the drinking hours.  There public houses close at 6 o'clock sharp and they were not concerned to provide an extension of the hours during the Olympic Games.  Indeed, in the greater part of Australia licensed premises are closed at 6 p.m.  Australia closes them at 6 p.m., Northern Ireland at 9 p.m., Great Britain from 9 to 10 p.m., but that will not do the Irish.  We want 11 p.m. or 11.30 closing and I would like to know from the responsible Minister what case has been put up that has satisfied him because, to tell us that the Garda cannot enforce the law, is weakness on the part of any Government, and a Government that has to admit that is unfit to administer any law passed by this House.</P>
    <P>I wonder did the Minister for Justice satisfy himself as to the views of the Hierarchy and the Irish Bishops on the question of drinking hours because I feel there are Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who, if they were given the opportunity of a free vote, would do as Deputies are doing on this side of the House and deal with this question in accordance with their own consciences and common sense, and that there are many Deputies in the House who may be considerably influenced by other reasons, though not by the fact that the Garda cannot do their duty, and not by the fact that maybe some tourists come here who want to enjoy late drinking.  Tourists come here to enjoy Irish hospitality, to fish and to shoot, and we can offer them the world's best in lake views and mountain scenery, and thank God that He did bless us with such wonderful <Col N="1027" /> attractions for tourists.  I am sorry the picture is being painted that they only come here to drink late and I feel that is no case whatever for an extension of the drinking hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to deal with the fact that reference has been made to this question by the Irish Bishops, and I feel it is no harm to place on record that in the statement issued on 23rd June, 1959, by their Lordships, the following text will be found:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> The abolition of <i>bona fide</i> trading if carried out, may be beneficial, but the benefits accruing from the change must be very seriously diminished by the recommendation to extend the opening hours all over the country on week-days from 9.30 a.m. to 11 p.m. (with a break of one hour, 2.30 p.m. 3.30 p.m. in County Boroughs only) and on Sundays from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.</P>
    <P>It cannot escape the attention of any responsible person that a relaxation of the law must seriously affect our people, more especially the youth of both sexes.</P>
    <P>Increased facilities for obtaining intoxicating liquor by the extension of the general opening hours will inevitably lead to a greater extension of alcoholism which in modern conditions has most serious moral and social effects in the increase of delinquency and in widespread danger to life on the roads.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that representatives of both the licensed trade and of the trade employees did not favour an extension of the hour for closing.</P>
    <P>The Irish Bishops express that opinion and before I make further reference to it, lest anybody in this House might say that to quote from the Bishops on this matter is making the issue very much one-sided, I would like to quote from a communication from the Dublin Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland which says the Temperance Agent and Temperance Council wish to register the strongest possible protest on the proposed legislation, particularly that dealing with the extension of drinking hours.  So here we have the Irish Bishops expressing an opinion that it is a danger particularly to the young people of this country that the temptation should be there for them to drink any later than the hours at present in force.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if Deputies prefer to play up to a few miserable votes in their constituencies or whether they are prepared to swim with the popular tide and stand over the teaching <Col N="1029" /> of the Catholic Bishops as Catholics in a Catholic Parliament.  That is what has been forgotten in this case. But we can go on to say that one of those Bishops, His Lordship the Bishop of Galway, is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of February 22, 1960, as having referred to longer drinking hours.  He said that some people spoke as if the only effect of longer drinking hours was to enable holiday-makers to enjoy themselves with a harmless, if not always tuneful sing-song, but longer hours would mean longer drinking, and the traffic in drink was not like a fish and chip business where a man stopped when he had taken enough.  It had been said that the existing regulations were not enforced because they had not the backing of public opinion but there were other laws concerning taxation and finance which were enforced with greater rigour, and enormous fines were imposed without any regard to public opinion.  That is a statement made by the Bishop of Galway.  Here we have men responsible for guidance in matters of this kind and their advice being ignored completely by the legislation which is at present coming forward in this House on which Deputies are anxious to get into the Division Lobbies and vote, legislation which will not be in the best interests of the young people of this country.</P>
    <P>The Bishop of Galway goes on to say in the same statement that the existing licensing laws were not enforced, nominal fines were imposed and names concealed because the Guards received instructions not to enforce the laws.  He continued that because the Guards did their duty they were reported by T.D.s to higher authorities and the authorities took some notice of these reports.  I think that statement with particular reference to the licensing laws, should not be allowed to pass without some comment in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the licensing laws cannot be enforced at present, how can they be enforced by extending them?  The question has been raised <Col N="1030" /> here by an admission of failure on the part of the Guards to enforce the licensing laws and close public houses at the time specified by the laws passed by this House.  It has been admitted here by an Irish Bishop that where the Guards close public houses at the correct time, complaints are made to T.D.s with detrimental results to the Guards who do their duty.  I want to make it clear that no Fine Gael T.D. participates in activities of that kind. It may be a matter for a certain amount of laughter from the Fianna Fáil benches.  It is quite true, and I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Bishop of Galway, that there have been numerous cases, despite what Deputy Boland said, where there has been an effort by the Guards to enforce the laws and, because there was, they found themselves at the back of beyond.</P>

      <P>The 22nd February, 1960.  I fail to understand why an effort is being made to ignore, and trounce upon the expressed opinions of the people whose duty it is to give guidance and advice on legislation of this kind.  I cannot understand for one moment why, particularly on these opening hours, that the recommendations to which I have referred have not been given more consideration and acted upon.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask for a clear statement from the Minister for Justice as to why he ignored in the legislation the recommendation of the Bishops; why the Government as a body ignore that recommendation; and what weight they gave to that recommendation of the 23rd June, 1959.  I feel that a Deputy ought to have the common courage and pluck, and that is why I raised the matter, to ask for an explanation as to why the Bishops' recommendations have <Col N="1031" /> been ignored.  I shall leave it at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if I may make reference to the fact that there have been statements here to the effect that there were pressure groups at work in this regard.  I do not know what movement has been referred to as pressure groups but, as far as I am concerned, there have been no pressure groups at work.  If communications have been addressed to Deputies by the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, it was an expression of opinion on the part of that Association and was sent for the guidance and information of Deputies. I feel that where an Association of such dimensions was prepared to give advice and guidance to Deputies they should at least receive an expression of thanks and not be the object of bitter criticism for offering their advice on a matter of this kind.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noel Lemass made reference to fatal accidents.  No matter what case Deputy Lemass may make, the Minister for Justice can have the information at his disposal that quite a number of fatal accidents have occurred because, as Deputy Lemass pointed out here, if a person is going to get drunk&mdash;and he used that expression&mdash;late at night in a public house, it takes place during the last 10 minutes. What will stop them drinking during the last 10 minutes under this new proposal?  There is ample evidence available that in the last ten minutes the customer, instead of taking his bottle of stout or glass of ale, switches, as Deputy Lemass pointed out, and takes, to use his own words, &ldquo;two or three small whiskies&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass stated that during the last ten minutes the customer switches over because he feels he will get down the two or three <Col N="1032" /> small whiskies with greater ease and speed than he would the bottle of stout or the glass of ale.  If he consumes three small whiskies in that ten minutes I respectfully suggest he leaves the public house in an unfit condition to drive a motor car and he is the type of man who, in many cases, slaughters other unfortunate users of the road. I would suggest that where a publican gives drink in the last ten minutes to a person already under the influence of drink&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am strongly opposed to this extension.  I wish it to be placed on record as an expression of my opinion that the hours of drinking on weekdays are sufficiently long at present and there should be no extension of any kind, an extension which can only have the result of putting our young people in temptation and inducing them to spend their time and their money consuming intoxicating liquor until late hours in the night.  That is most undesirable and I hope the House in its wisdom and after calm consideration of all the facts will be prepared to take the advice that has already been offered in this regard by the greatest possible authority in the country, namely, the Hierarchy.  Their advice should be taken.  It is advice to which more <Col N="1033" /> consideration ought to be given than has been given so far in this Bill.</P>

      <P>If Deputy O.J. Flanagan holds himself out as the interpreter of the Bishops, I suggest he might direct his interpretation to some of his colleagues who have expressed themselves as having different views on this matter.</P>
      <P>This Bill&mdash;this has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>&mdash;has been brought in here as a result of the report of an independent Commission which not alone examined the matter in all its aspects but also heard a large body of evidence in relation to the matter, including evidence on the hours that are now in issue.  It is idle to talk about members of the Commission holding divergent views on this issue.  The fact is that a majority of the Commission came to a certain conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the recent report upon which this Bill is based, it might be both wise and profitable for some Deputies to have a look at some of the <i>obiter dicta</i> contained in the 1925 Report&mdash;the report of a commission which sat in 1925 to consider our licensing laws.  It would be wise to keep some of the matters which arose <Col N="1034" /> then in mind as set out by that Commission in regard to the objectives we should aim at in legislation of this character.  On page 2, paragraph 3 of the 1925 Report it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In the first place we desire emphatically to point out that temperance legislation has succeeded in the past only so far as the willingness of the community involved has permitted it to succeed.  The essential functions of the law are to preserve order, maintain justice, and protect the community.  It is not the function of the law to make people good. Whenever it tries to do so without general public support it fails.</P>
    <P>This Commission also mentioned something else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure you, Sir, that I propose to make this very relevant to the hours set out in this Bill inasmuch as they are the hours, I believe, which are most likely to command general public support.  On that proposition, unless we get a measure from this House which will command general public support the law will not be enforceable.</P>
      <P>It has been alleged by the protagonists of restricted hours that extended hours will lead to greater drunkenness.  At page 3 the 1925 Commission reported:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right to interfere with the drunkard is the right to interfere with a public nuisance, but this right does not entitle the law to prohibit or unduly restrict the satisfaction of a natural and legitimate appetite by reasonable and moderate men who do not abuse their rights.  The ideal to be aimed at therefore seems to us to be a system of law which will secure good order and remove the abuses <Col N="1035" /> connected with the consumption of an article, the use of which may be voluntarily abandoned, but cannot be forceably suppressed.  It is, moreover, abundantly clear from all human and legislative experience that there are limits to the compulsory suppression of drinking, and that when carried beyond those limits it defeats its own object by tending to promote more injurious forms of excess as well as evasion of the law by common consent. These are the principles which have guided us in our proceedings and underlie the recommendations of this Report.  In short, we are satisfied that it is necessary to enforce reasonable restrictions on the trade in intoxicating liquor and that these restrictions must be based upon consideration for the necessities of public order, public health and public safety.</P>
    <P>I think, that we have proved what that Commission stated in its report.  I was in this House when the former licensing legislation went through.  On that occasion, too, there was much talk of a free vote of the House and there was a free vote allowed on many amendments to that legislation.  The result was that instead of the Bill which was introduced and which would have been workable had it emerged as it was introduced, we had different views expressed by different Deputies and we ended up with legislation which was neither fish, flesh nor good red herring.  That legislation has proved to be entirely unenforceable, and I think that is known to every Deputy who represents a rural area.</P>
    <P>I have said that in my view that on this occasion we should be very careful and that we should endeavour, in so far as we can, to put a workable Bill on the Statute Book.  Deputy Palmer's amendment is not, to my mind, of very grave importance to rural Ireland.  There is the view, I know, that we should strive to have summer time, as the country people call it, extended further in this Bill. There is a distinction in the existing laws between closing time during summer time and during the rest of <Col N="1036" /> the year.  At the moment closing time is 10.30 p.m. in summer time and 10 p.m. for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>Summer time lasts from the third Sunday in April to the first Sunday in October although I am told that it begins earlier this year because the third Sunday in April is Easter Sunday. We came to the conclusion that the distinction between summer time and winter time was not the correct one to make.  Deputy Palmer would like to have these hours in existence for the month of May and he made the case on behalf of rural Ireland on that issue.  Taking one thing with the other, I think that there is not the same necessity for the extended time in the month of May that there is the following months.</P>
    <P>If we could get from the House as much agreement as possible on this matter and if we could get some kind of uniform hours I think we would make some progress.  I think it is demonstrably true that the people who sat on this Commission representing the Total Abstinence Association accepted the Majority Report of the Commission for the reason that they felt that in our circumstances it was the most likely one to be enforceable and accepted by all our people.  I am quite sure that they also had in mind that earlier closing hours would not be acceptable and that they would lead to other abuses, the abuses which we all know are taking place.  It was for the purpose of getting a workable measure that these men subscribed to the majority view of the Commission. It was not because they liked it but because being reasonable men they felt it to be the most workable solution and the most reasonable one in all our circumstances.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies on the opposite benches have been extolling the view that it would be a good thing for the Government to have a free vote on this issue.  I take the opposite view and I take it very seriously.  I am sorry that the Opposition groups have decided not to take a majority decision representing the majority view of each Party.  I think that our work as far as this Bill is concerned would be much easier if they had followed <Col N="1037" /> the usual practice.  I would like to point out to Deputies how difficult it is for the Government and for anyone listening to the debate to get what might be described as a common denominator of the majority view of this House.</P>
    <P>If we take the amendments which have been tabled and which we are now discussing we have Deputy Cosgrave in his proposals asking that the closing hours in the country should be 11.30 p.m. from June to September and 11 p.m. from October to May.  For the city he asks that the hours should be 11 p.m. from June to September and 10.30 p.m. from October to May. Deputy Ryan of the same Party tables an amendment expressing the view that in the country the hours should be 11.30 p.m. from May to September and 11 p.m. from October to May but in the city he wants 11 o'clock from June to September and 10.30 p.m. from October to May.  Deputy Manley, again from the same Party, has an amendment that the closing hours should be 10.30 p.m. all the year round.  Deputy Rooney, also from Fine Gael, advocates 11.30 p.m. in the country throughout the whole year and he wants 11.30 p.m. in the city from June to September and 11 p.m. from October to May.</P>
    <P>If we take the other Parties, we have Deputy Norton of the Labour Party whose view is that closing hours should be 10.30 p.m. all the year round while Deputy Larkin wants 10.30 p.m. in rural areas from June to September and 10 o'clock from October to May. Deputy Russell, an Independent Deputy, has an amendment for 11 p.m. all the year round.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In that amendment he seems to be supported by the Leader of the Opposition.  With this whole conglomeration of hours and all these diverse views it would appear that there are no two people on the Opposition benches who hold the same view. That is why I say it would certainly be more helpful to the Government if the majority view of the Deputies in these <Col N="1038" /> different Parties were expressed.  It is quite obvious that we cannot have a licensing Bill providing for all the different views that I have read out here.  One would want to schedule and provide a special licensing law for practically every public house in the country.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the various views expressed by Deputies in the House, and views expressed outside the House, I feel strongly that the hours set out in the Bill are the hours that would command the greatest support generally.  I do not believe that one half-hour will make any great difference in rural Ireland but, keeping in mind our experience and the habits of our people, particularly in rural Ireland&mdash;like other Deputies I do not profess to know the problems in Dublin city or the habits of the people there&mdash;I am of the opinion that the hours set out in the Bill are those most likely to command general support throughout the country.</P>
      <P>If we do not have that general support, it is useless to pass a licensing law.  One cannot hope, by writing legislation in this House that, in the main, is unacceptable to the people to enforce it unless one is prepared to put a civic guard outside every public house in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>A Deputy asked for some information as to whether facilities were being provided for people engaged in special trades, late workers, and so on.  That law is a very old law in our code and has been availed of mainly by fishermen in certain ports. That is provided for in this Bill and will be continued under this Bill.  I call it a general exemption order for these special purposes.  I do not know what the technical expression for it may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be continued under this legislation and I assume that, as formerly, the court will have power, where the local circumstances arise, to give special facilities for late night workers or fishermen who come in there at night. <Col N="1039" /> That has been the position in Deputy O'Donnell's constituency, in Killybegs, and in my own constituency, in Achill Island.</P>
      <P>Taking all the various and conflicting views expressed by Deputies, mainly from the opposite side, I cannot see any hope of getting agreement on a measure here.  Taking one thing with another, the summer period and the hours laid down in the Bill as it is, I think we could debate this for the next two years here and, judging by the views I have heard expressed, we could not get anything more acceptable than what is in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would say on behalf of the Government that whatever has been said on this Bill will be considered between now and Report Stage but, from the diversity of views expressed here, it appears to me that the Minister would have no option now but to insist on the hours set forth in the Bill.  The Minister and the Government will have an opportunity of considering the suggested differentials but, in the main, I can see no option but to ask the House to reject this multiplicity of diverse amendments that have been tabled on the question of hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to have to raise the subject matter of Question No. 30 on the adjournment tonight, but in view of the unsatisfactory nature of the Minister's replies to a series of questions to date I have no alternative.  This question related to the proposal to errect a pier at Castletownbere, County Cork.  I need scarcely remind the House that Castletownbere is one of the major harbours in southern Ireland, and the condition of the existing pier has been engaging the attention of many people for some time.  The local fishermen and others using the pier have again and again expressed the opinion that it is likely to collapse, that it is unsuitable for reconstruction and that the only thing to be done is to demolish it and erect a new one.  In order to secure approval for that contention the fishermen and the other local people who use the pier have approached various public representatives and also the Minister's Department asking for early approval for their scheme.</P>
      <P>This matter has also been discussed on various occasions by the local authority, Cork County Council.  They were of the opinion that it would be more satisfactory to erect a new pier rather than reconstruct the old one. With that view in mind I addressed a question to the former Minister for Lands, Deputy Childers, on the 4th June, 1959.  I called the Minister's attention to the state of this pier and to the many representations made by local parties and indeed by foreign agencies as well, because I would remind the Minister at this stage that not only is this pier used by many local people but it is also used by foreign trawlers from France and Spain.  The Minister at that time was of the opinion that the existing pier could be renovated and he indicated he would communicate with Cork County Council on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result the Cork County Council received a report from their technical advisers that it was essential to do something with Castletownbere pier immediately.  If the council were to carry out improvements or reconstruction a sum of some £4,900 would be necessary, and it was made quite clear that the expenditure of that amount of money would only do a very small job of work, which would not last very long and would be entirely a temporary measure.  The members of the council, having examined this question closely and diligently, and having had further technical advice, decided it would be a waste of public money to spend almost £5,000 on the reconstruction of this pier when their technical advisers <Col N="1045" /> were of opinion that it should be demolished within a short number of years in any case, and replaced.</P>
    <P>With that in mind the Cork County Council sent a deputation to the Minister for Lands some months ago to explain to him in detail the state of Castletownbere pier and to stress the seriousness of the position that was arising there.  I need hardly remind the House that if Castletownbere pier were to collapse, serious loss of life could be incurred and, if such a misfortune should happen, the Minister will appreciate that all the public representatives from that area would be indicted and indicted very severely. We called on the Minister at his office in Leinster House and we gave him a complete picture of the position.  We told him that it was the considered opinion of the local people in Castletownbere that the pier should be demolished and replaced.  We told him that Cork County Council had agreed that opinion was correct and we asked him to review this matter as early as possible and send us a reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us that a Swedish consultant had been engaged by the Board of Works and that he, with a number of other technical advisers from that office, was making inspections of major harbours in Southern Ireland and that one of the piers being examined was Castletownbere. He expected that in the not too distant future a report from that consultant would be available to him and he assured us that, as soon as that report was received in his office, he would have it dealt with immediately and communicate as early a decision as possible to the Cork County Council. When asked by the deputation when it was likely that the report would be received, he anticipated that it would likely be at hand early in the month of January and he was quite satisfied that before the Estimates meetings of the Cork County Council would take place in March the report would be available to the Council.</P>
    <P>As representations from local quarters were renewed, and vigorously renewed, and as the Minister's report had not come to hand in the month of January, as was anticipated in our <Col N="1046" /> consultations with him in his office, I addressed a question to the Minister on the 11th February and I want to remind him that the 11th February is exactly six weeks ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell the Minister all what I said today as I proceed. On that date I asked the Minister:</P>
      <P>whether he has received a report from his technical advisers on the proposal to erect a new pier at Castletownbere; and, if so, if he will indicated the action proposed to be taken.</P>
      <P>In the course of his replies the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I understand a report has now been received in the Department and is under examination by the people concerned.</P>
      <P>Surely the reasonable interpretation that I, or any other member of the House, got from that statement was that the report was now available in the Minister's office and was being examined by the responsible authorities? There were a number of supplementary questions on the 11th February and finally I informed the Minister that if a report were not made available to the county council within a reasonable time I would renew the question.  Today I asked the Minister for Lands:</P>
      <P>Whether he will indicate his decision on the report received from his technical advisers on the proposal to erect a new pier at Castletownbere.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>I have not yet taken a decision on this matter.</P>
      <P>I then asked him:</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicated when he will take a decision on the matter?</P>
      <P>and the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>I cannot indicate that at this time.</P>
      <P>I then asked:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister not aware that he <Col N="1047" /> informed a deputation from Cork County Council that a decision in this matter would be taken possibly in the month of January and would be communicated to the council in time for its Estimates meeting in March?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The Deputy is completely misstating the facts.  I stated no such thing.  I stated that a decision would be taken when we would get the report from the expert which we were awaiting and when it would be examined.  At that time we did not have that report.  We have just received it now.</P>
    <P>I then asked:</P>
    <P>Is the Minister not aware that he informed this House almost two months ago that the Report was then available?</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Deputy is again inaccurate. It was not two months since he put down this question.</P>
    <P>I amended this to six weeks, which was the correct time, and then the Minister made a very peculiar reply. He said:</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago the report was received.  I had not then seen it. I have seen it since and it is still under examination.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister's contradictory statements in this House today and on the 11th February indicate quite clearly that his statements are untruthful.</P>

      <P>Surely if a Deputy who raises a question on the adjournment suffers a loss of five minutes, the Minister in his reply should bear some of the loss in the time allocated to him?  I do not know whether there is any Standing Order on it but the Minister has 10 minutes in ordinary circumstances and the Deputy has 20 minutes.  Surely there should be a compromise?</P>

      <P>I am sorry to say that today the Minister's attitude seemed to be, to put it mildly, rather petulant.  I hope that when he replies he will make some apology for the attitude he displayed on this very important question of the provision of a pier for Castletownbere.  I regret that the Minister has not given this matter the attention we thought he would give it when we appeared before him on the deputation.  With the short time at my disposal I am making a <Col N="1049" /> very strong plea to the Minister here this evening that he should reconsider his decision in this matter, that he should deal with this report which is now available in his Department, expeditiously and send along to the Cork County Council without further delay approval for the construction of the pier at Castletownbere.</P>

      <P>On this matter, we had better get the position clear for the record.  First, I want to refer to a meeting with the deputation that I received from Cork, including the Deputy, on the 12th November, 1959, and I wish to refer to an <i>aide memoire</i> made by one of my officials who was present at the time:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In reply, the Minister stated that he was awaiting the report of the Harbours Consultant.  When the report was available he would give it immediate consideration but the deputation would appreciate that he would have to examine it in the light of the over-all national circumstances.  The natural advantages of Castletownbere impressed him.  He noted, however, that landings of fish there were largely made by visiting boats.  He also noted that the county engineer had stated 12 months ago that the jetty was not in danger of collapse but apparently the position had changed in the interval.  The Minister agreed that it would be inadvisable at this stage to incur any heavy expenditure at Castletownbere at the present time.  He would deal with the expert's report as quickly as possible and the Government's decision on the over-all position would be taken without delay.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was made clear to the deputation, of which the Deputy was a member, that at this stage we had not received Mr. Burke's report at that time and that when the report was received it would naturally have to be examined and the Government's decision taken on the matter.  This report, I should say, arises from part of the major economic policy of the Government <Col N="1050" /> and was made subject to the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> from which I quote to put this matter in its proper perspective:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are many small piers and harbours none of which, however, was designed as a modern fishing harbour.  There is an outstanding need for five or six specially developed fishing harbours with good berthage, depth of water, and quays equipped with modern facilities for unloading, for the manufacture of ice and the processing of fish meal and oil.  A Swedish consultant has been engaged to advise on this matter and when his report has been received a development programme will be undertaken.  Many other possible landing places will also be improved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Bjuke, the expert brought in under that provision of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> published by the Government, had to examine practically all the ports that would be suitable in the whole of this country round our coast and in fact his detailed examination comprised an examination and report on 56 ports in this country. When this deputation was received by me I did not have this report.  I told them we expected to have Mr. Bjuke's report round about January.  We in fact got it about the first week in February.</P>
    <P>Mr. Bjuke's proposals were on the whole 57 of the ports which he had examined.  That report had, of course, to be scrutinised and examined by the officials of my Department.  In particular the technical proposals made by him had to be examined; some have still to be examined.  It would appear to be suggested that a matter of this kind, not deciding whether this particular part should be in or out but deciding the whole national picture involving an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds, should be decided by me with one stroke of the pen without a full examination.</P>
    <P>The Deputy comes along to the attack, if I may call it such, on the 11th February in this House when he put down the question to which he himself has referred.  The Deputy suggested <Col N="1051" /> that I had the report because I stated in my reply that the report was received in my Department and was under examination but that I had not yet seen it, and that was the position at that time.  He again comes along with his question today.  So far as he quotes from what was said today I only want to correct him in one thing. I repeat, of course, that he was inaccurate when he wanted to build up this picture of delay.  He started off with the proposition that he had this question down in the House two months ago.  That was not so as has been admitted now by himself.  The question was on the 11th February.  He also made the allegation here as to what I was alleged to have said to the deputation which I received.  I have now put on the records of this House what was said to the particular deputation and that they were told&mdash;that when this report was received it would be examined without any undue delay but that we would naturally have to have it examined when we received it from the expert concerned, Mr. Bjuke.</P>

I want again to put it on record here that when his question of the 11th February was put down to me although the report was received by the engineers and technical staff of the Fisheries Division I had not yet seen it, nor did I have any time to study it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> Again, let me make clear, it was a report dealing not only with Castletownbere but with 56 different harbours in this country.</P>
    <P>The Deputy evidently thinks, for some reason of his own, or for some purpose of his own, that by trying to twist my arm here he will intimidate me into taking some unconsidered steps in this matter.  I will not be intimidated.</P>

      <P>As has been stated in the replies to previous Parliamentary Questions on this subject, it is not possible to obtain figures for total emigration from the State.  Reliable estimates of net emigration can, however, be made but only for the periods between Censuses of Population.  The latest such estimate relates to the five year period between the 1951 and 1956 Censuses in which net emigration amounted to 196,763 persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the service of the American Loan is charged directly on the Central Fund no provision for the repayment of the Loan is made in the Annual Volume of Estimates for the Supply Services.  Full details of the terms of the loan are available on the Loan Agreements dated 28th October, 1948, 23rd February, 1949, 22nd December, 1949, and 30th June, 1950, which have been presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The rate of interest is 2½% on the balance outstanding from time to time and the amount of principal repayable in 1960-61 is $1,503,708.</P>
      <P>Of the Irish currency proceeds of the loan which amounted to £40.7 million, £630,000 was invested in Agricultural Credit Corporation Stock. The balance with accumulated interest was invested in Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer and was utilised with other Exchequer borrowings to finance capital and other services during the period from December, 1949, to December, 1951.  The particular services financed by the loan proceeds were not segregated.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) This is the average number employed for a full year.  Employment on Land Commission estate improvement works is casual in nature and it is estimated that the average duration of each operation is from 10 to 13 weeks.  In all, 3,000&mdash;4,000 different workers are employed in a full year.</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) Basic weekly rate of wages at present ranges from £5 17s. 6d. (minimum) to £6 8s. 6d. but at 107 forests, where the Incentive Bonus Scheme is in operation and at which 2,975 men are employed, bonus earnings would bring the gross earnings of most workers to over £7 per week.</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) Inclusive of payments under the Incentive Bonus Scheme.</P>
