      <P>You know, Sir, that the Taoiseach unfortunately has entered a very strong <i>caveat</i> against this procedure. He objects to amendments from the Seanad being considered on the day they are presented to Dáil Éireann.  In the circumstances, I do not think we can flout his authority, and I am sure the Minister would not wish to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 33, &ldquo;seventeen&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;sixteen&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>Under the section young persons between the ages of 17 and 21 years who are on remand awaiting trial or awaiting sentence may, with their consent, be sent to a remand institution instead of to a prison.  This amendment extends the age group to persons aged 16.  This does for remand prisoners what the amendment proposed by Deputy Declan Costello did for sentenced prisoners.  In that respect they are related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one question I should like to raise.  What is involved here is the remanding of a person of 16 to 21 years of age to a remand home, instead of to a prison, with the consent of the young person. Does there not seem to be something a little odd in asking a young person of 16 whether he consents to be sent to a remand home instead of to a prison? Is it necessary to get his consent?  If it is deemed desirable to send him to a remand home instead of to a prison, then why not send him there?  It does seem to be a little odd to say to a boy of 16 years of age, in the dock: &ldquo;I propose to remand you.  The law requires me to send you to Mountjoy. Will you permit me to send you to a remand home?&rdquo; My submission is that it would be perfectly proper for the district justice to say to a child of that age: &ldquo;I am sending you up to St. Patricks.&rdquo; Does it not seem a little odd to the Minister that the district justice should consult a young person of 16 as to whether or not that young person should go to prison or to a remand home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the main, this deals with young girls who have been remanded in custody and who could be sent either to prison or to a convent. Now the girl may object to going to a convent.  She may desire to go to a prison instead.  Under this, she cannot be sent to a convent without her consent. <Col N="1553" /> As I say this affects girls in the main.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is very much to it.  There were some references made to a particular convent in the Seanad last evening.  I do not think there is a whole lot to what was said, but we may be able to arrange that, as far as that convent is concerned, the girl can be sent to a particular part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I can appreciate that if the Court wishes to send a girl to a convent, which is not a prison institution at all, and if the girl is very recalcitrant and absolutely refuses to go to the convent, the fact is that the convent may not be able to control her, and it might therefore be necessary to send her some place where she would be under the control of trained women officers.  In such special circumstances, I could understand this amendment but, in its general form now, might it not amount to a situation in which not only girls but boys will be subject to this?  Does the Minister not think there is something wrong, or unsuitable, in the district justice consulting a 16 year old boy before he remands him?  I do not think that is either becoming or desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The parent would probably be present.  The boy would have the right, if he feels he would prefer to go to prison rather than to an institution, to say that he would prefer to be remanded to a prison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The district Justice will decide that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But that does not seem to be the position.  I should be quite content if the Minister were asking for wider discretion for the district justice but, as I understand the Minister's explanation, the position now will be that, if a 16 year old boy is brought before the district justice and the district justice considers it desirable to remand him, the district justice is now obliged to consult the boy as to where he will send him.  I think that is wrong.  I think the district justice must retain a discretion because the boy may be of a very recalcitrant kind who would wreck a remand home if he were sent there.  In these circumstances it may be an inescapable but desirable development that he has to send him to Mountjoy.  Surely it is the district justice who ought to decide this?</P>
      <P>Suppose you get a tough little lad of 16 years of age before the Court and the district justice is quite satisfied that superficially he is tough but fundamentally is not of the criminal type.  He will not want to put him into contact with the criminal population in Mountjoy.  Under the amendment, as proposed, if the justice says: &ldquo;You are going on remand for a week to St. Patricks,&rdquo; and the boy says &ldquo;No, I am going to Mountjoy,&rdquo; the justice's hands are tied and he must send him to Mountjoy.  That is wrong.</P>
      <P>The district justice ought to be entitled to say to a young person between the ages of 16 and 17 years: &ldquo;You are going where I send you and I have it at my disposal to name the new Marlborough House or St. Patricks.&rdquo; I think he would probably send the boy to Marlborough House, and even though the boy might say: &ldquo;No, I am going to Mountjoy&rdquo;, the district justice ought to have a right to say: &ldquo;No, you are not.  You are going to Marlborough House and stay there for a week.&rdquo; Surely it is most undesirable for us to legislate that a 16 year old boy has a right to tell the district justice he wants to go to Mountjoy?  I cannot believe that the Minister desires that and I would be opposed to any such proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The 16 year old boys of today have quite a considerable amount of thinking power.  They can make their own decisions if the district justices put the question to them.  They can say they would prefer to go to one as against the other, but I want to remind the Deputy that this section only deals with remand prisoners. They do not associate in any case with convicted prisoners.  In other words, the difference between the institution and the prison in this respect would be negligible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand what the Minister says, that a great deal of power is given to a 16 year old boy, and that is what I am objecting to.  I think that the power should be given to the district justice and it is more important on remand than it is after sentence.  On reflection I think the Minister will agree that the proper way of dealing with this matter is to give the justice absolute power as between the ages of 16 and 21 years. I entirely agree it is better to go back from 17 years of age to 16 years of age, but the power to decide should be given to the justice.  One of the things about Teddy boys is that they think they are grand fellows.</P>
      <P>That is part of the trouble with youthful offenders, that they are trying to build up their own importance, and the effect of the proposal by which they will be asked whether they will go on remand to Mountjoy or to an institution is further inflating their ego. What we should aim to do is to deflate them without being, if I may use the word, inhumane in the process, and the best deflation in regard to the remand sphere is to leave the discretion solely with the justice.  So long as these young fellows are entitled to get up and say they are not going to do this or that they will think that they are grand fellows instead of being conditioned, so to speak, to be ashamed of themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the Minister extending the age back to 16 years but would he look at Section 9 of the Bill and consider, when inserting this amendment, in lines 35 and 36 deleting the words: &ldquo;provided the person consents&rdquo;?  That would leave the discretion entirely in the hands of the district justice as to whether to send a boy on remand to prison or to a remand home.  I would agree with the Minister, if we were conferring a power on the district justice to increase a penalty or to abridge the ordinary rights of a defendant, that the words: &ldquo;provided the person consents&rdquo; should be incorporated, but where this section operates to do what I understand it does&mdash;to give the justice a right of mitigating the rigours of remand&mdash;I would not agree with him.  Ordinary remand means a cell in Mountjoy and the section gives the justice power to prescribe that, in the case of any individual juvenile, instead of going to a cell in Mountjoy he will go to a remand home, to Borstal, or to St. Patricks.  Why must you get the boy's consent to protect himself from a sojourn in a cell in Mountjoy?  That is putting the justice in the ridiculous position of saying: &ldquo;I would rather send you to St. Patricks, if you will consent to go there.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Certainly if I were a Teddy boy desiring to display my toughness to my neighbours in the district court in Dublin I would say: &ldquo;Not so-and-so likely; I am going to Mountjoy.&rdquo; I think I would expand and become an important person as I cheerfully announced my intention of facing the rigours of Mountjoy.  District Justices should have this right and if the Minister will agree to delete the words: &ldquo;provided the person consents&rdquo;, then we shall have no hesitation in accepting the Seanad's amendment, but I do not think we ought to give a 16-year old the right to tell a district justice where to get off</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I should like to mention.  The Minister says that a boy is remanded to a separate section of Mountjoy but, generally speaking, a Sunday intervenes in the remand period and all the inmates will congregate together on <Col N="1557" /> that day.  The inclination of the young lad or Teddy boy, whatever you like to call him, is to show how tough a fellow he is and the Sunday gives him an opportunity of displaying how tough he is to the other fellows in Mountjoy, by telling them he has selected Mountjoy as against a remand home.  I think it is a very dangerous discretion to leave in the hands of a young fellow of 16 or 17 years of age.  We all knew a lot when we were 16 or 17 but it was only in after life that we found out how little we knew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is really very little in this.  It the district justice wishes he has the alternative of sending the boy to Marlborough House because the boy is still a 16-year-old and would in the normal way be entitled to be sent there.  But if the district justice thinks that the boy would be too unruly or depraved to be kept in Marlborough House, he can send him either to Mountjoy Prison or the Institution.  This is related to the amendment we accepted from Deputy Declan Costello and Deputy Ryan in which they advocated reducing the minimum age at which an offender can be sentenced direct to St. Patricks from 17 years to 16 years.</P>
      <P>I said at that time that I was accepting that amendment with some misgivings, but in view of the case made by the Deputies, I agreed to substitute &ldquo;16&rdquo; for &ldquo;17&rdquo;.  In this amendment we are doing for the remand prisoner what we did, under the Deputies' amendment, for the sentenced prisoner. Deputy Declan Costello wanted the age reduced from 17 to 16 for the sentenced prisoner.  He wanted the 16-year-old boy committed to the Institution instead of to prison.  What we are doing in this amendment is to make the same provision for the remand prisoner as Section 13 makes for the sentenced prisoner.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is a lot in it. The provision is unlikely to cause any difficulty.  The parents will probably object to the boy being sent to Mountjoy, and the alternative is here provided to send him to the Institution instead.  I rather imagine it is for the Institution that the parents and the boy himself would opt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows more about Teddy boys than I do. There may be a difference of opinion between the boy and his parents.  I would prefer if something were included in the amendment to the effect that the parents must be consulted. Many young fellows of 16 are rebellious against their parents.  If the parents say &ldquo;The Borstal Institution&rdquo;, the young fellow may say &ldquo;Mountjoy&rdquo;. There is the conflict.  I appreciate what is in the Minister's mind because one of the Senators explained to me the reason for the inclusion of this amendment.  I believe it is to deal particularly with the case of some female prisoners who in the past have been sent to an institution which has given them a certain brand, not deliberately, but that is what has happened. Would the Minister not consider including in the amendment something to the effect that the parents or guardian must be consulted?</P>

We want the girl to say, if she wishes to say so, that she does not want to go to the convent, that she wants to go to Mountjoy or whatever prison is involved.  With the removal of these words we give discretion to the district justice to send her wherever he wishes.  He can commit her either to the convent or to prison.</P>

      <P>Let us do nothing rash or foolish.  I think this a perfectly safe thing to do, provided the district justice is a competent person &mdash;and I have no doubt he is.  If a girl says: &ldquo;I would sooner go to the Convent than to Mountjoy,&rdquo; I cannot see any rational district justice saying: &ldquo;You must go to Mountjoy whether you like it or not,&rdquo; if she wants to go to the Convent and desires to embark <Col N="1561" /> on a path of reform.  Do any of our lady colleagues here see any objection?</P>

      <P>Our job is to legislate. The suggestion is that if a girl goes to a convent there is some reflection on her sexual purity whereas if she goes to Mountjoy there may be a reflection on her reputation as a law-abiding citizen in regard to other matters, but no suggestion of sexual immorality. Surely the probation service, the district justice, and the courts can find some way out of that complication? A convent can be found other than a Magdalen institution for this special function.  There are one hundred ways of resolving this problem and, if it is generally stated that this is a problem that girls have to contend with if they get into trouble, I have no doubt that the Minister is a sympathetic man and he will arrange that a convent other than a Magdalen institution will be chosen for the purpose of remand.</P>

      <P>When we consulted the authorities when we were framing this Bill, we felt that it would be desirable to send a young girl who might be innocent but who would be charged with an offence on remand to a convent rather than for her to suffer the stigma of Mountjoy, but the view of <Col N="1562" /> the Senators was the view that has been expressed by Deputy Corish&mdash; that there would be a greater stigma in remanding her to the particular convent than in remanding her to Mountjoy.  We must keep that at the back of our minds also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about the courts; I do not think I was ever in court in my life, thank God, but when the section says that the teenager is consulted, does that necessarily mean that the teenager has an opportunity of consulting his or her solicitor as to what is the best thing to do or does the justice say: &ldquo;Where do you want to go?&rdquo; Has the young person any opportunity of consulting anybody at that stage, solicitor, parent or guardian?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Right off, I could not say, any more than the Deputy could.  The boy may be a young scamp who is outside the control of his parents.  He may not be represented either by parents or by solicitor but we know that district justices are very humane gentlemen and when they are dealing with that type of boy they would say to him something like this: &ldquo;I am going to send you on remand and you can go to Mountjoy or to St. Patrick's Institution.  I would recommend you to go to St. Patrick's Institution.  Are you satisfied to go there?&rdquo; The boy would probably say: &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; That would be the end of the matter.  There would be no question of forcing him to accept one or the other.  I am pretty certain he would be guided by the words which the justice would apply to his case.  I think that would be all.  In fact this problem would hardly arise in the case of boys at all; the provision was intended in the main to cover girls in the circumstances which I have described.  Now, we have been involved in this discussion which brings in another matter and which, in my opinion, takes away the right of the individual girl, at any rate, to say that she would prefer to go to prison rather than to a convent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why we should be mealy-mouthed about this. As a Catholic layman I have no hesitation in saying&mdash;and anyone who does not like it can lump it&mdash;that if there is a problem here in which a girl feels that remand to a Magdalen home involves her in a background which is to her a grievance and a humiliation I cannot believe that the ecclesiastical authorities of our Church, the Roman Catholic Church, or of the Protestant Church or of any other religious communion will not help us, the legislature of the country, to surmount that difficulty by providing for us a convent which is not associated with that glorious charity of the Magdalen homes but which is prepared to provide a different charitable service &mdash;the care of prisoners without reference to the nature of their crime. I think we have a right to expect that of our ecclesiastical authorities and I have no hesitation in saying that if, in the judgment of this legislature, it is desirable that that should be done I cannot conceive it as probable that the ecclesiastical authorities of the Church of the majority, or of the minority, will refuse whatever we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the resources of the charitable Orders of the Catholic Church in Ireland are abundantly ample to provide such a service if called upon to do so but I cannot imagine that if we apply to the ecclesiastical authorities they will refuse us.  I sympathise with the problem envisaged by the Senators and mentioned by Deputy Corish.  I can understand a girl remanded on a shoplifting charge or on a variety of other charges we can imagine, being a simple person and feeling that remand to a Magdalen home may hereafter be upcast to her as evidence that she was guilty of unchaste conduct in the past.  That is something with which I have sympathy and something from which we should not recoil or be afraid to mention here because we have a duty to discuss that problem. I think we can find her a suitable retreat to which she can be sent on remand other than prison and which <Col N="1564" /> will not have that association from which she recoils.</P>
    <P>I am not a bit shy about facing that problem and declaring my views on it. I say that quite deliberately and I want to go on record as saying that I think the Minister for Justice has a right to expect from the ecclesiastical authorities of the Church to which he and I belong, the assistance requisite to make that facility available if and when the Oireachtas take that decision and I cannot doubt that he will get it.  But I think what I have heard from the Minister is the right and proper course. I believe that the difficulty connected with the remand of a female prisoner can be surmounted while at the same time we restore to the district justice his discretion as to how juvenile persons on remand should be disposed of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt in my mind that his Grace would accede to a request to make another convent available but when we made the request originally his Grace was kind enough to suggest this particular convent. The fact is that this is a convent in which work is carried on.  Most convents are of a very private character and deal in the main with matters religious and they do not cater for any outsiders whatever.  I am pretty certain that this will limit the number of convents that can be made available.</P>
      <P>There are other convents of the same type as St. Mary Magdalen's but the same stigma would operate if they were to be selected and I can see certain difficulties from that point of view.  As I pointed out in the Seanad last evening, I was conscious when this convent was nominated of the limitations which existed and I emphasised to my officials that when we were dealing with this matter we should try to ensure that the girls in question would not in any respect be associated with the type of person to whom objection is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I made that statement in the Seanad I do not think it was generally accepted as the remedy for the difficulty which had been raised but, as I said in the beginning, I cannot select a convent.  I cannot say, &ldquo;We <Col N="1565" /> will remand the girl to this place, that place or the other place&rdquo;.  It is for the ecclesiastical authorities to agree to make these facilities available.</P>
    <P>We could have avoided all that, and this discussion also, by simply leaving matters as they are and letting the girl be remanded in the ordinary way to prison but I was conscious of the fact that while quite a number of girls are charged with criminal offences at least some of them are acquitted subsequently and that in those circumstances the stigma of being associated in any respect, even for a week or two or a few days, with Mountjoy ought to be removed.  I thought the suggestion of the convent was an excellent way out.  I am somewhat doubtful now, because of the discussions that have taken place in the Seanad in respect of the particular convent and the discussion that has taken place here, if the remedy is in fact a remedy at all and if matters would not have been better left as they were.</P>

      <P>Before subsection (2) the following subsection inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the power conferred by section 10 of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914, to commit to prison shall be deemed to be a power to commit in custody for sentence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the law stands, the district court can commit persons of criminal habits of not less than 16 and not more than 21 years of age to prison until the next Circuit Court which is empowered to sentence them if it thinks fit to Borstal detention or to imprisonment.  This amendment will enable the district <Col N="1566" /> court to send such persons to St. Patrick's Institution until the circuit court decides what to do with them.  In other words, it is in line with the one which was proposed under Section 13 of the present Bill, that is, that they may be remanded to the institution until they are brought before the circuit court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Criminal Justice Administration Act of 1914 provides that where a criminal is remanded in custody to be dealt with by the circuit court that carries with it the implication that he must be dealt with at the next session of the circuit court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It means in effect that the district justice cannot sentence a prisoner to a period of imprisonment longer than 12 months and if he deems that the person before him is deserving of Borstal detention he must refer him to the circuit court which has the power to sentence him to such detention of two years or a maximum period of three years.</P>

What I want to ensure is that under this criminal justice code if a district justice remands a juvenile to St. Patrick's in order that he may be dealt with by the circuit court there will be an implied condition that the juvenile must be produced to the circuit court judge of the next circuit court that sits.

De réir Ailt 4 den Acht de 1932, ní thiocfaidh aon scéim phinsin i bhfeidhm go dtí go ndéanfar í do leagadh fé bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas agus í do dhaingniú le rún ó gach Teach acu sin.</P>
    <P>Den Airteagal is tríocha atá sa Scéim, is mínithe na ceithre chinn thosaigh.  Beartaítear i seacht nAirteagal (uimhreachta 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 agus 17) éifeacht foirmeálta a thabhairt de mhéaduithe ar an bpá scoir agus ar phinsin atá de réir na méaduithe do phinsinéirí Stáit, i gcoitinne, a húdaraíodh ag an Aire Airgeadais sa Ráiteas ar an gCáinaisnéis, Aibreán, 1959.  Tá méadú de 6% i gceist do dhaoine a hurscaoileadh roimh 1 Meán Fómhair, 1949, agus do bhaintreacha agus leanaí áirithe; agus méadú de 4% do dhaoine a hurscaoileadh idir 1 Meán Fómhair, 1949, agus 1 Samhain, 1952.  D'aontuigh Dáil Éireann leis na méaduithe seo sa mheastachán a ritheadh ar an 22ú Iúil, 1959, agus táid á ioc ó Lúnasa, 1959, i leith; £10,000 sa bhliain an garchostas.</P>
    <P>Tagrann ocht nAirteagal eile (uimhreacha 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 agus 20) do na méaduithe ar an bpá scoir agus ar phinsin, a déanfar ar 1 Lúnasa, 1960, de réir na méaduithe do phinsinéiri Stáit, i gcoitinne, a luaigh An tAire Airgeadais sa Ráiteas ar an gCáinaisnéis 27ú Aibreán, 1960.  Sa chás seo, deonfar méadú de 7½% ins na pinsin atá iníoctha do dhaoine a hurscaoileadh roimh 1 Meán Fómhair, 1949, agus de bhaintreacha agus leanaí áirithe, agus iocfar méadú de 5% ar <Col N="1568" /> phinsin daoine a hurscaoileadh idir 1 Meán Fómhair, 1949, agus 1 Samhain, 1955.  Beidh costas £10,000 sa bhliain airgeadais reatha agus £17,000 i mbliain iomlán, ar na méaduithe seo.</P>
    <P>Forálann seacht gcinn den dá Airteagal déag eile (uimhreacha 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28 agus 29) go ndéanfar méaduithe gnáthacha ar an bpá scoir, ar phinsin agus ar aiscí; táid seo riachtanach&mdash;de bhun méaduithe ar an bpá sheirbhíse&mdash;chun an ceangal atá idir luach saothair agus sochair scoir a choimeád.  Baineann Airteagail 21 agus 23 le méadú ar an bpá sheirbhíse a deonadh do roinnt oifigigh pósta i Márta, 1956, agus nár deineadh méaduithe cuí dá bharr ar an bpá scoir agus ar aiscí sna Scéim Leasaitheach 1957 agus 1959.  Faoi Airteagail 22 agus 24 méadófar na sochair scoir d'oifigigh de dhroim na méaduithe ar an bpá sheirbhíse atá i bhfeidhm ó 1 Aibreán, 1958 agus 15 Nollaig, 1959.</P>
    <P>Ar mhaithe le soiléireachta agus ionus go mbeidh na méaduithe uilig ó 1 Aibreán, 1958, agus 15 Nollaig, 1959, le chéile, táthar ag déanamh athachtú sa Scéim seo ar na forálacha sa Scéim Leasaitheach 1959 le haghaidh méaduithe ar an bpá scoir agus ar aiscí d'oifigigh faoi leith díobhtha seo. Na forálacha méaduithe sa táible in Airteagal 22 agus in Airteagal 25 a bhaineas le céim LefteanaintGhinearál, ní bhaineann siad ach le hoifigeach a scoir ar 1 Eanáir, 1960; de bhrí nach bhfuil LefteanantGhinearál ar bith san Airm agus nach raibh an pá sheirbhíse lena mbaineann na sochair scoir seo, mar sin, á íoc ach amháin don oifigeach a scoir sa chéim sin ar 1 Eanáir, 1960 (An Ceann Foirne atá imithe).  Forálann Airteagail 28 agus 29 go méadófar pinsin agus aiscí d'O.N.C. agus fir de réir na méaduithe ar an bpá sheirbhíse a deonadh ón 15ú Nollaig, 1959, amháin bhí foráil sa Scéim Leasaitheach 1959 do na méaduithe a ceaduíodh in Aibreán, 1958, do na céimnigh seo.</P>

Tá an tAirteagal seo riachtanach chun dámhachtain nua pá scoir a chur ina n-áit sin nach mbeidh na tréimhsí seirbhíse siúd san áireamh iontú; beidh feidhm ag na méaduithe fén gCáinaisnéis de 1959 leis na dámhachtain nua seo.</P>

Maidir le mir (2) den Airteagal, tá sé i gceist go mbeidh an sainmhíniú ar oifigeach &ldquo;seirbhíse speisialta&rdquo; chun críocha pá scoir ar aon dul, comh fada agus is féidir, leis an sainmhíniú sa Rialachán Óglaigh na hÉireann a bhaineas le pá sheirbhíse den oifigeach chéanna.</P>
    <P>Tá srian ar phinsin baintreach sa Phríomh-Scéim faoine gcaithfear an pinsean sin a laghdú de pé mhéid a thuilleann an bhaintreach as airgead poiblí; cuireann Airteagal 27 deire leis an srian seo.</P>
    <P>Faoi Airteagal 30, beidh cead ag oifigeach tréimhse ar bith seirbhíse i gCúltaca na nÓglach nó i gCór Tréineála Oifigeach a áireamh mar sheirbhís inphinsean más rud é go raibh sé i dteideal an tréimhse sin a dhealú ón a aois chun go mbeadh sé cáilithe le haghaidh ceapacháin mar oifigeach de na Buan-Óglaigh.</P>
    <P>Mar chríoch, tá na forálacha a bhaineas le leanai uchtaithe sa Scéim Leasaitheach 1959 á bhforléanadh ionus, sa chás go bhfuil leanbh uchtaithe ag fáil liúntas as na cistí poiblí toisc seirbhís a thug a thuismitheoirí <Col N="1570" /> nádúrtha, go laghdófar de mhéid an liúntais, pinsean pósta a gheibheann an t-athair uchtála de bharr an linbh.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh na forálacha sa Scéim níos soiléire ón athchoimre seo; má fheiceann éinne deacrachtaí ar bith, beidh áthas orm déileáil leo nuair a bhead ag rá an focal scoir.</P>
    <P>This Scheme is made pursuant to the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts 1932 to 1957.  It will not come into force until it has been confirmed by a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The first four of the thirty-one Articles in the Scheme are definitory. Seven Articles (Nos. 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 17) relate to increase in retired pay and pensions (authorised in the 1959 Budget) amounting to 6% for personnel discharged before 1st September, 1949 (and for certain widows and children) and 4% for personnel discharged between 1st September, 1949, and 1st November, 1952.  The increases, which are similar to those for State pensioners, generally, were approved by DáilÉireann in an estimate introduced by the Minister for Finance on 22nd July, 1959, and they are being paid since August, 1959, at a cost of approximately £10,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Eight other Articles (Nos. 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20) are designed to give effect to the increases to be made on 1st August, 1960, in retired pay and pensions (in accordance with the 1960 Budget) amounting to 7½% for personnel discharged before 1st September, 1949 (and for certain widows and children) and 5% for personnel discharged between 1st September, 1949, and 1st November, 1955.  The increases, which are similar to those for State pensioners, generally, will cost £10,000 in this financial year and £17,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>Seven of the remaining twelve Articles (Nos. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28 and 29) are concerned with normal adjustments of retired pay, pensions and gratuities related to service pay increases.  Articles 21 and 23 follow a service pay increase for certain married officers in March 1956 while Articles 22 and 24 provide for adjustments <Col N="1571" /> to accord with officers' service pay increases in April, 1958, and December, 1959.  The increase provisions in the 1959 Scheme for certain of these officers are being re-enacted here so as to bring all the relevant figures together for convenience of reference.  In the table to Article 22 and in Article 25 the references to a Lieutenant General relate only to the officer in that rank who retired on 1st January, 1960, because the service pay to which these adjustments relate was paid only to that officer (the former Chief of staff) and there is no other Lieutenant General serving.  The pension and gratuity increases in Articles 28 and 29 are associated only with the Service pay increases granted to NCOs. and Men in December, 1959; the April, 1958, increases for these ranks were granted by the 1959 Scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally there are five Articles (Nos. 19, 26, 27, 30 and 31) which introduce amendments to the Schemes.  Article 19 is necessary because certain officers, who were not eligible for military service pensions when they retired from the Defence Forces, received retired pay based <i>inter alia</i> on service before October, 1923, and, having later succeeded on appeal, in their military service pension claims, were awarded military service pensions in respect of periods already covered by the retired pay awards.  This Article provides for the replacement of the latter awards by new awards based on service since 1st October, 1923, which will therefore exclude the overlapping service periods. The Article also applies the 1959 Budget increases to these new awards (for which the 1960 Budget increases are provided in Article 20).</P>
    <P>It was the intention that the provision in the principal Scheme (Article 13) for a 20% increase in retired pay for Army Medical Corps Officers should benefit only medical and dental officers&mdash;but not officers attached to the Corps for other duties.  Paragraph (1) of Article 26 serves to make this clear while paragraph (2) re-words the definition of a &ldquo;special service&rdquo; officer to bring it closer to the definition <Col N="1572" /> of such an officer in the Defence Force Regulation relating to service pay.</P>
    <P>Article 27 repeals the provision which requires a widow's pension to be reduced by the amount of her earnings from public funds.</P>
    <P>Article 30 permits the reckoning, as pensionable service, of any period of an officer's service in the Volunteer Reserve or in an Officers' Training Corps which he was allowed to deduct from his age in order to qualify for appointment to be an officer of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Article 31 provides that a married pension, which an adopted child attracts to his adopting father shall be reduced by the amount of any allowance from public funds enjoyed by the child by reason of services rendered by its natural parents.</P>
    <P>Should there be any aspects of the scheme which are not clear I shall be happy to furnish any further information required when I am concluding.</P>

      <P>This new Order confers considerable benefits on serving and retired members of the Defence Forces.  In so far as it does that, it is welcome to me and to this Party.  It is difficult for serving members of the Forces and members of this House to find out exactly where anybody stands in relation to the Order and what benefits are actually being conferred.  These benefits can be determined and ascertained only after considerable time and work by the Department of Finance and the Department of Defence.  The time has arrived when&mdash;as the Minister has done in one case here, that is, bringing the Schedule together for easy reference&mdash;there should be a general amalgamation of all the Orders to clarify the position and give examples of the benefits conferred.  In that way the members of the Forces and of the Oireachtas would be clear about the benefits being conferred.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Government have decided to give these increases.  The Minister says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The increases, which are similar to those for State pensioners, generally, were approved by Dáil Éireann <Col N="1573" /> in an Estimate introduced by the Minister for Finance on 22nd July, 1959, and they are being paid since August 1959 at a cost of approximately £10,000 a year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Eight other Articles (Nos. 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20) are designed to give effect to the increases to be made on 1st August 1960 in retired pay and pensions (in accordance with the 1960 Budget).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why is that money not being paid from an earlier date than the 1st August?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well that this complies with the general plan. The Minister says that the increases, which are similar to those for State pensioners, generally, will cost £10,000 in this financial year and £17,000 in a full year.  On page 2 of his statement we read: &ldquo;The increase provisions in the 1959 Scheme for certain of these officers are being re-enacted here...&rdquo; I should like to see the whole thing brought together so that it would be easier to understand. However, there is an improvement.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that five Articles &mdash;Nos. 19, 26, 27, 30 and 31&mdash;introduce amendments to the Schemes. Where a person was not eligible for a military service pension when he retired but, under the 1949 amending Act, since qualified, a benefit was conferred on him.  Is it intended to leave him as he now finds himself?  Is it now intended to take anything from him?</P>

      <P>In the case of an Army officer who was awarded a military <Col N="1574" /> service pension&mdash;say, under the 1924 Act&mdash;his Army service counted only from 1st October, 1923, in reckoning his retired pay under the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes.  The officers concerned here, at the time they retired from the Army, had not been granted military service pensions.  Therefore, their whole service in the Army counted for retired pay, unlike their colleagues who got military service pensions.  Subsequent to retiring, they succeeded in their appeals and got military service pensions.  They are now being brought into line with their colleagues whose service dated only from October, 1923, because they had other pensions.</P>

      <P>The benefit the 1949 amending Act conferred on them is now being lessened.  In a nutshell that is what it means.  I think that should not take place because for a considerable period they would have been in receipt of a military service pension and they would have that much benefit.  Now they have lost both ways.  They are going to lose something through not having received it in time but late in life.  Now they are going to revert to a position as if <Col N="1575" /> they had it all the time, which they had not.</P>

      <P>I am arguing that they were at all relevant times entitled to a military service pension. The only thing is that it was not granted to them in time because for certain reasons this Dáil and the Minister for the time being did not make it retrospective to 1924.  I think he should have but that is beside the point.  Having suffered the disadvantage of being without it and because they succeeded at a later date, the Minister now says they will go back as if they had it all the time, which they had not.  However, we have to be satisfied with what we get.</P>
      <P>On page 3 the Minister seeks to make this applicable to the Army Medical Corps officers.  They are the only officers who will benefit under it. This now brings in other officers.</P>

Is he still like Mohammed's coffin in a position of temporary suspension for the past 30 years?  Is he going to remain in a temporary position until he dies?  Is that a reasonable line to take?  He is suspended between two Departments, the Department of Finance and the Department of Defence.  The Minister for Defence says he belongs to one Department and the Minister for Finance says he belongs to the other.  The truth of the matter is that he is attached to the Minister for Defence and is responsible to the Minister for Defence.  I thought that type of person was covered in this section.</P>

      <P>I accept the Order in so far as it goes.  My only regret is that the Minister has not been able to go further but there is always another day and amendments are always possible.  We have to be satisfied with it as we find it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the benefits that are actually being conferred, I think it is made quite clear that the increases were granted in the last two Budgets in respect of the years 1959 and 1960.  This scheme has to be confirmed by the two Houses of the Oireachtas to give that statutory effect.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin mentioned it was time there was a general consolidation of these schemes.  I agree that is desirable but I think there is something more than consolidation required. The schemes are so complicated now that they would really need to be recast and rewritten.  That would be a very big task.  I do not rule out the possibility of its being done but I cannot give any guarantee that it will be done in the near future.  When a scheme such as this is being introduced, we issue an explanatory memorandum to give as clear a picture as possible of what is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Article 19, these three officers are retired officers who, since they retired, have been granted military service pensions.  Deputy MacEoin is not quite right in saying that they lost a considerable amount due to the fact that they only received a late award because they could not draw the military service pension until after they left the Army.  All the time they were serving in the Army, even if they had a military service certificate, <Col N="1577" /> the actual pension could not have been paid until after they left the Army.  In working out whether they had gained or lost by having two pensions in respect of this period for a short time, you would have to know the date on which each of them left the Army and the date on which the award of the Military Service pension was made. The difference between what they would have got by way of a military service pension from the date they left the Army up to the time they were granted the pension would have to be balanced against the length of time for which they were paid on the double for the same period.  If the officers were at any loss compared with their colleagues I would say it would be very small.  None of them was paid pensions while actually serving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>When that was being made out it was to the benefit of the Government and not the recipient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were to continue being paid twice in respect of the same period for the future, then definitely there would be a loss to the State and a benefit to them and a benefit as compared with their colleagues. We should not forget their colleagues who got their military service pensions granted to them earlier on.</P>
      <P>The civilian member of the Army Pensions Board is in the same position as any other temporary civil servant. He is not in any way connected with the Army Medical Corps.  The provision in this scheme to which Deputy MacEoin related his case has nothing to do with the Army Pensions Board at all.  There happens to be one Army officer on the Army Pensions Board in addition to the civilian medical member and the Chairman of the Board.  They were always in a temporary capacity.  I do not see that there is any particular case for establishing them.</P>

    <Title>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital) (Kingdom of Sweden) Order, 1960: Motion of Confirmation.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital) (Kingdom of Sweden) Order, 1960</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid on the table of Dáil Éireann on the 8th day of July, 1960.</P>
      <P>This motion relates to the implementation in Irish law of a comprehensive Agreement with the Royal Government of Sweden for the avoidance of double taxation of income and capital.  The Agreement has been signed on behalf of the Irish Government but before it can enter into force each party must ensure that the necessary steps have been taken under the law of its own country to give effect to it.</P>
      <P>So far as concerns Ireland, it is necessary to comply with the provisions of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1958.  Section 44 of that Act provides that an arrangement entered into with a foreign Government to afford relief from double taxation in respect of income tax, surtax, corporation profits tax and any taxes of a similar character shall have the force of law in this country if the Irish Government makes an Order accordingly.  Before the Government may make any such Order, however, a draft of the Order must, under Section 49 of the Act, have been laid before Dáil Éireann and a resolution passed approving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill has been passed by the Swedish Parliament giving effect to the Agreement under Swedish law.  When <Col N="1579" /> subject to the approval of the Dáil, the draft Order which is now before the House has been made by the Irish Government, the Department of External Affairs will be in a position, therefore, to exchange instruments of ratification and the Agreement will enter into effect forthwith.</P>
    <P>Deputies will find the text of the Agreement scheduled to the draft order.  On the Irish side the principal provision for the avoidance of double taxation in the Agreement is based on what is known as the &ldquo;credit system&rdquo; of relief.  It provides broadly that where double taxation arises and is not eliminated elsewhere in the Agreement by confining the right of taxation to one country or the other, then the tax imposed by Sweden on income from Swedish sources shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed on the same income by Ireland.  On the Swedish side the corresponding provision in the Agreement is based principally on the &ldquo;exemption system&rdquo; of relief.  That means that, where, under the Agreement, income from Irish sources continues to be taxable both in Ireland and in Sweden, then Sweden will exempt that income from Swedish tax.  The &ldquo;credit system&rdquo; of relief, however, is used in the case of certain dividends from Irish companies under Article 23.</P>
    <P>A short explanatory note regarding the provisions of the Agreement has already been circulated with the text of the Order.  Apart from the inclusion of taxes on income and capital, from Sweden's use of the &ldquo;exemption system&rdquo; of relief and from one other important aspect to which I shall refer, the Agreement generally follows the main lines of our Double Taxation Agreements with the United States and Canada and is broadly in line with modern international tax agreements.</P>
    <P>The agreement contains an important novel feature in paragraph 2 of Article 23.  I refer to the provision that, where Irish dividends qualifying for credit relief in Sweden have not suffered full Irish tax&mdash;for example, dividends paid out of profits which qualify for &ldquo;exports&rdquo; relief&mdash;the <Col N="1580" /> Swedish Revenue will give credit as if full Irish tax had been suffered by the Swedish recipient in respect of the dividend.  This will be the first example of what is known as &ldquo;matching credit&rdquo; to be given effect to in a double taxation agreement.  I might explain the purpose of &ldquo;matching credit&rdquo; is to ensure that the benefits of tax incentives granted by one country will be preserved in the other country by its deeming that the tax waived by the first country has in fact been paid and, accordingly, by giving credit in respect of it.</P>
    <P>It is provided in the Agreement that it will enter into force upon the exchange of instruments of ratification. It will thereafter continue in effect indefinitely but may be terminated by either Party by giving written notice not earlier than the 30th June, 1964. Upon exchange of instruments of ratification the Agreement will have effect in Ireland&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  in respect of income tax for the year of assessment 1960/61 and subsequent years;</P>
    <P>(b)  in respect of surtax for the year of assessment 1959/60 and subsequent years; and</P>
    <P>(c)  in respect of corporation profits tax for any chargeable accounting period beginning on or after the 1st April, 1960, and for the unexpired portion of any chargeable accounting period current at that date. </P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This agreement which the Minister asks the House to ratify is the natural follow-up of the change that was made in our conception of the general method of taxation some years ago.  Until taxation was used for incentive purposes, as it was decided to use it some years ago, there was not the same necessity for double taxation agreements except in the very limited case where, perhaps, people had emigrated in their early years and had come back to reside here having investment income in the countries in which they had previously resided.  I am speaking, of course, of countries other than Britain which had been <Col N="1581" /> dealt with in the very early double taxation agreements.</P>
      <P>Once, however, the State had started on the line of endeavouring, in so far as it was possible, to attract better conditions of mutual trading and to attract people, so far as our side of it is concerned, to set up establishments here, it became clear that it was desirable, in so far as it was possible, to conclude double taxation agreements with more countries and of a wider scope.  The change of the purpose of taxation from merely being something that was a means of collecting revenue to something that was also being used not merely as an economic arm, in the wide sense of the phrase, but as an incentive towards particular types of activity made the conclusion of these agreements very much more of a necessity.</P>
      <P>Some people are sometimes inclined to say and to think that the conclusion of a double taxation agreement with any country is a matter that requires little time and little thought.  Nothing could be further from the fact.  Before there can be any approach even to a double taxation agreement with any country it is necessary for our experts to attune themselves and to become acquainted with the taxation law of that other country.  Naturally, that does take time and I think the Minister will agree with me&mdash;in fact I am positive he will agree with me&mdash;that it is his experience, as well as it was my experience, that if one gives the Revenue people adequate time to ponder over and become acquainted with the full aspects of the problem with which they have to deal, nothing could be better than the service that the State obtains from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not pretend for one second that I fully understand this agreement. To put it mildly it is an extremely complicated one and all one can do in this House is to consider and to accept or reject the general principle set out in the Order.  We accept the principle that it is wise to have such a double taxation agreement and the Revenue Commissioners are to be congratulated on the agreement they have negotiated on this occasion.  As far as I can <Col N="1582" /> understand the agreement, it is operative in any event for the next four years, until June, 1964, and thereafter it remains operative until such time as it may be terminated on due notice being given by either party. That is the best type of agreement.  It should be operative, in any event, for a fixed period first, so that people will know where they stand, and should provide that thereafter it shall continue until such time as it may be varied.  Probably we shall find, as a result of experience, that there are minor matters in respect of which it will become necessary to make amendments as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I did not quite catch what the Minister said when he referred to the passage of the agreement in Sweden. Did I understand him to say it has already been confirmed in Sweden?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it will become immediately operative when we confirm it.  That again is good because it enables people to see more clearly where they stand.  I should like the Minister to tell me if I have correctly understood Article 5.  As I understand it, it is, so to speak, enacting what is included there on the same basis as our double taxation arrangements with Great Britain.  In other words, it means what we consider are the places where the company has incorporated its registered offices, where it has its directors' meetings, and where the control is effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I raise this matter particularly is that I notice the word used in Article 5 is &ldquo;management.&rdquo; The word used in ordinary everyday parlance in tax matters, as between this country and Great Britain, is &ldquo;control&rdquo;. I am anxious to know if, in fact, there is any difference between &ldquo;management&rdquo; in Article 5, and &ldquo;control&rdquo; as we understand it.  Therefore, I should like to have clarified whether there is any difference.  It may merely be that &ldquo;management&rdquo; is a more easy word to translate into Swedish.  Unfortunately I have no knowledge of the Swedish language with the exception of one word which perhaps the Minister may also have <Col N="1583" /> knowledge of, that is, the word &ldquo;Skol&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is the sum total of my knowledge of Swedish.  Passing from that to Article 1, sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), I presume that the English there is purely a translation of the words that follow, which I shall not attempt to pronounce. I have no doubt whatever that the Revenue Commissioners here, in considering Swedish law, will have taken note of the fact that there they seem to have a specific tax on public entertainers. I trust the Minister will not try to follow them in that respect in our next Budget.</P>
      <P>There is also a provision that movable property will be considered as taxable in the country in which it is situate.  I should like the Minister to tell me whether movable property in Sweden is construed, in the terms of the Agreement, according to our law or according to Swedish law.  There is something known as a &ldquo;Jersey mortgage&rdquo; which according to Jersey law is movable.  I am afraid that, whether or not it is construed according to our law, there may be a conflict where something has to be determined as within the definition in one country and not within the definition in the other.  What exactly happens under this agreement then?</P>
      <P>If the definition in Swedish law of movable property is different from our definition, is it the case that if the article so to speak&mdash;be it a mortgage property itself&mdash;is situate in Sweden, Swedish law will prevail, and if it is situate in Ireland Irish law will prevail? If the law is different in the two countries, is there some type of compromise, or will the agreement not operate at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can see also, this agreement refers solely to persons who are resident in either of the two countries and who are not resident in both.  It seems, therefore, that the question of double residence may arise and I am not clear as to what happens in that case.  The clause which appears to govern it is paragraph (c), Section 1, <Col N="1584" /> Article 2, which refers to residence in Sweden and residence in Ireland, as applying respectively to any person who is resident in one country and not resident in the other.  What transpires if there is double residence?</P>
    <P>I find it a little difficult to follow these references to the agreement being operative by way of credit, by way of exemption, and by matching credits. I should like, therefore, to be clear as to whether the effect of these provisions, which I think are entirely new in any double taxation agreement, is, so to speak, directly opposite to the principle enshrined in the British 1952 Finance Act.  As I understand the situation now, in that Act the operation of double taxation relief is specifically restricted to the tax actually suffered by the company in Great Britain.  It is not possible under that Act to obtain refunds or relief by way of credit here for tax that has not actually been paid to the British authorities; and that our double taxation agreement so provides.  In this case it would seem that we are to take into account not merely the tax suffered in Ireland but also the tax that would have been suffered were it not for the remission by way of specific industrial incentive to which I referred earlier. If I have correctly understood the position, I think, without question, it is an advance, and perhaps an advance which the Minister, having got it through in the case of Sweden, might now endeavour to extend into the British, Canadian and American double taxation agreements.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is in Sweden the same system of individual taxation, for individuals, arising from dividends paid by companies.  Here, as in England, of course, the dividend that is paid by a company is paid with deduction of tax; the tax has, in fact, already been paid by the company concerned.  It is treated here, therefore, as being income already subject to tax before receipt by the recipient. I do not know whether in Sweden the same principle applies as between company taxation, on the one hand, and individual income tax on the other. I think I am correct in saying that it does not apply in the United States of <Col N="1585" /> America; in the United States of America exemption is given for only part of the tax suffered by the company before the individual draws his dividend from it.  The operation, therefore, of that part of the agreement must depend entirely on the manner in which the general structure of Swedish income tax is made out.</P>
    <P>The State capital tax in Sweden is exempted in so far as anyone here is concerned but, as far as I can understand it, only if a company here does not set up a branch in Sweden.  I want to be quite clear now as to what is involved in setting up what is described, I think, as a permanent establishment in Article 2.  The display that is organised, for example, by Coras Trachtála for goods in another country, or for the exhibition of goods in another country, seems fairly clearly to come within the exemption included in paragraph (a).  Supposing we decided that it would be in the general interest for Coras Trachtála to open in Stockholm a permanent place of exhibition on the lines of the exhibition house in London&mdash;I cannot remember the name of it at the moment&mdash;operated by Coras Trachtála there, would that have the effect that anyone who took part in that, and ran a business in it for a week, a month, or whatever it might be, would thereby be outside the terms of this agreement?</P>
    <P>It seems to me difficult for a firm to display, or even to deliver goods or merchandise, and equally to store goods or merchandise, without having some sort of office facility for the taking of orders, the issuing of merchandise, and even the organisation of the display itself.  I am not clear, therefore, whether the very specific statement, that the permanent establishment includes an office would override the provision in the phrase &ldquo;permanent establishment shall not include display&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The general scheme in which Coras Trachtála has been operating has been to do the promotional part of getting together Irish industrialists and getting them to run jointly displays, exhibitions, and so forth, in other countries. <Col N="1586" /> It may well be that, as part of its general work, Coras Trachtála might well decide to have a permanent office in Stockholm.  If it does, are we clear that the fact that it has a permanent office, and the fact that people giving the display are subscribing to the cost of making arrangements, as they do, means that the exemption from Swedish tax to the manufacturers here will continue to apply?</P>
    <P>Apart from the explanatory note, I think it is a pity that there is not attached somewhere to the agreement, or to the Order, a table of contents, or an index.  It may be intended to incorporate such when the final printed copy is issued.  This is a long Order, a complicated Order, and one in respect of which a table of contents, or an index similar to that which is incorporated in an Act, would be of tremendous assistance to those who must refer to it from time to time.  I think there should also be a somewhat more explanatory note available after the agreement is ratified.  The explanatory note is certainly helpful but I think it could be supplemented by slightly greater detail, and possibly there is some more detailed summary in the Minister's brief which would be of great assistance to anyone who had to consider the terms of it.  Such a supplementary memorandum could easily be included, subject to the note that is to be found in the existing explanatory note, which sets out that while it is not part of the Order and, therefore, is not binding, at the same time it includes the general purport.</P>
    <P>As we are on this question of double taxation relief, perhaps I might be permitted to ask the Minister if there are official explanatory memoranda issued dealing with the effects of the Canadian and American agreements? I cannot remember if there are, and I should also like to ask are there any other double taxation agreements under negotiation?  France is a case where such an agreement clearly seems to be needed.  Now that some French companies are setting up factories here, it would seem to be necessary and desirable that we should endeavour to negotiate a double taxation agreement with the French authorities so as to <Col N="1587" /> provide the same facilities for residents in France who may start manufacturing operations here as we are providing in this agreement for residents of Sweden.  Germany, of course, is a similar case in point.</P>
    <P>In saying that I do not want to be unfair to the Minister or to the Revenue.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I accept without question that the negotiation of a double taxation agreement with any country, particularly one that has a different system of taxation from ours, is a matter that requires an immense amount of ground work before one can get down to the real negotiating end of the bargain.  Therefore it is a thing that cannot be done perhaps as quickly and as speedily as everyone would like.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to tell the House whether there is any form of subsidiary body to O.E.E.C. in existence which endeavours to iron out taxation differences between one country and another?  Is it possible through O.E.E.C. to arrive at some system of what one might term a standardised form of double taxation agreement? It may be, however, that the systems of taxation in all countries are far too different to provide such standardisation, but whatever our individual views may be in Ireland, it does seem that we are moving forward to the concept of there being a greater flow between one State and another in Europe in trading matters.  The establishment of the Common Market, E.E.C., the negotiations leading up to the E.F.T.A. and the fact that the Taoiseach said that we were considering the implications of joining G.A.T.T., to which I referred last night, all make it clear that there will have to be many more double taxation agreements between countries than were necessary up to this.</P>
    <P>If that is so, and I think everybody will agree it is, would it not be desirable that we should be in the position that there should be some standardisation in the form of double taxation agreements, sponsored by O.E.E.C. or some similar organisation, though I cannot say what other organisation there would be, which would make negotiation of these arrangements very <Col N="1588" /> much more simple in the future?  The Minister is in a strong position to take such a line because in this agreement we have gone further than was possible before.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the credit system has meant that we have got here the right to offset in Sweden not merely taxation suffered here but tax that might be suffered if we had not got the incentives provided by the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956, which I introduced, and which was extended and improved by the present Minister in subsequent legislation. Having got that principle accepted here it would seem to be desirable, and almost essential, that we should go one better and endeavour to get that principle accepted in relation to other countries with which we are bound to have far greater trading relations in the future.  Of necessity, when one is to be involved in more intimate trading relations, more intimate taxation arrangements have also to be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman began by saying that the necessity for these double taxation agreements arose mainly because of the tax incentives introduced here in 1956, in a Bill which he brought in when Minister for Finance, and which were expanded in subsequent Budgets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, but I would not agree that they were not necessary before that.  They were necessary but that Bill introduced a new factor. That, however, is only a matter of opinion.  They are becoming all the more necessary as time goes on, and the Deputy is quite right in saying that it takes a lot of time, thought, and great research to negotiate double taxation agreements with other countries because of the different tax systems which all countries have.  Many changes in tax methods have been made over the years and I do not think there are any two countries where we could say exactly the same agreement would suit both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of this agreement is for five years, not four as mentioned by the Deputy, but he was right in <Col N="1589" /> saying that after that it will continue in operation until one country or the other takes action and says: &ldquo;We want to end this.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked about Article 5.  It is exactly the same as the double taxation agreement with Great Britain.  The tax incentive clause referred to in this agreement is a novel feature as far as we are concerned. This is the first agreement containing such a clause.  It is in our interest to have it inserted.  The Deputy can rest assured that the Government will make every effort to have it inserted in new agreements and in old agreements when the opportunity offers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It was because I realised it was so much in our favour that I asked whether the Swedish Parliament had already ratified it.  I would not have referred to it, had they not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an explanatory memorandum available dealing with the agreements with the United States and Canada.  We intend to prepare a more elaborate, and I hope more understandable, memorandum in connection with this agreement.  The negotiations for an agreement with Germany are most advanced and we will probably have a resolution of this kind before the Dáil when we resume in October.  Some progress has been made in the case of Holland and we hope to commence negotiations with Belgium and France in the near future. The O.E.E.C. has a fiscal committee dealing with this matter and our representatives have taken a very active interest in it, being actually on the <Col N="1590" /> working party preparing the model agreement.  In fact, in the agreement before us, a number of the model clauses laid down by O.E.E.C. have been incorporated.  Of course, in many cases they had to be modified to suit the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I shall endeavour to deal, as far as I can, with the points raised by the Deputy.  With regards to immovable property, as the Deputy pointed out, the law here is different from that in Sweden, but I think Article 9 should satisfy the Deputy on that point. Roughly, what it says is this: our law will apply here and Swedish law will apply there; we each will look at it from our own point of view.  Where there is a double residence, it is decided that we shall give relief here on Swedish tax paid and Sweden will give relief on Irish tax paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it on the same proportionate basis of allowances and expenses as exists in the case of the double residence agreement between here and Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think it would be a bit different.  You pay the same at the end but it is worked out a different way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You pay only one tax. In Sweden, there is a difference in the <Col N="1591" /> taxation of companies.  Here, as we know, if a company pays income tax on its profits and then distributes the profits by way of dividend, there is no further tax, but in Sweden there is a double tax.  The company pays tax on its profits and when the dividends are paid, the recipient pays tax again. This may answer another question raised by the Deputy.  If a Swedish company has a subsidiary here and the subsidiary pays over profits to the parent company in Sweden, they are not taxable in Sweden.  In that case, we get the tax.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about Córas Tráchtála.  That would be display and would not attract any liability for tax. It is not a trading company and therefore would not be liable.  I am afraid I have not answered all the detailed questions put by the Deputy, but perhaps I might plead this.  Only this morning, for instance, I got a query about double taxation arrangements with the United States and I was told by the Revenue Commissioners it would take some time to answer it. Therefore, difficulties do arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report <Col N="1592" /> progress last night, I was dealing with the question of marketing.  The measure of our failure to compete on the British market has not been so much the failure of our farmers to answer the call for increased production but rather our failure to compete with the highly specialised marketing techniques of our competitors in that market.</P>
      <P>I want to compliment the Minister in removing from farm buildings the threat of revaluation.  That was something long overdue.  It gives to farmers prepared to invest their capital in buildings a guarantee that they will not be penalised in perpetuity by the Commissioners of Valuation.  That is only equitable in view of the considerable amount of legislation passed by this House giving all kinds of grants and reliefs to those engaged in industry.</P>
      <P>Last night, Deputy Sweetman made a reference to the Agricultural Institute and said there was a rumour that an attempt had been made to restrict the Institute in a matter of grants from the Department.  We set up the Institute here a few years ago and it was long overdue.  It was at least an important milestone in agricultural development here.  To date they have pushed ahead at a pace that none of us could anticipate a year or two ago.  Apart from the grants made available to that Institute by the Government, I think industries allied to agriculture should take some interest in the financing of such undertakings.  If we were to examine the pattern of agricultural research in Britain we would find that a considerable amount of valuable research is being done by firms like Imperial Chemicals, British Oil and Cake Mills, and even the petrol companies such as Esso, as well as by research stations attached to the Agricultural Science Faculties in different British Universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some criticisms of the work of our Institute.  There are people who say that much of the research which we might undertake has been done elsewhere.  I think that is wrong because in many instances research done in another country has no practical application here.  If we take <Col N="1593" /> the Grassland Research Institute at Chorley near Maidenhead, and try to apply its findings to our conditions, we should find they were not applicable. for instance, in their grassland and wheat research, conversion ratios would not equate to our conditions.  As far as I know, the land attached to that station is based on a chalk subsoil and the average rainfall in the area is something like 20 inches whereas our the average rainfall is 42 inches.  We can see straight away why their findings could not apply here.</P>
    <P>The experiments done on various varieties of plants would give quite different results under Irish conditions. For the first time we had a scientific seminar last summer and British scientists, accustomed to going to Belfast to attend such seminars, came to Dublin and were loud in their acclaim of the work undertaken by our Institute.  We were fortunate in having a man like Dr. Walsh appointed as Director, a man with a reputation extending far outside the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I should mention it on this Estimate but I often think that our present Department of Agriculture has become an administrative colossus and one must have sympathy with any man who has thrust on him the responsibility of administering that empire.  The time is long overdue when the administrative responsibility of that huge Department should be shared by somebody else.  If we decide to put a Parliamentary Secretary into the Department of Industry and Commerce and divide the responsibility there the time is surely overdue for such a development in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJBurke" hpid="Mr. J.J. Burke Mr. J.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time I think everybody, with the possible exception of the Government, realises the importance of agriculture. We cannot lay too much stress on the importance of agriculture, as it is from agriculture we must get the necessary revenue to prevent our whole financial structure from toppling.  It is generally agreed that every man, woman and child, whether in city, town or country, in the last analysis depend for their <Col N="1594" /> standard of living on the Irish farmers' ability to export profitably.  It is also generally agreed that the only thing we can export profitably is livestock and livestock products.  It appears to be the simple duty of any Government to try as far as possible to increase the numbers of livestock and to leave the land in a fit condition to carry the extra numbers.</P>
      <P>During the inter-Party Government's term of office everything possible was done in that direction.  Under the Land Reclamation Scheme at least 1,000,000 extra acres of land were reclaimed; lime was made available at the cheapest rate in Europe; and very up-to-date soil-testing facilities, which were lacking up to then, were provided.  Every farmer realises that it is practically useless to spread manure on his land unless he gets that land properly tested and finds out what it requires.</P>
      <P>During his term of office Deputy Dillon made sure that those services were made available to the farmers.  It was not very much use to reclaim 1,000,000 acres and to place numbers of livestock on the land unless somebody made sure that we would have a market for the extra livestock.  During the time of the inter-Party Government in 1948 Deputy Dillon went to London and negotiated a Cattle Agreement with Britain, which was responsible for the increased price of livestock from 1948 to 1958.  In 1958 that agreement expired and one would think it was the simple duty of the Government at that time to try to negotiate another agreement for our chief industry, the export of cattle, but apparently, this Government does not take that problem seriously.  They appear to have just sat back and done nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who knows anything about the livestock trade at the present time knows that cattle prices were never as bad during living memory.  They are even worse than during the economic war.  During the economic war prices were bad enough but farmers could sell their cattle.  I have been at several fairs recently.  A farmer could be there for a week and nobody would ask him what brought him unless he had an <Col N="1595" /> exceptionally fine type of beast to sell. We are all very anxious that the standard of cattle should be improved but there is always a large amount of second-grade cattle which must be got rid of.</P>
    <P>In west Roscommon the position is so bad that very many small farmers with holdings of 15 to 25 acres have locked their doors and gone to England.  That is a very sad state of affairs.  It is sad for the families who have to go and it is disastrous for the country.  We all know what happens when the farmer abandons a small farm.  It is set on the 11 months' system to a neighbour or somebody else.  In the first year production goes down by about 25 per cent.  In the next year or two it will decrease by a further 25 per cent. After five or six years the land will be covered with rushes and will produce about one-third of its potential. If that sort of thing continues I do not know where the revenue will come from to keep the State going.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to say that the industrial arm is developing.  I am very glad to hear that that is the case but the raw material of industry has to be imported and the only real source of the money to buy such imports is our exports of livestock.  If farms are allowed to become derelict the national income will be very considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>There is a trend that has a very bad effect, especially in the west of Ireland. Far too much money is being spent on expensive foreign machinery.  Half the amount of machinery would do if there were a co-operative effort among small farmers.  That cannot take place without some direction from a body such as the Sugar Company. The country is full of tractors and expensive machinery for which there is not half enough work.  It is robbing the small farmer and a much more serious aspect is that it is robbing the State.  Every penny that goes to buy, maintain and fuel this machinery leaves the State.  It is all very fine to have machinery in top production and giving a return but in the west of Ireland very little return is being got for the amount of expensive <Col N="1596" /> machinery there.  I know places where there are tractors and expensive machinery where two fairly good horses would do all that has to be done.</P>
    <P>It will be generally agreed among farmers that in this highly competitive age technical advice is absolutely essential, if we are to get the maximum return from the land.  The parish plan should be reintroduced.  I know that the Minister is not too keen on the parish plan.  Deputy Moher referred to it last night.  He said there was duplication of services, that county committees of agriculture, by statute, were supposed to provide advice for the farmers.  That was the theory but, in practice, we know what happened. Several county committees of agriculture employed a chief agricultural officer and, possibly, one or two assistants.  The reason for that was that the members of the county committees of agriculture were loth to put an extra burden on the rates by employing extra staff, one-half of whose salaries and expenses had to come from the rates, whereas the parish agent was paid directly by the State.</P>
    <P>Advice and lectures without demonstration are of very little use.  The small staff of agricultural advisers went around the country giving lectures in schools and various other places, very good lectures.  Farmers came and listened to them and agreed that they were very good lectures but they did very little about them.  Under the parish plan, groups of farmers who were interested applied for the services of an adviser and, in due course, the adviser went to individual farms in the area and stayed with the farmer and got the work done.  The results obtained by demonstration were twice as good as those obtained from lectures.  When good results were obtained on the farms where the parish agent stayed all the farmers in the area followed suit.</P>
    <P>In County Roscommon the scheme worked very well and there was no duplication whatever between the parish agent and the county committees of agriculture.  I was a member of the county committee of agriculture for ten years and we always <Col N="1597" /> found that the greatest harmony existed between the staff of the county committees of agriculture and the parish agent.  As a matter of fact, the parish agent was in constant touch with the chief agricultural officer and they made sure that there was no duplication whatever.</P>
    <P>Some people are inclined to think that farmers are reasonably well off at the present time.  I do not know about the midlands, but I know that in the west farmers are in a very bad way.  Rates have become a shocking burden as far as they are concerned. They have trebled in the last decade or so.  Wages have gone up to meet the increased cost of living.  The farmer has to pay all these increases. He has to pay the increased cost of maintaining his wife and family.  His income is gradually going down and, as far as I can see, the Government are doing nothing about it.</P>
    <P>According to statistics, the agricultural income has gone down by £17 million recently, but if there was a check taken on the present year that figure would be doubled, at least. Unless the Government take the matter seriously and make some agreement with the British in the very near future we will have lost our cattle trade completely.</P>
    <P>In my area at the present time, where farmers mainly depend on raising store cattle, fifty per cent. of the farmers are not able to meet their commitments.  They have the stock but cannot sell it and have no ready money.  The Government will have to take the matter seriously and try to negotiate some type of suitable agreement.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to be continually talking about the bovine T.B. eradication scheme.  That is very important, I admit, and should be completed as speedily as possible, but there is very little use in having T.B.-free cattle unless there is a market for them. More stress should be laid on getting a proper market.  There should be less talk about the T.B. scheme and more action.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a lot of messing around with the scheme for the eradication <Col N="1598" /> of bovine T.B.  I know that it is a huge problem for any Government, but it should be handled courageously and got through in an expeditious way just as human tuberculosis was eradicated in the inter-Party Government's term of office.</P>
    <P>There is a point that I should like to mention, which is an important matter for the area that I represent.  In the clearance area where a herd has two clear tests and in the third and final tests one or two beasts react or are inconclusive, the herd should not be put through the whole process again.  Reactor cattle should be bought and taken away by the Department immediately and the farmer should get a clear certificate for the remainder of his herd.  That would expedite matters and I do not see how it would interfere with the eradication of bovine T.B.</P>
    <P>The marketing of all our agricultural produce should be completely reorganised.  There is&mdash;and I have it on better authority than my own&mdash; a vast market in Britain for Irish bacon.  The only reason English shops will not stock Irish bacon is that there is no continuity of supply. They will have too much one week and none at all the next, with the result that they cannot deal with Irish suppliers.  They must deal with Danish or other suppliers who will ensure them a continuity of supply.  I know that is easier said than done but there should be some way of overcoming the difficulty. The market is there; all we need do is to handle it in a sensible and businesslike fashion.</P>
    <P>It is high time the bacon industry and, for that matter, the whole dead meat trade were taken over by the Government.  Everybody knows that the factories are making enormous profits at the expense of the small farmer.  They appear to be giving any price and grading any way they like. It is all very fine to say that is happening but we need proof.  I have proof in one instance.  A man had a beast which he brought to a certain factory. This man said this in public; there was no behind the scenes talk about it. Having brought the beast to the factory, they told him they would send <Col N="1599" /> him a cheque.  He said: &ldquo;No&rdquo;; he wanted the money then.  He was given a cheque for £22 which he refused. He said he wanted to see the manager and was told the manager was not available.  He insisted on seeing somebody in charge and eventually they gave him a cheque for £33.  He happened to be a butcher and he knew the value of his beast.  When that can happen to such a man, what must be the experience of the average countryman?  It is high time the Government stepped in and took control of the situation.</P>
    <P>The next point I wish to mention does not relate strictly to this Estimate but agriculture being the main Department in this State, the Minister should impress on his colleague, the Minister for Lands, the urgent necessity of giving additions of land, where land is available, to smallholders.  The present policy appears to be that 18 or 20 Irish acres represent an economic holding.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows anything about agriculture knows that it is impossible for a man to raise a family in any reasonable comfort on a farm of less than 40 acres.  The Minister should impress on his colleague the necessity of giving these men an extra 20 to 22 acres.  The Land Commission are not doing that at the moment. They regard 20 acres as an economic holding.  I wish some of these gentlemen were sent out to live on 22 acres of land and they would soon find out whether it was an economic holding or not.</P>
    <P>I would again impress on the Minister the urgent necessity of making an agreement in relation to the cattle trade.  If things are allowed to continue on their present basis, a serious problem will develop.  In my own county, which is reasonably well-off, if the present trend continues for a further six months the rate collector will go without his rates.  It is impossible for a man to pay rates in present circumstances because he cannot sell his stock.  I hope the Minister will look into that question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies from <Col N="1600" /> the Opposition side have made great play of the fact that last year and in 1958 the incomes of farmers showed a big diminution.  They directed most of their efforts to suggesting that that was mainly or completely due to mismanagement on the part of the Fianna Fáil Minister and Government.  I was surprised to hear some speakers from the Opposition who are farmers, and whom one would have expected to know something about farming, making this suggestion.  Any Deputy who understands anything at all about agriculture realises that in the past two years production has been depressed considerably by weather conditions. A good many of the speakers referred to the bad harvest of 1958. It is no harm to remind the House that even if weather conditions in 1958 had been perfect, there would still have been no harvest in that year worth reaping because a fungus disease had already destroyed many crops.  That applied to all cereals and it applied particularly in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny where the farmers suffered heavy losses.</P>
      <P>The same thing occurred in 1959. The production of grass simply fizzled out.  Consequently the production of milk, the supply of milk to the creameries and the returns for that milk were substantially reduced. Along with that, grazing conditions lent themselves to the spread of parasitic diseases and cattle herds throughout the country are still feeling the effects of infestation that they picked up under the close grazing conditions of last summer and autumn.  It is not a subject of which political use should be made.  It is not a good sign of the standard of debate in this House to see the misfortune of a great many of our people being exploited in this way.  I am perfectly confident that our farmers are sufficiently resourceful and courageous to stage a comeback when the weather returns to normal.  We should be thankful this year that up to now it has been very promising indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor that helped to depress cattle prices in the past 12 months and I think that will continue to depress them is that over the last period of years the British authorities have <Col N="1601" /> applied themselves very vigorously to the task of increasing their cattle population.  The results they have had up to now have been very significant indeed.  The indications are that, for farmers and the Department of Agriculture here, we shall have to face very serious competition from Britain's own farmers, when one considers the increases in cattle numbers achieved up to the present with the aid of new developments like artificially-induced twinning of cattle.  We must necessarily expect that since the supply of livestock to the British market is considerably increased the price must also necessarily be depressed to a proportionate extent.  I have no doubt that with the aids we have at our disposal we shall be able to meet that problem when we come up against it.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch on a question that has bedevilled the cattle trade in Ireland for the past couple of years and that is the row between the Irish Cattle Traders' Association and the cattle markets.  There does not seem to be any visible sign that this dispute is nearing solution.  The Minister for Agriculture has made a very determined attempt already to solve this problem.  I regret to say he has not met with any success.  I would ask him to avail of every opportunity to impress upon the disputing parties on both sides to sink their differences, whatever they may be, to remember that it will be the farmers and stock-producers of Ireland who will suffer by the disagreement and that they also in the long run will have to suffer.  I do not submit that either side has a monopoly of the grievances or that all the fault lies on one side.  I do not believe it does.</P>
    <P>It would be salutary if the Minister were to enquire into the way the business is conducted in some cattle markets in the country.  It would be a good idea if the Minister were to enquire into the methods by which their buying organisations are constituted and run.  It might be well for the Minister to interest himself in that question.  The facilities the farmer hoped to enjoy when he erected co-operative cattle markets here and <Col N="1602" /> there throughout the country are not accruing to him as they should, particularly because of this row.  When I mention cattle markets I want to say that in my part of the country I believe cattle markets are being erected in too close proximity to one another.  Sometimes they are erected by private enterprise for the stated purpose of making money.  If the farmers like them they may avail of them that is all right. There should be a minimum range between each cattle market.  I refer to the distance between one market and another.  In County Kilkenny, the distances are much too close to one another and in time some must necessarily fail for want of supply of cattle.</P>
    <P>I have been thinking on this question and wondering whether it would be a good idea for the Minister to introduce a system of licensing for the erection of cattle markets.  Otherwise we shall have some white elephants on our hands in future times and the money that has been collected to build the markets will have been spent in vain.</P>
    <P>I am glad it is proposed to spend so much money on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis scheme.  The progress is not what it might be.  I do not propose to lay the blame at anybody's feet.  It is terribly difficult to get moving.  Even at present, in my constituency, being one of the southern counties, it is a common complaint that it is very difficult to transact any business with regard to bovine tuberculosis because of the scarcity of staff and the fact that veterinary surgeons are run off their feet.  Anybody in County Kilkenny endeavouring to become attested must do all his bovine tuberculosis eradication work through the office in Waterford.  Our Committee of Agriculture have for some time been pressing the Minister and his Department to establish an office in the City of Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>It is quite unrealistic that a person living in Urlingford in County Kilkenny must get in touch with the bovine tuberculosis office in Waterford, maybe 50 miles away, in order to solve his difficulties and do his business.  It is quite unsatisfactory for an ordinary farmer to go into a public <Col N="1603" /> telephone booth and try to transact his business in respect of this scheme with somebody at the end of the line whom he has never seen.  He wants to go into an office and talk to the man there about it.  Our cattle population is pretty considerable and the establishment of a bovine tuberculosis eradication office in Kilkenny would be a definite help to us there.</P>
    <P>Veterinary surgeons are so constantly busy in the actual carrying out of tuberculosis tests that it would not be possible for them to do any clerical work or keep individual herd records.  Some arrangement should be made with the veterinary surgeons so that records of individual herds will be kept and the herd-owners will know exactly where they stand. I am an accredited herd-owner.  I do not know whether or not I am at liberty to sell cattle from my accredited herd because I had one animal in proximity to the herd which gave inconclusive test results.  I do not know rightly whether or not I can sell the rest of the cattle.  That is the type of question I should like to put to an officer in county Kilkenny, but, at present, I must make the inquiry through county Waterford.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to mention in connection with the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  I have personal experience of the unsatisfactory nature of the 14-day testing. I know of an instance where 18 cattle were put into isolation at the beginning of the year before being accredited and of the 18, eight were finally passed into the accredited herd. The others went down.  I have met English farmers who bought 14-day test cattle and their accounts of the 14-day test were very bad.  I had occasion to get in touch with the Department complaining about certain veterinary surgeons who did not seem to be carrying out the tests as they should be carried out.  There should be no carelessness in a matter so serious.  I am glad to say that the vast majority of the veterinary surgeons in my constituency are very conscientious but there are always exceptions to the rule.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> There is another aspect of that matter upon which I should like to comment.  I am told that there are a great many in-calf cows being sent to the cannery in Waterford for slaughter.  I have even heard that live calves have been taken out of railway trucks.  I think that situation should not be allowed to continue.  If an in-calf cow proves to be a reactor, it should be permitted to go full time to have that calf and then taken to the cannery for slaughter.  This is a matter really for the farmer himself but he may have no place to keep such reactors.  In-calf cows are being slaughtered and the farmers in my constituency think there is something wrong about that.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers mentioned the import of maize against the export of similar quantities of barley.  The importation of maize is not necessary. Certain people derive a very considerable profit from it.  In relation to the differential in price between malting and feeding barley, I had an idea that it should be possible, since the arrival of new varieties of barley&mdash;like Proctor which could be used either as feeding or malting barley&mdash;to strike a flat price for dual purpose barley of that kind a good deal in excess of the present price for feeding barley.</P>
    <P>At the present time contracts for malting barley are very inequitably distributed.  Sometimes it depends on the personal preferences of the individual grain merchants or maltsters and sometimes it depends on other considerations. It may be a surprise to the Minister to learn that.  At any rate, there are people who can get contracts for all the malting barley they want, while other people cannot get any malting barley contracts at all.  That seems to be very unfair and unjust. A simple way out of that would be to equalise the price by levelling the two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of feeding barley might be raised.  It is generally felt that those who produce meal for <Col N="1605" /> pigs and livestock get more profit out of it than the farmers or anybody else. I subscribe to that belief.  Deputy Moher last night cited figures, as only he can, in connection with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder.  It is a question that should be examined.  A very careful examination of the matter would reveal that the profits accruing are distributed in a rather surprising way.  With regard to the superphosphate subsidy, it is one of the best measures ever introduced by the Department of Agriculture.  Opposition speakers spoke about the million acres of land which were put back into production through the agency of Deputy Dillon during his term of office. There is a farm of 123 acres within half a mile of where I live.  About three-fourths of that land was as sound as a bell and the rest of it is a bit rushy.  This whole farm was included as having been reclaimed.  I think that in the 1,000,000 acres of land that were alleged to have been reclaimed under the land project that 123 acres were included.  About 20 acres of wet land were reclaimed under the land project on this farm in fact.</P>
      <P>The figure of 1,000,000 acres is completely false.  It gives a completely false picture of the amount of land that was made available for tillage. It gives a false picture of the amount and quality of the work done.  I contrast that position with the introduction of the superphosphate subsidy. Speaking as a farmer, I would prefer to make use of the superphosphate any day.  I often wonder if any research work has been done in this country with serpentine superphosphate.  It is possible to get the same result with less superphosphate, by the inclusion of serpentine.  I believe that in New Zealand all superphosphate is serpentine superphosphate and I think an experiment on that line should be made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Agricultural Institute have applied themselves to the task of machinery testing.  In the past ten years, we have spent millions <Col N="1606" /> of pounds on machinery that is quite unsuitable for the work it was intended to do.  I hope that in due course the Institute will be in a position to recommend various types of tractors, ploughs and other machinery and give them recommendations of a very detailed type which would preclude the purchase of farm machinery which really is not suitable for this country at all.  I am very glad to note that new departure.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that one aspect of our livestock export trade that is worthy of consideration is the lamb trade.  Again, I must refer to what Deputy Moher said last night in this regard.  He quoted figures which showed the comparison between New Zealand's exports to Britain and our exports.  Our sheep numbers have been coming up at a very encouraging rate in the past few years but more attention could be paid to the selection of stock rams and sheep for the type of lamb that is wanted for the British market.  This is not as easy a question as it seems.  There are different types of sheep which suit different localities but in general it would appear that the heavy boned type of sheep which is the most common type are not suitable for the breeding of lambs for the lamb trade. In ordinary arable farming, some type of Downs or Suffolk cross would probably be the most suitable but, in respect of mountain sheep, I am not competent to say what type of breed would be the best.  It is a question which should be looked into carefully and as early as possible because it is a market which we can expand and one which we shall require in view of the position in regard to the cattle trade which we discussed earlier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote for the Department of Agriculture in a country such as ours must, I would say, be regarded&mdash;apart from the Vote on the Taoiseach's Department which covers policy generally&mdash;as the most important and the premier Estimate for the year, and as such one must approach it.  Before dealing with any of the aspects of agriculture in detail, I should like to say in a general way that the <Col N="1607" /> speakers on the Government side, particularly on this Vote, expect from us a degree of credulity in their apparent simplicity.  I could not help admiring the naïveté of Deputy Gibbons who has just spoken and who plaintively asked in relation to the depressed prices available to the agricultural community at the moment, that such misfortune should not be made a political plaything and should not be used to gain political advantage.</P>
      <P>Such sentiments are extremely admirable and in fact if put into practice, would be even more admirable still.  But those of us with any memory at all cannot forget that the Fianna Fáil Party in asking for such indulgence in Government are departing considerably from the practice in which they indulged so freely when in Opposition.  In late 1956, when there was some depression in cattle prices, when economic conditions generally were militating against the Government, there was a howl, not insinuating, but alleging mismanagement under Deputy Dillon, who was then Minister for Agriculture.  Those howls alleging that mismanagement came from practically all of the more vocal members of the Fianna Fáil Party then in Opposition.</P>
      <P>To-day Deputy Gibbons asks us not to blame the Minister for Agriculture or the Government on any aspect of agricultural administration for the deplorable position in which Ireland's agriculture finds itself to-day.  He takes a stand with triplets in his arms, triplets named fungus diseases, unsuitable climatic conditions and grazing conditions which give rise to embarrassment in the cattle trade.  I am sure that during the previous Government's administration, one could if one sought hard enough find equally effective excuses&mdash;and I hasten to say effective verbally but which on factual examination and closer scrutiny reveal an entirely different situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who at the present time goes through this country, be it either on a political or a business mission, and comes across fair or mart activity, cannot help noticing the atmosphere of near-gloom that prevails at all such <Col N="1608" /> gatherings.  Not alone in the majority of cases are prices appallingly low but there is a very keen shortage of demand for what the farmers have to offer at the organised fairs and markets. I come from a constituency part of which has very good land and part of which is not so good.  The vast majority of it is poor and in the main the holdings are extremely small.  In the absence of any earnings either internally or by way of remittances from outside the country, each small holding must pay for the maintenance of the family which lives upon it and must pay for the other outgoings which the head of the house is called upon to meet from time to time.</P>
    <P>When we look at the situation in which we find ourselves today in relation to the price obtainable, or the lack of price obtainable, for the commodities which the farmers have to offer we are immediately confronted with the question of how can he meet, or how does he propose to meet, his commitments by way of ordinary maintenance and the outgoings which fall to be met from time to time.  I heard Deputy Burke from County Roscommon, which is a comparatively well-off county, say that if the present trend continues&mdash;and he is an experienced farmer&mdash;in six months' time in Roscommon the financial situation of the farming community will be such that the rate collector will have to depart without the rates.</P>
    <P>If that is to be the situation in Roscommon, if the trend continues&mdash;and I sincerely hope it will not&mdash;what will be the situation in other constituencies with poorer land and smaller holdings? The maintenance costs are the same from the point of view of the purchase of food and clothing.  The rates will be somewhat lower, of course, but the income will be correspondingly low in, say, parts of North Mayo in comparison with Roscommon and Kilkenny which is the county Deputy Gibbons comes from.</P>
    <P>For some time past this whole question of family emigration has been causing me as well as many other people&mdash;I am certain not only on this side, but on the Government side of <Col N="1609" /> the House&mdash;a considerable amount of agitation.  I am certainly perturbed in no small degree and I am being forced to the conclusion that the departure of whole families from small holdings, which is now the new pattern of emigration, is due to the high cost of maintenance, and the high demands in relation to outgoings, as against the depressed prices of the few animals they have for sale from time to time during the course of the year.</P>
    <P>Anyone coming from a constituency such as Mayo or any constituency on the coast&mdash;and indeed some inland constituencies&mdash;is perfectly familiar with the pattern of the economy of small holdings.  They sell some dry cattle, change their milch cows, rear a pig or perhaps two or three, keep some poultry to sell either chicks or eggs, but the money they receive from the sale of that livestock goes towards the upkeep of the house and the purchase of food and clothing generally.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the gap has become too wide between the income of such holdings in very many cases and what has to be paid out.  The struggle to survive has become so great that families have given up and have departed, from the head of the house to the youngest in it.  That is an extremely serious situation, even if it happens to only one or two families in one parish, but I have cited here before many such cases in the different parishes of the constituency I represent.</P>
    <P>That has a double effect.  It is bad nationally and it is bad economically that whatever production there was on those little holdings prior to the families leaving, there is no production on them now.  Whatever came into those holdings by way of emigrants' remittances prior to the families leaving no longer counts, so there is a reduction in the income from abroad and a reduction in production at home.  In other words, the life blood of the nation is going when these families depart and places are left lying fallow.</P>
    <P>Very often there is a third loss to the country in that considerable sums of money have been spent on housing <Col N="1610" /> grants and drainage, or there may have been other subventions from the State which have now gone for nothing in the case of these people.  That is a situation about which neither the Government nor the Opposition can be complacent.  It is a situation which calls for urgent attention, and unless that attention is urgently given, I am afraid the trend which Deputy Burke from Roscommon anticipates may well continue, and we shall be left with a situation with which it will be very difficult to deal.</P>
    <P>I strongly hold the view that this Government wasted time in relation to trade pacts with other countries&mdash;not only Britain but other countries&mdash;and were utterly devoid of any plan or concept for the future development of agriculture or for keeping in line with the developments taking place all over Europe and, indeed, all over the world, in the different aspects of economics. While it has been said by other speakers, I want to say again that that waste of time took place principally during the foolish campaign, against proportional representation which this Government indulged in for well-high over a year during which the efforts of Parliament, councils, debating societies, and public men were all wasted. Their minds, energies, and attention, were all diverted into channels of thought of no economic consequence and when we suddenly woke up, having saved the system of voting, we found that as a nation we had lost.</P>
    <P>While all that was happening the Danes, the New Zealanders, the Argentinians, and, in fact, anyone who had anything to offer in the way of agricultural produce in the British market, had been in Britain, holding their councils and gaining advantages which would have been ours had the Government been sufficiently alive to the necessity for watching the market&mdash;the market that is closest to us and the market upon which our survival as an agricultural community depends.  I think that that is accepted now, at this late hour, by even the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of agricultural development in which I am particularly <Col N="1611" /> interested.  If it is the intention to develop an export market&mdash;I do not want to be taken now as opposed to industrial development in what I am going to say&mdash;the one that should be developed is the one based on the raw material available at home.  In that context I refer in particular to the rearing of sheep, Not alone has the sheep industry a tremendous carcase value from the point of view of human consumption, at home and abroad, but there are tremendous possibilities in the wool end of the industry.  There are markets for knitwear and tweeds.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should collaborate with his colleagues, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for the Gaeltacht. I direct his attention and theirs to the huge market available in Africa, not to mention others that are there, ready and waiting for development. This is a line of country which would be of assistance to our people in those areas where they need most help&mdash; around the mountains, and hillsides and commonages along the north-west, the west, and the south-west coast, where sheep can be profitably raised and where it is essential there should be available to the people all the advice and assistance necessary to enable them to go in for sheep farming in a big way by suitable breeding.  All the advice necessary is available from the wool merchants and the manufacturers of tweed.  They give it to me.  I am sure they would be only too delighted to give it to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have received numerous complaints about the delay in the sanction of farm buildings, the provision of water supplies, and all the kindred projects and amenities that should be available to the people through the special section of the Department of Agriculture set up to deal with these matters.  There is, too, complaint in relation to the slowness of the grants. I do not know why that should be. I do not know the reason for it. Perhaps the Minister will explain the position and give an assurance that avoidable delay will not occur in the future.  That will remove some of the <Col N="1612" /> burden of complaint from the people. There are also complaints about the situation with regard to seed potatoes. The system seems to have fallen down completely.</P>
    <P>I note there is to be a new board in relation to the bacon industry, which will deal with the centralisation of markets for bacon.  That may, or may not, be a good thing.  There was a very good board which dealt with the export of eggs.  That was abolished by the present Government.  Now it is being brought back again.</P>
    <P>In agriculture the most important thing is the development and promotion of markets.  In Great Britain I meet people from time to time&mdash;not in London, but in other heavy centres of population&mdash;who would be glad to get Irish butter, Irish bacon, Irish eggs. They do not seem to be available to them.  Sooner or later there will have to be a fresh attack made in the direction and development of pig rearing, pig breeding, and bacon production generally.  That may cost money.  It will certainly require dynamic organisation on the part of the Department of Agriculture.  It will also require a psychological approach to imbue our people with the need for long-term planning.  If we have a year in which a particular commodity fails, we are very prone, I think, as a people to dodge that commodity the next year. The agricultural community will have to be trained in the idea that things must be done, that they must plan on a long-term basis, and work hard; above all, they must be prepared to take the good year with the bad.</P>
    <P>On the question of markets and market organisation, at the beginning of this Government's term of office, the Minister for Finance announced jubilantly, and the announcement was received with a matching jubilation by his own Party, that £250,000 was being set aside for the development of markets.  We have not heard very much about that £250,000 since.  We have not heard how much has been spent or the manner in which it was spent. Perhaps the Minister might deal with that matter when he comes to reply and tell us something more about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> I want now to pay tribute to those who operate the peatlands project at Glenamoy.  This project, as the House is aware, was substituted for the mad programme, which is being reintroduced in another part of my constituency now on a political rather than an economic basis, of growing grass on blanket bog for conversion into grass meal.  Peatlands is a very worthy institution.  It is admirably run. Curiously enough, from what I see and from what I hear, everything that is grown there experimentally seems to be meeting with a considerable degree of success except grass.  I shall have more to say about that later.</P>
    <P>On the question of the eradication of bovine T.B., I am not prepared to deal with the niceties of the situation, but I have one comment to make which, I think, supports comments made on both sides in relation to administrative detail.  It is not unusual for me, or for other Deputies, to receive letters something after this fashion: &ldquo;I applied some six, nine, or twelve months ago to have my cattle tested and so far nobody has come near me.&rdquo; That is probably something that could be dealt with in a very simple way.  The situation could, I think, be put right.</P>
    <P>The drive to complete the eradication of bovine tuberculosis should be intensified and the House should be willing to give even more money for it, if it is sought, in order to bring our cattle into line with the healthy condition of cattle obtaining in the markets in which we seek to sell and, in addition to that, to have us ready for whatever sort of trade alignment will follow in Europe, whether in two blocs, one bloc or in whatever number of blocs they ultimately align themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is really very much the Minister can do, even in response to the exhortation of Deputy Gibbons, to try to settle the differences between cattle dealers who favour the fair green idea and those who want to have marts.  I for one, certainly would not favour the regulation of the building of marts, or their running under licence from the Minister for Agriculture or any other Minister.  If they are to be white elephants, as <Col N="1614" /> Deputy Gibbons fears, let them.  The people who are building them are doing it with their eyes open.  They are doing it by way of ordinary commercial enterprise, and to bring them within the purview of the Department of Agriculture, by way of licence or otherwise, would be a dangerous step. In any event, it would be a great interference with the exercise of people's free will, especially in relation to the use of their own private property and their own money.</P>
    <P>A commendable feature of Irish agricultural life has been the development of voluntary organisations such as the National Farmers' Association, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country-women's Association and such like institutions. Very rightly, Deputy Sweetman deplored the attempt of any political Party to take over these organisations. It would be the end of their usefulness and effectiveness if they allowed themselves to be monopolised and their objectives obscured by becoming strangled by any one political Party.  By all means members of these voluntary organisations should, and must, hold their own political views, and air them within the ranks of their own political Parties, but at different meetings, and while in voluntary organisations they should work together for the common good.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the recent trade agreement with Britain is as good as some people make it out to be.  It is not right that members of the Government should be making utterances that show a complacency which disregards the facts, and I cannot reconcile what people told me, at any fair or market which I visited in the past year, with statements made by members of the Government saying that the trend is satisfactory, that prosperity is around the corner and that we are now beginning to find ourselves on a firm footing. Such statements may be all right in preaching to the unrepentant converted, but to try to tell people who are in process of packing their little belongings, locking the doors of their houses and departing with their whole families, probably for ever, that the trend is satisfactory and that prosperity is around the corner is not alone a great betrayal of the people's trust <Col N="1615" /> but a magnificent contempt for their intelligence.</P>

      <P>Speaking as a city man on this Vote, I must say that when I look over Fianna Fáil policy in regard to agriculture, I have to express my disappointment and that of the workers who have to pay the piper for the high price of bread, the high price of butter and who, at the same time, have to help subsidise that industry. Not alone do they subsidise it in this country but they subsidise its products on a foreign market.  To say the least of it, it is galling for them to have to subsidise butter and at the same time, be compelled to spread it very thinly on the bread their children are eating. We have heard a lot of talk about self-sufficiency, but if that is part of Fianna Fáil self-sufficiency, I must express my disappointment with it.</P>
      <P>In former years, we heard a lot of talk from the Fianna Fáil benches about cattle ranchers but now they are expressing their fears for the cattle trade.  We all remember the time when they cut the throats of the grand-aunts of these cattle.  Now they show a great change in their policy and are bemoaning the dangers which threaten that trade.  They also thanked God that, in their own words, &ldquo;the cattle trade was gone.&rdquo; They boasted about that, but the only regret farmers have today is that they have not a Dillon in office to make a bargain on their behalf and make a good agreement for their cattle, sheep and pigs.</P>
      <P>One has only to attend fairs throughout the country to hear farmers express their regret that they have not a Dillon in office, but they are hoping that time will come soon.  As one farmer said to me recently: &ldquo;Look over the walls in the countryside and you will see the track of James Dillon's hand.&rdquo; At the same time, he pointed up to the sky, to the vapour trail of a jet plane, and said: &ldquo;That is where the track of Fianna Fáil is. They are up in the air.&rdquo; I think it is about time they came down to earth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farmers in my constituency are very small.  Cromwell saw to that, but the small farmers and small pig producers there are not <Col N="1616" /> pleased with the system of payment for their pigs as operated by the bacon factories.  They cannot understand the different systems and different grades.  One day they will bring a fat pig to the market only to be told that it is a lean pig that is wanted. Next week, they will bring a lean pig and are then told it is a fat pig that is wanted.  That is only making fools of them.  In addition to that, they are paid by cheque which means that a farmer must make a second trip to town and waste another day.</P>
    <P>There was a lot to recommend the old system by which a farmer was paid on the spot.  He knew what he was getting.  He was either satisfied or he did not take the money and, of course, the rest of his family came into town with him that day.  They all got a share of what profit he made and the whole matter took only one day.  Now they have to go back to town again to cash the cheque and that is a waste of time.</P>
    <P>At one time in my area, it was the pig that paid the rates and clothed the children.  That system had a lot to recommend it.  This new system should not be imposed on the people because it is having an adverse reaction. In the factory, on the other hand, it takes only about three hours to process a pig.  The pig may have been on the premises for 13 weeks, but the factory will have more out of that three hours than the farmer will have after three months.  The Department should see to it that each side gets a fair crack of the whip and that the profits are not all on one side. If he wants to get increased production, I hope the Minister will not find himself on the wrong side of the fence. I should like the Minister to give us his views on these matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay mentioned the opportunities for developing our trade with Africa.  Only yesterday I gave a letter to the Taoiseach's Department setting out possibilities of developing our trade with Nigeria.  Nigeria is an infant state with 38,000,000 people. Other countries are waiting for the opportunity to get in there but our Government have no intention of getting cracking.  There is no use sending out a civil servant to these places if you <Col N="1617" /> want to develop trade.  Send out a trade delegation composed of people who have an interest in the business. A consignment of Irish sausages arrived at a certain place in Nigeria recently and they were purchased immediately.  One priest actually motored 40 miles to get these sausages but, if I may use the word, they were &ldquo;swiped&rdquo; before he had the chance. They did not last on the market for two hours.  While that opportunity offered and since we are more friendly with this country than, perhaps, other countries are, we should get moving right away.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to what was popularly known in my area as &ldquo;The Dillon Scheme&rdquo; or the Land Project. Unfortunately, parts of that scheme have been brought to an end.  It was most unfair that young, married men who had given good service over the years should have been displaced.  It is regrettable that the Department took no steps to see that they got priority in the matter of alternative employment on forestry or other activity.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I brought to the notice of the Department the case of a beast which had been injected under the T.B. eradication scheme.  The injection paralysed the neck of the beast and the animal is now worn away to a thread.  That farmer has not got compensation.  It is most unfair that a small farmer, a man with a big family, should be at a loss under a Government scheme.  I do not think even the &ldquo;bone men&rdquo; would take that beast now.  I hope something will be done about it.  You will not get the co-operation of the people if such a system prevails.</P>
    <P>In regard to the sheep trade, the Department should redouble their efforts to see that what has happened in the past will not recur.  There is no use dwelling upon it now but we should have more foresight in looking after the interests of the small farmers, and in the west most of them are sheep rearers.  I trust the Minister will take note of these few points and give me the benefit of his views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of a Deputy, this is the most important Vote that comes before us <Col N="1618" /> each year.  I am sorry to say that this year the Minister for Agriculture has very serious responsibilities on him. The plight of the small farmer was never as bad as it is now.  I am sure the Minister is aware of his conditions, particularly of those under £30 valuation. All of them nowadays can be described as smallholders.  First, there is no price; and even if there were a price, there is no market for most of the produce the small farmer wishes to sell.  It appears that the big farmers in the east and south at least have some security in four of their principal crops: wheat, beet, barley and milk. But the small farmers, particularly those in the west, do not go in for any of these products.  The economy of the average holding under £30 valuation will not allow of it.  We have neither the climate nor the soil to grow a profitable crop of wheat, and the little barley grown is used mainly for consumption on the farm.  Beet is grown by a few of the farmers lucky enough to have sufficient help to look after the crop, because it is a troublesome crop, if a profitable one.  Beet is about the only crop that the small farmer can take advantage of.</P>
      <P>That brings me, then, to what principally provides a livelihood for the average small farmer: the selling of a few finished cattle in the year.  He may also have a few sheep and lambs if his land is suitable, and before the present Minister took office, he used to make a little profit out of eggs and turkeys. These are the principal items.  There is absolutely no market and no price for them at present.  Some of the blame is laid on the T.B. eradication scheme but I do not agree with that. I admit that it may have caused a temporary upset on small holdings where there were reactors but the manner in which the farmers have responded&mdash; particularly small farmers&mdash;to the scheme is proof enough that it has little or no upsetting effect.  In my county it has reached the stage that any herd with reactors is closed for a period of 60 days until the next test reveals whether they are clear of reactors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact remains that we have lost the British market and lost it badly. What happened was that during the year when our delegation went to <Col N="1619" /> London to try to strike a new trade agreement they were met by the story from the British that the market was already gone to the Dutch, the Danes and the New Zealanders.  Of course they were right; these people were minding their business and seeking a trade agreement with the British to help their farmers while we were busy here wrangling and trying to take proportional representation votes from our people so as to make sure that one Party and one Party alone would be in power for good and for all.  When the Taoiseach went over he was told that there was no market but that they would give him a price.  We know what the price has been from that time to this.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach came home, in order to save his face&mdash;and I admit he had only a poor excuse to make and even with his ability he was not able to put a good colour on it&mdash;as a sop to the farmers, after allowing them to be jostled out of the British market through political mongering which was going on for the past 12 months, he promised the farmers that he would give them some relief by way of&mdash;I think it was one of the things he mentioned&mdash;derating of agricultural outoffices.  I have heard nothing about that since.  He also made some other promise.  That was immediately after his return from London.  I have not got the text of his statement now but it appeared in the papers of that time. Perhaps the Minister would tell us what has become of those promises. Further, would he tell us when replying is that exactly the amount of help that the Taoiseach and his Government think will be sufficient to put the small farmer on his feet&mdash;taking rates off agricultural outoffices?  If that is the Taoiseach's knowledge of the plight of the small farmer today, then I say that the families packing up, closing their doors and moving out with all their possessions are right and that they have taken the Taoiseach's measure from an agricultural point of view very accurately.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to criticise but it is our duty also to make the Minister and the Government aware of what is taking place in the various constituencies. <Col N="1620" /> I hope I have done so; I am sure the Minister must be aware of it; he has been told of it often enough for the past 12 months.  The small farmers are being crushed out of their holdings.  I remember reading volumes and volumes of outcry against the landlords' wholesale clearances in the past but for the past 18 months the clearances forced particularly on the small farmers by the failure of the market and the Government's failure to provide reasonable prices and markets for their produce would almost parallel the exodus that took place at the time of the famine.</P>
    <P>Perhaps some Deputies from the south or the east may not be aware of what is happening.  In the parish of Foxford alone there are 80 slated farmhouses on small holdings closed up.  In my own county also there is Meelick where there are 40 closed. It is not a very large parish.  These are two cases that I can vouch for but the same thing is happening elsewhere and these are all houses built within the past 25 or 30 years by people who thought that there was a future in agriculture.  These are two parishes which I have named and the facts can be verified.  I am not exaggerating or understating the position. In the case of Foxford I do not know if the number is 80 or 88 houses but it is not less than 80.  The other case concerns a parish in a good agricultural area, not mountainous land but an area where the local people pride themselves on having fairly good quality land and in that one parish alone there are 40 slated houses closed up.  I am not talking about thatched houses or houses that may have become derelict in which the people refuse to live.  This is a very serious matter and something to which the Government must wake up because agriculture is our principal industry.  No matter how many planes we buy or how many concrete runways we provide for jet planes we must face that stubborn fact.  Those who live and work on the land are keeping the country going and paying the piper.</P>
    <P>If the Government is genuine in attempting to hold the remnant of our small farmers on the land there must <Col N="1621" /> be a minimum price fixed for at least four commodities, cattle, sheep, pigs, eggs and turkeys&mdash;I am putting eggs and turkeys under the one heading of poultry.  I shall give the reasons.  We are practically a welfare State whether we like it or not.  Almost every section of the community has some measure of security and more luck to them. That is as it should be, but there is one section of the community&mdash;that is the farmers of from £50 down to £5 or even £1 valuation&mdash;who have absolutely no security.  They do not qualify for the dole or for unemployment benefit, which is usually referred to as stamp money; for work on the roads, for county council or for forestry or Land Commission work simply because they are not registered as unemployed in the labour exchanges. They and their wives and children work hard on their holdings throughout the year to feed cattle, feed and care for sheep and lambs and produce the wool and when they have these things ready to sell there is no market. The market has gone absolutely and there is no hope in the future of getting a market or reasonable prices for them.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Parliamentary Secretary, who is now sitting in for the Minister, realise what is happening in his county or are conditions there the same as in Galway, Clare and Kerry? I do not want to paint an over-gloomy picture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to treat this matter seriously.  I should like him to bring it to the notice of the Minister when he comes in and point out that a pretty serious situation is occurring right under our noses&mdash;the banishment of small farmers from their holdings, from holdings that our forefathers in the past generations fought so dearly to secure.  The £10 valuation holding is a thing of the past.  The Land Commission are trying <Col N="1623" /> to bring holdings of £4 or £5 up to £10 valuation.  They are years behind the time.  On a holding of £10 valuation, having regard to the high cost of living and the complete lack of markets, there is not a living except for a bachelor or an old maid.  The same will apply very soon to holdings of £15, £20 and £25 valuation.</P>
      <P>I remember when Fianna Fáil were making an outcry about ranches.  The day is not far off when a great deal of the land in the west will become ranches.  That would be a desperate situation if it were allowed to develop. The land is going derelict.  Some security must be given to small and medium-sized farmers, if they are to survive.  Instead of engaging in political nonsense, the Government should consider how to save the remnant that is left.  This serious situation has arisen in the past 18 months.  Things were quite all right in the first one and a half years of the Government's term of office.  As soon as markets vanish, people have to lock up and move out.  I want to warn the Minister and the Government that there is a desperate situation in existence, particularly for the small farmer.  The cost of living has gone extremely high. The cost of everything the farmer has to buy has increased.  The price of what he has to sell has gone down and the market has vanished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very excellent job has been done in land reclamation.  One matter has been brought to my attention.  It is that it is a waste of time to bulldoze and till land on which there is furze or whins for the reason that if whins have been established, the surface is pickled with the seed of the whins, which is very prolific and almost indestructible. In the Westport area, a man told me that about nine years ago an excellent job of work was done under the Land Reclamation Scheme on about ten statute acres.  The tillage provided just the right seed bed for the seeds of the whins that were there in the soil, which were not discernible unless one looked very closely.  Those ten acres have reverted to a forest of whins.  I do not blame the Department or the land owner but <Col N="1624" /> I will make a suggestion that may help. The same grant should be given for the removal of whins by hand, leaving the grass surface as undisturbed as possible.  Many years ago a field was cleared by hand, using the ordinary mattock.  The grass was not disturbed. The whins were taken out by the roots. The land was heavily fertilised so as to induce a heavy growth of grass which succeeded in preventing the seeds of the whins from germinating. In the course of time, the whins deteriorated.  It is an absolute waste of time to clear furze by the method employed at present.  I understand that under the Land Reclamation Scheme there is a regulation whereby the land must be tilled before the land owner qualifies for a grant.  Where furze is concerned, such a policy is a complete waste of time and of public money.  The method I have suggested is the only way to deal with furze.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not in the House at the moment because I want to ask him if his Department have any means of checking the growth of furze in mountainous areas. The Parliamentary Secretary is smiling.  Perhaps he has such a problem in Donegal.  In Wicklow, when I was Minister for Lands, huge areas of once excellent sheep grazing country had to be sold for the purposes of afforestation because ferns had spread to such an extent that they crushed both sheep and man out.  That is happening in parts of Mayo.  In the past few years, ferns have begun to take hold.  I do not know how they can be checked.  Is there a selective killer on the market that would help to check them?  While economic circumstances, lack of markets and so on, are forcing some people out, the ferns are playing havoc in the hill grazing areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not lucky to touch the ferns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly not lucky for the beast which will eat them in the morning.  He will have a pain in his liver.  Ferns have created a problem.  Farmers who were making a comfortable living out of sheep and cattle grazing on the hills find <Col N="1625" /> that ferns are making that impossible and most of these people have to surrender land to the Forestry Division because the ferns have destroyed vegetation.  In some places the ferns are two or three feet high.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister explain to those who are trying to help in the matter of pig production where they stand?  For the past two years, we have been advised over the radio, by the Department, by everybody, to produce a lean pig.  The Grade A pig was supposed to be a lean pig of a certain type.  Farmers went in for that type of pig and succeeded in producing a Grade A pig.  No sooner had they produced such a pig than they were told that such a pig was not wanted for bacon.  Now it seems that we have to feed the fat back on to the pig.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has been advised by farmers, as I have been, that the whole thing is a racket by the bacon factories, by the Department or by someone who is making something out of it.  That is the average farmer's belief.  I do not believe it is a racket.  The average farmer who is trying to rear pigs as a sideline is being fooled.  I would ask the Minister to make a definite statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>The factories publish a certain price, but the farmers never seem to be able to get that price; hence it is very hard to blame them for saying the whole pig business is a racket. There is another unfortunate state of affairs in that the factories are vying with one another for the purchase of pigs in an area.  One factory gives a price higher than another and the farmers do not know where they stand.</P>
      <P>I should like again to bring to the Minister's notice that there is a clearance from the land that was never witnessed since the time of the Famine or the landlord clearances of the 1860s and 1870s.  If nothing is done to stabilise the position, we shall lose all the small farmers.  The farmer with the £10 valuation is a thing of the past.  He is trying to do the impossible and there is only one remedy for that.</P>

      <P>I am trying to visualise the position of that farmer who has to pay £3 7s. 6d. every fortnight for a bag of flour, which is only one item, who has perhaps only three or four cattle to sell in the year and ten to fifteen lambs.  These form his principal income.  He cannot sell them at the fair.  He would nearly want to have them shod because he has to bring them so often to the fair where there is no demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not argue with the Parliamentary Secretary.  What Deputy Coogan said a moment ago is true, that Fianna Fáil's track is up in the clouds with the jets that are streaking across the sky.  As I have said, the £10 valuation farmer is going and he forms one-eighth of our total farming community.  I do not see how he can be saved.  I want the Government to save those over £10 and up to £30 valuation because if the present trend continues, they will follow the £10 valuation farmers.</P>
      <P>I thought I would have had a friendly hearing from the Parliamentary Secretary from Donegal seeing that he comes from a county of smallholders like those in Mayo, Galway and Clare.  However, he is out of touch with the people.  These farmers do not make any grouse or grumble. When they find they cannot make ends meet, they pack their belongings and cross to England or to the United States and try their luck there.</P>

I shall not answer that question but I know what the answer would be.</P>
      <P>Every other section of the community has security.  This is supposed to be a 100 per cent. welfare State. Why should the principal group in the community, the small farmers, be excluded? Why should they have to carry the burden for everybody else and get nothing in return?  If the Government want to help them, a minimum price must be fixed for the four or five principal items of agricultural produce on which they are depending.</P>

      <P>It shows how little interest is taken in the most important Estimate when one sees the small number of Deputies in the House.  I must agree with my colleague, Deputy Blowick, in regard to the position of the small farmers.  No matter what the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary may say, there is not the slightest doubt that the £10 to £20 valuation farmer in the west of Ireland was never in a worse position than he is in today.  He cannot sell the few cattle he possesses, no matter what fair he goes to.  Some 12 months ago, he had to pay £20 to £25 for a suckling calf.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the farmer tries to rear two or three calves on the one cow.  That calf is not worth that money today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in the same position.  Take the case of lambs.  No later than last week, I was at a fair in my own town in the west of Ireland.  If you gave lambs away for nothing, they would not be taken from you unless you had lambs that were fit for the factories or fit for killing and very few people have lambs in that condition. Those small farmers&mdash;you may say they are labourers&mdash;have to meet the high cost of living.  They have no weekly wage or income.  I put it very <Col N="1629" /> seriously to the Minister and the Department that at the present time the small farmers are not able to meet the cost of the bag of flour at the price it is today.  Take the case of the potatoes that were produced last year.  You could not get anybody to take them away.  They were sold for 3d. and 4d. a stone.</P>
    <P>Take the crop of oats.  There is nothing in them.  The few who grow an acre of wheat&mdash;well, you know what they were promised when Fianna Fáil would get into power.  Where is Deputy Corry?  I do not see him?  If they grow their acre of wheat, and very few of them have the land to grow it on or are able to produce it at all, they get nothing but disappointment for their labour.</P>
    <P>Let me come to one industry that is very helpful to the small farmer in my county and in the west of Ireland generally, the beet industry. What do we find?  The cost of producing an acre of beet and looking after it is not a lot.  The small tenant farmer had his family to help, but it was heavy labour.  They could have looked after an extra acre of beet last year, but they were not allowed to contract for it although it was the only commodity that brought a few pounds profit to the tenant farmers in the west last year.</P>
    <P>We are discussing agriculture.  I may be going a bit outside it when I make a reference to a certain matter &mdash;not that I want to rock the boat&mdash; far from it.  I understand that for the sugar exported from this country to Britain last year we have to pay £855,000 in what I would describe as a penal tariff.  Up to 1957, we had a free entry to the British market.  Since then, a British sugar board has been set up which imposed a levy on Irish sugar exported either to Britain or the Six Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear whether the Minister for Agriculture has any responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The agricultural community wants to be clear about it. They want to know their position.  May I pay a tribute to the founders of that industry, the early Government of our country, in 1924?  It has progressed well.  May I also pay tribute to the General Manager of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta?  Last year, a penal tariff of something like £855,000 was paid in respect of sugar we exported to Britain and the Six Counties.  Why?  That money was distributed to our competitors in the so-called Commonwealth Countries.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister and the Department seriously to look into that matter. Under the 1948 Trade Agreement, as the Leader of the Opposition says, and nobody should know it better than he does, there is a protective provision as far as we are concerned.  We had as free an entry as any of the other countries until 1957.  Why did it take the British until 1957, until this sugar board was established, to impose a tariff on our sugar exports?  What made them think of it in 1957?</P>
      <P>Not that I want to rock the boat in any way, far from it, but to our small tenant farmers in the west the acre of beet last year brought in roughly from £60 to £80.  That was their only income last year.  It was all they had last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything else they produced in the line of a few cattle, <Col N="1631" /> sheep, potatoes, and so on, was produced at a loss.</P>
      <P>The only income came from the acre of beet.  I am told many of them tried to get more&mdash;another acre or two, as the case may be, which would have been a great help. Unfortunately this penal tariff is there. The Sugar Company, I understand, cannot afford to have thousands of tons of sugar for export on account of the penal tariff the British have imposed on exports of that commodity from our country.  I would seriously ask the Minister and the Government to took into this point.</P>
      <P>As they say in the west of Ireland, there is no good in driving the fool further&mdash;one saying it is a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce and another saying it is a matter for the Department of Agriculture. It is a matter for the small farmer to know the position and to have this penal tariff removed from the one commodity he can produce that will give him a few pounds profit. The least the Government or any Department might do would be to put that matter in order and I do not care whether it be the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Agriculture or any other Department.  The least they might do would be to make sure that that tariff will be removed so that the small tenant farmer can continue to produce the one commodity that is keeping his head above water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important item to the small farmer in the west of Ireland to which I must refer is pig producing.  To our forefathers the pig was known as &ldquo;the gentleman who pays the rent&rdquo;. Today, the pig producer does not know where he stands.  It is &ldquo;Grade this, Grade that, and Grade the other&rdquo;.  Whatever grade this, that or the other may be, it is certain that it is the grade that does not suit the man who produces the pig.  He is paid according to that grade and that is the grade which gives him no return.  I appeal to the Minister to forget about Grade this, Grade that and the other. When they wanted our produce <Col N="1632" /> during the war they did not grade it.  They just wanted it.</P>

      <P>I have not received any recent proposals from Wexford County Council for the provision of dentures for persons in the lower income group.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the policy recommended to health authorities, the Council is concentrating its limited resources in dental personnel and equipment mainly on the provision of services for eligible children as, in the long run, they stand to benefit more from dental treatment.  I understand that the Council, of late, has found it difficult to maintain even the services for children due to the general difficulty of recruiting sufficient whole-time dental officers for the local authority service.</P>
      <P>While the initiation of a scheme for making available dentures to the lower income group is primarily a matter for the Council, it will be appreciated, in the existing circumstances, that the Council could not be expected to introduce such a scheme when it could only do so at the expense of the inadequate service being provided for children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>From enquiries I have made, it does not appear correct to suggest that the patient referred to in the Deputy's question was left without a reply to his application for clothing.</P>
      <P>I am informed that it is the usual practice in the offices of the Wicklow Health Authority to acknowledge the receipt of applications for commodities under the Domiciliary Welfare Scheme, except perhaps where the public Health Nurse is due to visit the patient in the near future.</P>
      <P>The patient concerned was provided in May, 1960 with a pullover, pair of pyjamas, pair of shoes and underwear.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the Nurse's visit to the Sanatorium in April of this year, the patient referred to an application which he stated he had made earlier for a suit of clothes.  There is no record of the receipt of this application, but in April a measurement form was sent to him for completion and return to the health authority.  The patient's mother later wrote to the health authority asking if a suit could be supplied directly by the suppliers.  She was informed by letter dated 30th June last that it would be necessary for the patient to complete the measurement form.  So far, it has not been received. When this form is furnished, the health authority will forthwith arrange for supplying him with the suit.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that in County Wicklow there is no undue delay in supplying necessary outfits to necessitous patients.  It will be appreciated, however, that in many cases enquiries have to be made as to whether the applicant is entitled to the clothing and as to whether there is need for them at the time of application, particularly if the patient has had a previous supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment under the Children's Allowances Acts has never been related at any age to school attendance.  The allowances continue to be paid up to sixteen years of age, irrespective of whether or not the child leaves school before reaching that age.  There is no differentiation on the ground of means, either of the parents or of the children. It would be a fundamental change to introduce the principle of differentiation as between one group of children and another and in my view such a change would not be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> The amount payable under the Children's Allowances Acts would not constitute a major contribution towards the cost of keeping a child at school or university and if provision for that purpose were to be made I do not think the Children's Allowances Acts would be the proper medium to use.  The sections of the community who would derive most benefit from such a course would not be those whose need is greatest but in the majority of cases those who would be less in need of assistance than many others.</P>
    <P>I might mention that up to 1953 payment for child dependants between the ages of 14 and 16 under a number of codes was conditional on full time attendance at school but this was found to be unsatisfactory in practice and was discontinued in favour of the system applicable to Children's Allowances.  I am accordingly not prepared to introduce the proposals suggested in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>No. The limited certificate actually operated on occasions when the censor felt we might have reason.  Generally speaking, it has an adverse effect.

      <P>I asked the Minister to do this for the guidance of parents. Is the Minister aware&mdash;I am sure he is &mdash;that in Britain there is a system whereby films are tabbed X, U and A? A film that is tabbed X is an indication to a parent that a child should not see that picture.  The majority of parents act according to the certificate given and do not allow their children to go to these films.

Would the Minister not consider Deputy Corish's suggestion that films in that category should be marked X or with whatever is a suitable mark, to advise parents in advance that while these pictures contained nothing offensive against public decency they are not the kind of pictures to which an impressionable child can properly be sent, particularly unaccompained by parents?  If you go with your child to a film which is unsuitable, you can walk out and, however reluctantly, you can drag the child out with you, but if you send the child to a film to pass the afternoon and it proves to be unsuitable, he comes home and retails the whole contents and leaves you with your hair standing on end.

      <P>An Foras Talúntais has two main sources of income: (1) interest and dividends on the Grant Counterpart funds transferred to it in 1958, the present capital value of which exceeds £1 million; (2) an annual State grant which, under section 12 of the relevant Act, is determined by the Minister for Finance in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and the Council of An Foras Talúntais.  For the current financial year, the amount of this grant is £400,000.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the income of An Foras Talúntais is applied is a matter for the Council of a that body pursuant of Section 13 of the Act. While, under the Act, An Foras Talúntais is free to determine policy on wages and conditions of service of staff in its institutions, it seems reasonable to assume that it would have regard to the practice, followed in similar State agricultural institutions, of paying 5s. a week over and above the current rates in the area.</P>

      <P>I am aware that such contentions have been made but I cannot agree that the margins available to wheat and barley buyers are, on the whole, unreasonable.  In the case of wheat, we have many applications on hands from merchants for buyers' licences and these applicants are obviously prepared to do business on existing margins.  As regards barley, the margin is not fixed under statute but by arrangement with the trade interests concerned.  Having due regard both to the necessity to keep the cost of feeding stuffs at a level which the pig producers can afford and to the interests of those who dry and store barley, I would not feel justified in advocating an increase in the margin.</P>

Thus, in the fresh waters, care has been taken to ensure that post-drainage conditions will afford facilities for the safe passage of fish on their upstream migration and will guard against their being exposed to danger from stranding.  In the estuary, the cutting of a new <Col N="1646" /> channel has given rise to some unavoidable interference with certain fishing stations, but, when the new channel has become stabilised, it is expected that the over-all situation for net fishing will approximate to that existing pre-drainage.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing during the debate which I regretted very much was when Deputy Blowick was speaking and referred to the £10 to £20 valuation, sitting at that time beside the Minister was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who asked: &ldquo;Is everything not being done for that type of man?&rdquo; He referred to the fact that he is in a certain favoured position as regards rates and that he has certain grants for house building, fencing, and so forth.  I was surprised by an interjection of that character from a Deputy who represents a rural constituency. I thought it was only Dublin city Deputies, and those who do not know the position in the country, who would make that kind of reference.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the man with £10 to £20 valuation in the west of Ireland &mdash;I do not know what the position is in Donegal; I think it is much the same &mdash;is the one man for whom nothing is being done.  He is an unpaid labourer.  I am glad the Minister is in the House at the moment.  I am perfectly certain he is one man who appreciates the truth of what I have said.  In my own county, in my own village, the pattern of emigration is assuming serious proportions.  It is not now the children who are going; the fathers and mothers are going also. The key is turned in the door and the house is left empty.  Of course, the man with the £10 to £20 valuation has not even a week's wages coming in. His cattle and sheep are no longer saleable.  His potatoes were a dead loss to him last year.  It is a very sad state of affairs.  I suggest to the Minister that he must take steps to remedy the situation by regulating prices in such fashion that that type of tenant farmer will get some return for his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1657" /> The one crop that would give him a return is the beet crop.  What is the position?  A penal tariff has been imposed on sugar exported from here into Britain, a tariff from which our competitors are free.  Worse still, the proceeds of that tariff go towards subsidising our competitors in Britain. That penal tariff formed no part of the 1948 Agreement.  Had it done so, it would have been a strange thing that they would have waited until 1957 to impose it.  That was the first year in which it came into operation.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to have that tariff wiped out so that the £10 to £20 valuation farmer will be able to continue using his land and make a living out of it. Beet is the only crop that offers him a return for his labours.  He has to meet the increased cost of living like all the other sections of the community; unlike the other sections, he has not received any compensation.  I make an earnest appeal to the Minister to consult with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with a view to getting that penal tariff removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no wonder that at certain times the Government's policy in relation to various matters comes under grave and serious consideration by the people.  We must, I think, all agree now that, no matter what test of policy there has been in the past, there are very few who could deny today that the Government are very speedily on the way out.  The results of the local elections and the results of the by-election in the farming constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny are a clear indication of the realisation on the part of the agricultural community of the manner in which they have been deceived by the Government. Not alone did this Government promise too much; it gave too little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often wonder if the members of the Government, particularly the Minister for Agriculture, ever cast their minds back on the promises they made and the undertakings they gave and, in turn, wonder how they ever received the confidence of the electorate. From every platform and every meeting place, in the newspapers, <Col N="1658" /> on the radio, and, particularly, in the election address, which was put into the hands of every citizen before the general election, special reference was made to agriculture.  In the pamphlet issued, details were given of agricultural policy.  They had a plan for agriculture.  The pamphlet dealt with the fundamentals of a sound agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil always seems to have good plans and a sound policy before an election but, the minute the election is over, the plans vanish into thin ai and the promises and undertaking become things of the past.  Realising that this is an agricultural country, one would expect the Minister for Agriculture, when introducing the Estimate for his Department, to declare that no matter what expenditure of energy is made by anybody, it will not change it from being an agricultural country.  There is only one industry in the country.  There can be only one industry and it is agriculture, and if the agricultural industry is flourishing, then everybody is flourishing. More money is in circulation; there are good markets and good fairs, good prices for all farm produce; and the best spenders are the farmers when they have money.  They are the biggest payers and the best employers in the country today.  The farmers are keeping the country shops going; they are the backbone of the country; and the day they are forced into poverty and distress is the day when the whole country will collapse completely.</P>
    <P>Within the past 12 months, farmers have begun to ask themselves will any lead be given to them by the Government? Is the Department of Agriculture in existence at all now?  The Minister himself has been surrounded by complete silence.  There has not been a single word in relation to farming policy.  Everything has been allowed to drift&mdash;wheat, oats, beet, barley, pigs, sheep, wool and cattle. Where is there any policy on all those things?  I venture to say that if the Minister meets any group of independent-minded farmers they will tell him that not since the dark days of the Economic War have they experienced such great difficulties as in the past 12 months.  They have experienced difficulties <Col N="1659" /> in every branch of farming, whether it be dairy farming, tillage farming or livestock.</P>
    <P>Now that the Government have been very seriously chastised by the electorate, one would expect that they would at least change their attitude towards the farming community and do something towards putting agriculture in its rightful place as the main industry of the country, but the Minister's speech introducing this vote was nothing more than a well-phrased statement of apology.  I have not seen anything in his speech which gives any hope to the farmers that they will be better off in the year to come as compared with that gone past, and I should like to direct attention to the fact that one of the pledges made by the Fianna Fáil Party at the last general election was that they would introduce a new marketing system.  The Fianna Fáil pamphlet issued to each elector went on to say that it was intended to encourage and help farmers' organisations to set up marketing organisations, and to give them all the necessary powers and sufficient funds to enable them to increase exports of their products, and to improve the quality, dividends, and all other matters affecting them.  What have they done about that in the past three years?</P>
    <P>We have heard Deputies speak about how difficult it is to obtain Irish bacon, Irish butter, and Irish cheese in Britain and it has taken the Fianna Fáil Government a long time to realise that Ireland, in that respect, could not be better geographically situated.  We are probably the most convenient agricultural country in the world to the greatest market in the world&mdash;the British market&mdash;but while every other country was leaving nothing undone to get into that market, a group of simple minded people here, known as the Fianna Fáil Party, were doing everything they could to deprive our farmers of the benefits of the British market, to discourage them selling in it, and to make their access to it more difficult.</P>
    <P>Now I am glad the time has come when a Fianna Fáil Government realises the British market is the most profitable one we could have.  In <Col N="1660" /> addition to that we happen to be in a very fortunate position because, unlike many other countries, if we increase our exports to Great Britain we have our own people there to eat them, but in the case of Irish bacon, it is a well-known fact that very few of our emigrants in Coventry, Birmingham, Bristol, London, Hull and other large English cities can get it.  I wonder why?</P>
    <P>There was a time not very many years ago when there were markets in rural Ireland known as the pig markets.  I have seen the Waterford pig dealers attending fairs in the midlands, buying pigs and paying good prices for them.  I have seen wagon loads of pigs leaving Mountmellick railway station for the Waterford factories. But what is the position today? Our pig markets have gone.  They have disappeared.  Our small farmers are no longer interested in keeping pigs and we find that Irish bacon cannot be had in Britain.  There is something very wrong with our marketing system when that happens.</P>
    <P>We were told by one Deputy that a question was addressed to the owner of a well-known provision store in London as to why he did not stock Irish bacon and his reply was: &ldquo;We might get a few sides today but it may be some months before we get any more.&rdquo; Does the same situation not apply to Irish cheese, and is it not time something were done when we hear Deputies making speeches on the serious situation that has arisen in regard to malting barley?  It would be possible to increase greatly the acreage of malting barley here but we do not seem to be able to push the market for Irish whiskey.  If there were a greater market for Irish whiskey, there probably would be a greater demand for malting barely.  Therefore, it would be a very profitable crop for the farmer.</P>
    <P>The story in relation to Irish whiskey is the same as that in relation to Irish bacon.  In the hotels and licensed premises throughout Britain, you will see every kind of whiskey, particularly Scotch, displayed; but if you ask why Irish whiskey cannot be obtained, you will be politely told that they have not seen the traveller and <Col N="1661" /> cannot get supplies.  That shows there is something seriously wrong with our marketing system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise&mdash;I shall not comment on that.  In their announcement of policy prior to the general election, the Government referred to advisory services and stated &ldquo;advisory services will be extended and improved as rapidly as possible.&rdquo; That one was worded very wisely and cutely. &ldquo;Local services will be under the control of the county committees of agriculture and will be reconstituted so as to strengthen farmer representation on them.&rdquo; The position is that there are now fewer advisory services for farmers.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, the Parish Plan. Was there any valid reason why the Minister should have abolished it?  The only reason it was abolished was sheer spite, because the Government realised it was finding favour with the farmers and was assisting the development of the parish very much.  But, like the Land Project, it was sabotaged.  Many farmers derived great benefit from the Parish Plan.  It was responsible in many areas for the production of healthy livestock, for bringing about increased production, additional fertilisation and a general improvement in agricultural knowledge.  All I can say from this side of the House is that the Parish Plan will be resumed without delay the moment there is a change of Government. We also give the undertaking that the Land Project will be resumed once there is a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister if he has given any serious <Col N="1662" /> thought to the question of reviving Section B of the Land Project.  Is he aware that a good deal of unemployment has been caused because of the failure of the Government to implement Section B?  Some time ago a communication was addressed to the Minister from the National Land Reclamation Association.  It pointed out that land drainage contractors had been encouraged to purchase heavy machinery by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dillon, at the time when Section B was under full steam.  Many of these people invested their savings in such machinery and others went into debt in order to purchase it.  But they found that the Minister completely dismantled the scheme by the abolition of Section B.  One of the Minister's predecessors, the late Deputy Tom Walsh, also encouraged farmers to purchase heavy machinery for land reclamation work and gave an assurance that there would be ample work available.  Contractors naturally assumed that Section B would be continued, and on that understanding, they invested large sums of money in drainage equipment.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why the Government should have discontinued Section B of the scheme?  The only reason was this.  The Land Project was designed to convert waste land&mdash;boggy land, marshy land, land covered with rocks, stones and furze bushes&mdash;into good land.  That the farmers appreciated the value of that scheme is proved by the large number who availed of it, particularly of Section B.  Section B gave them great benefits, added considerably to our national wealth and contributed generously to the million acres of land we have now reclaimed.</P>
    <P>The Government were jealous of the success of the scheme.  They thought that the name of Dillon might sink down too deep into the hearts of the Irish farmers and the only attack they could make on the energy, drive and initiative of the then Minister for Agriculture responsible for the scheme was to attack the scheme and dismantle it in the same way as they attacked and dismantled the Parish Plan.  They were not concerned with reclaiming <Col N="1663" /> land, with benefiting the Irish farmer or with whether we were to turn our waste land into good useful land; they were concerned only with bickering, bitterness and spite.  That is why the Land Reclamation Scheme and the Parish Plan were attacked.</P>
    <P>The time has now come, however, when the farmers see that that type of spiteful action does not pay, even in politics, in the long run.  The Parish Plan and the Land Reclamation Scheme are contributing very substantially towards the downfall of the Government in rural Ireland.  I do not know if Deputy Dillon said so yesterday but if not, he has said it on previous occasions&mdash;the moment there is a change of Government, Section B of the Land Reclamation Scheme will be revived.  It is only right that that statement should be made in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit facilities always provide a very good headline for pamphlets before an election.  People who lack these facilities are always first to read about them.  A very important pamphlet was published before the last general election and the heading was &ldquo;Credit Facilities for Irish Farmers&rdquo;. Naturally enough, if a pamphlet is distributed at a Church gate where big numbers of farmers anxious to avail of credit facilities are present and if it <Col N="1664" /> is an attractive pamphlet such as was issued by Fianna Fáil, they will read it and it is certain to catch on and attract votes.  It said:</P>
    <P>Credit Facilities&mdash;To help towards increased production an extended system of agricultural credit will be provided.  Increased investment in agriculture is an essential condition of expansion.</P>
    <P>Naturally every farmer in the country thought credit facilities would be made available to him the moment there was a change of Government.  What is the real position?  What has happened since?  There are no credit facilities now that were not available when the inter-Party Government were in office. As a matter of fact, any farmer will tell you that there is a great shortage of credit for farmers.  While the figures of the Agricultural Credit Corporation may reveal that more loans are being given&mdash;I do not doubt that&mdash;the loans are for very small amounts, £25, £50, £75 and £100.</P>
    <P>If the Government are anxious to paint a picture of providing credit facilities for so many farmers, it is very easy to say that you have given loans to four farmers if you give them £25 each, but I remember the credit facilities that were promised before the general election.  There is little use in giving credit facilities unless they are worthwhile facilities.  The scheme that was put into operation, sponsored by the N.F.A., and conducted through the banks, for the replacement of T.B. reactors was a step in the right direction but how many worthy and deserving farmers were in a position to avail of it?</P>
    <P>Credit facilities are desirable and necessary but we must give the facilities to those who need them.  Any man who has a land certificate, a clear title and full deeds can go into any bank and get any money he wants but a big number of people have not their land certificates and have not clear titles possibly because of failure in many cases to have proper registration of title.  It may be that no administration was taken out: the owner of the farm sometime in the past may have died intestate: there may be family settlements to be discharged which were <Col N="1665" /> never complied with because of lack of credit.  There are a thousand and one sound reasons why farmers cannot produce land certificates in the bank to obtain money.</P>
    <P>That is why I say the Agricultural Credit Corporation, as at present set up, is an asset to a well-off farmer who needs money to carry him over from one end of the year to another because he is carrying big stock.  He has his land certificate but the small, mountain farmer with a valuation less than £30, the type of farmer on whom the country depended during the emergency for tillage and on whom it now depends, cannot get credit facilities from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>The time has come for a general review of the position and a new and up-to-date policy of credit facilities for small farmers is essential.  I trust that some arrangement will be made by the Government this year, having regard to the fact that not for many a long day have farmers experienced such great difficulties and trials as they have experienced in the past 12 months. They are the only section of the community whose incomes have dropped considerably.  According to statistics, in 1957 the farmers' income was £150 million and last year it was £133 million.  There is no type of person that any Deputy can mention, other than the farmers, whose incomes have not been steadily increased to meet the increase in the cost of living.  Due to the policy of the Government and the manner in which they have mishandled affairs, the one section whose income has dropped considerably are the farmers.</P>

      <P>We have reached a new stage, as has been pointed out here.  Small farmers are <Col N="1666" /> flying out of the country with their families.  That has become very evident in recent months.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, 14th April, the <i>Irish Independent</i> carried a report of a statement made by the Bishop of Elphin, Most Reverend Dr. Hanly.  His Lordship was speaking at the opening of a social centre in the village of Tulsk, County Roscommon.  He is reported as having said:</P>
      <P>Only a few days ago I was around this parish and it was pointed out to me that no fewer than 17 homes had been closed in an adjoining district; that 17 young people had turned the key in the door to seek a livelihood in England.</P>
      <P>We are told here by Fianna Fáil that those things never happened, that there are no houses locked up in the west of Ireland, that there are no houses locked up in the midlands; that if farmers have gone away they have gone on holidays and will be back. Who believes all this?  Is it not true to say that there are more small holdings locked up and vacant than there ever were in the history of the country? The only time comparable with the present is 1847.  The years of the Famine are the only years comparable with today as far as life in rural Ireland is concerned.</P>
      <P>His Lordship the Bishop of Elphin continued as follows on the same occasion:&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is unknown and far more have gone than even his Lordship realised or knew but he did know about 17 people locking up their houses and going.  That is only one instance. Let us have another instance. We shall go this time to a statement published in the daily papers by another Irish bishop, the Bishop of Cork. Speaking at a Confirmation ceremony in Ballinspittal, as reported on 24th April, His Lordship said:</P>
      <P>During the past year, for instance, the total number of farmers and farm labourers in the country fell by over 4,000.</P>
      <P>Yet there is no outcry, neither from the Government working the Constitution nor from the economists advising them.</P>
      <P>Further on His Lordship is reported as having said:</P>
      <P>They worry; their families worry, but they neither speak up themselves nor have they anyone to speak up for them.</P>
      <P>Will anyone speak today for them?  Is there anyone in the Government who will speak for them?  Is there anyone in the Government who gives two damns whether they come or go?</P>
      <P>I am taking as an example only these statements of two prominent and eminent Churchmen who know their dioceses, who know the conditions under which the people live in the rural districts of their dioceses and who deplore the fact that so many small farmers are leaving the land and seeking a livelihood across the Irish Sea.  Yet, we are told that everything is all right, that there is no need for anyone to worry, that Fianna Fáil have a policy and that so long as Fianna Fáil are there everything is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are disappearing from this country.  The greatest sign of serious <Col N="1668" /> rot in any country is when people fly out of it in the way described by the two Irish bishops in the past few months.  The story which these statements relate in regard to Roscommon and Cork are typical of the stories that can be told about the midlands.  People are inclined to say that people are flying only from the west of Ireland; that houses are being locked up only in the west of Ireland.  There are many holdings locked up in the midlands also.  This is a new type of emigration, a type of emigration to which the Government have closed their eyes.  They are not anxious to see. The most serious type of emigration is when the farmer, the backbone of the country, leaves and takes his family with him.  It is a very sad and serious reflection on the Government.  In relation to every branch of agriculture they have deceived everyone associated with it.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to hear from some of the Government Deputies who can be very vocal outside but who are mute inside the House.  Will the Minister for Agriculture tell the House was it on his authority or on whose authority it was that Fianna Fáil Deputies promised 82/6d. a barrel for wheat?</P>

      <P>That is co-operation and a bit of advice.  Let us come back to the levy again.  The wheat levy is not welcomed by the farmers.  Apart from that, certain undertakings were given earlier this year by the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party that the wheat levy was being imposed for one season only. This year, the wheat levy is reintroduced. I should like to ask the Minister if he can say how much per barrel the wheat levy will be this year.  He did not indicate the amount.  Will it be 5/- a barrel?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  The wheat situation is unsatisfactory, and the failure of the Minister to keep the price of barley in accordance with his <Col N="1672" /> promise has also met with the disapproval of many Irish farmers.</P>
      <P>I wish to make reference, as Deputy Donnellan has done, to the question of beet contracts.  Beet is a good cash crop and in recent years beet has been a very good paying crop.  The beet cheque comes to the farmer at the right time of the year, that is, around the Christmas season, after the harvest and before the spring.  It is not so very long since our farmers were asked by the Government to increase their acreage under beet.  The farmers found that beet was a profitable crop and they engaged in its production but last year and this year they were denied contracts for the production of beet.</P>
      <P>If the Minister were asked why there were not more contracts made available, his reply would be that the Sugar Company and the beet factory could not handle any more beet.  I do not see what is to stop the Minister from consulting his colleagues and explaining the seriousness of the situation in relation to beet production and pointing out what an important source of income it is to the farmers.  He should urge them to erect another sugar factory so that beet can be handled and, if necessary, sugar produced and exported.  I understand that we export sugar to Northern Ireland and to England.</P>
      <P>Why should our farmers, because our sugar factories cannot handle the beet, be denied the right to produce what they consider is a good cash crop for the production of which their land is suitable?  I sympathise with farmers in the beet growing districts but sympathy does not carry much weight in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of their barley fell far below the undertakings of the Government. The price of their pigs dropped. The price of cattle dropped.  The only crop on which they could rely to give them a fair return for their labour was beet.  Here we see that the Government have decided, in co-operation with the Sugar Company, to deny farmers the right to grow beet.  They use the excuse, if I might term it such, that the Sugar Company and the beet factories cannot handle the beet.  That <Col N="1673" /> is no excuse or if it is an excuse the problem should be overcome.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to the payment to farmers for pigs. Deputies have already pointed out that the pig has been described down through the years as a ready source of income for the farmer.  On many occasions, the pig was called upon to pay the rates and the rent.  Many small farmers and many agricultural workers through the hard work and industry of their wives were able to turn out a pig or two or three a couple of times a year.  The position has become very serious for pig producers.  The Department of Agriculture must not be in very close contact with bacon factories. The system of payment to farmers for pigs should be reviewed by the Department.</P>
    <P>Well-known pig producers who have been in the business all their lives, who with the slant of their eye, could tell whether a pig is under or over 15½ stone at three months and a week or three months and a fortnight, are not satisfied with the present position.  They are members of well-known families connected with the pig industry down through the years.  They have always produced top quality pigs.</P>
    <P>One of these pig-producing experts delivered pigs in the past 12 months which in his opinion were of top quality and such as he always produced.  One consignment consisted of 53 pigs.</P>
    <P>Only 10 out of the 53 were Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo;.  Another consignment of 46 pigs contained only 13 Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; pigs. There was another consignment of 25 pigs of which 11 were Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo;. Another consignment of 18 pigs contained only five Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; pigs.  He had a last consignment of 40 pigs of which only seven were Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo;. That man is an expert and his father and grandfather before him were experts in pig production.  He claims that all the pigs were top quality.  His view is that it could not possibly be that, out of the 53 pigs delivered by him to the factory, only 10 could be ranked as Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know of another instance in which a farmer delivered his pigs at the factory <Col N="1674" /> and was told they did not reach Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; quality.  He immediately demanded his pigs back and had them reloaded.  He brought them to another factory and 10 of the pigs that did not qualify in the first factory as Grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; qualified in the second factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. S. Browne Mr. S. Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer in question was told he would get so much for his pigs.  He took them back and brought them to another factory where for 10 of the pigs he got much more money than was offered at the first factory.  That happened in the Midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. S. Browne Mr. S. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer had been caught out three or four times before that.  He had learned his lesson. There should be somebody in the bacon factories to look after the interests of pig producers.  There should be somebody to check the advice or opinion of persons who decide the quality of the pig.  Farmers should have a representative who will ensure that the factory will not be made fatter and richer while they become thinner and poorer.  That is why I feel there is room for a great deal of improvement on the question of payment for pigs to farmers.</P>
      <P>From my association with people in the pig industry, I fear they are being robbed right, left and centre.  I fear they are not getting full value for their pigs.  There is something radically wrong with the system that will not allow a farmer to get what he feels is the full value of a good pig.</P>
      <P>The Government may be inclined to agree 100 per cent. with the present grading system for pigs but who should know better&mdash;the pig producer or the official in the factory armed to the teeth with fountain pens and pencils?</P>

      <P>Certainly they are well off.  We have reached the stage now when the Fianna Fáil Party tells the farmers they are well off today. Arising out of the remark by a Fianna Fáil Deputy that the farmers are well off today I see a statement in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of April 14th, 1960, by the N.F.A.  That body speaks for the farmers of this country.  There is a heading with reference to the trade agreement.  It says: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil sees few bright spots in Pact.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>They say the Association regrets that the Government's decisions fall at least £13,000,000 short of meeting the reduction in annual farm income over the past 12 months.  We read that at a meeting of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, as reported on the same day, a statement was made by Mr. C.H. Fletcher, President of the Association, in which he says:</P>
      <P>The increase in the price of creamery milk was entirely inadequate. In terms of cash 1.3d. a gallon increase in the price of creamery milk meant an extra £2 8s. 9d. per year on the average cow which gave 450 gallons of milk.</P>
      <P>The dairy farmers had had no improvement in milk prices since 1953, while virtually every other section of the community had two or three increases in that time.  The cost of living increased by 15 p.c. in these seven years and the dairy farmers' income was down by about £4,000,000 in 1958 and 1959 through factors outside their control.</P>
      <P>Then we are told here that the farmers are well off.  How could the farmers be well off if they cannot get beet contracts or grow beet?</P>

      <P>That is the point in relation to wheat, beet, barley, milk and pigs.  They have got less for all those and now we have a statement from the Minister today that the wheat levy will be in the region of 5/9d. a barrel.  Despite the fact that the farmers are flying out of the country, we are told here that they are better off than they were and are well off at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the trade agreement made by the present Minister with the British during the past year. Nothing was got from the trade agreement and there is no use in Fianna Fáil Deputies saying that they won this and that from them.  They got nothing from them.  The Irish delegation came back with their hands hanging.  They went over thinking they would get something.  They did not get <Col N="1678" /> it because they were not capable of negotiating anything with Britain or with the British Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Did they improve on anything we had not already got?  The Fine Gael Party, Deputy Dillon and the former Taoiseach, Deputy J.A. Costello, led a delegation in 1948 which was responsible for the 1948 Trade Agreement that put millions and millions of pounds into the pockets of the Irish farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1948 Trade Agreement can be described as being probably one of the greatest achievements of any Government in this country.  What kind of spectacle did we see this year in relation to the group of people who went over to England with very competent civil servants?  The spokesmen that went over from the Government, including the Minister for Agriculture, were in my opinion utterly incompetent and incapable of negotiating with the British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>A very valuable opinion that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a valuable opinion.  I go further and say that it is an opinion shared by thousands of Irish farmers today.  What an extraordinary thing it was to see the men going over this year to ask the British for better cattle prices, better markets for bacon after the Danes had wiped our eyes a couple of days before that.  While our Government were trotting round the country to rig the election in relation to P.R., the Danish Minister for Agriculture was about his business.  He did not travel around Denmark changing the system of election.  He was busy watching the interests of the Danish farmers and the Danish pig producers. He wanted to step up the supplies of Danish bacon into the British market because he realised the value of the British market to Denmark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was our Minister for Agriculture doing?  Our Minister for Agriculture at that time was busy examining the electors list and register of electors; he was busy plotting and planning to <Col N="1679" /> change the system of voting; he was busy seeing how he could keep Fianna Fáil and himself and his Party in office.  He was not concerned with pushing Irish pigs on to the British market at increased prices.  He was not concerned with ways and means of squeezing the Danes out of the British market, instead of opening the door to let them in and stepping aside.  That man went over to ask the British for better concessions knowing that he and his Party were the people who knelt down and expressed sincere thanks to God at one stage that the British market was gone and gone for ever.  If a farmer mentioned the British market at that time they would all make the Sign of the Cross and keep as far away from him as they could.  Remember the slogans which they had: &ldquo;Burn everything British except their coal&rdquo;, &ldquo;Boycott John Bull&rdquo;, &ldquo;Boycott Britain&rdquo;.  There is none of that this year.  They are all on their knees begging England&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for markets and for prices and to see what they could get.  What did they come back with?  They came back with practically no more than we always had and they did not and could not improve on the 1948 Trade Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Various statements were made in regard to the Trade Agreement.  I have quoted one statement by the National Farmers' Association which I shall not quote again.  They said there were few bright spots in it.  The Fine Gael Party always asserted the value of the British market.  They never went behind the door and they never believed in the British market more than they do to-day.  Thank God, we all lived to see Fianna Fáil being made converts to the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a believer in the British market and I am <Col N="1680" /> glad that that belief is shared by everybody connected with Fianna Fáil.  The Fianna Fáil Party <i>en bloc</i> have been converted to the British market.  Fine Gael always realised the value of the British market and for that reason this Party and its supporters in the country were pleased that the terms of the 1948 Trade Agreement were accepted this year by this Government as being sound and solid.</P>
      <P>Since the inter-Party Government negotiated that Agreement in 1948, Irish store cattle and sheep have enjoyed the benefits of the link with British prices.  The Agreement made a few months ago makes no change whatever in that system.  I may say that it came with keen disappointment to farmers and to Fine Gael that the Minister for Agriculture and his delegation came back with nothing more than we had already.  No concession whatever was obtained and certainly no concessions were obtained for industrial exports.  Fianna Fáil lack interest in the farmers; they lack the talent for negotiating; they lack the ability to negotiate; and above all they lack the confidence of the people.  No member of the Fianna Fáil Party can honestly stand up to-day and say that he believes that Fianna Fáil enjoy the confidence of the people.  If he does, he should have himself examined.  He is not of sound mind because the Government have lost not alone the confidence of the farmers but the confidence of every other section of the community.  If they want to test that, there is a very simple way, that is, to have the Taoiseach seek the approval of the President for the dissolution of the Dáil.  Then he can obtain the opinion of the farmers on the Government's policy.</P>

We have seen various reports from those directly engaged in agriculture and we have seen the comments of leading farmers and leading farmers' organisations, and, without exception, they have expressed condemnation in strong terms of the Government's agricultural policy.  Really, I find it difficult to condemn a policy that does not exist because there is no <Col N="1682" /> policy for farmers and with regret, I say that the Department of Agriculture is drifting along on its own, without any leadership and without a spokesman.</P>
