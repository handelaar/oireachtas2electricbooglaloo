    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Mentally Handicapped Children&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy D. Costello on 9th November, 1960:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that present facilities in this country for the treatment, Care and education of mentally handicapped children are deplorably inadequate and calls on the Government immediately to ensure that adequate facilities are made available so as to remedy the present unjust situation.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment thereto:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the following: &ldquo;while conscious of the fact that due to historical causes present facilities for the treatment, care and education of mentally handicapped children are inadequate, realises that it has been <Col N="864" /> the constant purpose of successive Governments within the limits of the resources in money, personnel and accommodation available to them to remedy this situation; welcomes the Government's White Paper, entitled <i>The Problem of the Mentally Handicapped Children</i> outlining the several aspects of the problem and the progress which has been made in regard to it; notes with satisfaction the accelerating rate at which deficiencies in institutional accommodation are being made good, as well as the attention which is being given to the development of day-training centres; endorses the policy which the Government has outlined and is confident that it will be given effect to with all possible speed.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputy Faulkner.)</P>

      <P>In concluding what I have to say in seconding this motion, I should like to say to the Minister that, as I mentioned last night, it was not a good thing for the Government to put down this amendment.  The motion was not put down to gain political advantage.  It was put down to draw the attention of the Government and the country to the position of mentally handicapped children. There are no grounds for complacency with regard to that position.  The facts now are that there are 2,620 beds available and there is a prospect of a further 600 beds being made available.  That reads all right because with the 600 extra beds, we shall have 3,220 beds, but there are 7,000 children in need of institutional care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to that fact and also to the groups that have come together all over the country and have formed voluntary bodies or societies in an attempt to grapple, even in a small important that these people should have the help and the co-operation of the Department.  When I say they should have the help of the Department, I mean that I consider they should have financial help and should not be dependent on flag days.  They should have substantial financial help <Col N="865" /> from the Department.  I should like to put on record that the people in these various centres in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford deserve the appreciation of the whole country for the magnificent work they are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised that the term &ldquo;political advantage&rdquo; has been used in this discussion. It is indeed very peculiar that such a term should be used when we are discussing the plight of one of the most unfortunate sections of the community&mdash;mentally handicapped children.  I cannot see why any Party or any member of this House should seek to derive any political advantage from such a discussion.  I am sure it is the wish of each and every member of the House, irrespective of his or her affiliations, to bring about an alleviation in the plight of these people.  Of course, we differ in our approach to the way in which this problem could be solved.  I regret very much that there is a marked difference in that approach but we in the Labour Party, without hesitation, support the motion and we believe that this amendment is to put it mildly, nonsensical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment states: &ldquo;... while conscious of the fact that due to historical causes present facilities for the treatment, care and education of mentally handicapped children are inadequate....&rdquo; In that part of the amendment, the Government acknowledge the fact that the treatment care and education of mentally handicapped children are inadequate, so that question is not in dispute.  The amendment then sets out that they realise of successive Governments within the limit of the resources in money, personnel and accommodation available to them to remedy this situation.  It welcomes the White Paper entitled &ldquo;<i>The Problem of the Mentally Handicapped Children</i>,&rdquo; notes with satisfaction the accelerating rate at which deficiencies in institutional accommodation are being made good, as well as the attention which is being given to the development of day-training centres, endorses the policy which the Government <Col N="866" /> have outlined and states that they are confident that it will be given effect to with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister and the Government know that they have no soundly based policy to provide accommodation and institutional treatment for these mentally handicapped children at the present time.  I think that our approach and their approach is very timid and it is a national scandal that children should be left in such a state. The Government state that they are providing an opportunity for rehabilitating these children as far as their resources go, that they are trying as best they can but that they have not sufficient money to do all they want to do.  It is indeed significant that when we had the question of the rehabilitation of land, not children, before this House, we had unanimity that it was a matter of national importance and urgency that as much land as possible should be rehabilitated in order to produce more wealth for the country.  On that occasion, we had not very many objections to the financial burden of that rehabilitation.  When we have a completely different matter of unbounded importance, that unfortunate section of our people, the mentally handicapped children, it is very strange that we should find in a Government amendment the question of financial resources.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that, over the years, successive Governments have promoted and advanced very much-health services generally, with the exception of the care of mentally handicapped children. In county Cork, time and again over the past eight or nine years, we have addressed ourselves to this question. We had several meetings of our health services committee which were almost entirely devoted to the question of providing suitable accommodation for the mentally handicapped children in the county.  Unfortunately we have made very little progress.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago meeting the Minister's predecessor, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, and discussing with him the problem of providing accommodation for the mentally handicapped children in the Cork health services area.  The Minister at that <Col N="867" /> time informed me, as he also informed the local authority on a number of occasions, that this matter was a major national problem and that the Department had not yet got around to it.  That is similar to the situation we have today.  He offered this solution for the Cork problem on a temporary basis&mdash;he advised the Cork health services committee to endeavour to provide one of the many institutions under their authority for the care of those children.</P>
    <P>I put that viewpoint forward at our meeting in Cork more than two years ago and it was agreed by the members of the county council that this suggestion was worth a trial.  It was handed over to a sub-committee of the council, with the engineering authorities and the county medical officer and they were asked to report on a building that was then vacant, the former sanatorium in Skibbereen.  The report as submitted by the then county medical officer stated that he was quite satisfied that the building was eminently suitable for the accommodation of mentally defective children.  He felt, however, that it was rather a small building and he estimated the number that could be accommodated in it at 34.  The other technical people agreed as to the general suitability of the premises.</P>
    <P>We then had before us a report from the county medical officer dividing into four different classifications the mentally handicapped children of the county.  Classifications (1) and (2) were children who could be deemed capable of getting great benefit from proper treatment; classifications (3) and (4) were children requiring total care, children with defects of a rather extreme nature.  We felt on his report to us that while there might be some difficulty in getting suitable staff, the children described as extreme cases could be usefully accommodated there for a number of years until more suitable accommodation could be provided.</P>
    <P>There was general agreement on the part of the county council with a total membership of 46 that we should, in <Col N="868" /> accordance with the recommendations of the county medical officer, make a start in Skibbereen and set up the hospital for 34 children in classifications (3) and (4) of the report.  We submitted that suggestion to the Minister and we had all hoped that it would meet with his approval, having regard to the fact that it had come about as a result of a suggestion of his predecessor.  What co-operation did the Cork health services committee get from the Minister?  He sent us a number of letters informing us that this institution that we were to establish in Skibbereen would cater for only 34 mentally defective children, that the number was negligible and that he would not give approval.  The only case the Minister was able to make against the proposal was that the number of children was so small that no useful purpose would be served by establishing a unit.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to inform the Minister of the difficulties, mental and physical, that beset parents of mentally defective children, particularly the types of children we had hoped to accommodate in the Skibbereen Institution if we had got the approval of the Minister. I have seen a number of these children in their homes.  I have the greatest sympathy for their parents.  I believe every Deputy has the greatest sympathy for them.  It is an impossibility for ordinary country people with, possibly, other children, to cater in the home for a mentally defective child.  I have not the slightest doubt that because a mentally defective child is unable to obtain accommodation in any recognised institution and must be kept at home its presence in the home is bound to have an adverse effect on the other children.  I think all the medical evidence available goes to show that that is correct.</P>
    <P>We have had many and forceful representations from parents.  They felt the health authority was obliged to provide them with some help for their feeble-minded children.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  So far as this problem is concerned, the co-operation we have received from the Department has been non-existent.  It is time for <Col N="869" /> the Government to forget that this is a problem the solution of which is around the corner in that we are providing plans to secure institutions to cater for these people on a national basis and that we hope in the future to have such institutions available.</P>
    <P>We must tackle this problem, as the motion suggests, as a most urgent one. I have no doubt that many children who may not be badly affected could, with training in properly-established and equipped institutions, become useful citizens.  I have seen a number of children who were catered for very well indeed and very advantageously by certain institutions such, I believe, as the Brothers of St. John of God. Undoubtedly, great credit is due to these people for the manner in which they bring up and advance the mentality of children committed to their care.</P>
    <P>On a motion with a time limit of three hours, it would be unfair to delay the House and preclude other members who may wish to speak.  This is a very pressing problem in County Cork. We do not know the exact number of children there.  It is useless for parents to request the county medical officer of health to provide accommodation for such children at present. The cases which were reported and those in respect of which representations for accommodation were made years ago were not satisfactorily dealt with as, so far, the accommodation has not been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I shall mention a very pleasing feature that came to my notice recently.  It concerns the centre in Cork dealing with the after-care of polio patients.  The number of these patients has declined and they are now turning their attention to mentally afflicted children.  A group like that, doing noble and useful work, should get the blessing of the Department. I urge the Minister to ascertain in what way that rehabilitation centre in Cork can now help the mentally defective children of the area.</P>
    <P>I wish again to stress the importance of the motion.  No Deputy is going into the Division Lobby to vote against the provision of money to help <Col N="870" /> feeble-minded children.  It is much more important to expend money on that section of the people and thus help many of them to independence and a position in life where they may be able to ply some useful trade. Surely, as good a case, in the Minister's viewpoint, can be made for it as the ones I already mentioned a while ago&mdash;the rehabilitation of land or the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>We are spending millions of money on, say, these two projects.  They do not compare in importance with human beings.  If the State is not handicapped in the provision of millions of money for such projects it should not be handicapped in providing money for the purpose set down in this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who has been in public life in this county for a number of years cannot but be fully aware of this problem.  I have come up against it for years.  I have seen the most harrowing circumstances and instances. I came across one family with four mentally defective children.  We can imagine what the mother and father had to suffer looking after them. However, in all the years, one thing I found was that it was very difficult to get the father and the mother to give up the children.  Above all, their great desire was that the matter should not be dragged before the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not agree more with Deputy Murphy when he says this is a problem that should not be made a political plaything.  The people who put down the motion are responsible for making it a political plaything.  We can only talk about it as we know it.  I have long experience and I devote myself to the problem in every possible way.  At different periods I have approached Ministers in charge of the matter.  I should like to pay tribute to what the then Minister for Finance did in Sligo in 1954.  He invited a French Order of Nuns to come to Sligo.  They did so.  They set up the Home of the Immaculate Conception under the care of the Sisters of La Sagesse, Cregg Street, Sligo.  The Sisters bought the house.  The money for renovation was provided by the then Minister for <Col N="871" /> Finance, Deputy MacEntee.  Deputy Dr. Ryan was Minister for Health at the time.  That house was opened in 1954.  In the following three years, not one shilling was expended on this project.  It was only in 1957, when we returned to power, that I approached the present Minister for Health and got a promise from him that the scheme would be proceeded with.  I am glad to say that the Minister has earmarked £200,000 so that that scheme may be continued, that the plans for the building are almost ready and that the hopes to have the contract placed within a few months.</P>
    <P>Deeds are more eloquent than words. The people who put down motions urging the Minister to do this, that and the other should review the record of the Minister and they will find what he has done for this project and that he has done it in a quiet way, in keeping with the wishes of the people concerned who do not want their names or their troubles to be dragged into this House or into every county council.  He has done it in a quiet way.  He has allotted the money and the scheme is being proceeded with.  When I came to the Minister in 1957 he told me that he was wholeheartedly in agreement but that the Hospitals Trust money had been spent and that as soon as possible he would devote money to this project.</P>
    <P>Listening last night to Deputy Lynch and Deputy Declan Costello talking about millions, about 6d. on income tax and 2d. on the packet of cigarettes, one got the impression that it was the most painless extraction of millions.  However, having regard to what these people said at the General Election about the squandering of millions and about the necessity for a reduction in taxation and the feeling of depression that they organised in public bodies down the country, I have a grave suspicion that when it would come to putting up the money a different tune would be played on the fiddle.</P>
    <P>The amendment deserves the support of the whole House.  I would <Col N="872" /> appeal again to the movers of the motion, if they have any sympathy with the parents of handicapped children, to withdraw the motion and thus take the matter out of politics. The Minister is doing his work in a proper way.</P>
    <P>I should like again to congratulate the Sisters of La Sagesse for the work they are doing in Sligo.  I visited the place recently and was delighted at the happy children who are under their care.  They are just as happy as they would be in their own homes.  These good Sisters deserve the gratitude of the Irish people.  They are a French being trained to conduct this work as soon as the building is ready.  I have not as the slightest doubt that the Minister will tell us when he is speaking on this motion that he is going ahead with the project, that the plans are almost complete and that the building will be ready in a very short time.</P>
    <P>That is the only home for mentally handicapped children that I know of and I speak only of what I know.  I am sure the same remarks apply in other cases.  I believe that the care of mentally handicapped children has the complete sympathy of the Minister but that he wants to do it in a quiet way and not drag the matter into politics, as is being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I should sympathise with the Minister and the members of his Party who have had the embarrassment of having to listen to the last contribution which I regard as one of the lowest contributions to a debate in this House for many years.  The motion deals with a grievous matter and it is alleged by Deputy Gilbride that it was prompted by political motives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy who put this name to the motion, I assert that that is a contemptible and damnable allegation on the part of Deputy <Col N="873" /> Gilbride.  There were no politics in this motion until the supplied amendment was tabled in an effort to whitewash a situation that certainly cannot be whitewashed.  The incontestable fact is that there are, unfortunately, some 7,000 mentally handicapped children awaiting hospitalisation and the particular attention that can be given only by trained personnel in institutions.</P>
      <P>In the past, parents of such children were loth to part with them even for a short time so that they might receive training that, in the unfortunate circumstances, the parents could not give them.  As a result of the gradual improvement in this respect parents now realise that it is in the interests of the children that they should be handed into the care of men and women dedicated in their vocations and qualified to give the training and assistance that would make it possible for these children to attain a level of self-help and in some instances to be able to live a normal life in the community. This is a wonderful development but it has brought an increasing demand from parents of handicapped children that we should be more energetic and should give more finances with a view to the immediate improvement of accommodation for such children.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilbride, therefore, when he alleges that the Deputies who tabled this motion had only a political object, is thereby admitting that there is something to defend on the part of his Party.  It is a scandalous thing that because elected members of this House, with the same rights as Deputies on the Government side, put down a motion to express public concern in relation to any position in any Department of State it should be asserted, by a strong Government, of course, that it is done for some low purpose, that it is just incredible that any number of Deputies should come together and table a motion the acceptance of which would be in the interests of these unfortunate children and that the House should be forced to listen to the statement made by Deputy Gilbride.  If we wanted to be political in relation to this matter we could go to town on the framing of the amendment to the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We prefer to use the limited time available to us in trying to bring home to the Minister that he should shed his complacency and give more attention to the alleviation of the situation.</P>
      <P>Any Deputy can go back over the years and say that so much was left undone.  I recall 1948.  The care and treatment of mentally handicapped children was not the only health problem that had to be resolved in 1948. A more pressing problem at that time was the elimination of human tuberculosis. The Government decided at that time to give precedence to the provision of institutions and the allocation of millions of money for the treatment of tuberculosis.  At that time people were queuing for sanatorium accommodation.  The Government were wise in their time in giving that priority.  Thanks be to God, within a very short time, we have reached the happy situation in which we now are in relation to that problem, a problem which was infinitely greater than that which we are now discussing.  If that situation had not been dealt with there would have been no necessity to table this motion.  However, thanks to the institutional treatment provided then, thanks to the improvements in the treatment of tuberculosis, this remains as the sole serious problem to be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What about cancer, polio and a few others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, cancer, polio and a few others.  We know that the world is awaiting developments in relation to the treatment of cancer and pending the discovery of the cure which so many millions in the world are waiting and praying for, not a lot can be immediately undertaken by any Minister or any Government in relation to the treatment of cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So we do nothing for the cancer patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>You do something for the cancer patients.  I am sure there is as much being done for cancer <Col N="875" /> patients as it is humanly possible to perform, but here is a field in which we are not waiting for any miracle drug.  We are not waiting for the solution that scientists and all great men throughout the world are applying their energy, their brains and experience to discover.  We are asking the Minister to apply himself to something which is absolutely simple in comparison with the cures and the alleviation of scourges such as the Minister has mentioned.</P>
      <P>All that is necessary is that the Minister would co-operate, as he failed to co-operate in the instance cited by Deputy Murphy in regard to Cork, in reducing the number of unfortunate thousands who are awaiting admission for institutional and specialist treatment.  I am sure Deputy MacCarthy will agree with me that it was a wonderful experience for Deputies of the city and county of Cork to be invited within the last twelve months to go with those who are engaged in rehabilitation in that city to see, in regard to those who were receiving institutional and day treatment in these institutions, the improvement that has already been effected in an extremely short time in the condition of these children.  I regard it as one of the most impressive experiences of my life and one that left an impression upon me that will remain for many a long day.</P>
      <P>I would say to Deputy Gilbride who has left the House that it had a lot to do with the tabling of this motion when we saw what was being done by an extremely well-trained personnel, people who were employed outside this country and brought home to apply their skill in the treatment of Irish children.  It was what I saw being done under very restricted and limited conditions in the city of Cork that inspired me to join with my colleagues in tabling this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, in face of the allegations made that this is purely and solely low politics, it brings the spotlight more to bear on the problem and gets effective action taken of such a magnitude as will immediately <Col N="876" /> relieve the situation, then, despite all the allegations made, the motion will have been worthwhile.  As time goes on, the condition of these children deteriorates and as they become institutionalised, it becomes more difficult to effect an improvement in their condition.  That is why the problem is so pressing.  We feel that the motion as tabled on the Order Paper is one that could be very well accepted and one which would receive complete cooperation from all men and women in public life, whether as members of this House or of local authorities in regard to assisting the Minister and the Government in any way possible to alleviate the situation.</P>
    <P>No matter what may be alleged, no matter what insults or allegations may be thrown at those who tabled the motion, I still think that in any efforts the Minister may undertake, such cooperation will be forthcoming. However, it is unfortunate that there should be a defence of the present situation on the basis that those who tabled the motion were actuated by a motive other than a desire to do their part in ensuring that an early and effective action will be taken in relation to this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I can accept without any reservation that Deputy Declan Costello spoke last night with complete sincerity and with real concern for handicapped children but I cannot resist the temptation to comment on the form in which the motion was put before the House.  If, as Deputy O'Sullivan claims, it was purely a non-political motion, it could have been phrased in a much more cooperative way.  It could have been phrased to express the concern of Dáil Éirean and to support the Government in any measures they might see fit to take.  Instead it deplores the situation at the moment and calls on the Government immediately to do something which is itself an attack on the Government for alleged chronic mishandling of the situation.  That puts the whole question on an entirely wrong basis.  Deputy Costello, who has very considerable knowledge of the position, tried to deal with it is a <Col N="877" /> proper way, though I do not agree with him in some of the points he made.  However, he does understand some of the magnitude and complexity of the situation, which Deputy O'Sullivan quite clearly does not.</P>
      <P>If it is a fact, as I believe it to be, that this situation is very serious, and if the members of the Opposition who have put their names to this motion represent their colleagues and if there is general concern particularly in the Fine Gael Party about the problem of mentally handicapped children, it is more than curious that only one member should be present during the debate and that the attendance of Fine Gael members since the motion was introduced by Deputy Costello last night has been noticeably poor.</P>

      <P>I still have not.  There may have been a Party meeting but so far as I know there were no Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member, but I believe I am better employed here at the moment. However, the absence of all the members of the Opposition is something on which I cannot refrain from commenting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred quite properly to the need for proper diagnosis for mentally handicapped children.  I agree with him that this is very necessary but I cannot agree that it is possible to set up diagnostic clinics at once, as he suggested.  Even if it were in itself is a great step forward without the subsequent institutional treatment which is not yet available.  It is no use diagnosing the problem unless you can do something about it. He claimed staff would be forthcoming for new and extended institutions.  I cannot agree with him there because <Col N="878" /> all the experience so far has been that staff are not forthcoming in the numbers required.  He stated that premises could be built.</P>
    <P>According to the suggestions in the White Paper we shall eventually require a total expenditure of about £7,000,000.  If the mere provision of £7,000,000&mdash;large though that sum may appear&mdash;were the only consideration, I do not believe the Government would hesitate for a moment, but it is not just a question of producing £7,000,000 and having the whole matter dealt with.  It is not just a matter of getting contractors to erect buildings.  The whole treatment of mentally handicapped children is so complex that we do not yet know what type of building or what type of treatment is best suited to the conditions we have here.  It may be that we should have more day centres and more facilities whereby children could go from home each day, be suitably employed and, if possible, educated during the daylight hours, returning to their homes in the afternoon.  That might mean that, instead of having a few large institutions, we should concentrate on a very much larger number of small day centres.  Nobody yet knows the solution to the problem and it would be criminally irresponsible on the part of the Government simply to erect buildings at a total cost of £7,000,000 at the grave risk that they might later be found to be white elephants and quite unsuitable for the purposes for which they were erected.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed that Deputy Declan Costello should fall so far below his own ideals in his introduction of this motion.  It is a pity he is not as good an advocate in this House as he is, I hope, in the courts, When he stated that the money could easily be raised by selling the Boeing jet aircraft, I felt he was sinking very low indeed.  It was a foolish remark. It was quite irrelevant.  All it achieved was to bring in the same Fine Gael policy and Party consideration&mdash;sell aircraft at all costs.</P>
    <P>I want to keep away from that kind of argument because I am deeply concerned about this matter.  I have done quite an amount of research on it quite <Col N="879" /> recently.  Sufficient staff are not available at the moment to permit of any great extension of institutional services. In recent discussion with the Provincial of one of the Orders, he expressed his concerns to me that he could not get sufficient staff to run his present three institutions.  It is a question of trying to find staff who are qualified and have a vocation.  The Provincial explained that it is essential that the people who do this work should have a vocation as well as qualifications.  Both are absolutely necessary because the mental, nervous and even spiritual agony which is experienced by people dealing with mentally handicaped children a something which very few of us can properly understand.  There are unfortunately few people who feel this divine vocation for such work. Amongst those who have this vocation, there are few who have the technical qualifications to do the job as well as they would wish to do it.  A vocation by itself is not sufficient.  Good intentions are not sufficient.  Expert technical training is needed before anyone can successfully undertake this work.</P>
    <P>We must remember that up to the present there has not been a suitable course for training nurses, male and female, clerical and lay, for the care of mentally handicapped children.  I welcome the step taken by the Nursing Council which has inaugurated a diploma course.  Students are now in training, but this is a slow and complex job.  It is no use just saying something must be done at once.  If you rush it, almost certainly it will be done wrongly.  It is not only a question of waste of money; harm might be done. Even though the situation is serious, even though suffering is being endured by children and their parents, we must not be panicked into taking hasty, ill-considered decisions.  It is not just a question of providing £7,000,000 and erecting buildings.  Provision must be made for the maintenance of such buildings and for their day-to-day running.</P>
    <P>Most important of all, we need more education of public opinion.  The poor <Col N="880" /> attendance in this House on both sides &mdash;let us be perfectly frank&mdash;is a fair reflection of the lack of public concern generally in relation to this matter.  We shall have to try to educate people so that they will understand that progress can be made with mentally handicapped children, if they are given proper treatment.  Up to now, this problem has not been faced properly because parents, from understandable motives, kept it quiet that they had a handicapped child in the family.  It is only now that people are allowing this to be known and bringing these children out of hiding.  It is only now people are coming to appreciate that there is no cause for shame and that-a handicapped child can in many cases be trained to take some part in everyday life.</P>
    <P>Let us try then to join together in every way we can to educate public opinion as to the magnitude of the problem and to a realisation of the fact that it can be solved to some extent. Let us hope this commission will work rapidly and effectively to give us the answer.  I am convinced that as soon as the answer is given, the Government will take action.  The phrasing of the motion calling on the Government immediately to ensure adequate facilities are made available shows a complete misreading of the situation.  Whoever drafted the motion&mdash;I hope it was not Deputy Costello; I should imagine it was not&mdash;completely misunderstood the situation.  Let us see now if we can reach agreement on the amendment which pointedly refers to the achievements of successive Governments.</P>
    <P>We are not attempting to justify any particular action by the present Government since 1957.  We refer to successive Governments.  We welcome the progress that has been made.  In particular, we welcome the issue of the White Paper and the proposal to set up a commission.  We assure the Government of our confidence that they will act as soon as the way is clear.  Surely we can do no more than that.</P>
    <P>I hope we shall have no more Party <Col N="881" /> political bickering on this matter.  It is far too serious.  It is not because of Party affiliations that I put my name to this amendment.  I did it solely in an effort to put the matter back into the proper perspective in which it should be considered.  The White Paper does not produce all the answers, but it does show the Government's realisation of the problem. It is the Government's first step towards achieving a faster rate of progress.  Beyond that we cannot go. If we can assure the Government of our support, action will follow.  If we criticise the Government for lack of immediate action, then we just do not know what we are talking about.  I have great pleasure in supporting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy, no matter what Party he represents, or whether he is an Independent, and no matter from what part of the country he comes, is concerned about this very serious problem of the mentally handicapped and retarded children. Because I believe this is a matter of serious concern, I want, initially, to express regret that in some respects the matter has been dealt with in this House from what I might term almost a political point of view. The motion is critical of the facilities which exist.  Surely any thinking person must be critical of the lack of adequate facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that there is a shortage, as I understand, of approximately 5,000 beds for children who require institutional treatment is in itself a criticism of the existing situation.  The fact that there are only an estimated 500 to 600 places available in the schools when there is an estimated need of 6,000 places is in itself a criticism of the present situation.  The fact that there are in the region of 40,000 of our nation's children either mentally bandicapped or slightly mentally retarded, and that up to the present we have not found any satisfactory means of diagnosing the handicap in these children, of impressing the seriousness of the matter on all shapes of public opinion, or of organising in an effective way the co-operation of all persons dealing with these children, by way of education, <Col N="882" /> training or medical treatment, and have not attempted to secure the active co-operation of the parents are also criticisms of the situation as it exists today.</P>
    <P>We are told that there are about 2,600 beds available in a number of institutions.  There is scarcely a Deputy who, from his own knowledge and the efforts he has to make from time to time to try to secure accommodation in an institution for some unfortunate child, is not aware of the suffering and hardship imposed on parents who have to wait week after week, month after month, and in some cases, years, before their child can get proper attention.  These matters in themselves are a criticism, and, if they are a criticism, surely it is only reasonable that we in this House should express criticism of the existing situation and call for some immediate attention for it?</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised when I read the terms of the amendment, because, with all due respect to those Deputies who spoke in support of it-and with all due respect to the excellent contribution made by Deputy Booth, I do not think be could even have read the amendment he was supporting&mdash;it appears to me as one of the greatest pieces of whitewashing it was ever attempted to put over a serious situation.</P>
    <P>In the course of the amendment, the Dáil is asked to realise that &ldquo;it has been the constant purpose of successive Governments&rdquo;&mdash;successive Governments&mdash;&ldquo;within the limits of the resources in money, personnel and accommodation available to them to remedy this situation&rdquo;.  Can we here in Dáil Éireann ask what attemps have been made since this State was set up &mdash;not the date which Fianna Fáil always uses as the beginning of things, the year 1932, but since Dáil Éireann commenced?  What attempts have been made in 40 years to train personnel for this task?  Did nobody know 40 years ago, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, of the existence of this problem or is it a problem that has arisen only within the past year or so?</P>
    <P>If this problem is one of recent origin and had not existed to an increasing <Col N="883" /> degree over many years, one could take this amendment possibly as being a reasonable one, but in 40 years we have reached the situation in which I think there is one child guidance clinic and one qualified psychologist in the Republic of Ireland. There are a number of institutions and there is the Order of the St. John of God who for years have been doing their very utmost to cope with the problem with, I am very sorry to say, very little support from the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly the remarks the Deputy has made so far are starting to impinge on the Minister's conscience. It is all very well to have a whitewashing amendment put down but that is not much consolation to the parents of children who may be told by others: &ldquo;We have issued a White Paper; we are beginning to examine the problem and by the time you are all dead and buried, we may be getthing somewhere with it.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper is an estimate of the situation but it does not appear to me to say what the Government propose to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the amendment goes on to say: &ldquo;... notes with satisfaction the accelerating rate at which deficiencies in institutional accomodation are being made good, as well as the attention <Col N="884" /> which is being given to the development of day-training centres...&rdquo; There has been some acceleration and there has been some increased attention, but what I want to ask, as a Deputy concerned with the matter, is: is that acceleration fast enough and is the attention great enough?  What has been done up to the present time to ascertain clearly and definitely the needs?  So far as I understand the situation, this is an estimate of the number of children who may require specialised attention of some form or another, whether institutional, treatment at day centres, or specialised tuition because of the fact that the children are slightly retarded.  What has been done to ascertain the number of children requiring such treatment? I fear that we are taking an average without any exact knowledge.</P>
    <P>It has been admitted by spokesmen of Fianna Fáil here, that the staff are insufficient, that there are insufficient trained personnel, and it is agreed on all sides, I think, that the personnel to deal with this problem must be highly trained.  May I submit at this stage that, in any effort to deal with the recruiting and training of personnel, the question of adequate payment, adequate salaries or wages, be included for consideration, because, in the matter of the general level of remuneration of those at present engaged in the nursing profession, whether they are nursing people suffering from ills of the body or of the mind, we have by no means been generous?  Over the years, the situation has existed and continues to exist that trained expert personnel in these fields are leaving the country because of their conditions and because of their unsatisfactory remuneration.</P>
    <P>In endeavouring to ascertain the needs, I should like to hear fairly and clearly what methods are considered to be most effective.  I think it is necessary initially to get the cooperation of the parents, as was done when tuberculosis was an immediate and an acute problem.  It is also necessary to obtain the cooperation of the teaching profession, and I have no doubt whatsoever that it will be gladly given, so far as it can be <Col N="885" /> given.  The cooperation of the schools medical officers is also necessary.  I do not know to what extent that will be of value because I am afraid their visits and their opportunities of seeing the children are limited in the extreme because of the limitations of that service.</P>
    <P>Certainly, so far as the city of Dublin is concerned, with regard to a vast number of young children&mdash; children in kindergarten and children of primary school age&mdash;there is a necessity for establishing, at a very early date, not one clinic, not one centre for diagnosis, but two, three or more.  In dealing with the diagnosis of young children, I am advised that it is not sufficient to have a psychiatrist and a psychologist, because in many cases it has been found that children who are apparently suffering from some mental retardment are in fact suffering from a physical infirmity.  Therefore, there must be full and adequate staffing.</P>
    <P>I understand some arrangement has been made arising out of the discussions on this matter.  I do not want to delay the House, but I want to say that the figures set out in the White Paper are an indictment of us here in this country.  The figures themselves indict us.  Therefore, even if the motion moved by Deputy D. Costello is one of criticism, in this matter of the well-being of children and the possibility of looking after them in the future, the motion should be accepted and should be accepted in the terms in which it has been moved, with a view to co-operation on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I regret, therefore, that the amendment tabled by a number of Deputies, instead of dealing with the problem, instead of facing up to the problem, is an attempt to sidetrack the issue and to introduce into the discussion a question of direct Party politics.  No Government up to the present day have anything to be proud of in relation to the problem of the mentally handicapped or mentally retarded children.  A commission has been set up and it looks as if something will be done in the future, but surely the Government should hear our voices <Col N="886" /> on this matter, first of all.  Surely something should be done as a matter of urgency.  These are the children of the nation and they are more entitled to the care and protection of the nation than other children or people who are fully able to take care of themselves.  I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion was put down for the purpose of directing attention to the inadequate facilities available to mentally handicapped children and it is in that spirit I believe it should receive the attention it deserves.  The problem of treating mentally handicapped children is one that has existed for a considerable time but, for many reasons, public opinion has not been focussed sufficiently upon it.  The inadequate arrangements which exist for treating these children are due to many reasons but particularly to the somewhat natural one that, in the past, many people regarded the fact that a member of a family was mentally handicapped as something to be kept quiet rather than exposed to attention. That attitude has greatly changed in recent years due to the development of proper corrective treatment and proper accommodation, and so on. That development has impressed itself on everybody interested in the problem and particularly on the unfortunate people who have the responsibility of caring for persons of this type.  Much can now be done to alleviate the condition of these people. The facilities now available for corrective training can provide a much improved method of looking after these people, of rehabilitating them and of allowing them to take their place in the community.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to direct attention to the fact that the facilities at present available in this country are entirely inadequate.  There is no attempt to apportion responsibility to this Government or any other Government but the motion is put down in the hope that a recognition of that fact will act as an incentive so that all those charged with the responsibility of solving this problem will make the maximum effort possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> The White Paper published by the Department of Health recognises the fact that not half the number of beds at present available or in prospect will suffice to meet the requirements.  The number at present available and the number in prospect, amounting to a total of 3,200, falls below half the number required.  In the estimated figures available, it is assumed that a total of 7,000 additional beds are required and the number at present available, in addition to the numbers shortly to be added, means that 3,200 beds will be available.  That is less than half the requirement.</P>
    <P>I feel we have a responsibility to see that sufficient money is made available for this purpose.  I think it is right to say that no tribute can be too high to pay to the work which the Brothers of the St. John of God Order, the Sisters of Charity and the other persons who voluntarily undertake this work are doing and to the skill, attention and devoted care which they have displayed in their efforts to deal with this problem.  Some years ago, because of the very serious effect which tuberculosis was having on the community, the most radical steps were taken and expenditure was incurred in order to deal with the problem. This problem has never impressed itself to the same extent on the community but it is a very real one and has brought much suffering and hardship to the persons concerned and their families.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I believe we should approach this matter in a new way and that we should recognise the importance of treating it as a matter of urgency.  The White Paper which was published is all right, so far as it goes.  It deals with a number of matters which will require to be dealt with, poses some questions and leaves a great many unanswered.  The litany of questions at the end of the White Paper, starting at paragraph 29, are matters that will have to be dealt with by experts, whether by the commission which it is proposed to set up or by the medical and other people who are qualified to express an opinion on the various matters there raised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> It is undoubtedly difficult not to come to the conclusion that there is too much complacency on this matter. If attention is paid to paragraph 16 on page 7 of the White Paper, some of the matters expressed there are most disappointing.  There is a senseless effort to pass the buck from one Department to another and there is the usual jargon which is employed when State Departments wish to avoid responsibility.  It says that because of the type of service they provide, certain services do not clearly fall within the ambit of the functions of the Minister for Health.  Neither could they be said to be educational establishments and, as such, to come within the responsibility of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that as it could tenably be argued that as the centres provide care for mentally handicapped children, many of whom cannot be educated or trained and thereby provide relief for the parents of the children, they should be considered the concern of the Minister for Social Welfare.  It adds that as the Minister for Health has, however, accepted responsibility under the Ministers and Secretaries Act for somewhat similar groups, such as senile and infirm persons and unmarried mothers and their children, it might, therefore, be appropriate for that Minister likewise to accept ministerial responsibility for the day centres, on the ground that they fall more clearly within the ambit of his functions than elsewhere.  The community is not greatly concerned with which Department accepts responsibility. The Government as a whole have responsibility and the House, in voting money for this problem, in common with other health problems, has accepted responsibility for it.  The main thing is to get action in order to provide additional accommodation.</P>
    <P>Probably one of the greatest problems connected with this matter is that a great number of young people who are in institutions will be obliged to leave them when they reach 18 years of age.  What will happen to them when they leave?  The more fortunate will probably return to <Col N="889" /> their families, if they are in a position to look after them.  Others will be transferred to county homes where they will tax the accommodation which in most cases is overcrowded. What is even worse, the corrective training, the treatment they have been given, will largely be wasted because there is no facility available in these institutions for a continuation of the training or for a follow-up.  Consequently, much of the useful and advantageous work already done in attempting to rehabilitate them will be wasted.  That is a very serious aspect of this problem and one to which very little attention has been paid.</P>
    <P>I know from recent experience that in some cases it takes up to three years for a person to be admitted to one of these institutions.  That is very disturbing and it should impress on everyone concerned the urgency of the problem.</P>
    <P>This motion was tabled to focus attention on the problem and to urge on the Government that the measures taken up to the present have proved inadequate.  While we recognise that steps are being taken to provide additional accommodation, the statement in the White Paper admits that, even after the accommodation in prospect is provided, there will not be half the number of beds available that are required.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I am afraid the amendment to this motion has the hallmark of complacency.  Whatever we do about this matter, we should not be complacent.  Nobody has sought to exaggerate the difficulty of the problems.  There is no question of making political capital out of it. This problem has existed for a number of years and successive Governments have made efforts to deal with it.  The fact that the efforts up to the present have not proved sufficient does not mean we should rest and leave the matter as it is.  In the past, other matters had to be dealt with as well.</P>
    <P>At the moment and for the future, this is one of the problems which should merit far more vigorous attention than it has received up to the <Col N="890" /> present.  I am seriously concerned about what will happen to the very large numbers of young persons concerned. The fortunate ones will have spent some years, or some time in the shortest case, in institutions.  They will be obliged to leave the institution when they reach 18 years of age.  The institutions already available cater for persons up to that age.  Many of them take children at 10 but they are obliged to leave at 18; others take them at a younger age.  However, they must all leave when they reach 18 years of age.  The serious question arises as to what will happen to them when they leave these institutions. Some of them will be taken back again into the home environment and a few may be fortunate enough to be looked after properly. In other cases, much of the money, care and attention, as well as a great deal of the skill, that has been devoted towards their rehabilitation will, to a very considerable extent, be wasted because no facility is available for follow-up treatment.</P>
    <P>I want to quote a paragraph from the report of the World Health Organisation on Mental Handicap.  It says:</P>
    <P>Every child has the right to develop his potentialities to the maximum. This implies that all children, irrespective of whether or not they suffer from mental or physical handicap, should have ready access to the best medical diagnosis and treatment, allied therapeutic services, nursing and social services, education, vocational preparation and employment.  They should be able to satisfy fully the needs of their own personalities and become, as far as possible, independent and useful members of the community.</P>
    <P>I hope that we, as members of that organisation, will endeavour to ensure that the services and facilities we provide will enable that aim to be realised. I hope the Minister and the Government will accept this motion in the spirit in which it is moved, namely, in order to direct attention to the urgent problem which requires solution and for which, I have no doubt, the House and the country are prepared to make the necessary financial <Col N="891" /> provisions to meet the needs of this very deserving section of the community.</P>

      <P>The words are deleted and I am now putting the motion, as amended, as follows:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, while conscious of the fact that due to historical causes present facilities for the treatment, care and education of mentally handicapped children are inadequate, realises that it has been the constant purpose of successive Governments within the limits of the resources in money, personnel and accommodation available to them to remedy this situation; welcomes the Government's White Paper, entitled &ldquo;<i>The Problem of the Mentally Handicapped Children</i>&rdquo; outlining the several aspects of the problem and the progress which has been made in regard to it; notes with satisfaction the accelerating rate at which deficiencies in institutional accommodation are being made good, as well as the attention which is being given to the development of day-training centres; endorses the policy which the Government has outlined and is confident that it will be given effect to with all possible speed.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Taoiseach's speech on the solution of Partition at the Oxford Union debate was of little improvement on previous proposals, and asks for a more vigorous and effective policy towards the solution of Partition.</P>
      <P>The reason I tabled this motion is that I believe this matter is one of the major problems of the Government and of the country.  I thought it strange that this problem should be discussed regularly at dinner meetings, at Party meetings and at debating societies while this House has not given the matter any serious consideration. Since I became a member of this House an occasional reference has been made to it but it has never been discussed.  It may be that the Government and perhaps the House think the subject too delicate, too dangerous or too tough for serious discussion. Nevertheless it was discussed in some detail by the Taoiseach when making a speech at the Oxford Union debate.  In fact he made an extra contribution in his reference to trade agreements and to social benefits to which, strange as it seems, he has not referred in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come to discuss this question in the House.  It is my view that the Taoiseach and the Government ought to have considered the development of some sort of plan that would aim at unity within the country, apart from unity between North and South.  For the past 40 years there has been disunity amongst Irish <Col N="895" /> Nationalists.  It may well be said that the Civil War largely arose out of the fact that the Treaty provided for Partition. I am prepared to admit that there is nothing that could have been done about it but nevertheless the argument was made; other arguments were made but these arguments were very thin because any objectionable features in that Treaty have since been largely overcome within the Treaty itself.  However, the bugbear is Partition because it was apparent that once Partition was effected it would not be within our power to solve it. Actually we were confronted with a situation similar to that with which Lincoln was confronted when South America seceded from the North.  Our problem has been to try to bring about unity by peaceful means. Whether we thought it right to act as Lincoln acted, we had not the power to do it, in the first place.  It has also been argued that, even if we had the power, it is not our desire.  Whether that is a good argument or not I shall not say at this stage.</P>
    <P>I realise that the average Deputy and the man in the street are concerned with day to day problems and that most people could not care less about Partition.  However, it is a major problem that the Government must face.  It is one that idealists will always face and certainly one that statesmen must always face.  Statesmen do not think in terms of the present but in terms of the future because, if they did not do so, the State would always be in turmoil.  The progress of any State depends on people seeing what should be accomplished and working accordingly.</P>
    <P>Partition as we know has caused a civil war, disrupted the whole country and divided the Republican movement. It removed any chance there was of unity.  If there had been unity we would have had a state of affairs in which we would have been animated by that passion that brought us so near to what we sought to achieve. We lost on that largely because the Six Counties were sacrificed and perhaps had to be sacrificed at the time the Treaty was signed.  Of course <Col N="896" /> Article 12 was alleged to give us hope but I think everyone knew that it was only a sugared pill to satisfy simple people.  The Six Counties were sacrificed and both sides knew nothing much could be done about it.  Apart from the Civil War we have had miniature civil wars since.  The Government of the Free State were compelled to jail Republicans and, to some extent because of that, the Fianna Fáil Party took power in 1932. Then there were those who advocated force and who used all their power in that way.  That again goes to prove that an armed body was opposing the ordinary democratic way of government, which is not correct.  This all indicates that Partition continued to influence our affairs.</P>
    <P>Following that there were more miniature civil wars and the very Government that were helped by those people in militant action were compelled to intern those people.  During the last war when a state of emergency was declared there was a miniature conflict in England and in the North resulting here in mass arrests and some executions.  Within the past few years, we have had armed attacks resulting in further disunity and recriminations between North and South. and between England and the South. Therefore we can say there have been 40 years of turmoil arising out of the fact that this country is divided.  I am a realist.  I am not one of those fellows who hope.  I do not believe in words.  I face facts.  At least, I do my best to face them.  I expect we shall have another 40 years' turmoil. If what appears to be imminent&mdash;a war on the Continent&mdash; reaches reality, it is possible that the very existence of Partition will connect us in some way with it and embroil the country in possible tragedy.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that Partition must be solved.  The Taoiseach made a certain contribution at Oxford.  His predecessor also made certain contributions with regard to the solving of Partition.  We know he offered the Northern Presbyterians autonomy.  He gave guarantees that there would be no interference, that there would be <Col N="897" /> favourable trade agreements, and all that sort of thing.  None of that had any effect. Since then the Taoiseach has come to realise that he might perhaps lose the Nationalist vote, not to speak of the Presbyterian vote; and at Oxford he gave guarantees in relation to the social benefits they enjoy in the North.  That was a tactical move.  It had no real effect.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Vote for the Department of Social Welfare here earlier in the year, I asked did anyone really expect the people in the North to come in here and lose anything up to half their present benefits?  The Taoiseach gave a guarantee that they would not lose.  I understand that the cost of that guarantee might be anything in the neighbourhood of £10,000,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach used language that has not previously been used.  Possibly he considers Partition is a subject which should not be discussed in public.  If people are not given an opportunity of discussing it, they might come to misunderstand even the Taoiseach's intentions and that might result in people taking the law into their own hands.  I believe in facing this problem.  The Taoiseach said that if England were to state that she had no interest, the problem of Partition would be solved very easily.  I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>In the past few days it was stated in the Press that the Vatican had set up a School of Atheism in order to teach Atheism.  The idea is to teach people what it is that motivates and makes Communists tick so that they will be better equipped to cope with and overcome the problem.  The best way to overcome a problem is to examine it in the raw and suffer from no illusions; to use a military expression, the best approach is to find out exactly what is going on on the other side of the hill.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that his offers do not represent an improvement on the offers previously made.  They do not touch the fundamental causes of the problem at all.  Unless we examine the problem and find out the <Col N="898" /> causes, I do not see how we can make any improvement.  I put it to the Taoiseach that Britain is very interested because Partition was brought about by Britain for clearly fundamental reasons.  She wanted the North as a bridgehead.  It is a bridgehead to-day and she is, therefore, deeply interested.  In my opinion it is Britain who holds the key and not the Government or the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We all know how empires grow, how they continue to exist, and how they sustain themselves.  Anyone who looks at a map of the world can see immediately that England is an island. On one side is the Continent of Europe, which has been occupied on a number of occasions and may be occupied again; on the other side is the island of Ireland.  That island could be in the hands of a Castro and England foresees that a situation of that sort could arise.  It is all very well for the Government here to say this country will not be used for an attack on Britain.  I do not doubt that is the way we feel.  But England is an empire. She did not build her empire because of conscience.  All empires are built on force.  Even though sweet reasonableness is supposed to prevail, it is the iron hand in the velvet glove which controls destinies.</P>
    <P>Whether the Taoiseach likes it or not the British are responsible for Partition. They will continue to be responsible for its maintenance.  In any further proposal the Taoiseach may have to make, he will have to take into consideration the British point of view and her interest in her own defence.  The Taoiseach is mistaken if he thinks the problem can be settled if it is left solely to the people of Northern and Southern Ireland, respectively. They are not one and the same people as the citizens of Cork and Galway are; Corkonians and Galwegians may have their little differences but they are fundamentally the same people.</P>
    <P>The people in the North were planted there and given a certain function to perform.  They are still performing it. They may call themselves Irish, but they are Irish only <Col N="899" /> because they were born in the country. They are Britons by character and nationality.  It does not matter what a person was if, by an act of his own free will, he changes his nationality as the citizens of the United States have changed theirs.  There is no evidence that the people in the North have ever changed their nationality.  I put it to the Taoiseach that they would remain British even if Britain decided she would not interfere.</P>
    <P>Many people assume that because the people in the North were associated with us in a desire for independence&mdash;I refer to the period of '98&mdash; that may be taken as a clear indication of their aspirations.  I give the Taoiseach credit for being a genius in business.  Whether he is a genius in matters of history I do not know.  I should like to inform him now that that alliance was not as deep-seated as he and others would have us believe.  The rank and file were not associated with the conflict at all.  The majority of the upper class and middle class took no part in it.  The alliance, if any was purely an alliance of convenience.  The Presbyterians were at the time just as heavily penalised as the Irish.  It is important to remember that.  I have read a good deal of history about the period. Writing is coloured and a great deal depends on the writer one reads and how one reads him.  That is why no one should read a history and just accept it.</P>
    <P>If you want to study history you have to study it from all angles, read it from the point of view of your enemies as well as that of your friends and from the point of view of neutrals.  You have got to use commonsense. I have no faith in histories as such because they are like the statement, which I often read in histories, that the Pope never issued a Papal Bull in regard to the conquest of Ireland but all the evidence is that he did.  Others in making some sort of apologia said: &ldquo;Oh, well, he was an Englishman.&rdquo;  But the evidence is there that succeeding Popes did the same and that they were asked to do so by the Hierarchy here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> I do not want to go back too far I just want to make the point that I do not accept history except where it is the subject of a vast study.  The Taoiseach largely bases his case on the fact that we may peaceably solve this problem, that Irishmen, here and up there, will come together.  I want him to be quite aware that, in my opinion, the majority in the North are Presbyterian Scots.  They do not accept that they are Celtic Irish but claim that they are Britons and their whole association is wrapped up with Britain. If the Taoiseach thinks that it is going to be as easy as all that to get the alleged Irishmen to smoke the pipe of peace around the table he is largely mistaken.</P>
    <P>Again, going back to the '98 period, he mentioned in several speeches since what he stood for, referred to the United Irishmen and said he bases his hope on some similar situation coming about again.  For practically 100 years before '98, the Presbyterians were penalished almost as much as the Catholics; the people who then ran the country were of the Anglican faith and government was in the hands of the Anglicans.  In fact, there was a miniature war going on between the two Churches and those of the Presbyterian Church who associated with people in the South did so only because it was convenient.  We know the old saying to the effect that adversity makes strange bedfellows.  The Presbyterians were required to take a religious oath contrary to their religious beliefs and every obstacle was put in their way.  Therefore they had grounds for opposing the Government. It was not because they believed in Irish nationality or Irish freedom; any man in trouble will be glad to accept help from another, even from an enemy.  I want to stress that point because I want to come to grips with the problem.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may as well make up his mind that those people with a few exceptions were using us.  He may quote the case of Tone and a few individuals but you cannot base an argument on those few individuals. Tone may have been genuine but it should be remembered that <Col N="901" /> Tone was from Dublin.  In the same way, a number of Englishmen gave us their allegiance during the Tan War. Is it not significant that when the '98 period had passed, those people ceased to associate any further with us?  There were a few exceptions but you cannot judge a case by quoting individuals. Five years later, in 1803, when Emmet tried to get them to revolt they would have nothing to do with him.  All interest in the South ceased when the tithe sack was abolished.  Those Presbyterians were compelled to pay money to support the Anglican Church but when they got their franchise, they ceased to have anything more to do with us.  You are not going to get those people to come around a table.</P>
    <P>We also have another side of the problem&mdash;the interest of the British in continuing Northern Ireland in existence. We also have a large number of Presbyterians who are interested in maintaining the present situation.  It should be a matter of common sense to all that as long as the hatchet exists in politics, as between North and South, it suits the people who control Northern Ireland.  It does not suit them to come to any agreement because if the hatchet were taken out of politics the rank and file might turn Labour and those in control might find themselves out of office.  That shows the extent of the problem; apart from nationality altogether it is not in their interests to have unity between North and South.  It might as well be faced that, as Scotsmen and Englishmen, they cannot claim to have any historical traditions in the country.</P>
    <P>Lord Brookeborough is forever saying the things which I am now saying.  It might be said that I am making an excuse for Brookeborough; I am accepting the truth.  The question then arises: what progress can be made if it is a fact that England has an interest and will never give up that interest; that she is interested in maintaining the status quo, that, therefore, those in control will never want to back out, and that trade gestures will not influence the position?  They may suffer some small economic trouble at the moment but they will not always <Col N="902" /> suffer from it.  There is nothing to stop the British giving those people the fiscal autonomy that we have.  I am pretty sure they would do that if they thought there was a single desire there to change the position.  We must accept it that if these people have problems, we may have them shortly, judging by the trends in Britain, if they result in loss of employment and overtime we might have a considerable number of people back here and we might not be able to crow about the unemployment in the North.</P>
    <P>My point is that we should face up to the problem.  Making speeches is just &ldquo;palaver&rdquo;.  No progress has been made and we must come to grips with fundamentals.  The Taoiseach should lead off by trying to unify all the national forces to begin with.  It is all very fine to blame the I.R.A. but, after all, it was inevitable that a certain situation should arise out of Partition. We must not forget that Mr. de Valera himself foresaw all that when he made his speech before the Civil War when he said the acceptance of this would mean that Irishmen would have to wade through the blood of Irishmen.  We should strive to get some organisation of a semi-statutory nature which would organise the people, take it out of politics, and invite such people as Sinn Féin and the I.R.A. to join it.  The great trouble is that some parties try to make this a Party issue, but once you start to associate anything with a Party it is inevitable, in a democratic system, that you will not get the assistance of opposing Parties.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not the democratic system is the best we can devise. It is not a perfect system.  It is not a system with which you can overcome great problems.  In trying to overcome a problem, no matter what the problem is, you have to make sacrifices in a democratic system because other Parties are only awaiting the opportunity to misrepresent.  Even though what you are endeavouring to do may be in the public good, they will, nevertheless, misrepresent you and may often defeat what is intended in the national interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> That is inevitable and that is why I hold that the Taoiseach should create some form of representative council which could engage in discussion and advice and maintain propaganda on a high level.  The young people may be irresponsible but I hold that they are idealists.  They are the people to whom Mr. de Valera referred.  They may make mistakes but they are the people who have achieved the freedom of the world and not majorities.  I am not aware that majorities ever created anything great.  The majority follows those minorities.  I always remember the Tan War for which we claim so much credit and about which we talk so much.  It was not started by the people.  A few individuals started it and we had no choice but to follow their example.</P>
    <P>I know that the will of the majority must be accepted but that should not give us the notion that minorities are, therefore, criminals or people who should be locked up.  I admit that should be done if their actions are endangering the safety of the people but it must be recognised that they are idealists.  We should try to help those people.  Those minorities who are idealists in a national sense are equal to many times their number.  The Taoiseach's policy of trying to solve this business by making a sort of Party issue of it and getting all the credit will not succeed because he will be misrepresented by all the other Parties in a democratic system.  That is why a dictatorship can do it easily.</P>
    <P>If we had unity we might not have a recurrence of what happened during the past 40 years.  If there was a semi-statutory council which would get support from the State, we would not be afraid of propaganda.  We would give those people an outlet.  When you deny people the right to say things you invite trouble.  We should have a plan.  If we had such a council as I suggest representative of all sections, I believe it would be possible to explain the problems.  People will not accept explanations from across the other side of the fence, but it is a different <Col N="904" /> matter when you get them round a table.</P>
    <P>For instance, if the Taoiseach were to speak to people like Sinn Féin, he could say: &ldquo;What can you gain by what you are doing?&rdquo;  It is funny how a discussion at a round table conference can get inside people and how they can convey their views to others. The Taoiseach who is the leader of the country must lead.  Any body, meeting or council of a static nature is useless.  We must keep up the propaganda. We should even go to every end and any length, outside force, to try to solve the problems.  Then he would get everyone else with him.</P>
    <P>This question of force is the bugbear. I confess that I am not a fool. We could not force the issue up there even if we wanted to, because Britain is there.  She guaranteed under an agreement that she would throw in her full forces to stop us.  It is in her interests to do so.  If I were asked how to solve the problem I would say force but I am not advocating it. Neither am I in favour of an agreement that would be nominal.</P>
    <P>We should organise the people and have some form of council.  We should invite all those people I mentioned and try to convince them of what is possible and what is not possible. We must all the time have some form of organisation.  It is not enough to say that we can do nothing and that we can only hope.  I have no faith in the &ldquo;hope brigade&rdquo;.  If a business man goes into business and hopes to make £1 million he must plan, invest and work.  That is how he makes his living.  The &ldquo;hope brigade&rdquo; reminds me of people buying a sweepstake ticket and hoping to win.  There is no harm in that but would any man build plans on the hope that he might win?  Those people may come down to us but I cannot see it happen.  Yet the Taoiseach expects that to happen. How is it to happen?  Is he aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the guaranteed benefits which the Taoiseach mentioned at Oxford.  That was a sugar pill for the Nationalists because it was guaranteeing only what they already have, and they may be suspicious that the guarantee itself might not last very long.  That proposal, tactical as it was, is not sufficient to solve the problem.  The true problem is that they are Scotsmen.  In fact they are British and England holds their interests.  I am putting it to the Taoiseach that he will have to face this problem from a different angle.  There is no point in a policy of hope and, if there are any grounds why people rebel against the Government of this State, and will rebel again in future, it is because of this apathy and this policy of hope.  I am asking for an active policy.  I am asking, short of a full armed conflict, for a policy.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to say that, in view of the fact three hours have been made available for a discussion on Partition, it is rather extraordinary that not a Deputy was prepared to speak on the subject except the mover of the motion, Deputy Sherwin.  The Taoiseach has been sitting here since the discussion started and it would appear that so far he has decided to make no contribution. Consequently, if it is the intention of the Taoiseach not to speak until everybody else has spoken, it is not fair to those Deputies in the House who would wish to make comments on whatever he has to say.  It is very hard for Deputies to argue on the question of Partition, or to put forward suggestions, when they are not given any <Col N="906" /> opportunity of hearing what the Government's view is.  Evidently the idea behind the Taoiseach's attitude is that the Government will make its position clear after everybody else has spoken, thus preventing comment in this House on the Government's outlook.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the circumstances I propose to be brief.  First of all, let me say we have three major problems, Partition, unemployment and emigration.  These three problems have haunted Ireland for the last 40 years and it can be said without contradiction that to-day we are no nearer solutions of Partition, unemployment and emigration than we were when this Statelet was set up in 1922.  It must be made clear also that the present Government, the Fianna Fáil Party, have had the major responsibility for controlling the destinies of this country over that period of time and, to a great extent, on their heads must be laid the blame for failure to solve any of these problems that must be solved if the country is to survive.</P>
      <P>For years we had in this country a pseudo-Republican cult under the de Valera régime.  We had the Fianna Fáil Party describing themselves as the Republican Party of Ireland and for years every poster and pamphlet they produced carried a big heading, in brackets, &ldquo;The Republican Party.&rdquo; Since the former Leader of that Party has been retired, let us now find out whether the new Taoiseach has thrown overboard the cult that his former Leader inflicted on this country during his long period of office.  We must be quite clear at this stage.  Is the Fianna Fáil Party continuing the de Valera myth in its outlook and policy on Partition, or has the present Taoiseach thrown overboard all his former Leader stood for on the matter of Partition?  That is the first answer we want.  That is the first point people in the North and South and in Britain wish to be assured on before they fall for any sugary promises made by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> In dealing with the history of Partition, I shall go back no further than the 1920 Act in which provision was made whereby the dissident elements, North and South, could at least come together on a council to debate matters of mutual importance.  Provision was made in that Act by the British Government to set up a council of Ireland and that provision was then enshrined as Article 12 of the Treaty.  It meant that the most rabid Orangemen could meet to discuss matters of mutual importance with the controlling elements in the Government of the Twenty-Six Counties, but a tragic event took place in 1925 which was that, when the Boundary Agreement was signed, Article 12 of the 1921 Agreement was thrown away.  To my mind that was a terrible mistake and I wish to put it on record that in my opinion the group primarily responsible for allowing that Act to go through this House, namely the 1925 Boundary Agreement, handing over the Six Counties to the Northern junta and at the same time cancelling the provision for consultation by a council composed of representatives of the North and South, was the present Fianna Fáil Party because the members of that Party failed to take their seats in this House.  Had they taken them, that measure need never have become law.</P>
    <P>In 1925, the Boundary Agreement was passed by 70 votes to 21.  This Agreement, in allegedly legal fashion, handed over the Six Counties.  With it, we gave up all our rights to the Six Counties and cancelled the provision enabling the setting up of a council on which North and South could be represented. The members of this House at that time were composed of what is now partly the Fine Gael Party, and of Labour, Independents and some other groups.  At that time the Fianna Fáil Party had 48 members, but they refused to recognise this House.  On the same day as the Boundary Agreement was passed here, Mr. de Valera led those 48 Deputies into the Mansion House and, in some mystical fashion, went through the motions of a division and protested against the passing of <Col N="908" /> the Boundary Agreement in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>Their place at that time was in this House.  If they had been really sincere about keeping this link between North and South, they would have taken their places here in 1925.  Forty-eight Deputies would have made all the difference in preventing that legislation from going through.  Further, their influence would have been such that a number of Deputies who voted for the Boundary Agreement would have realised they were making a mistake. I believe a number of Deputies were forced into a wrong position because of the tactics and sinister manoeuvrings of a group outside this House led by the former Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The significant fact emerges that in December, 1925, Mr. de Valera and his group, who have since described themselves as Fianna Fáil, did not recognise this House at a most vital stage&mdash;the stage when the Six Counties were handed away&mdash;but two years afterwards, in June, 1927, Deputy de Valera, as he then was, decided to come in and recognise it.  Why did he he wait for two years?  Why did he not come in at the vital stage?  I shall not go further into that.  As Deputy Sherwin said, the interpretation of history is very important, and it is tragic to read the trash about Irish history being put across to our youngsters in the national and secondary schools.</P>
    <P>The facts are there, on the records of this House, in the Treaty Debates and the follow-through afterwards.  I am convinced that when hard times come in a few years, as they will, the real culprits in this tragedy of Partition will emerge.  In my opinion, all the blame does not rest on those people who came into this House, set it up and acted as Government, be they good or bad, for a number of years.</P>
    <P>This cult of pseudo-Republicanism followed by Fianna Fáil was a useful political parrot-cry to stir up the Nationalist feeling in the 26 Counties in order to get support at election times.  The very same tactics were followed by the Orange Order in the North when the bigot drums were beaten in order to gain support against <Col N="909" />&ldquo;Popery&rdquo;.  The problem of Partition has been used, mainly by Fianna Fáil, as a political football at election times. Over the years, they have succeeded to a great extent in maintaining themselves in office by getting the support of what is described as the Republican element in this country.  When the younger generation, in their sincerity and burning desire to seek the reunification of this country, read the versions of Irish history given to them today, they believed they were following the example of certain members of the present Government by taking the line that physical force was the only direct method by which the unification of Ireland could be achieved. Therefore, as a result of the activities from 1922 to 1927, and even later, we had an attempted repetition of those tragic happenings.</P>
    <P>Is this cycle of violence to continue every 15 or 20 years?  There was a calm between 1937 and 1940.  The next blow came in 1954, but it appears to have died down now.  Are we to have a recurrence of this in 15 or 20 years' time, and have the tragedy of young men being killed or arrested and jailed for activities along the Border &mdash;young men who, in my opinion, are genuinely convinced that they are correct in their approach?  If you speak to them on the question of our history over the last 25 or 30 years, they show an utter lack of knowledge of what took place in those years and of the attitude of leading personalities during that period.</P>
    <P>It is time this new Taoiseach cleared the air and gave us his idea of Republicanism as Fianna Fáil have preached it.  Has it gone by the board since the new Taoiseach took office? Have Fianna Fáil shed this Republican cloak and donned a new one?  If so, let us know the colour of it.  Let us know what policy they are following. The Taoiseach has made a number of statements in recent months. On the face of them, these statements cannot be criticised.  The Taoiseach made one the other day at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, to the effect that he would guarantee as far as the South was concerned that he would take no action in the economic sphere that <Col N="910" /> would harm the economic welfare of our people in the North.  That statement is an admirable one, but what are the people of the Six Counties to think when at the time the Taoiseach made that statement for consumption at a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, he was deliberately allowing competition here with similar industrial concerns in the Six Counties?</P>
    <P>I gave an example here yesterday. While the Taoiseach was preaching the policy of co-operation with the North on industrial and economic matters and suggesting that there should be more consultation on various matters of mutual interest in the economic sphere, we had the position in Cork that a Dutchman was backed to the tune of over £4,000,000 of Irish money to set up a shipbuilding industry there.</P>

Apart from that, it has had no order from any foreign country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the economic condition of the workers in Belfast shipyards is a matter that concerns the Taoiseach.  He has stated that we shall not take any action here that would harm the Six-County <Col N="911" /> economy and I am pointing out that Irish Shipping has given an order in Cork.  Why could we not show our sincerity in respect of Belfast by giving orders there?  Is this country not too small to carry competing industries of the size of the ship building industry? Is it not nonsensical to think that we shall have competition between Belfast and Cork on such a matter?  Is it not sheer bravado on the part of the Taoiseach to say he is prepared to cooperate on industrial and economic matters when, in the practical field, the very opposite is taking place? When we find the leader of the Orange junta or Order in the Six Counties rejects the Taoiseach's approach, in all fairness, we cannot blame him because he feels that this pill is sugar-coated and with the sugar gone, he feels the results may be anything but beneficial to the Six-County workers.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was made by the Taoiseach in the speech to which Deputy Sherwin referred that we could guarantee to the people in the Six Counties the social welfare benefits they have at the moment.  I should like the Taoiseach&mdash;as it seems that at last he is about to speak&mdash;to elaborate on this promise made in the debate in which he took part last year on the matter of social welfare benefits.  He is looked upon as a purely practical down-to-earth man and does he now think that if those in control in the Six Counties decided to-morrow morning that they were prepared to throw in their lot here, the Government here are in a position to meet the social welfare requirements for them in respect of the unemployed, the widows and orphans, the old age pensioners and the children's allowance and so on, at the rates operating in the Six Counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the first thing would be to set a good example here.  Is it not extraordinary to offer guarantees to people outside your jurisdiction and say that you will give them equal benefits, while your own people are on the starvation line so far as old age pensioners and widows are concerned and while the unemployed can hardly keep <Col N="912" /> body and soul together on the miserable allowances they get?  Surely that kind of approach will not carry weight with the people of the Six Counties who, under the present administration, whether you like it or not&mdash;and I do not like it; I dislike it very much&mdash;will not give up the practical benefits they have for any promise made by the Taoiseach when he debates Partition in Oxford; but not now when he discusses it here where his statements can be exposed in the spotlight of publicity.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Taoiseach's point of view on how unification of this country can be brought about is justified but I intend to use my privilege in this House to point out that even after shedding the cult of Republicanism which was attached to his former leader, we have not had any approach in the field of negotiations with the British Government.  For years here a number of us pleaded that Ireland should make every effort to join the United Nations and our application was finally accepted and we became members.  It was the genuine belief of many people in Ireland that at least we should have gone into that organisation and made some attempt to interest other nations in Ireland's problem of Partition, but if we go over records of the various discussions in the United Nations since Ireland became a member, we find that the total amount of time taken up in discussing one of Ireland's major problems is insignificant, while at the same time our representatives have ranged the globe to deal with partition in other countries, their economic, racial and colour problems.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to that and I think our contributions were excellent and have raised Ireland's status, but why, at the same time, can we not make the Irish case?  Surely there is a lot of truth in the old saying: &ldquo;charity begins at home&rdquo;, and it would strengthen our case and show that we were really sincere about ending Partition if we did go to the uncommitted groups in the United Nations, the new States emerging from the shackles of Imperialism and tell them that we want their support on the Irish <Col N="913" /> problem and that we would support and speak for them and help to solve their problems.</P>
    <P>So far there is no sign of that. On November 27th, 1957, Mr. Boland said that the partition of New Guinea must be ended.  He was quite right. I think he made an excellent speech. But it is extraordinary that we can do everything to help everybody else: we can take up the world stage, criticising, advising, admonishing, praising and interfering in the affairs of every other nation and we cannot take any action or make any attempt to solve the problem in our own back garden, the problem of our fourth green field.</P>
    <P>I mention that to show the dishonesty of the Fianna Fáil Government all through the years.  They did nothing about ending Partition in any sense, physical or otherwise, during their period of office for 16 years from 1932 onwards.  When we became members of the United Nations, instead of trying to solve our own problems, we proceeded to solve world problems. Why have we not made some move internationally to gain support for Ireland's case?  I shall tell the House what I believe is the Fianna Fáil reason.  In 1958 at the Ard Fheis, Mr. de Valera made it clear that Ireland was not going to raise the problem of Partition in the United Nations because there was a danger that our case might be beaten.  Is that not a significant admission from the then Taoiseach, that there was a definite danger that by raising our case or looking for support from the uncommitted nations, we were likely to be beaten?  Why?  He did not tell us why, but it is quite apparent, from a legal point of view, that the British and the other nations are standing on the legality of the 1925 Boundary Agreement.  We know that agreement, which was ratified under international law, has never been repudiated in the slightest degree by this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put a purely personal point of view in connection with the problem of Partition. I cannot say that I go the whole way with this motion in so far as I believe that any action solely directed from the 26 County side of the Border will not, of itself, secure any solution of that problem.  I believe that before the Border will go, we shall have to have, not only on our side, but on the Six-County side, a desire to unite.</P>
      <P>It must be clear to anyone examining the position that there are differences between the section of our people in the Six Counties and the majority of our people in the 26 Counties. There is a religious difference which I suggest has been fanned by the political Parties on both sides of the Border for their own purposes.  I go a long way with Deputy Sherwin in the belief that some political Parties are taking advantage of that religious difference and do not regard, in the slightest, the fact that Partition is not being solved at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another difference, as has already been pointed out, in regard to the social services.  It is quite obvious that, irrespective of your religion on the other side of the Border, you must, of necessity, if you are an old person or an unemployed person, say to yourself: &ldquo;Should we unite, how would it affect me financially? Would my pension or my benefits be reduced?&rdquo;  It is true that the Taoiseach <Col N="915" /> gave certain undertakings that we would endeavour to bring our social services to a point where that difference might not exist, but a bird in the hand, as the saying goes, is worth two in the bush.  If you live in the Six Counties at the moment, you enjoy better social welfare benefits than can be envisaged in the 26 Counties for quite a time to come.</P>
    <P>It is true also that there is the question of the form of government.  There are many people in the Six Counties who believe in the monarchy, who believe in living under the control of a sovereign of the British succession, whether it be a king or a queen, while the vast majority of the people on this side of the Border believe in the republican form of government.</P>
    <P>What I want to say is simply that I believe no solution will be found for the problem of Partition, unless and until both north and south of the Border, the Labour group secure power and then, with the goodwill and with the common understanding of these three different points the vast majority of the working class people have in common, they will find a solution.  It is for that reason I believe that in working for a Labour Government in the south, I am contributing to finding a solution, and the only solution that will ever do away with the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it will ease the Deputy's mind, I shall make a very brief intervention now, but it will be very brief.  This motion relates to a speech which I delivered to the Oxford Union Society last year. Deputy Sherwin made some reference to that speech but Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Kyne did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently Deputy Sherwin thinks that speech represented very little improvement on previous proposals but <Col N="916" /> I did not suggest it represented any improvement on previous proposals. It seems to me, however, that during the course of his remarks Deputy Sherwin came very near to the point of trying to revive the long-discredited two nations theory&mdash;the theory that there are in this island two racial groups, that the island is occupied by people who are two separate racial entities, who do not constitute and have never constituted one nation. That is an historical absurdity.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Sherwin believes in that contention, then it seems to me he should have gone on logically to argue that we should entirely abandon our effort to re-unite the country.  Certainly, if we accept his contention, it would seem that the only case that could be made for the ending of Partition would be an economic one, although we could justify, even on his spurious grounds, seeking the rectification of the Border.  If we followed his argument to a conclusion, the moral case for the re-unification of Ireland would have to be abandoned altogether.</P>
    <P>Our case for the ending of Partition, for the re-unification of Ireland and the establishment within the country of political institutions functioning for the whole island, is based upon the historical, and unquestionable fact, that Ireland is one nation&mdash;not two nations but one.  It is true that this nation of ours is divided at present by deep-rooted prejudices, misunderstandings, fears and hostilities.  These divisions were used as a pretext for Partition in the first instance and are used as a justification for maintaining it now.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the aim of national policy must always be to endeavour to remove those divisions, to eliminate, if we can, those barriers of fear, prejudice and misunderstanding which are keeping our people divided.  In the Oxford Union Society speech to which the motion refers, I set out my views as to how we could go about doing that.</P>
    <P>I am not going to refer to the 1925 Agreement except to say that Deputy McQuillan's remarks are completely ill-informed.  Any defence to be offered for that Agreement must come from <Col N="917" /> the other side of the House.  As I understand it they would contend that it was not it which established the partition of Ireland, which had already been effected by the Treaty, and that it referred only to the determination of the Border which the Treaty of 1921 had set up.  Deputy McQuillan's statement that we on that occasion abandoned the national claim to the re-unification of Ireland, in an international way, is without foundation.</P>
    <P>We want to end the partition of our country, not merely because we wish to see the whole of the national territory brought under the jurisdiction of an Irish Parliament but primarily because we wish to bring about the re-unification of our people and to eliminate the misunderstanding, hates and fears which have kept them asunder, so that the re-united nation would be better able to promote the economic, cultural and social welfare of the whole Irish community.</P>
    <P>In order to bring about that situation I believe that we should seek to promote all possible contacts between the people in the two areas, social, cultural and economic contacts.  I said when speaking to the Oxford Union Society: &ldquo;I have not disguised my hope that economic co-operation would eventually bring about this result; but, quite apart from any views one may hold about the eventual re-unification of Ireland, is it not plain common sense that the two existing political communities in our small island should seek every opportunity of working together in practical matters for their mutual and common good?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I see reported in the Belfast newspapers of yesterday a statement by Lord Brookeborough to the effect that, &ldquo;if Mr. Lemass wanted to help economic conditions in Ulster, all he had to do was to remove the Customs barrier.&rdquo;  We have made known our willingness to consider that step in respect of products of <i>bona fide</i> Six County origin.  Another spokesman in that debate in Stormont, a Mr. Nixon, the Unionist member for North Down, said that we could bring about that <Col N="918" /> situation overnight, that a free trade area could be created overnight and that &ldquo;Mr. Lemass could do so with a stroke of his pen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Most people understand that there would be practical difficulties of some magnitude in applying and operating such an arrangement although I am certainly confident that they could be solved with goodwill.  These would be matters, I suggest, for discussion by experts in the first instance.  There is no question of our willingness to take measures which would open the whole of our markets here to products of<i>bona fide</i> Six County origin in the context of an agreement which would be intended to promote the economic welfare of the whole country and which would be so designed as to enable it to function properly.</P>
    <P>Everybody is aware that the British Government now control the trade arrangements in the north-east of Ireland. I may say, however, that I have no reason to think that they would offer opposition or create any difficulty, if agreement were reached within Ireland on the desirability of moving in that direction.  I do not think that I have anything more to say in so far as the motion relates to this speech which I made at Oxford.  I have re-read it and I do not think it is necessary to change a word of it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked for the setting up of a council composed of people of all political Parties and beliefs.  My view is still that which was expressed in an order issued by the headquarters staff of the Irish Republican Army shortly before the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; in the civil war of 1923, setting out the proposals then put forward by them for the functioning of Irish democracy which included that national policy should be decided by the majority will of the people and accepted by all; and that its direction should be the responsibility of the Government elected by the people.  I do not think that the Government could delegate their responsibility in this matter to any extern council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one fundamental concept associated with this problem and that is that the unity of this country cannot be restored by the methods of civil war.  Anything that involves the shedding of the blood of our fellow countrymen in Northern Ireland by our fellow citizens in this part of Ireland is civil war.  That has always been our view on this side of the House, but it has not been universally held by all Parties in the Republic.  It is a good thing that it is now generally held and I do not believe that any useful purpose is served by raking over the ashes of our past history in that regard.</P>
      <P>That fundamental and, to my mind vital, principle having been stated, I think it is very important in the best interest of all concerned&mdash;by that I mean the people of Great Britain, who have their full share of responsibility for the existence of Partition in this country, our people in Northern Ireland and our own people here at home&mdash;that they must all come to recognise the inescapable fact that the Partition of this country will never be acceptable to the vast majority of the Irish people.  There is no use in anybody in Great Britain, Northern Ireland or here hoping that there can be an enduring settlement of our relations, which we most earnestly desire on terms of friendship and true co-operation, except on the basis of the restoration of the unity of this nation.</P>
      <P>The recognition of that inescapable political fact should make the people of Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic recognise that it is in the vital interest of us all to end Partition.  The sooner it is ended the less danger there will be of still greater evil arising from it, which even those of us with the best possible intentions might in certain circumstances find ourselves unable to control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that make those of us in the public life of this country most solicitous is the anxiety lest this enduring intolerable situation should create a condition where counsels of prudence, patience and charity should be swept aside and those who advocate <Col N="920" /> such counsels be forced to give way to more reckless spirits who might do both this country and our neighbours a great injury by believing that violence is an effective substitute for patience, reason and commonsense. We are living in a world in which there exist today threats and challenges to peace, freedom and all the fundamental political beliefs which the people in these two Islands share. I feel that menace is becoming so formidable and proximate that there is little time left to freedom-loving nations effectively to combine in defence of these values.</P>
    <P>Our people at home and abroad have an influence in the world disproportionate to the magnitude of the resources of the country from which we spring.  It seems to me to be a matter of vital interest to the cause of freedom that our people should be enabled to play their full part in the world's struggle to defend it.  Nothing is more certain than that in the enduring existence of the partition of this country a great deal of our potential for good in that crusade is negatived.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, for our people to make the full contribution which we could and should make to that cause, an essential prerequisite is the restoration of the unity of this country. I know and I have bitter reason for knowing that the advocacy of reason and argument in this cause sounds hollow in the ears of many of our people.  There is nobody in whose ears it should sound more hollow than in mine.</P>
    <P>I can look back over three generations in the family which advocated that cause of reconciliation of ourselves and the British people through the instrumentality of reason and argument.  I have known these methods twice abandoned under intolerable provocation.  I have seen the very things that were sought for the reconciliation of our people conceded to violence and even armed resistance which had been denied for decades to the methods of reason and argument. My grandfather was swept out of public life in pursuit of that campaign, as was my father.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> It must be difficult to preserve one's faith that some day the influence of argument, reason and charity can be made to prevail in matters of this kind.  I preserved that faith in the conviction that the alternative of civil war would be a disaster for our country, a crime against our people and an unthinkable expedient for the expedition of the disappearance of Partition.  I believe that is a hope every member of this House shares.</P>
    <P>I rejoice that every member of this House now appears to share the view that counsels of patience and prudence will prevail.  However, it is right that two things should go on record for those who run to read it.  There is no prospect now or ever that the partition of this country will be accepted as a permanent arrangement by the vast majority of the people of Ireland. Secondly, it ought to be borne in mind by everybody who wishes to see a peaceful resolution of this grievous problem that we all have a duty to refrain in so far as it is humanly possible not only from provocative acts but from provocative language because both could be pregnant of much evil.</P>
    <P>It is right to say that it would be wrong to allow this matter to be raised and discussed in this Parliament of Ireland without recalling that we here in this part of the country for which we are responsible rightly take pride in the fact that any minorities that live amongst us have every freedom, every right and every privilege that is claimed by the majority and that all elements in this Parliament representative of majorities or minorities however small are more solicitious to see the rights of the minorities vindicated and protected than to assert the legitimate constitutional rights of the majority that constitute our society.</P>
    <P>There does exist, unhappily, in the Northern Six Counties of this country, in certain areas and in certain regards, a readiness to deny the Catholic Nationalist majority the fundamental rights that are their clear due.  It is a great disservice to our people that that kind of thing should be tolerated to continue in Northern Ireland.  It will <Col N="922" /> be a great contribution to better understanding and to the prospect of enduring friendship if such abuses are resolutely sought out and rectified by the authorities who at present constitute the Government there.  It would be wrong for us in discussing this problem in an Irish Parliament to avert our eyes from that disagreeable fact and to pretend either that it does not exist or that we did not know about it.</P>
    <P>I believe there are many public-spirited and good people in Northern Ireland belonging to the Ascendancy that obtains there who share the view I have expressed.  I hope they will do their part to abate the abuses to which I now refer.  I record the conviction of this Party that in the difficult and dangerous work of restoring the unity of this country, we have to give our people the counsel of patience and of charity and of enduring resolution because the alternative to these is the disaster of civil war and there is no end, in our judgment, that would justify the precipitation of our people into a catastrophe of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the slightest notion of speaking on this motion until I heard the statement of the Taoiseach.  To a certain extent, what the Taoiseach said worried me. He began talking about the economic position in the North and in the South, about the removal of certain barriers which will, as he said himself, make for more friendly relations between North and South.  That worried me. So did the statements of the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, about patience and reconciliation.</P>
      <P>I want to make it plain to the Taoiseach that as far as we in this part of our country are concerned, what we have, we hold.  The freedom that we have in this part of our country was dearly bought by the red hot blood of our people and there should be no bargaining whatsoever that would in any way lessen that dearly-bought freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to &ldquo;the Government of Northern Ireland&rdquo;. There is no such thing as the Government <Col N="923" /> of Northern Ireland.  The Leader of the Opposition also referred to &ldquo;the Government of Northern Ireland&rdquo;. There is a junta set up there at the behest of the British Government.  It is a bad day that the Taoiseach should refer to them as a Government.  They are no such thing.  I never thought the day would come when the head of a Fianna Fáil Government would refer to that junta as &ldquo;the Government of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  There is no such thing as a Government of Northern Ireland.  There is, as I have said, a junta that is set up there.</P>
    <P>It worries me to hear the Taoiseach talk about certain bargaining as regards tariffs and things of that description.  I want to tell the Taoiseach that I disagree with Deputy Dillon.  I believe nothing was ever got for our people except what was fought for.  Patience or plámás never got our people anywhere.  I want the Taoiseach to realise that the freedom we have here was dearly bought and that there should be no bargaining whatsoever with this junta in the Six Counties.  &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; be damned.  It is not Northern Ireland; it is just a corner&mdash;six counties&mdash; nothing else.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Taoiseach&mdash;I do not think I should have to tell him&mdash; that sops never got our people anywhere. Any sops he holds out now to this Orange junta up there will not get us anywhere, unless it is of benefit to themselves.  I throw out this warning: let there be no bargaining whatsoever with that junta there with a view to coaxing them.  The majority of the people of our country do not want this area partitioned off.  The British Government&mdash;a democracy as they call themselves&mdash;are bolstering up that portion of our country in order to keep it away from us.  Apparently, the economic position is not so good there at the moment.  They are saying with one side of their mouths that they will come in and with the other side that they will not come in.</P>
    <P>The job of this Government or any Government we may have here is to <Col N="924" /> build up the portion of the country we have.  As time advances, the junta in the North, to whom, I regret to say, the Taoiseach refers as &ldquo;the Government of Northern Ireland&rdquo;, will some day in the near future have to surrender and come in with our country.  They belong to it, whether they like it or not.  We are willing to accept them but let there be no plainas designed to get them to come in that would interfere in any way with the economic position of this part of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with what the Taoiseach said in reply.  I confess I have great admiration for the Taoiseach.  He always makes a fighting speech but his speech on this motion was the tamest I ever heard. In fact, he scarcely raised his voice and had very little to say.  He commenced the little he did say by implying that I accepted the two nation theory of Lord Brookeborough.  That is not true.  I did not mention the word &ldquo;nation&rdquo; or imply at all that there were two nations.  I recognised the fact that there was a foreign element in Northern Ireland, which is an entirely different matter.  To recognise the two-nation theory of Lord Brookeborough would be to recognise their right to sovereignty and their right to be something apart from the rest.</P>
      <P>I hold the very opposite view.  The view I hold would be something like the view held by Lincoln regarding slavery in the Southern States.  Lincoln accepted slavery.  He realised he could not do much about it but he did not accept the right of the Southern States to secede or their right to be a nation. It is in that spirit I referred to the race apart in Northern Ireland.  In the latter part of my speech, I stated that if I had my way I would clean the slate.  I would have only one Government, not two.  Therefore, the Taoiseach made no point there.  I do not say it was deliberate but he misrepresented me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of my motion asked for a more vigorous policy on the part of the Taoiseach and he implied that he was not going to do anything other than what he was doing, <Col N="925" /> which means that the motion is justified. He admitted that he did not make any additional contribution at Oxford; he then went on to say that he has nothing extra to offer and that he does not intend to set up a pan-Irish conference to delegate powers. Again, he has misrepresented what I said.  I made no mention of delegating powers.  I suggested some sort of conference of an advisory nature whose powers could be defined.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made no case at all. The point I was making and have made all along is that he could do something that would appeal more to the idealists, to the people who are members of this House who will not take their seats, to the Sinn Féin element, to the 69,000 who voted in the last election for the points of view of these absentees.  He should try to meet these people.  I am not saying he should do what they would like him to do.  I am not a subscriber to force but if we claim sovereignty and deny the sovereignty of Northern Ireland, then we have certain rights.  I am not suggesting we should avail of those rights.  I fully agree that the only way this problem can be solved, without going to the extent of using force, is by making concessions.</P>
    <P>We should recognise the problem for what it is and not what we would like it to be, that there is a tough crowd up there who are not like the rest of us.  They are allied to Britain because they are part of the British race.  I also pointed out that England's interest cannot be ignored.  We should put forward some proposals.  It is no use beating around the bush.  This is a problem which involves commitments. It is a serious matter in a democracy because it seems to be the aim of one Party to take advantage of any little weakness that appears in the other Party.  I appreciate that national problems are difficult to solve in a democracy.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to set up a council to advise on Partition so that the question could be taken away from Party politics.  So long as any Party strives on its own to solve this problem, the other Parties, while they <Col N="926" /> may appear to help, may be only too glad, behind the scenes, to make things difficult in order to gain Party advantage. Therefore, it is not easy for this institution to make progress on a problem of this kind.  If such a conference were brought about where there would be goodwill understanding and common agreement such as in regard to the proposal by the Taoiseach that the social benefits would be maintained, greater progress would be made.  He said that in all good faith and I admit that is a point.  He wanted to remove the fear that even the Nationalists might not agree.</P>
    <P>We must accept that ordinary people are animated by their own desires. They cannot understand how somebody else should get more and they should get less.  That is why I suggest the setting up of a council where representatives of all Parties would agree not to make any proposals that would aim at solving the problem along Party lines, thus raising awkward questions here, and that if such an attempt were made, it would get no support.</P>
    <P>There is a case for the setting up of some sort of council.  Although this is the sovereign body, it will make no progress on Partition.  The Taoiseach, whether intentionally or otherwise, misrepresented me once or twice but he had nothing to offer in the nature of a solution to this problem.  However, I do not intend to press the motion.  I tabled it for the purpose of airing views on the subject and I am glad I have done so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order Paper it is &ldquo;should be usable&rdquo;.  I am not the first to raise this matter in Dáil Éireann.  I know the suggestion has been resisted from time to time by various Governments.  I am not certain, but it is possible it was raised during the period in which I was a member of the Government.  It is put down now in an effort to see if the suggestion can be implemented or, at least, to have the position clarified. Straight away, I may say I do not intend to ask the House to divide on this.  If there is a reasonable answer, I shall be the first to accept it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne and I were prompted to put down the motion because of the incontrovertible fact that the building of houses by local authorities at present is proving very costly.  Because of the high cost of building, high rents have to be charged.  Those are the main reasons why this motion has been tabled and why we should like to have a discussion here on the problem and especially a contribution from the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of these grants.</P>
      <P>I do not want to pursue in any detail the subject of the high cost of building houses and the high rents that have to be charged because I think every Deputy is aware of the position.  Houses are costing a pretty high figure for various reasons: the high cost of materials, the high cost of land and, of course, the increase in tradesmen's wages and in builders' labourers' wages over the past few years.  Whatever may be the reason for the high cost of building houses, the fact is that the rents that are being charged, and must be charged, are to a large extent outside the reach of the people for whom the houses are primarily intended.  At the moment the situation appears to be that those who are the first responsibility of the local authorities cannot be catered for from the point of view of making available to them houses at a cheap rent.  If accepted and implemented, this motion would tend to decrease the cost of building houses, with a consequential decrease in the rents charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that winter relief scheme <Col N="928" /> grants were introduced for a particular purpose.  As their description suggests, the primary purpose is the relief of unemployment amongst those registered at the employment exchanges and in receipt of unemployment assistance. I know too, that any work which local authorities engage in with the assistance of these grants must be work with a pretty high labour content. They are the two main qualifications for the use of moneys given by the Minister for Finance to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in many districts &mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government could enlighten us on this&mdash;local authorities have grave difficulty in finding suitable schemes for the employment of money given by way of winter relief grant.  Members and officials of local authorities have been at their wits' end &mdash;this is borne out by discussions&mdash;to find suitable schemes on which to expend these moneys.  While the moneys have not been wasted in that they have given certain employment, they are to some extent wasted in that the work done is not of particular or exceptional benefit to the village, town or city involved.  I suggest, therefore, that winter relief grants, if employed in the manner suggested here, would be far more advantageous to local authorities, more important still, more advantageous to the community in general and, most important of all, to those who are the responsibility of the local authority from the point of view of housing.</P>
    <P>This motion asks that agreement be given to making available winter relief grant moneys for the development of local authority housing sites.  I am not a member of a local authority but I understand the position is that if a winter relief grant is used for the development of a site, that site cannot be used for house building by the local authority until a period of two years has elapsed.  Whether or not that regulation has been scrapped, I do not know.  I await with interest the Parliamentary Secretary's statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>I know one housing scheme where a winter relief grant was used for <Col N="929" /> development purposes.  The Parliamentary Secretary has no responsibility for this, but the local authority was penalised later on in the subsidy paid. If that is to obtain, in the event of this motion being accepted, the whole purpose of the motion will be negatived. I cannot see any valid reason why these moneys could not be used to assist in the building of houses. Nobody has yet given me any valid reason for the ban on their use in such a manner.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example now of a housing scheme of approximately 30 houses.  It is estimated that the development of the site will cost about £4,000.  That represents £136 per house.  That can be reflected in a pretty big way in the rents that must be charged.  I think it would be a good thing, therefore, if a winter relief grant of £4,000 were made available to the local authority for the development of the site&mdash;levelling the construction of roads and footpaths, the laying of sewerage pipes and water mains.  It may be argued that the primary purpose of these grants is to give employment and schemes engaged in must have a high labour content. I suggest that the preparation of a site, as far as levelling is concerned, certainly carries a high labour content, unless it is suggested that bulldozers or other similar machinery be employed.</P>
    <P>The moneys for the development of a site from the winter relief grant could be devoted to the building of roadways. The repair and even the building and laying of roadways is, in the ordinary course of events, accepted as work that may be done with the winter relief grants, but cannot be done when it is related to the development of a site for the building of houses.  A favourite scheme for local authorities is the laying of footpaths, or the repair of broken footpaths.  I suggest again that the winter relief grant money could be devoted to the laying of footpaths on a site intended for building houses, and similarly in respect of preliminary work for the laying of sewerage pipes and water main pipes.  Let me stress again how difficult it is for tenants, especially <Col N="930" /> those in the lower income groups, to pay the rent that is being charged for local authority houses by reason of the fact that they cost so much.</P>
    <P>Of course, as I said before, if there is to be an application of these grants to the development of housing sites at the expense of a reduction in the subsidy, local authorities will not be encouraged to use the winter relief grant as proposed in this motion.  In any case, I do not think it should affect the Government fund subsidy because it is still based on the maximum cost of a house being £1,500. The subsidy is given only on a house which is built by local authorities, assuming that the maximum cost is £1,500, or, should I say, it is not given on any house that costs over £1,500. The average all-in cost to-day of a local authority house in the urban areas is in the region of £1,800.</P>
    <P>I have not got much more to say. The motion does not require a lot of explaining.  The explanation as to why this is not done should come from the Parliamentary Secretary and I should be very interested to hear the case against the application of such money in this way.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the motion, in view of the fact that house building is so costly at present and because many of the poorer classes of people are unable to pay the rents demanded for houses by local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that there is nothing but the best intention behind the motion.  It is in fact an effort to try to devote to another purpose money that is already given for the read of unemployment; in other words, in addition to relieving unemployment to apply it to subsidising house rents for local authorities.  For that reason, the Minister for Local Government and I have given considerable thought to the motion and to the purpose behind it.  I want to say at the outset that in all the circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that it is not a motion that could with any good reason be accepted, at this time anyhow. <Col N="931" /> There are a number of reasons for that and I want to deal with some of the more important ones.</P>
      <P>As the proposer of the motion has already correctly stated, the purpose of the Special Employment Scheme Grants is to give employment, in addition to the normal employment which is likely to be available.  If there were an urgent and pressing need to go on with housebuilding, and if for some reason or other, it was being held up by site development, that would be a good reason for considering this motion in another light.  For instance, during the war years when materials were not readily available for housebuilding and when local authorities were prepared to go on with the housing drive immediately materials became available, site grants were made available in anticipation of the resumption of the housing grants.  One could easily see the sound sense of that.</P>
      <P>At the present time that is not the position.  Money is available for local authority housing, including site development work, but there is no appreciable delay, nor would anything contained in the motion tend to accelerate the housing drive or the rate at which houses are being built, and, taking into consideration all the disadvantages involved, the amount of relief it would give to subsidise the rents would be inconsiderable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see that it would really have any serious impact on rent subsidisation or reduction.  First as the mover pointed out, these moneys are allocated to the different areas, urban and non-urban towns, in relation to the figures of unemployment the number of unemployment assistance recipients therein, and the amount in most cases would scarcely be sufficient to do any worthwhile development on what might be a reasonably big site.  Therefore, the position is that if any worthwhile work were to be done with the moneys available, larger grants would be necessary or failing that continuing grants, doing a little bit each year; in other words, entry on to a site for development.  To do anything else <Col N="932" /> would involve a commitment that the work would have to be completed, irrespective of whether the unemployment figures justified the allocation of grants in future years or not.</P>
    <P>There are complications which might be really difficult to overcome. There is likely to be a tendency to use this money for site development when in fact better sites requiring less development might be available.  In some flat counties like Kildare and elsewhere, it is easy to get good sites involving little development but in mountainous counties like Donegal and Kerry, very often a good deal of money has to go towards the development of the sites, when we think in terms of levelling, a matter to which the proposer of the motion referred a good deal.  The area which was the more qualified for the better grant, owing to the registered figures of unemployment, might be the very one which would require less money for site development.</P>
    <P>These are only small considerations but they are some of the main factors which would militate against the successful operation of what the motion suggests.  There is an obligation on the local authorities to seek work with the greatest possible labour content.  That is something with which we are very much concerned, particularly in the cities at the present time where it is becoming increasingly difficult to get work with a reasonably good labour content.  Site development in the cities or the larger towns involves the laying on of water, sewerage, road construction and footpaths&mdash;all involving very costly work, with not a lot of unskilled labour content.  As I have said already, it would require large grants to make any reasonable impression on the real object of the motion.</P>
    <P>At the moment, grants are subsidised in respect of these houses and the subsidy is reasonably generous. The same pressure for local authority housing which existed some time back does not now exist.  A good deal of thought has been given to the requirements of the programme for the future, but in many cases saturation point has already been reached, so <Col N="933" /> that we would really be operating a rather inequitable scheme whereby in particular areas we might create an unfair advantage against those areas which are obliged to accept the full rents with the existing subsidy, without any further remission.</P>
    <P>By and large our schemes are working out reasonably well.  There are certain criteria in regard to the qualification for these grants&mdash;the relative figures of unemployed, the provision of work of a suitable labour content with a reasonably good portion of the work going to unskilled labour.  I do not think, particularly in relation to the question of the relief of unemployment, it could be argued that we are seriously contributing to that if we step in and take over work that would ordinarily be done by the housing drive.</P>
    <P>That is the principal point to my mind, which would tip the scales against the operation of the scheme for the purpose which the motion suggests.  If one were to make a case for the future subsidisation of grants, that would be a totally different argument and would possibly involve Departments other than the Office of Public Works, but these schemes, as administered by the Special Employment Schemes Office, are clear cut and designed for a definite purpose.  I do not think they could, within the scope of the spirit of their administration, be diverted to serve the dual purpose of providing employment and the subsidisation of grants as well.  It is not a problem which is crying out for general application at the moment.  It would not tend towards the acceleration of the housing drive and would not create extra employment for the people.  The amount of the subsidy. which it would contribute to the rents of a particular housing scheme would be so infinitesimal that the benefits are far outweighed by the many advantages which would be secured from leaving the schemes to be administered as they are at the present time.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to elaborate any further on the motion.  I concede that there is a very good, laudable purpose behind it but it <Col N="934" /> might create an erroneous idea that if these schemes were allowed to be diverted to that purpose, huge reductions could be secured in local authority rents.  That is not the case.  I can conceive of only an infinitesimal reduction in any case.  It would be rather sporadic and would apply to certain areas and not to others.  Taking all those matters into consideration, I am afraid I could not at present accept the motion in its existing form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position there is that if we conceded that, it would be tantamount to saying we should use these moneys for site development.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I like about this motion is that it endeavours to make the money for special employment schemes serve a useful purpose.  I have the feeling that behind the special employment schemes is the old Victorian <Col N="935" /> or 19th century idea that any money spent for the relief of unemployment or for the relief of hardship must not be spent usefully.  What I look round me in Dublin, I see some horrible scars inflicted on this city under the special employment schemes and schemes for the relief of wholesale unemployment.</P>
      <P>Within a couple of minutes walk of my own house, £15,000 was spent in spoiling the neighbourhood.  That was bad enough but it took the best part of eight months to do it during which the local authority&mdash;I think with no permission whatsoever&mdash;put up a detour notice which upset large numbers of the community.  One of the ways in which money was wasted under the special employment schemes was that a wail, previously four feet high around a local school, was raised another three feet.  We now have around beautiful parkland with trees, a wall about 500 yards long and now three feet higher than it was before.  The only virtue I see in it is that, in the next couple of years, money from the same source will be used to take down the wall again because the Parliamentary Secretary, his colleagues in the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Transport and Power are calling on people to lower walls&mdash;I think public money is being spent in many cases&mdash;so that tourists can see the landscape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In more than one case, money is spent on erecting unnecessary eye-sores&mdash;walls which spoil the view and which in themselves have no aesthetic value.  A concrete wall dashed with pebbles and cement is not a very pleasant view.  In Dublin, we had reasonably good footpaths ripped up and replaced by better footpaths.  I can think of many better ways in which the money could have been used in providing the same amount of labour.  I appreciate that the purpose behind these schemes is to provide employment for a considerable unskilled labour content which might not otherwise be provided but I feel that there is a revulsion in the Special Employment Schemes Office to spending any money under their vote, if it <Col N="936" /> can be usefully done by some other Department.</P>

However, the notion at present in relation to special employment schemes seems to be the same as they had in the 19th century.  At that time, landlords believed in building high walls around estates and the same notion was behind the erection of the &ldquo;monument to the great hunger&rdquo; at Killiney.  That monument was put up purely for the purpose of providing work for the unemployed. Other such works included the Bottle Tower at Rathfarnham and others further out.  They were all built for the purpose of providing employment.</P>

The purpose of the motion is to ensure that the money will be used for the development of local authority housing sites and I do not think it would be so much resented by people living in houses erected some time ago, and who did not have the benefit of money provided for special employment schemes when the sites of their houses were being prepared.  For one thing, the cost of building is now higher than it was ten years ago and, as the Parliamentary Secretary has <Col N="937" /> said, there are some cases where there are peculiar problems because of the nature of the ground or site.  If you provide money in such cases, in effect, you are only balancing out the cost of the houses.  If it costs twice as much to prepare the foundations of houses on the top of a mountain as it costs in the city of Dublin, then it is only fair to subsidise the cost of building on a site where it would not otherwise be economic to build.</P>
      <P>I feel the Parliamentary Secretary might be able to overcome the administrative difficulties which he may feel exist in relation to the problem, in so far as the development of housing sites is concerned.  It is mostly unskilled labour that is involved and on that account I do not think the intentions of this House would be thwarted. I know the House intended that this money be spent on providing work for unskilled labourers and I do not think the intention behind the motion is in conflict with that intention.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Corish said, the motion is pretty well self-explanatory. Deputy Ryan has put into words the exact idea that motivated Deputy Corish and myself in moving it.  Its intention, if the Parliamentary Secretary sees fit to implement it, is to see that productive work is carried out with this money.  I remember back in 1948, though perhaps under different circumstances, the then Minister for Local Government, the late Mr. T. J. Murphy, advocating such a policy on visits to local authorities, though I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that at that time there was an urgency in the housing drive. Many preparations had to be made and supplies were scarce but I still think that to carry out productive work with the special employment grants is in itself a good aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main objections raised by the Parliamentary Secretary is that this would be an encouragement to local authorities to neglect to spend the money they normally would have to spend on housing schemes, or on those portions of schemes which would be their responsibility, and that that would mean a loss of employment. <Col N="938" /> Perhaps that is quite true but the loss in employment would be infinitesimally small.  Local authorities do not tackle housing schemes every year, or even every five years, and that loss in employment would be offset by the gain both to the rates and to the tenants of local authority houses developed by this money.</P>
    <P>As a member of a number of local authorities, I find that very often schemes, presumably sanctioned by the Parliamentary Secretary, while being desirable and having a high employment content, are not productive.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that to engage on site development, with the uncertainty of not knowing whether the local authority concerned would get a further grant the following year would be disastrous, and that having started to develop a site, the authority might find itself in a position that it would not have any special employment grant awarded to it in the following year, with which to finish the job, because of a change in the unemployment position in the area.  I gravely doubt that we can reach such a Utopia in which our unemployed position would be so low that we would not merit a grant at all.</P>

      <P>Is it not quite true that in my own area we have embarked on a long-term scheme of using that grant to extend a promenade as a bulwark against coastal erosion, with the sanction of the Parliamentary Secretary's Department, and are depending on a continuation of the grant next year?</P>

      <P>Surely it is not to be left half breached, liable to be washed away by the sea, and all the money already spent on it wasted because of an improvement in the unemployment situation in my area?  Anyway, we did not envisage that money being used now on big sites for housing, but I suggest that the money could be very usefully employed on site development. <Col N="939" /> There are many derelict sites which need attention and many small groups of houses still to be built.  If that were done, it would tie in with the policy advocated by Bord Fáilte through its tidy towns competition, and surely the greatest eyesores in our urban areas are derelict sites and roofless houses?  As I pointed out in a previous talk on this subject, many landlords secure a remission of rates by simply pulling down chimneys from old houses and pulling off the roofs.  I believe no remission of the rates should be given unless a derelict building is taken down completely and the site left in a condition that will not be an offence to the eye.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, as the further discussions for an attempt to reach agreement between the European Economic Community and the European Free Trade Area towards a free trade area in Europe will take place within the framework of G.A.T.T. in the first part of its session, Ireland will be represented at such discussions; if so, by whom; and if Ireland will not be directly represented, if he will have an observer present to keep this country privy to any negotiations that take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy has in mind the G.A.T.T. Tariff Conference which opened in Geneva on the 1st September last. This Conference will be held in two phases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase, which is expected to last until Christmas, is primarily concerned with re-negotiations between the Six Member States of the European Economic Community and the other members of the G.A.T.T. due to the fact that, in moving to the common external tariff of the Community, some of its members will have to increase duties which individually <Col N="940" /> they had bound in earlier G.A.T.T. tariff negotiations.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the Conference, which will take place in the opening months of 1961, will be largely concerned with negotiations between the Contracting Parties to the G.A.T.T. for new tariff concessions, including negotiations with the European Economic Community for reductions in its common external customs tariff.  At the same time countries which intend to accede to the G.A.T.T. will have the opportunity of conducting the tariff negotiations which are a necessary preliminary to accession.</P>
    <P>As Ireland is not a Contracting Party to the G.A.T.T., we have not so far been taking part in the present Tariff Conference.  However, as the Deputy will be aware from the official announcement issued at the beginning of September, the Government have decided to investigate the question of Ireland's accession to the G.A.T.T. and discussions to this end have been proceeding with the Contracting Parties.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that it is proposed to try to reach agreement between the European Economic Community and the European Free Trade Area within the framework of the G.A.T.T.  Indeed, I am afraid that I can see no immediate prospect of fruitful discussions of the kind indicated in the Deputy's Question, either within or outside the framework of the G.A.T.T., although the matter does appear to fall within the scope of the Committee on Trade Problems established last January, on which Ireland is represented.  This Committee, which met in March and June last, set up in June a Study Group to examine, among other questions, the ways in which reciprocal tariff concessions between the E.E.C., E.F.T.A., and the other members of the Committee could be achieved and has directed the Study Group to organise its work having in mind negotiations within the framework of the G.A.T.T.  Tariff Conference.  If the work of the Study Group results in negotiations within the G.A.T.T. in which this country would be directly interested, the Government will seek <Col N="941" /> to ensure that Ireland will be represented at such negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of recipients of unemployment assistance in County Mayo, and the number who have had their allowances reduced or stopped in the past three years to the latest accounting date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy) Michael Joseph Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics of numbers of recipients of Unemployment Assistance are not kept on a county area basis, and the information sought by the Deputy in this regard in respect of County Mayo is accordingly not available.  As regards the remainder of the information required, the Deputy is no doubt aware that the means of holders of qualification certificates must be reviewed when any change occurs in the circumstances of a holder e.g. acquirement of property, marriage, change of address.  The means of self-employed persons must also be re-examined periodically.  Apart from the other reasons mentioned the means of the holder of a qualification certificate must also be re-investigated if his circumstances have not been reviewed for a number of years.</P>
      <P>The numbers of unemployment assistance cases in County Mayo reviewed by Officers of my Department in discharge of their statutory duties in the years ended 31st October, 1958, 31st October, 1959, and 31st October, 1960, were 423, 885, and 995 respectively. Unemployment assistance was reduced in 187, 489 and 535 cases respectively and disallowed in 84, 272 and 266 cases respectively.</P>
      <P>Prior to September, 1958, the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes, where such were derived from the occupation of land, was based on values for stock, crops, etc. adopted in 1940.  Since September, 1958, up-to-date values, as are used for old age pensions purposes, have been applied to the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the value for <Col N="945" /> means assessment purposes now placed on two cows and two calves, and the value for such purposes placed in the years 1940 and 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the relevant statutory provisions governing the calculation of means in the case of applicants for social assistance payments, the yearly value of advantage accruing to a person from property used and enjoyed, such as agricultural holdings, must be included in the assessment.  This yearly value is determined by the officers of my Department in discharge of their statutory duties by reference to the facts, evidence and information which it is reasonably possible to obtain in each particular case and which appear to be sufficient for the purpose.</P>
      <P>The estimated yearly profit on stock is not a fixed amount for general application but varies according to quality of land and stock, standard of husbandry and other relevant factors such as in the case of cows the method of disposal of milk, prices obtaining locally, etc.  The assessment of means is based on the estimated average profit over a period of years.  This method of assessment has been in operation for old age pensions for more than 45 years and for widows' and orphans' pensions since inception in 1935.  It did not undergo any modification in 1940 or 1950, or since, for old age pensions or widows' and orphans' pensions purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be other factors in that case.  If the Deputy <Col N="946" /> gives me particulars of the case, I shall have it investigated.  The claimant has a right to appeal on all these matters and the appeals officer is inclined to play them down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister aims at uniformity of values in all social welfare systems where there is a means test.  It would be most unfair to have one value for an old age pensioner and a lesser value for an able-bodied man.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will take steps to ensure that a receipt will be issued by the Revenue Commissioners to the person from whose earnings the income tax is deducted weekly, monthly, <Col N="948" /> etc., instead of sending receipts to the employers or collectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to take the steps suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>An official receipt is issued to employers in respect of each remittance of tax deducted under the scheme of Pay As You Earn; and after the end of the income tax year the employer is required to give to each taxable employee a certificate showing the amount of pay received during the year, the amount of the employee's tax-free allowances and the amount of tax deducted.</P>
      <P>Except for the cases of small employers using stamp books in which a quarterly return is made for each employee, the Revenue is not aware until after the end of the income tax year of the amount of tax deducted in any week or month from a particular employee.  It would not therefore be possible, under the present system, for the Revenue to issue receipts to employees in respect of the weekly or monthly tax deductions.</P>

When they approved of the proposal a survey was made on 4-12-57 to prepare a sketch scheme.  On consideration of that scheme by the Department of Education it was found that the attendance at the school warranted an additional classroom and a further inspection was made on the 5-10-60 to get the more detailed information required for the preparation of working drawings.  As all three inspections formed part of inspection tours embracing other buildings, the precise cost is not ascertainable but it is computed to be about £22.</P>

The application of the grant to specific projects is in the first instance a matter for the local authority.

At the first interview which he had with an officer of my Department on 24 Mean Fómhair, 1960, the producer stated that he would co-operate fully with the Department in ensuring that the questions to be put at the interviews would be designed to bring out answers dealing with points which the Department regarded as important.  On 29 Mean Fómhair, 1960, the producer undertook that he would give representatives of An Roinn Cosanta the opportunity of hearing the programme in the form in which he intended that it should be broadcast, so that any final editing necessary could be mutually agreed. This latter undertaking was repeated at further discussions on the 7 and 13 Deireadh Fómhair, 1960 and in a telephone <Col N="960" /> conversation with an officer of my Department on the 17th idem.  At the discussion on 13 Deireadh Fómhair, 1960 the producer also promised that certain important points made in support of Civil Defence by An Stiurthóir Cosanta Sibhialta in his recorded interview, and which were specifically brought to the producer's notice, would be retained in the final recording.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that the payment by his Department of substantial sums of money held in the names of deceased persons in Post Office Savings Bank accounts without requiring production of letters of administration where such persons died intenstate has resulted in persons lawfully entitled to claim against the estate being defrauded; if sums up to £500 have been paid out of such accounts without regard for the legal rights of next-of-kin entitled to share by virtue of the law of intestate succession; and if he will direct that this practice should immediately stop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 38, 39 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>Where a depositor in the Post Office Savings Bank dies intestate and the balance in his account exceeds £100, the statutory regulations require the production of letters of administration before payment is made.  This is not necessary in cases of nominations, joint or trust accounts or where is certain circumstances, a claim is made by the husband of a deceased depositor.</P>
      <P>Where the balance in a sole account does not exceed £100 and the depositor has not executed a nomination, inquiries are made as to whether letters of administration have been extracted.  Where extracted, the Letters of Administration are inspected before payment is made.  If it is intended to obtain Letters of Administration, a statement of the balance in the account is issued for inclusion in the Schedule of Assets for estate duty and payment is made to the administrator when the grant issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is not intended to take out administration, a registrar's certificate of death is required, and in cases of sole accounts inquiries are made as to whether the depositor left next-of-kin; particulars of the degree of relationship together with their names, addresses and ages are required.  Payment is made to the person or persons entitled according to the status of <Col N="966" /> distribution or at common law, provided no claim has been received for funeral expenses, or in respect of public assistance.  Reimbursement of the amount of the funeral expenses is made to the person who paid them, if required, or his consent is obtained before distributing the balance in the account.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that the practice in the Savings Bank has deprived anyone lawfully entitled to benefit from the account of a deceased depositor, or that the purpose of the law governing estate succession has in any way been defeated by such practice.  I am satisfied that the balances in the accounts of deceased depositors are disposed of in accordance with the statutory regulations made under the Post Office Savings Bank Acts.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to deal with this complicated matter through Parliamentary question and answer.  If the Deputy has a complaint arising out of a specific case, I shall be glad to have the matter fully investigated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this is a matter of public importance?  Would he not give an unequivocal undertaking that amounts in excess of £100 will not be paid out to claimants from Post Office Savings Bank accounts where the depositor has died intestate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The only undertaking I can give is that the Acts will be administrated in accordance with the intentions of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that it is very grave if a person entitled to a share of the assets of a depositor who has died intestate does not get it because the Minister's Department paid out money to somebody without surety or bond as to his behaviour?  Does the Minister not realise that banks adopt certain measures with regard to such money and have regulations which apparently are not good enough for the Post Office Savings Bank?  I can give the Minister examples of cases where amounts even in excess of £300 were paid out. A person who said he represented an intestate deceased depositor was able to obtain money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>A request to have Milverton national school, County Dublin, inspected with a view to the carrying out of a scheme of improvements was received in December, 1957.  Due to the heavy programme of work on hands some time necessarily had to elapse before the inspection could be carried out. As is the case in relation to all schemes of improvements the preparation of a sketch scheme took a considerable time.  The fact that the lease of the existing school site was about to expire and that arrangements for its renewal had to be made also delayed matters.</P>
      <P>The formalities which have to be completed are the finalising of the arrangements in regard to the lease, the preparation of the detailed working drawings and specification, the invitation of tenders by public advertisement and the examination of the tenders prior to the placing of a contract.</P>

      <P>Action by parents cannot expedite these works.  As I said already, we have a very large scheme of school building and school improvements in hands.  It depends on an orderly carrying out of the works of the Departments concerned.  Action by parents in any particular case is often and attempt to get a position out of the queue, or order of priority.  It can lead only to delays by taking up the time of my staff and, I am sure, the staff in the Office of Public Works. That is why I thought the question might be mischievous.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of his speech, said he felt that any savings made in the cost of house erection by local authorities by the adoption of the system advocated in the motion would not have any appreciable effect on rents.  I have information&mdash;I am not quite sure whether it was used by Deputy Corish in his opening speech or not&mdash;that the use of grants for site development in the case of the John Street site in Wexford resulted in a saving estimated at about £4,080 or of £136 per house.  Taking the cost of the average local authority house at about £1,500, I suggest that a saving of £136 is of considerable magnitude which would be reflected in the rent charged.  Any use of public money or diversion of public money that would enable local authorities to carry out their commitments at reduced cost to tenants should be welcomed by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>I accept and appreciate his remarks to the effect that he believes in the motive behind the motion.  He stated publicly that he felt that it was intended as a constructive motion but regretted that it would not be practicable to put it into operation.  I suggest to him that there are advantages which should outweigh the disadvantages he enumerated.  I suggest that perhaps his Departments are conservative. Departments that have been acting in a certain way for a long time resent change.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take the initiative in this case, even as an experiment in approved cases.  It will not be necessary to make it compulsory on local authorities to use this money for sites development but it should be made permissive, if they so wish or, perhaps, if they can put up a case, the Parliamentary Secretary should seek authority to permit them to carry out site development out of special employment scheme grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see advantages that would accrue from the channelling of this money into site development for housing. First, there would be a reduction in cost, be it great or small.  Then there would be continuity of employment on building work which would retain a unit of direct labour in existence in local authorities.  That could be wedded to the idea of clearing derelict sites and at the same time, providing small sites for grouped house building, as is most desirable in <Col N="975" /> the case of local authority housing. The system of large scheme development of outlying parts of corporation or urban areas, cities or large towns, tends to move the workingclass people away from their employment and to impose additional expense on them in bus fares or in providing their own transport to work.  Difficulty is created for the tenants and their wives and families who are removed from shops, schools and churches in very many cases.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the proposal would have the effect of improving the type of building provided, in so far as it would encourage small sited development. It would also have the desirable effect of improving the position in relation to derelict sites in local authority areas.  When a local authority secured permission from the Department of Local Government for a scheme, it would mean speedier erection of the houses because the contractor would enter a prepared site.  A good deal of delay in house building is due to the preparation of certain types of sites in many cases.  In some cases, of course, sites are ideally situated from the point of view of sewerage and water services and roads. It would be an excellent thing if contractors could enter on sites where these services were already laid on and could start immediately to erect the houses.</P>
    <P>I do not think I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary on the question of loss of employment.  Site development by direct labour by a local authority would have a much larger employment content than site development by the contractor as part of a housing scheme.  The local authority, very likely, would employ manual labour as against machinery. The local authority would not have, and very probably would not trouble to hire, bulldozers or exceptionally heavy machinery to carry out site development, which can be done quite as effectively with a shovel or pickaxe. I instance the excellent work that was done in that way as far back as 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>We have gone just a little step too <Col N="976" /> far in the encouragement of mechanisation because of the supposed saving in cost.  I wonder if that saving is as real as we think it is, in view of the fact that there is such a vast number of unemployed seeking employment? It is much more important to take men off the dole and to put them to work, even though the time taken may be a little longer.  Even if the work is only 95 per cent, as good, the important feature is that men are employed rather than imported machinery.  That argument should appeal to the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the development of small sites or small groups of sites could be offered to people to encourage them to build under the Small Dwellings Acts and that the preparation of the site and the laying on of sewerage and other services for housing could be regarded as the supplementary grant which local authorities are being encouraged by the Minister for Local Government to give for the purpose of Small Dwellings Act building. In this way, there would be continuity of employment in the building trade, mainly in the labouring class.</P>
    <P>We have no intention of making an issue of this motion by demanding a vote.  We brought it forward believing it was something which should be discussed.  We would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine the facets of the question in as favourable a lights as possible and to do the best he can to turn this very desirable employment which has come by his Department into productive employment, in the interests both of his Department and of the local authorities themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I had not the advantage of hearing the proposer or the Parliamentary Secretary's reply so my observations on this motion will be governed largely by my idea of its purpose.  Already, as I understand the circulars which have come from Government Departments in the past few years, the clearing of derelict sites can be done under these special employment grants.  Subsequently, although it is a different operation, these sites may be considered suitable <Col N="977" /> for building and they are then dealt with as building sites.  Consequently, the employment relief grants are to an extent used in the way this motion suggests.  If my interpretation is correct, and I think it is, as far as urban areas are concerned&mdash;and I presume rural areas come into the same category&mdash;the local authorities provide one-sixth of the moneys being expended under the special employment relief grants and the local authority contributes towards the loan charges and gives grants for building under the Small Dwellings Acts.  The site element is included proportionately in these charges and consequently as matters stand, there would be a certain amount of overlapping.</P>
      <P>As far as the purpose of the motion is concerned, to give perhaps a wider scope for direct labour, employment and so on, that is already done where direct labour schemes are in operation. The development of the site has sometimes led to contract if it is of a nature that will require a good deal of machinery, especially on the laying of roads and other such work.  I know at least one authority which, when its schemes are prepared on certain sites, leaves a certain proportion for private development under the Small Dwellings Acts.  The sites are already prepared for the people to move in and build their houses, and very often these are not availed of, even though it saves the intending builder from legal charges in trying to acquire sites and getting title and matters of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of what the motion contains is already covered by some local authorities in different ways but not perhaps to the extent suggested. Furthermore, when sites are decided upon for building in suburban areas or in the environs of some of our towns and villages, there are small narrow passages of roads which lead to sites and money could be expended on improving them.  Road workers do not now get continuous employment and during the lean period, when the funds of the ordinary workers of the county council run out, they could be kept in continuous employment on works of that kind.  However, that <Col N="978" /> goes beyond what is stated in the motion.  If the preparation of sites is to be done by ordinary council labour, that increases the costs very often, although I agree with Deputy Kyne that perhaps we have gone too far in the use of machinery because then we have the machines and not the men.</P>
    <P>It is most important that we should provide for our population by giving them employment, even though the economics of it may not be favourable, because it will be a bad day when we consider entirely our bank balances being correct and disregard our people going.  At the same time, there is a limit to that consideration because the charge comes back and is reflected in the work that has been done.  Even though there may be an advantage, the Government and public authorities will have to work out what is the best solution for the community generally. I think this motion deserves consideration but as far as I can see and as far as my experience goes, it is being implemented to some extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should introduce proposals for legislation to provide for a minimum of twelve working days' annual holidays with pay for all workers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hardly necessary at this juncture to justify workers seeking to have annual holidays.  Their right to enjoy annual holidays has been conceded to a greater or lesser extent for many years.  Only very small sections of our community would, I think, deny to <Col N="979" /> workers today this opportunity of rest, recreation and recuperation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I intervene?  If the Deputy will give way, my intervention may help to shorten the discussion of this motion.  A few days ago, I announced publicly that the Government have in hands the preparation of legislation extending the minimum entitlement of workers to holidays.  As Deputy Larkin is aware, the present position is that the minimum entitlement is six working days, plus, in appropriate cases, bank holidays, or days in lieu.  That is covered by the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, and the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy has outlined, in many cases, workers get a fortnight's annual leave with pay, plus public holidays. That position has been secured by agreements registered by the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  There probably are employee's who, because they are not organised, do not enjoy the 12 working days, plus the other holidays; it is for the purpose of making adequate provision for these that the proposed legislation will be introduced.  It is not my intention, therefore, to oppose this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's assurance.  Perhaps I might take this opportunity of referring to one or two matters.  As the Minister is aware, under existing legislation, a worker in receipt of over £350 a year is not legally entitled to even the six-day period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to raise that ceiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been a cause of trouble.  There are two or three other aspects which should be considered. Workers covered by legislation are frequently denied annual holidays because wet time is not taken into consideration as a qualifying period.  That is particularly true in the case of building trade workers; wet time for which payment is made <Col N="980" /> is not included for holiday purposes. The same position obtains where illness occurs.  The Act provides that an interruption for a period of one month can have the effect of depriving the worker of the full holiday period.  A peculiar feature is that the present annual leave is not included. The Minister has assured us that he intends to revise the provisions.  I trust he will consider these points when it comes to framing the new legislation.</P>
      <P>With regard to public holidays, another difficulty arises.  Where employees are due to go on annual leave, and a public holiday occurs in or around the period, certain employers have arranged matters in such a manner that the employees get their annual leave immediately prior to the date on which the public holidays falls. The employers then contend that under the Act the employees must work 150 hours in the five weeks immediately preceding the holiday and the employees are, therefore, not entitled to the benefit of the public holiday.  I am sure it was never the intention to afford anyone an opportunity of getting around the Act in that manner.</P>
      <P>In view of the Minister's assurance of his intention to introduce legislation, I shall, with the permission of the Chair, withdraw this motion.  I trust the Minister will give us an opportunity of raising the various points here or permitting us to communicate with him before the introduction of the legislation.  Revision has been requested for some years by workers' organisations at the annual congresses of the various trade unions and at the annual congress of the Trade Union Congress.</P>
      <P>Finally, could the Minister give us some indication as to when we may expect this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>The legislation is in course of preparation.  The heads of the Bill have been drafted.  The Deputy will appreciate, because of the pressure of work from all quarters on the Parliamentary Draftsman's office, it is not easy to say when the legislation will actually be introduced.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the majority of workers take their holidays in the months of May to September.  There are some unfortunate workers who are compelled by circumstances to take their holidays at the beginning or at the end of the year.  Is it possible this legislation will be introduced in sufficient time to benefit workers in the next holiday period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, in the opinion of Dáil Éireann, the Government should without delay introduce proposals for legislation to enable owners of dwelling-houses and business premises in cities, towns and villages to purchase, on equitable terms, the ground rents to which such houses and premises are at present subject.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving this motion, I should like to draw the attention of the House to circumstances which might be considered somewhat peculiar, at least. In modern circumstances and in modern times the State and local authorities have been endeavouring to encourage citizens to purchase houses as residences for themselves and their families and millions of pounds have been spent under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  The bulk of the money was spent to provide houses. That has resulted in a situation where people enter into commitments to purchase residences for their families but, even on the full completion of their payment for such houses, many of them find that they do not own a single inch of the ground on which their dwellings are situated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This condition not only applies in cases where the owner of the land is a non-national, a speculator, an association, <Col N="982" /> a building society, or some other form of body; it also applies in the case of the local authorities. It applies in the case of the city of Dublin where over the last 20 or 30 years thousands of dwellings have been constructed with the aid of public funds.  It applies even in the case of our own local authority and I think it applies to many others.  Spokesmen of Fianna Fáil and spokesmen of Fine Gael in various quarters and on various occasions have lauded it as being most desirable that people should buy their own houses so that these houses shall become their property and that of their heirs and successors; yet not many local authorities have made arrangements to sell the tenant-purchaser the ground on which the house is built.</P>
    <P>There may be reasons for this. Possibly we may hear them during the course of this debate.  It may well be that the local authorities, to some extent, are anxious to control by this means the people who live in the houses just as in the case of an absentee landlord.  I propose to illustrate that by reading a letter addressed to Deputy Corish dated the 7th November. I do not think it would be proper in these circumstances to mention the name of the individual.  The letter reads as follows&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Corish,</P>
    <P>In view of your forthcoming motion in the Dáil to have proposals introduced for legislation to enable owners of dwellinghouses and business premises in cities, towns and villages to purchase on equitable terms the ground rents to which such houses and premises are at present subject, I would like to let you know my experience.</P>
    <P>I am 19 years of age.  My father died last year and I now carry on the family business in our premises...</P>
    <P>My granduncle...built our premises out of his savings.  A degrading, Elizabethan lease was imposed on him by the landlord, the ground rent being £4 14s. per annum.  My granduncle just had to accept the <Col N="983" /> covenants in the lease, otherwise he could not have built the premises...</P>
    <P>Under a settlement, the premises pass to me absolutely on my reaching 21 years of age.  At present they are held for me by trustees.</P>
    <P>It had been usual in the past to let one of the rooms in our premises; there had been four such lettings.  Since my father died I, as advised, applied to the landlord for permission to make a fresh letting of the room.  Permission was refused. Nevertheless I made a fresh letting of the room.</P>
    <P>Now the landlord has commenced proceedings against me to eject me and our family from our premises, merely because I refuse to be dictated to as to whom I allow across my doorstep.  Needless to say my ground rent has always been paid promptly.</P>
    <P>The landlord's only interest in my property is this ground rent of £4 14s. a year or 1/10 a week.  With income tax deducted, as it must be, his income from the property is £3 1s. 1d. a year, or 1/2 a week, less than the price of a loaf.  The capital value of his interest in my property&mdash;15 years' purchase&mdash;is £70 10s., about the price of one beast sold in my shop.</P>
    <P>An approach was made to the landlord to sell his interest to us, but without result.</P>
    <P>It seems fantastic to me that the landlord could hold me and other members of our family by the throats, and could have the power to eject us from our premises, merely because he draws an income of 1/2 a week from our property.</P>
    <P>Surely this is landlordism at its worst!  The ghost of Queen Bess stalks our town and it is about time something was done about the matter.  The facts I give can be confirmed by reference to the two local T.D.s.  I wish you success in your efforts to have these degrading ground rents abolished.</P>
    <P>I was dealing with two specific cases, one of which was the case of the local <Col N="984" /> authorities.  At one time, I was inclined to the view that because local authorities, with the aid of finance from the central Government, had provided dwellings, it was possibly in the interest of the community to reserve the control of the ground rents, with a view to preventing undesirable development in the premises rented from the local authority, but, on more mature consideration, that appears to me to be only avoiding another issue altogether.  Consequently, I feel now that there is no merit in saying to a tenant purchaser of an urban dwelling or the tenant purchaser of a cottage: &ldquo;We will arrange a scheme of purchase for you.  You can buy your dwelling over a period of so many years and if you have sufficient financial support and if you can get a guarantor or go to the bank, you can come to the local authority, pay down the full price and as far as we are concerned, the premises is yours but you will continue to pay us ground rent and we will be your ground landlord.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To a great extent the same situation exists in the case of people purchasing their dwellings under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts or purchasing their homes through insurance companies, and such bodies. While insurance societies, housing societies, the State and local authorities are prepared to sell the person the house, by and large, they are not prepared to sell him the ground on which the house stands.</P>
    <P>I do not know who the ground landlords are.  I do not think it is a matter of great importance because the principle enshrined in this motion is the principle that if one is and should be estitled to buy one's home, dwelling or house, one should be entitled to buy the piece of ground on which it stands.  The legal position at present is this, I think: If somebody buys a house over a period of 35 years, at the end of that period, one can actually come in and take possession in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Why should a white-collar worker, a carpenter, a professional man or a small business man who has been encouraged by propaganda and by making loans a bit easier through <Col N="985" /> grants from the State and through supplementary grants from the local authorities, be also under the hardship that while he can buy his house he cannot purchase the piece of ground upon which the house or garden is built?</P>
    <P>I understand that this matter was discussed many years ago in this House, but whether or not it was discussed or what was done with it on that occasion is not, I submit, of very great importance either.  I also think that it is not particularly important as to who owns the ground rents because that is not the aspect we are concerned with.  The motion before the House is not, in fact, one calling for anybody to be given the ground rents. It is not, in fact, and it might well have been, a motion calling for legislation so as to afford occupants of houses an opportunity to purchase the ground on which their premises is situated and that the price of the ground rent should not be increased because of the operations of local authorities, development societies or the national Government.  The motion simply asks that legislation should be introduced which would provide an opportunity for these people to purchase their ground rents at equitable terms.</P>
    <P>It is true that in a number of housing estates developed in or around the city of Dublin in recent years there have been instances where people bought their houses under a freehold system.  They have become, when they completed the purchase of their dwellings, not only the owners of the house but also the owners of the land. If that is fair and equitable in a number of cases, I hold it to be fair and equitable in general.</P>
    <P>I do not see&mdash;and I have been a member of Dublin Corporation for many years&mdash;that there is any argument in the principle which would entitle Dublin Corporation to say to anyone purchasing a house from them, whether tenant purchaser or otherwise: &ldquo;We will lend you the money. You can repay us and we will build you a house.  You will repay us the capital and interest charges but under no circumstances will we include the <Col N="986" /> question of the ground on which your house stands.&rdquo; In moving this motion, I want to draw specific attention to that position and I ask for support from all sides of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Larkin, I do not think he knows very much about the country outside of Dublin which seems to be the be-all and end-all of his existence in this matter.  I should like to call his attention to the Purchase Bill passed through this Dáil very many years ago in respect of labourers' cottages. Under that, the tenant who purchases becomes the complete owner of his own house and one acre of ground and annuities to the Land Commission are finished.</P>
      <P>There is no such thing as ground rent in that respect.  Certainly, Deputy Larkin must not have been alluding to the ordinary cottage tenant purchaser. On the other hand, if he is dealing with what we call a non-municipal house in the country&mdash;and I speak for a pretty considerable area surrounding Cork City, out as far as Kinsale, Macroom, Youghal and Bandon&mdash;in no case did we ever purchase land for housing purposes that carried a ground rent.  In all cases the land was purchased outright; in all cases we have brought in purchase schemes for the tenants and in no case is a tenant purchaser liable to ground rent.  Therefore I do not know what Deputy Larkin was alluding to, except that he may know of cases in Dublin.  As far as country life is concerned, he has a very poor knowledge of his subject and I should just like to correct him on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a great hatred for ground rents and ground landlords, as great a hatred as any man living.  On several occasions I have spoken against them in this House and outside it and I have found that when we succeeded in getting tenants to fight we managed to get ground rents reduced considerably.  In the case of Cobh we succeeded in getting a slight reduction of thirty-three and one-third per cent. on all ground rents, though <Col N="987" /> it took us two years to do so through non-payment of rent, fighting a few cases in the courts and finally by arrangement at arbitration.  We have many towns in which most of the property is owned by landlords residing in England and all the ground rent leaves these towns each year without conferring any benefit on this country.</P>
    <P>As I said, my sole reason in getting up to speak was to correct the impression Deputy Larkin seemed to have that local authorities are inviting tenants to purchase their houses but still keep collecting ground rent.  That position may exist in Dublin but I do not know where else it exists.  It does not exist under the Labourers Act, which provides for the purchase of labourers' cottages and under which we are working the non-municipal housing schemes in Cork County.  There, when a tenant purchases his house, the land goes with it.  However, some difficulties have arisen in connection with that.  For example, under the cottage purchase scheme a tenant, no matter how anxious he is, may not buy out his house by putting down the full sum of money.  He is not allowed to do so and the local authority cannot accept that money from him.  To be frank, it was only within the last fortnight I found out that.</P>

      <P>I am still learning.  This was a case of a tenant purchaser who bought out his cottage, got it vested, and started to make some needed improvements.  He spent something like £1,200 on a couple of rooms, a bathroom and sanitary accommodation. He was able to get a grant from the State and also from the local authority, but when he went to look for a loan from the local authority he could not get it because so long as a first mortgage remains a local authority is prevented from giving a second mortgage.</P>

It is a case I discussed today with the Minister for Local Government in an effort to arrive at a solution of it.  In conclusion I cannot understand a Deputy like Deputy Larkin judging everything by this many little city he has in Dublin.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, the Fine Gael Party have already publicly declared their intention to introduce legislation, when returned to power after the next election, to permit tenant occupiers to purchase the ground rents on their property.  This is being done because Fine Gael believe that the whole theory of ground rent being a fair rent, charged by the owner of land on those who use his land, is not valid in the Twentieth Century, and that ground rent today is nothing more or less than a privately imposed tax levied on the property of another.  We believe that when a person buys a piece of property for building purposes, or when he purchases a building on a piece of land, he is then the owner of the equitable interest in that land and all that is on that land.</P>
      <P>If a person pays £1,500&mdash;a fair price for an average house in the city of Dublin may range from £1,000 to £1,500 though it can go much higher&mdash; for the bricks and mortar in a house, he becomes the moral substantial owner of that land, and it is farcical to see a ground rent collected in this day as a fair rent charged for the use of the land on which the house is built. We believe the moral substantial ownership goes to the person who purchases the land on an open market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that a person freely purchases a house with a ground rent attached to it but that, of course, is utter nonsense because, if he is in an <Col N="989" /> an area where ground rents are levied, the possibility of purchasing a freehold house is almost negligable.  That that is so in Dublin is indicated by the fact that one&mdash;only one&mdash;firm of builders have been making a good thing in recent years out of advertising their houses as having no ground rents attached.  It is true that the plots on which these houses are being built are not having ground rents charged on them <i>in futuro</i>, but the purchasers are being charged £100 to £150 over and above the normal price of the houses.  It is a penalty which the tenants are being called upon to pay because our society continues to tolerate a system which might have been appropriate in feudal times but which is certainly very wrong today.</P>
    <P>We must, of course, preserve the rights of private property and Fine Gael have made it clear that, in introducing legislation permitting tenant occupiers to purchase out the ground rent, the rights of other people will be preserved.  But rights must not be considered as being monopoly rights or the rights of class, privilege or money.  A fair price can be paid, but I do not believe there is any need to entertain to any great extent the argument of the landlords who say the cost of buying them out will be too much.  We cannot allow one small section, particularly when so many of them are outside the State, to hold the community up to ransom.</P>
    <P>Let us be quite clear what we mean by the rights of private property.  I would refer the House to our own Constitution.  You will find that the abolition of ground rents, in the manner in which Fine Gael advocate it should be done, is not only consistent with the Constitution but is in fact called for by it.  Article 40, section 3, subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws, protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>I feel that a ground rent today is an unjust attack upon the property rights of the masses of our people.  If they wish to own their own land, they find <Col N="990" /> that if they exercise their right to ownership, they cannot completely acquire that right because a privileged section of the community have either the money or ancestry which gives them the right to levy a private tax. Article 43 acknowledges the right of man to private property and guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish that right.  But that, I think, does not mean our Constitution guarantees the right to property in anything. I think it is permissible to say that when that right is exercised against the common good, then the common good must be supreme.</P>
    <P>The same Article, Article 43, makes it clear that the exercise of that right is conditional on its contributing to the common good.  Clearly, I maintain, ground rents do not contribute to the common good of our people. Article 43, Section 2, subsection (1), states:</P>
    <P>The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>It is already well established by our courts that the Houses of the Oireachtas are the sole determiners of what amounts to the exigencies of the common good.  Therefore, it is appropriate that we should be considering this very important matter as it affects so many of our people.</P>
    <P>I believe it is a good thing for people to live in their own houses, that they should have some property rights in the houses in which they live.  By owning their own houses or buying them, our people will live in a money box.  We believe it will improve their stability if they can acquire their own property.  We in this country have one of the lowest percentages of privately-owned houses in the civilised world.  Even in the United States, <Col N="991" /> which many of us fancy is a country in which everybody lives in a flat or dwelling of that nature which would prevent its being privately-owned, I understand that some 75 per cent. of the people are living in houses which they own or are buying through some loan or mortgage.  Our percentage is very much less.  I am not sure exactly how much but I think it is somewhere around 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why our people are slow to buy their own houses&mdash;and today it is a great deal cheaper to get a 95 per cent. loan from a local authority or building society, even at 7 per cent., and pay the outgoings than it is to rent a house from a private source&mdash;is ground rent, and in addition there is Schedule A tax, stamp duty and the legal costs in regard to conveyances.  I regard ground rents as one of the irritants discouraging people from purchasing their own houses.  It may be said it is only an infinitesimally small amount of the annual outgoings.  Of course it is, but it is these irritants, never previously borne by people, which discourage them from buying their own houses. I appreciate that the Schedule A tax comes out of the ground rent in the majority of cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy means that the ground rent is allowed as a charge against Schedule A tax?  It is the other way about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the layman says: &ldquo;My ground rent is £15 and I will pay one-third of that in tax.&rdquo;  I appreciate it is actually set-off, but the average householder looks on it the other way.</P>
      <P>These are payments which have to be met twice a year in lump sums. There is much bother and worry attached to them, and on top of that, the other burdens and responsibilities of house ownership have to be met. If we removed these irritants, we would get more people to buy their own houses and that would make more money available for housing people who cannot afford to do so themselves and cannot be expected to do so in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> Fine Gael believe this motion should be supported in principle because of what it endeavours to achieve and because it wishes to remove a social injustice.  My own belief is that we ought to go further in this matter. Not only should we make it obligatory on landlords to sell the rents at a fair price to tenant occupiers but we should prohibit the creation of any new ground rents.  I do not know what our society would think if the first owner of a motor car&mdash;an article costing about £500 or £600&mdash;were to levy a rent on any succeeding owner; but that is what is done with ground rents today.  If you accept that as valid, you ought to accept as valid and socially desirable that the first owner of a motor car should impose a tax of £5 per year on every succeeding owner of the car.  The same could be applied to pieces of furniture.  The first owner of a bedroom suite or a drawingroom suite should be entitled to levy a tax on any succeeding owners.  It is the same principle, and, to my mind, it is highly obnoxious and socially most undesirable.</P>
    <P>I believe we should not permit the sale of ground rents to anybody except the tenant occupier.  I appreciate that this will be a restriction on the sale of ground rents but I believe that it is socially necessary.  The only way in which we can in our time make a serious contribution to this injustice is to put these restrictions on the ownership and assignability of ground rents.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coogan gave notice that he would raise the subject matter of Question No. 25 on yesterday's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I must express regret that I am forced to raise this matter in view of the magnificent gift by the Hearst Corporation to the citizens of Galway; but I must raise it because of the inaccuracies in the replies I received from the Taoiseach who answered for the Minister for External <Col N="993" /> Affairs here yesterday.  It seems that the Taoiseach is as far removed from the facts as the Minister for External Affairs is from this country at the moment.</P>
      <P>I have here letters concerning the Sword and Mace from the die of Galway Corporation.  This matter of the return of the Sword and Mace first arose in a letter dated 28th March, 1960, from Bord Fáilte Eireann addressed to the then Mayor, Ald. Peter Greene who was, incidentally, a Fianna Fáil mayor but a decent man. In the course of that letter it is stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I now have an assurance that the Sword and Mace will be presented for return to Galway.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the first letter concerning the Sword and Mace that Galway Corporation got.  It continued:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have some ideas on how best to arrange an appropriate ceremony and I have asked Mr. O'Hanlon to go to Galway tomorrow to discuss the programme with you and probably Mr. O'Flynn.  I would very much hope that you would go to New York and accept the presentation.... I hope that when the matter comes to the Corporation, probably by way of letter from Mr. Berlin of the Hearst Corporation, to you, there will be unanimity about accepting the gift.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At a meeting of Galway Corporation, a letter dated 24th August, 1960, was read from Bord Fáilte and it stated that word had been received that the Hearst Corporation were agreeable to return the Mace and Sword to Galway as a gesture of goodwill &ldquo;to your city and to Ireland&rdquo;&mdash; the city comes first.  It was proposed by Aid. Coogan, seconded by Aid. Ryan and resolved that the offer of the return of the Great Sword and Mace be gratefully accepted and that sincere gratitude be expressed to the Hearst Corporation for their gesture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his reply yesterday, the Taoiseach said the Hearst Corporation expressed a desire that the Minister for External Affairs, who was then in New York, should accept the Sword and Mace on behalf of the people of Ireland and Galway, in <Col N="994" /> particular.  The Minister agreed to do so.  The Hearst Corporation thereupon invited the Mayor of Galway to attend the presentation ceremony.  It is very strange that in the first instance last March, when the Mayor of Galway, then a Fianna Fáil Mayor, was invited to accept this Sword and Mace, no Minister was to be tied in along with him; neither, at any stage, was there a request from the Galway Corporation that the Minister should accept the Sword and Mace.  As far as we were concerned, there were only two people involved, the appointed representatives, who were to accept the Mace in New York.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the other arrangement was merely a blundering intrusion on the part of the Minister and it was done just to muscle in, as it were, politically on a situation that might be of assistance to him.  By his action, the Minister has only offered insult to the dignity of the first citizen of our city, the Mayor of Galway, the unanimously-elected mayor, that grand old man whom we sent to New York at 88 years of age to accept and bring back the Sword and Mace.  It also offered insult to the Corporation and the citizens of Galway and the only reason that can be attributed for the Minister's action is that he was trying to rehabilitate his Party in a city that gave such a shattering result for that Party in the local elections.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested by the Taoiseach that the Corporation were aware that the Minister for External Affairs was to receive the gift on behalf of Ireland and Galway.  Be that as it may, and at the last minute the Minister may have muscled in but there is no denying that we sent over our representatives and that pressure was brought to bear on them so that the Minister could cash in on the event.</P>
    <P>The letter of 24th August addressed to the Mayor, Councillor J.J. Redington, stated:</P>
    <P>I have now received word from Mr. Richard Berlin, President of the Hearst Corporation that the Hearst Foundation is now agreeable to restore the Mace and Sword to <Col N="995" /> Galway, as a gesture of goodwill to your city and to Ireland.  In view of our participation in the negotiations for the return, Mr. Berlin has done me the honour of asking me to convey his offer to you, and indeed it gives me great pleasure to do so.</P>
    <P>That letter was from Bord Fáilte who played a big part in the return of the Sword and Mace.  I cannot see how the Minister's answer, through the Taoiseach&mdash;which should be even more accurate&mdash;could state that &ldquo;the Mayor was invited thereupon,&rdquo; suggesting that from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; the Minister had been &ldquo;in&rdquo; on this.  So far as I am concerned&mdash;and I know the facts because I have been closely associated with this as senior alderman of Galway Corporation&mdash;I know what was happening.  Our Mayor left Galway&mdash;and our manager may say what he wishes&mdash;and before he left, he made arrangements to bring back the Sword and Mace with him.</P>
    <P>He wrote to the office of the Revenue Commissioners and the reply came on 26th October, the day before the presentation in New York.  It said:</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Revenue Commissioners to refer to your letter of the 14th October, 1960 which was addressed to the Department of Industry and Commerce and to state that the Great Mace and Sword of the Ancient Corporation and the City of Galway may be imported without payment of duty under the provision of Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>The necessary instructions are being issued to the officer of Customs and Excise concerned.</P>
    <P>The representatives appointed by the Galway Corporation left at considerable expense both to themselves and to the ratepayers for the one purpose &mdash;the return of the Sword and Mace. In Galway, we had made arrangements for a proper and dignified ceremony when his Worship, the Mayor, would return and all that was thrown overboard by the action of the Minister in ignoring the representatives concerned <Col N="996" /> in America and in trying, as I said before, to muscle in on the situation politically.  There is no denying the fact that it was to Galway it was presented.</P>
    <P>I have here a quotation from the <i>New York Journal-American</i> of Friday, 28th October, 1960, in which Mrs. William Randolph Hearst is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>I now formally on behalf of the Hearst Foundation present these historic heirlooms to you, Mr. Lord Mayor, with our best wishes for the happiness and prosperity of the city and citizens of Galway.</P>
    <P>There is no mention whatsoever of the Minister for External Affairs. Whether or not he was trying to rehabilitate himself with the American people, I can assure him that he has made a big blunder, so far as the people of Galway are concerned.  I do not think that the Taoiseach, no matter how he covers up, can justify that state of affairs and I protest on my own behalf and on behalf of the citizens of Galway against such action by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It may help a little to put this matter in its historic perspective without going into the matter in too great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The returning to Ireland of this insignia has been under consideration for many years and, indeed, discussions took place before the war with the late Mr. Hearst when it was <Col N="997" /> announced that he intended to put them up for sale.  These discussions took place between Mr. Hearst and the consul in San Francisco.  The articles were subsequently withdrawn from the sale which Mr. Hearst had arranged, and certainly, at that time, Mr. Hearst understood that he was dealing in the matter with the Irish Government. After Mr. Hearst's demise, negotiations were opened with the Hearst Corporation by Bord Fáilte, and, at that time, it was the intention of Bord Fáilte that the objects would be presented to the Irish Government and be placed in the National Museum. Subsequently, the idea that the articles should be returned to Galway came forward and received the agreement and, indeed, the enthusiastic support of the Government.</P>
    <P>The question of the arrangements for the presentation of these articles has been an open one for a long time. The original suggestion was that they should be presented to myself as there was some idea that I might be in the United States on St. Patrick's Day of this year.  That idea was abandoned only when it was realised that I did not intend to travel to the United States at that time.  There was another proposal that they should be presented to the Tánaiste, Deputy MacEntee, who was in the United States later, but that idea had to be abandoned because at that time Mrs. Hearst was travelling in Europe, and it was desired that the presentation should take place at a time when she could be present.</P>
    <P>Certainly the idea of presenting them to the Mayor of Galway was also put forward and, indeed, Mr. Greene had undertaken to travel to the United States for that purpose.  I personally am not quite clear as to why he did not do so at the time. With regard to the present Mayor, Mr. Redington, who although not a member of Fianna Fáil, is also a decent man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that he is a very great age&mdash;he is 88 years, I believe&mdash;and when he was first approached on this matter, I understand <Col N="998" /> that he declined to travel to America for the purpose of the presentation or was reluctant to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my information. However, the Hearst Corporation who certainly have no concern with any internal Irish politics, came forward with the proposal that they would present the articles to the Minister for External Affairs as they knew for certain that he would be in New York attending the United Nations Assembly.  That is how the matter was finally determined.  There was no misunderstanding, and could be no misunderstanding, as to what the position was.</P>
      <P>A letter sent to the Mayor of Galway by a representative of the Hearst Corporation reads in the following terms:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Mayor,</P>
      <P>You are aware, I know, of the decision of the Hearst Foundation, Inc., to restore to the historic City of Galway the Mace and Sword in possession of the Foundation since 1935.</P>
      <P>The presentation, it is hoped, will take place in New York or Washington D.C. later this month. For your information, His Excellency, Frank Aiken, T.D., Minister for External Affairs of Ireland, has graciously accepted our invitation to accept the Mace and Sword on behalf of the people of Ireland and Galway in particular.</P>
      <P>It is my hope that you or your representative from the Galway Corporation can be present for this ceremony and on hearing from you I shall keep you informed as soon as possible on the place and date for the presentation.</P>
      <P>That letter to the Lord Mayor of Galway was dated October 6th, 1960. The Galway Corporation met on October 10th and I have with me a minute of that special meeting which is headed &ldquo;Return of the Sword and Mace&rdquo; and says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> The county manager stated that he had been informed by Mr. O'Hanlon of Bord Fáilte that arrangements had now been made by the Hearst Corporation, New York, for the restoration of the historic Mace and Sword to Galway; the presentation to be made at the City Hall, New York, on 27th October, to Mr. Frank Aiken, T.D., Minister for External Affairs, who had agreed to accept the Regalia on behalf of the people of Ireland, and Galway in particular.  Representatives of the Galway Corporation were invited to be present at the ceremony.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Corporation was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That His Worship the Mayor and the County Manager be appointed as representatives of the Corporation to attend the presentation ceremony to take place in New York on 27th October and that the K.L.M. fund of £300, now invested in Prize Bonds, be realised and the proceeds devoted towards the expenses involved.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to establish by reading these documents is that whatever may have gone before, there was no misunderstanding at the time the Mayor and the county manager travelled to New York.  The presentation was to be made to the Minister and they were invited to be present at the ceremony.</P>
    <P>In New York, there were discussions as to how the regalia would be returned to Galway and I understand that there was agreement between the Mayor, the county manager and the Minister in that regard.  That agreement regarding these objects given to the Government by the Hearst Corporation was that there should be a subsequent ceremonial transfer of them from the Government to the Corporation.  I still think that is the correct procedure.</P>

      <P>We have a report in the <i>New York American</i> in which it is stated that Mrs. William Randolph Hearst handed over the Sword and Mace to the Mayor of Galway.  The report states:</P>
      <P>Mrs. William Randolph Hearst has restored the Great Mace and the Civic Sword of the City of Galway, Ireland, to Irish hands again, &ldquo;fulfilling a wish expressed by my husband before his death&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Hearst, on behalf of the Hearst Foundation Inc. presented the splendid symbols of the City's past glory to Lord Mayor James Redington and two other Irish dignitaries at a colourful ceremony in the City Hall yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report goes on to say that amongst those present were Richard E. Berlin, President of the Hearst Corporation, and it then gives the quotation mentioned by Deputy Coogan.  Both the letterpress of the journalist describing the event, and the letterpress of Mrs. Hearst and all the photographs of the event go to show that it was Mrs. Hearst who handed to the Mayor of Galway these historic symbols.  The photographs show Mrs. Hearst handing them to the Lord Mayor.  If the Taoiseach talks of what went on before, the actual ceremony took place, as far as the Press of America was concerned the presentation was made by Mrs. Hearst.  How does the Taoiseach <Col N="1001" /> then say that the presentation was made by other officials?</P>

With the county manager of Galway, Mr. C.I. O'Flynn, he attended the City Hall ceremony here.  Due to a misunderstanding of the arrangements on the part of the officials at City Hall, the Sword and Mace were actually handed over to Mayor Redington by Mrs. William Randolph Hearst, Senior.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that the regalia should be handed over by the Government to the City of Galway at a ceremony to be held in that city was discussed and agreed by the Minister for External Affairs, the Mayor of Galway and the county manager.  That is how the situation stands.</P>
