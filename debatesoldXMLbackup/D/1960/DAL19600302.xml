      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has considered the advisability of this country becoming associated with the European Economic Community (Common Market); and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Among the questions at present under examination by the Government in connexion with our external trade policy is that of our future relations with the European Economic Community.  I am not in a position to say anything more on the subject at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate when he would be in a position to make a comprehensive statement on the question of our association with one or other of these group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to answer that question.  I am naturally anxious to give the Dáil as much information as possible on these matters so long as no damage is done to the national interest by disclosing our ideas or giving information in advance of the appropriate time.  I appreciate that the Dáil will be entitled to receive a general statement on the Government's policy regarding <Col N="984" /> external trade matters and I shall certainly make that statement at the earliest moment it is possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach note the forbearance on the part of the Opposition to press him on these matters in view of the considerations which he has just named and which is based on the assumption that the Taoiseach will take the Dáil into confidence at the earliest proper occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the forbearance which has been shown by the Opposition in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is on record as having said that we could not become a member of any European grouping of which Great Britain was not a member.  Does he still stand by that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is one of the facts to which we have to have regard in deciding our policy, but both the Rome Treaty, which established the European Economic Market, and the European Free Trade Association Agreement appear to contemplate the possibility of association without full membership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach, in view of the heavy adverse trade balance between this country and the countries of Continental Europe, what steps it is proposed to take to revise the trade agreements between Ireland and these countries; and if any other action is contemplated to remedy the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the policy of the Government to negotiate trade agreements with countries of Continental Europe when opportunity offers and where it is considered that such agreements would serve the essential interests of this country by assisting the expansion of our exports. Such agreements are kept under constant review with a view to possible improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> Our external trade policy in relation to the countries of Continental Europe is at present under examination.  At this stage I am not in a position to say anything further on the subject.</P>

      <P>Comprehensive statistics of Irish speakers are available only from Census of Population sources and relate to the Gaeltacht areas as defined by Coimisiún na Gaeltachta 1925.  At the 1936 Census the numbers of persons (excluding children under 3 years of age) returned as Irish speakers were 123,125 in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and 115,213 in the Breac-Ghaeltacht.  At the 1946 Census the corresponding numbers were 104,941 and 88,022 respectively. Although an inquiry into the knowledge and use of the Irish language was carried out in Gaeltacht areas in <Col N="987" /> conjunction with the 1956 Census, the results, for reasons stated in my reply of 22 July, 1959, to a question by Deputy Lynch, were not considered to be sufficiently reliable to merit publication.  No more recent reports on the numbers of Irish speaking persons in Gaeltacht areas are available from any other source.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to relate the description &ldquo;road-making machinery&rdquo; to the headings of the Official Import List, since many different types of machinery that are commonly used in road construction operations may also be used for other purposes.  However, I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing, in respect of each of the years 1955 to 1959, the value of permanent and of temporary imports under each of a number which, it is thought, may be relevant to the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the means of holders of qualification certificates must be reviewed when any change occurs in the circumstances of a holder e.g. acquirement of property, marriage, change of address. The means of self-employed persons must also be re-examined periodically. Apart from the other reasons mentioned the means of the holder of a qualification certificate must also be re-investigated if his circumstances <Col N="994" /> have not been reviewed for a number of years.</P>
      <P>As regards the information requested, records are available only from 1st September, 1957.  The number of unemployment assistance cases in County Kerry reviewed by Officers of my Department in the discharge of their statutory duties in the two years ended 31st August 1958 and 1959, and in the six-month period ended 29th February, 1960, was 563, 767, and 630 respectively. Unemployment assistance was withdrawn in 53, 213, and 157 cases, respectively, reduced in 313, 367, and 285 cases respectively and increased in 41, 58, and 56 cases respectively.</P>
      <P>Prior to September, 1958, the assessment of means, for unemployment assistance purposes, where such were derived from the occupation of land, was based on value for stock, crops etc., adopted in 1940.  Since September, 1958, up to date values as are used for old age pension purposes, have been applied to the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>

Golden syrup and Bakery Syrup may be liable to the duty at Reference No. 243/1, depending on their composition.  Fondant is liable to the duty at Ref. No. 244/1.  Invert sugar is not liable to duty.  None of the products mentioned is subject to Special Import Levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The restoration of the dock gates at Cleggan Harbour would necessitate the provision of a removable barrier or boom to safeguard them against damage from exceptionally heavy seas.  These works would give the necessary shelter for safe harbourage during stormy weather but would only afford limited flotation in the dock at all stages of the tide. The order of cost of these works would <Col N="998" /> be upwards of £8,000, and as there appears to be little need for the provision of flotation in the dock at low water periods the cost of the whole proposal is considered to be too dear in relation to its utility.</P>
      <P>Adequate shelter can be provided by installation of the barrier or boom on its own.  This work including a hand operated crane and the clearance of obstructions, is estimated to cost £2,150, and would appear to be warranted in the local fishery interests. The making of a grant available towards the cost of this smaller work on the usual conditions that the Galway County Council will contribute one quarter of the cost and maintain the work on completion is under consideration and it is hoped that a decision will be reached shortly.</P>

After consultation with the shipping industry, I have made new Rules governing the carriage of life-saving appliances on ships, entitled the Merchant Shipping (Life-Saving Appliances) Rules, 1960, which require the carriage of inflatable life rafts on passenger and cargo ships on cross-Channel and near Continental voyages, on fishing boats over 50' in length and on certain other sea-going craft including tugs and tenders.

These Rules, which were presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas on 19th February, 1960, are due to come into operation on 1st April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it is correct that no furnishing cloth can be imported unless a certain amount of the same cloth is being bought from an Irish company; and, if so, what are the proportions and the relative costs, expressed in percentages, of the home and imported cloths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1004" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  The importation of furnishing cloths is regulated by quotas and tariffs.  Wool and cotton moquette are subject to quotas; wool moquette may be imported by registered importers in quantities related to their total purchases in a basic year.  There is no provision at present for imports of cotton moquette.</P>
      <P>Most other furnishing fabrics are liable to duty and may be imported without restriction on payment of the duty or in some cases under duty-free licences.  The duty-free licensing position is complicated but may be outlined briefly as follows: unprinted furnishing fabrics may be imported without restriction under duty-free licence if they cost not less than 9/- a square yard or if they are genuine furnishing brocades under 4 ozs. a square yard.  In the case of unprinted fabrics under 9/- a square yard licences may be issued on the basis of 3 square yards for each square yard purchased from home mills.  Licences are granted for damask ticken on a basis of 2 square yards for every 5 square yards purchased from home mills.  No licences are granted for curtain linings or loomstate cloth.</P>
      <P>Duty-free licences for the import of printed furnishing fabrics are granted on the basis of 3 square yards for each square yard purchased from home sources.</P>
      <P>Because of the considerable range of prices and cloths I would be unable to give a comparison of home and import prices of the cloths.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that commercial travellers are charged rates for motor insurance that are 50% higher than the rates which apply to ordinary private motor car insurance. Representations have been made to my Department on this matter in the past by representatives of the Irish Commercial Travellers' Federation. The classification of risks is a matter of detailed insurance operation in which I do not think it proper that I should intervene.  Classifications, I am advised, are based, <i>inter alia</i> on claims experience.  In any event, the question of constituting a Prices Advisory Committee under the Prices Act 1958 would not arise as charges for services rendered in connection with insurance are specifically excluded from the scope of the Act.</P>

      <P>For the information of Deputies, some of whom would wish to make it appear that this Government was falling into the ways of the last Government in regard to not paying their commitments, the following is actually the position and leads up to the situation which we are now discussing. When the Estimate for the year 1959-60 was being prepared in October, 1958, the allocation figures for new houses for the six months ended 30/9/58 were 1,458.  On this basis the indications were that a total of 2,916 new house allocations would be reached in the year 1958/59 and estimated figures of allocations had been reasonably consistent in each month of the first half of the financial year 1958/59.  It was decided to accept a figure of 3,000 allocations for the year 1959/60.  In fact, new house allocations in the period 1/4/59 to 29/2/60 amounted to 3,472, representing an estimated figure of 3,800 approximately, for the full financial year which is, accounting for payments falling due in the month of February this year in respect of new house grant allocations, a figure of £225,000 which, subject to check, is the highest figure that was ever demanded from the Department of Local Government for the payment of new house grants in the month of February in any year since the housing drive first commenced.</P>

The figure for the first nine months of 1959/60 is <Col N="1012" /> £1,425,235.  The estimate of the total figure for this year will now certainly be in the region of £1,900,000, which shows approximately a 50 per cent. increase in overall grants this year over last year and a fairly substantial increase on the previous year.</P>

Summing up the position at the moment, the demand for these housing grants, both new and reconstruction, is such that the increased figure for payment of all grants could not possibly have been anticipated. We have a figure of £225,000 for the month of February this year, which is the highest for any month of February, in any year, under any Government since the housing drive commenced.  In addition, we also have up to date, not to mention what may yet come in, the highest number of reconstruction, repair, and improvement grants ever undertaken in any single year for a full twelve months since we started the housing campaign.</P>

Investigations preliminary to the detailed planning of the work are at present being carried out by their consulting engineer.  I may mention that I have allocated to the county council a grant of 75% of the cost of the work, subject to a maximum of £45,000.</P>

      <P>The repair of this county road is a matter for the Kerry County Council.  I understand that Bord Fáilte Éireann have informed the county council that they are not in a position to accede to the council's request for a grant to carry out the work. I may say that the provision of funds for the repair of county roads is a matter for the road authorities concerned and it is open to the Kerry County Council to consider the needs of this road when dealing with the county road estimate for the coming financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be convenient to both sides of the House if we did because these amendments relate to the question of the Cherry Orchard Hospital and the Dublin Fever Hospital Board and, perhaps, on that I should make a general statement which would cover the three amendments.</P>
      <P>In my reply to the debate on the Second Stage of the Bill on 5th November last, I said:</P>
      <P>In regard to the Dublin Fever Hospital Board, I have undertaken to meet a deputation from that board after this debate but we must not lose sight of the fact that, in the present scheme of health services and administration, the Dublin Fever Hospital Board is something of an anomaly.  Nowadays certain fevers are rightly regarded as the particular concern of the local health authority.  Due to its history, of course, we have in existence the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  It administers Cherry Orchard Hospital. Cherry Orchard is a magnificent hospital but it was not built out of the trust fund of this body. It was built by funds provided by the Minister so there is no question of appropriating private property or anything li0ke that.  That should be understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to meet the members of this board and, if I cannot persuade them to accept my point of view, we may be able to come to some amicable arrangement.  Somebody suggested that the trust funds might <Col N="1032" /> be restored to them, thus enabling them to provide them for some other charity which perhaps would be equally desirable.  I do not think that would present any great difficulty; but perhaps that is not the point; perhaps what they are really concerned about is the tradition. I am not committing myself, but I am prepared to listen to what they have to say and to come to a decision of which, I hope, the House will be able to approve afterwards.</P>
    <P>That is what I said on 5th November on Second Stage.  Since that Stage I have met deputations from the Fever Hospital Board on two occasions and there have been other consultations with the board and its officers in my Department.</P>
    <P>As a result of the discussions I am happy to say that we have reached agreement with the Board on a scheme under which the Extraordinary Members Electorate, that is to say those who are the successors, the present successors of the trustees of the old Cork Street Hospital, will be associated in an advisory capacity with the Cherry Orchard Hospital.  Furthermore under this scheme the assets which were transferred from the then trustees to the Dublin Fever Hospital Board under the arrangements made in 1936 will be handed back into the control of the Extraordinary Members Electorate.</P>
    <P>Amendments 3 and 5 are intended to give effect to this arrangement.  The general purpose of the amendments is to set up an advisory committee for the Cherry Orchard Hospital with equal representation from the Extraordinary Members Electorate and the proposed Dublin Health Authority. This committee will advise the Health Authority&mdash;which in practice will generally be the chief executive officer &mdash;on the administration of the hospital. The chief executive officer will be expected to keep the committee advised of matters appertaining to the hospital and the committee will have certain statutory powers to obtain information from him in this regard. It will be also obligatory on the chief executive officer to give the committee, <Col N="1033" /> if they so desire, advance information in respect of works other than works of repair and maintenance which are proposed to be undertaken in the hospital and the committee will then be able to make representations to the Dublin Health Authority on the matter which could, if the Dublin Health Authority so decides, lead to the Chief Executive Officer's proposals being vetoed.</P>
    <P>The investments now held by the Dublin Fever Hospital Board which were transferred to them in 1936 or which were since acquired by them from money received for the sale of property taken over by them in 1936 have been segregated and listed in the proposed new Fourth Schedule to the Bill as the &ldquo;reserved property.&rdquo;  The total value of these and of cash held is £52,000.  There are certain other properties held by the Dublin Fever Hospital Board and these are listed in the Schedule.  The income from these, as well as transferred investment, will in future be at the disposal of the Extraordinary Members Electorate. This income will total about £3,500 a year.</P>
    <P>The Board have agreed and it has been provided for in the amendment that this income will be made available for such purposes in connection with Cherry Orchard Hospital as may be agreed upon by the advisory committee and the Dublin Health Authority. However, as the Extraordinary Members Electorate view the proposal for this advisory committee as being experimental they have asked for provision to be made whereby after a year's trial they could withdraw from this arrangement and put the income from the reserve property to other uses.  There is accordingly included in the amendment a provision under which, if an absolute majority of the members of the Electorate so decide, they can cancel the nomination of members of the Advisory Committee, and when they do that, this committee will go out of existence and the reserve property will become available for use by the Electorate for other charitable or public purposes.  I hope very sincerely that the Electorate will not find it necessary to invoke this clause and <Col N="1034" /> that as the successors of those who, out of charity, provided the old Fever Hospital at Cork Street their association with the new hospital at Cherry Orchard will continue.</P>
    <P>There is one point relating to the reserve property which I would like and which it is necessary, I think, to refer to particularly.  When the Dublin Fever Hospital Board was established under the act of 1936 the Cork Street Hospital was transferred to that body. It was understood at the time that when the new hospital was completed and taken over by the Board, the proceeds of the disposal of the Cork Street Hospital would go to the Hospital Trust Fund to offset part of the cost of the new building.  In the event however, when the Fever Hospital was transferred to Cherry Orchard the Cork Street premises were taken over by the Dublin Board of Assistance on a lease as a home for old people and they are now using it for that purpose.  It is known as Brú Caoimhighin.  The rent is just sufficient to meet the outgoings on ground rent so there is no rent income to the Dublin Fever Hospital Board from this property at present.</P>
    <P>In the discussions with me however, the representatives of the Extraordinary Members Electorate made the point that the agreement of 1936 to hand over these premises was based on the consideration of their participating in the Body administering the new Fever Hospital, as that as the latter hospital was being taken out of their control they should logically have the old institution handed back to them.  There is some logic, I grant, in this but they do realise that even if the Institution was now finished with it would not be much use to them or to anybody else.  They cannot reopen it as a Fever Hospital and they would not have a Fund to administer it for any other purpose. They made it clear that so long as the Institution was used for its present purpose or for another public purpose they were quite satisfied and would not lay any claim to it.  However they were concerned, and I suppose rightly concerned as Trustees, as to what might happen if the Institution <Col N="1035" /> were closed and the property disposed of for private purposes.</P>
    <P>I agree that their concern in this matter is reasonable and accordingly that they would have a reasonable claim to part of the proceeds of the sale.  It has therefore been provided that if this property is sold at any time within a period of fifty years after the establishment of the Dublin Health Authority, an appropriate sum not exceeding £30,000 will be transferred to the Electorate and become part of the reserve property and usable as such by the Electorate.  We have further provided in this amendment at the request of the Board that the Advisory Committee to which I have referred, which includes seven representatives of the Extraordinary Members Electorate will receive prior notice of any proposal to dispose of Brú Caoimhighin.  Such disposal is under Section 83 of the Local Government Act of 1946 and subject to a veto by the elected members of the local authority to appoint members.</P>
    <P>The committee will be able to make such representations to the local authority or the Minister as may prevent the disposal of the property if they so wish and the local authority will naturally take into consideration any such views in arriving at a decision.  The arrangements which I have outlined have been agreed to in detail by the Dublin Fever Hospital Board and in particular by the representatives on that Board of the Extraordinary Members Electorate.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it quite clear, and I think in fairness to the representatives of the Extraordinary Members Electorate it is only fair that I should make it clear, that I do not claim that I have persuaded the Board that what is being done under the Bill is preferable from their point of view to their being left in charge of the Hospital at Cherry Orchard.  They have their own views on that question and I have mine and I outlined mine to the House on the Second Stage.  It is highly commendable and praiseworthy that those who have been associated in a voluntary <Col N="1036" /> capacity with the treatment of infectious diseases in Dublin for many years past should wish to continue their unselfish efforts.</P>
    <P>I do not want to criticise the members of the Board for not seeing eye to eye with me on the proposals in the Bill as introduced.  I think the House will agree that it would have been entirely wrong for me, having regard to the changes in the method of treatment of infectious diseases over the last 20 years or so and to possible future developments, not to have included the Dublin Fever Hospital Board with the new general health authority in Dublin.  The House, in giving the Bill a Second Reading, endorsed the general lines of my policy, the policy, perhaps with some reservations, of my predecessor and of his predecessor in this respect.  I am glad that the Board, whatever reservations they may still have had on the principles of these proposals have been able, within the framework of the decision taken on the Second Reading, to agree on a scheme for the continued participation of the representatives of the extraordinary members in the operation of Cherry Orchard Hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to congratulate the Minister and his advisers on the manner in which they have faced up to the problem which undoubtedly existed in the Bill when it was introduced here.  At that time, under the Section now being amended, it was proposed to amalgamate and vest in the new Dublin Health Authority, the Dublin Fever Hospital at Cherry Orchard.  With that amalgamation and vesting went the assets and the interest of a very old charity.  I felt at the time that this was a very glaring defect in the Bill which otherwise might have received support here in the House.  I felt in particular it was an assault on private voluntary charitable work.  I am very happy to note that following the Second Reading, the Minister has had meetings with the charitable persons concerned at present with the running and the ownership of the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  I think it was a very fine thing for the Minister to do particularly <Col N="1037" /> as the Minister had, as he stated, a very strong view in relation to the abolition of this Hospital.</P>
      <P>While the amendments now proposed do not meet entirely the objection I had in mind they certainly go a great deal towards meeting them and I learn that the Minister's approach has had the appreciation of all those concerned with this particular matter.</P>
      <P>I would like to avail of the opportunity on this Stage to deal with what I think is a misapprehension on the Minister's part in relation to my views when I was Minister concerning the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  I stated during the discussion on the Committee Stage that I was not aware of any proposal to abolish the Dublin Fever Hospital.  I repeat that statement deliberately now.  I was not aware at any stage, when I was Minister, that it was intended that the Dublin Fever Hospital Board should be amalgamated with the new Dublin Health Authority.</P>
      <P>It is proper that I should, for the purposes of the record, clear up this matter because, following the Committee Stage the Minister wrote me a letter and I am sure I have his permission to read that letter.  On the 15th February, of this year the Minister wrote me as follows:</P>
      <P>Dear Deputy O'Higgins: Apropos the references in Dáil Eireann on the Second and Committee Stages of the Health (Unified Authorities) Bill, 1959, to the inclusion of the Dublin Fever Hospital in the ambit of the Dublin Health Authority, I enclose for your information photostat copies of:</P>
      <P>1.  A memorandum or note on the subject of unification submitted to you as Minister by the Department (See paragraph 1);</P>
      <P>2.  A direction given by you as Minister following consideration of that note that the matter should be referred to the Government; and</P>
      <P>3.  An extract from the memorandum, dated 3 Bealtaine, 1955 subsequently submitted to and considered by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The memorandum referred to and <Col N="1038" /> the extract of which it was part states in paragraph 1:</P>
    <P>In June 1952 the Government approved of the preparation of a Bill providing that the Health functions of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council and all the functions of the Dublin, Rathdown and Balrothery Boards of Assistance and the Dublin Fever Hospital Board should in future be dealt with by a new Health Authority.  It was proposed that the new authority would have the services of a whole time chief executive officer,</P>
    <P>and so on.</P>
    <P>That statement was in a file and was associated with a memorandum which apparently came before me as Minister and which I considered: I then issued a direction to the Secretary of the Department as follows:</P>
    <P>Secretary:&mdash;I have read the note attached.  I am anxious that the whole question should again be discussed by the Government.  A document should accordingly be prepared setting out what steps have already been taken.  Give some priority to this.</P>
    <P>Following that direction a submission or document for the Government was prepared which again referred, <i>inter alia</i>, to the Dublin Fever Hospital Board although I was not so aware at the time.  In paragraph 16 of that document it states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health wishes to submit this matter for the Government's approval.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision of the 2nd June, 1955, was notified to me as Minister by the Secretary to the Government as follows:</P>
    <P>I am to refer to the memorandum submitted by the Minister for Health and to inform you that it was decided that the Minister should examine the matter further in consultation with the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>That was the decision of the Government on a memorandum submitted by me.  It is correct to say that reference <Col N="1039" /> is made to the Dublin Fever Hospital Board being concerned with the proposed amalgamation but I was not aware of that and certainly would not have given approval to it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Minister, in his reading of this matter, went on the statement contained in the memorandum that the Government, in June, 1952, had approved of a proposal relating to the unification of Health Services in Dublin and elsewhere which included the Dublin Fever Hospital Board and these hospitals.</P>
    <P>That was in June, 1952.  When I was dealing with this matter in my Department at the time, the one document with which I was familiar was a document known as the Dooge Report.  That was the report of a Joint Committee set up in Dublin City and County to consider the proposal as it affected Dublin City and County.  It is interesting to note that following the Government decision of June, 1952, the official notification which issued from the Department dated 30th September, 1952, excluded the Dublin Fever Hospital from the proposed Dublin Health Authority.  I do not need to refer to that letter.  The Minister can get it.  It is dated 30th September, 1952, and the relative paragraph, which is about half way down the letter, states as follows:</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes that in Dublin City and County there should be one health authority, to consist of 16 members of the Corporation and 8 members of the County Council, to carry out the health functions of the Dublin Corporation, the Dublin County Council and the three Boards of Assistance, and the functions of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Board.  The new body would have the services of a whole-time officer....</P>
    <P>There is no inclusion of the Dublin Fever Hospital Board and that this matter was so understood appeared from the report of the Joint Committee on the Proposed Amalgamation of the Health Services in Dublin City and County dated December, 1952.  On <Col N="1040" /> page 15, paragraph 19, of the Report, the Minister's proposal is dealt with in the following way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal is that the Health Services for the population of Dublin City and County (700,000 people) should be administered by a single authority.  This Health Authority would consist of 24 members&mdash;16 of whom would be members of Dublin Corporation and eight members of Dublin County Council.  The new Authority would have the power, if it wished, to set up Committees to deal with matters arising in relation to Health Services in sub-divisions of its functional area.  The Authority would have the services of a whole-time executive officer to carry out the appropriate functions.  The staff of the Authority would be formed from the present staffs of the three Boards of Assistance and the Mental Hospital Board.  The new Health Authority would carry out the present Health functions of Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and the three Boards of Assistance, and the functions of Grangegorman Mental Hospital Board.  It would not administer the present functions of the Dublin Fever Hospital Board, which would still remain as a separate Local Authority.</P>
    <P>That was the proposal which I understood and with which I was familiar and it is the proposal outlined in that Report of the Joint Committee following the Departmental letter of 30th September, 1952.  It was never suggested to me by any of my advisers &mdash;and if it had been so suggested I should have dealt with it in accordance with my own view and policy&mdash; that this proposal would involve the abolition of the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  The Minister's records in his Department will show him that I discussed the significance of unified health services with every body and board likely to be affected.</P>
    <P>I never had any discussions along those lines with the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  In fact, as the Minister is probably aware, I was extremely concerned about the future of the Dublin Fever Hospital Board. <Col N="1041" /> I was very much concerned in relation to what proper and beneficial use that hospital could be put in the future.  I was aware&mdash;I had been so advised&mdash; that the fever problem did not represent in 1954 and 1955, and was unlikely to represent in the future, the problem it had represented when the new Fever Hospital was blueprinted and built.</P>
    <P>The Minister has kindly sent me the minutes of certain Departmental conferences which I convened and over which I presided, commencing on the 5th November, 1954, and held on three subsequent dates, when I considered with my advisers the possibility of turning the Dublin Fever Hospital Board into a national rehabilitation centre.  That suggestion, as the Minister's officers are aware, was put forward to me, as Minister, by certain members of the Board of the Dublin Fever Hospital.  At the time I had already decided that the Dublin Fever Hospital should be the polio centre and it appeared to me worth considering whether it should not also, in addition to being the centre for polio-myelitis cases, be the centre for rehabilitation.  I went into the matter fully, as the minutes which have been sent to me by the Minister disclose, and eventually I was unable to approve of the proposal for the reasons which transpired in these minutes.</P>
    <P>I mention that in order to emphasise that I was conscious of the problem created in relation to the future of the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  I never contemplated that this Board should be abolished and that it should be merged in the new unified health authority.  I have taken perhaps an undue length of time referring to this matter but I do so merely in order to permit myself as a Deputy to retain such reputation as I have.  I made a statement which I believed in sincerely. The records in no way cause me to feel I was mistaken.  I assert I was never conscious of any proposal to abolish the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  I accept that it may have been, as indeed the documents seem to show, included in some of the documents before me but it never had my <Col N="1042" /> approval.  So far as I was concerned, I would have felt that the Dublin Fever Hospital Board and those associated with it would continue to play an important part in the health services as persons doing it from a charitable motive and under a voluntary dispensation.</P>
    <P>I am happy, now that this matter has been raised in relation to the section of the Bill, that the objections which were voiced here by me and by others have been met, as they have been met by the Minister, in such a handsome way, and I hope that as a result the Minister will continue to have what every Minister for Health should have, the ready support in improving health services of this charitable kind of people who wish to help in a constructive way.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy O'Higgins for the detail with which he has outlined his position in regard to Cherry Orchard, the Dublin Fever Hospital.  When this matter arose on the Second Stage of the Bill I made a remark which I felt I was justified in making, on the records as they appeared to me.  I read the words; I did not know what the intention behind them may have been or what reservations attached to them. In any event, in the whole context of this Bill the position of the Dublin Fever Hospital Board is a mere detail which I am glad to say has been settled satisfactorily.  My only concern, when I mentioned this matter, was to ensure that nobody would feel that I had wilfully misled the House. I think it will be understood that whatever I may have said in relation to the policy of my successors as Ministers for Health I did not deliberately try to mislead the House and that I was speaking in good faith.</P>

      <P>That is all I want to say on that point.  I must also say this.  I think I should say it in fairness to my predecessors.  This has been a very knotty problem which has engaged the attention of at least three Ministers for Health including myself.  The <Col N="1043" /> Bill is now going through and I think it has been received very sympathetically and with a great deal of understanding on the part of the House. I feel that a great deal of the credit for the comparatively smooth passage of the Bill is due to my predecessors one of whom blazed the trail and the other broke the ground.  I hope that when we have disposed of amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 5 and No. 4 that the House will be able to give me the Fifth Stage of the Bill today.</P>

      <P>In this Estimate the Minister is seeking an increase of £118,000 approximately from the Central Fund and, naturally, added to that will be the same amount from local authority funds, because of underestimation of the amounts required for the administration of health services.  The Minister's statement was a full and comprehensive one and he explained fully the financial implications as they applied to the necessity for this particular Estimate.  Several things in his statement struck me as significant.  The Estimate would have <Col N="1052" /> been considerably higher but for the fact that there were savings of nearly £50,000 on tuberculosis administration and as I read the Minister's statement, this is the last year in which it is likely that any funds will come back to the Central Fund as a result of economies in the tuberculosis administration. The actual sum, I think, was £48,000 for the years 1957-58.  It is estimated that there will be very little saving from now on.  From now on we must at least have the possibility of facing increased charges for the administration of health services each year, both in regard to the Central Fund and the local authority funds.  In other words, there will be increased taxation to meet existing health services and there will be an increase in the rates.</P>
      <P>I note in today's paper that Dublin Corporation expect an increase of 1/1d. in the present rates bringing the current rates over £2 in the £1.  It is stated that this is solely due to the administration of health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gives several reasons for this increase, one of the main causes being the extra charges that fell on the local authorities in the administration of health services due to the fact that more money was required for patients that were being admitted to voluntary hospitals.  He said this was due to increased awareness on the part of patients that they were entitled to services in the voluntary hospitals. This poses a very serious question. In the administration of the health services throughout the country the aim has been under this Act to make available in all rural areas whether regional or definitely inter-county, specialist services of all kinds.  But the fact is that, according to the Minister's statement, more people are going to the voluntary hospitals and that means that more patients are going to central hospitals situated in Dublin, Cork and Limerick&mdash;the only places in which you find voluntary hospitals nowadays.  That goes to prove that the administration is not really a success.  In 1957 and 1958 people were availing of local services and since then more specialist services have been available in local authority hospitals; yet, even though there are more specialist services so available <Col N="1053" /> more people have availed of the opportunity of going to the voluntary hospitals for treatment.  That seems to suggest to me that we are having duplication of administration which is, of course, unavoidable.  It means that the money that is being provided for health services is not only providing local hospital treatment and providing specialist services which are not really being availed of but it also has to pay for the administration of the voluntary hospitals.  I should like to submit to the House that in the administration of this Act we should not go too fast.  Perhaps there has been a little too much wishful thinking on the part of those who were so keen on this particular administration.</P>
    <P>To prove that case more concretely, I want to refer again to the Minister's statement.  The Minister said that a certain amount of this money was due to the fact that more money was being spent on mental administration than before.  I do not think there is a Deputy who would not welcome that statement.  Every Deputy agrees that more money should be spent on mental administration.  However, I want to go further into the Minister's statement.  In that statement the Minister says that the increases in the mental hospitals are mainly under the following headings: food, repairs, maintenance, salaries and medicines. He does not say that there is an increase in those particular lines in the ordinary hospitals; it is only in the mental hospitals.  That means that these increases which have to be levied on the tax-payer, be they for central or local administration, are due to those particular reasons.  But there is no mention of their being due in the ordinary local authority hospitals for the ordinary specialist services. This again proves the point and verifies what the Minister says, that the people are not availing of the local authority hospitals and that they are availing of the voluntary hospitals.</P>

      <P>I understand and appreciate the Deputy's great concern with the subject, but we shall not get very far if the Deputy ascribes to me something which I did not say and a concept which is far from my mind. I did say that one considerable factor in the increase was the fact that people were availing more readily of the services of the ordinary general hospitals.  That does not mean to say that people are flocking to Dublin and Cork from the local authority hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall quote the Minister.  The reference is Col. 932 of the Dáil Debates for Thursday, 25th February, 1960:</P>
      <P>The occupancy of voluntary hospitals appears to have increased significantly over the years 1958 and 1959.  Many of the additional days of occupancy are attributable to the patients receiving Health Act services, and also the increasing awareness of patients of their right under the Acts, and consequently the proportion of the services provided in voluntary hospitals which results in claims on health authorities, may be assumed to have been growing over those years, and, indeed, to be still growing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to embarrass the Minister.  He has told us there are increased charges in the mental hospitals due to certain things.  The point I was making was that he did not mention there were increased charges in the ordinary local authority specialist hospitals due to the same causes.  The reason those increased charges do not take place in the local authority hospitals is that there are not more people in them. It goes to show there are fewer people availing of the local authority hospitals for specialist services than previously.  I have imputed nothing else to the Minister, only what he said. I do not think the Minister can accuse me of trying to put words into his <Col N="1055" /> mouth he did not say.  If he thinks I said anything, I would be happy to withdraw it.  I do not think he made a clear case against me.  I am only quoting him fairly in the two instances.</P>
      <P>I want to go back to the mental hospitals.  The Minister said the increase in the mental hospitals was due to food, repairs, maintenance, salaries, and medicines.  The increase in 1958-59 was £123,000, and the increase in 1959-60 was £55,000.  Due to modern treatments, expenses were higher.  I cannot conceive, even taking the lower figure for 1959-60, how the medicine bill could be £50,000 up. That, to my mind, is impossible, even with the advent of modern drugs and scientific treatment.  Though these drugs cost a considerable amount when they first come out, the general tendency is, when more and more come on the market and are easier to produce, that they rather tend to fall in prices.  We must come to the conclusion that the real increases in charges in the health services are due to other things.  One is that it is defeating its own end.  That is a point I made before: that the patients are not availing of the local authority hospitals and, therefore, the whole scheme is, in my opinion, a failure. They are turning back to the original centres of treatment where they went before.  The other increase is due to the general rise in the cost of living.  I do not want to labour in the House the reason for the rise in the cost of living.  The Minister knows that as well as I do.  Every Deputy knows it. There is pressure for increased wages, and that is due to the fact that there has been an almost illimitable increase in the cost of living.  While I say it is necessary that this amount of money should be voted as necessary to maintain the health services, the reason I intervened was to make it quite clear that, in my opinion, no matter what arguments are used, the health services as at present administered will cost more to the tax-payer each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the proof of that is that the Minister himself has stated you cannot expect much more reduction in savings under the heading of T.B.  At the moment I have a letter in my <Col N="1056" /> pocket from a working man who suffers from chronic asthma, and who is just able to carry on working himself. His wife is a chronic invalid.  He is earning just under £7 per week.  He had to send his wife into hospital because he could not look after her himself.  She is in hospital for 42 days and he now has a bill for £21, which he has brought to me.  He cannot pay it.  He says he never had, and is never likely to have, £21 in his possession in his life.</P>
    <P>It is not only yesterday or to-day I have got letters like that.  I have been getting such letters regularly over the past couple of years.  We are spending huge sums of money on the health services.  I submit that we are not getting the return that we should.  The very people who should get a return from the health services are not getting it. They are waiting at the end of the queue.  I said that in 1952 and the facts have proved I was right, and I repeat it here.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister cannot be blamed for the health administration that he is faced with at the moment, and I am grateful to him for the comprehensive statement he made the last day when introducing this Estimate but, anyone who reads it carefully, will see it is an admission of failure in regard to the money spent. I suppose the Dáil will have to vote more money in future but I submit that the country, and the people who should get a fair return from health administration, are not getting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Supplementary Estimate the Minister requires something like £120,000 for the administration of the health services generally. I know this is not the main Estimate and therefore my remarks will be fairly brief, but I think it would be wrong if I allowed this opportunity to go without making a comment on the administration of certain parts of the health services at present.  I suppose the Minister must be aware, as are most of us in this House, that there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction with regard to the administration of certain sections of the Health Act.  In <Col N="1057" /> particular there is grave dissatisfaction on the question of the issuing of medical service cards.  I suppose the great bulk of the people are served pretty well so far as the lower income group services are concerned but there is a pretty big fringe who, in my opinion, are done a very severe injustice. By whom I do not know.  I must confess that, and one does not seem to get much satisfaction when one inquires why this or that person did not get a medical service card.</P>
      <P>That brings us down to the question that has been often addressed to the Minister in this House: who is entitled to medical service cards?  As yet there has been no definite reply given, either by the Minister or by the various executives, who are the county managers in most cases.  If any Deputy were asked, as many have been asked by their constituents and other people &ldquo;Deputy, am I entitled to a medical service card?&rdquo;, the Deputy must reply &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; The Deputy or member of a county council who is asked that question feels pretty foolish because he can only say &ldquo;The manager decides whether or not you are entitled to a card and it depends on your circumstances.&rdquo;  The man then tells you his circumstances but still you cannot tell him.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there is some difficulty in laying down a means test in respect of services given by either local authorities or the State, but I wonder are the medical services vastly different from the ordinary social welfare services administered for many years?  If a person were to ask anybody in this House, or any member of a local authority &ldquo;Am I entitled to an old age pension?&rdquo; one has only to ask one or two questions and immediately one can say whether or not that person would be entitled to an old age pension, and one would be right 99 times out of a 100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When someone asks me &ldquo;Am I entitled to home assistance?&rdquo; knowing the rules as laid down by the Minister for Social Welfare, and included in the Department of Social Welfare's Booklet, after asking two or three questions I can tell that person whether he is entitled to home assistance. <Col N="1058" /> With a fair degree of accuracy I can tell a widow whether she is entitled to a widow's pension, and so on with regard to the other social services administered by the Minister for Social Welfare and his officials, but, even though we are told there is a means test with regard to medical service cards, nobody knows it.  The Deputies do not know it and I do not think the Minister knows it, and how it is operated by the local authorities I do not know.</P>
    <P>Again, when a person is refused a medical service card one might as well be idle as to ask for the reason.  No reason is given beyond the vague reply that the circumstances of the applicant are such as would not warrant him receiving the services generally applied to the lower income group.  That is one of the principal reasons why there is grave dissatisfaction with regard to the administration of the health services, that even though certain services are refused no good reason is given as to why they were refused.</P>
    <P>I know very many deserving people who, in my opinion, are deserving of the services generally applied to the lower income group and I wonder whether or not there could be a system whereby even a part of these services would be applied to those who would be on the border line.  There is tremendous expense on a person who is ill pretty often and who has not got a medical service card, who is just on the border line and who has to pay £1 or 25/- for one particular drug that he himself must have, or that some member of his family must have.  Such a person is in the unfortunate position of being more or less chronically ill and of having to have particular drugs and, as Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde said a moment ago, drugs can be pretty expensive in these times.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think a general review is called for and I think the Minister who introduced the Health Act said at that time that we would have to see how we got on over the years.  That Act has been administered for the last five or six years and I think it is about time there was a review.  We should not leave it like other Acts, for 20, 30 or 40 years and then only after persistent <Col N="1059" /> criticism attempt to make a review of it.  Possibly the Minister himself makes a periodical review.</P>
    <P>Again in reference to the issuing of medical service cards it seems to me that each local authority is in competition with the others.  Periodically the Minister gives information to the House as to the percentages of population covered by medical service cards and they range between 28 per cent. up to 40 per cent. of the population. The local authority which covers 40 per cent. of its population rightly does so because that 40 per cent. are deserving of the services available to the lower income group, but it seems to me that when local authorities see figures ranging from 28 per cent. up to 40 per cent. they all try to get down to an average, or to get below the figure which is covered by other local authorities and which is below their own.</P>
    <P>I know, as the Minister said here last week, that money is a very important factor and I suppose to some extent we must cut our cloth according to our measure, but it would be interesting if the Minister could give us a break down of the expenses of the health services.  It would be interesting to see how the money is spent.  I do not think that information is given in the Estimate.  I think the Estimate merely reads &ldquo;Grants to health authorities&rdquo; but it would be interesting if the Minister could give us that information on the main Estimate. What part of the money goes to the voluntary hospitals, to local authorities, to dispensary doctors, what part goes for maternity services, for drugs, for medicines and all the other things included under the general heading of &ldquo;Grants to health authorities&rdquo;?  It is true, of course, that some local authorities are more progressive than others.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's hands are tied to a large extent on a matter about which I feel very strongly, the extension of the health services as allowed under the Health Act, 1953. For instance, some local authorities have a dental service for adults. <Col N="1060" /> Others have not.  I agree with the Minister and his predecessor that the concentration should be on school children in the matter of dental care but it is also very important that elderly people should have good teeth. Some elderly people are under the impression that if they had teeth extracted the local authority would provide dentures.  That was done prior to the Health Act, 1953, under a heading in the Vote.  Whether it was under the public assistance heading or not, I do not know, but people were provided with dentures under some heading, prior to the introduction of the present Act and there is provision for it in the Act.  I would ask the Minister for Health to encourage every local authority to go as far as they can to provide a dental service for adults in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde referred to hospital charges.  I am afraid that in that respect there is room for very detailed examination.  In my constituency, at least, people who would ordinarily be entitled to a medical service card have discovered that the local authority have now checked up on hospital accounts and have sent out bills for fantastic amounts for maintenance in hospital.  The local authority should be reasonable in that respect.  A man whose income is £8 or £9 a week, who has a wife and one child and who would not be entitled to a medical service card, would find it very difficult to pay a hospital charge of 10/- per day for 30 or 40 days in respect of his wife.</P>
    <P>There is another criticism one can make of the administration of the Act by the local authorities, namely, that, invariably, the 10/- per day is charged. The Act says, and the Minister said when he introduced the Bill, that a charge up to a maximum of 10/- a day may be made but the intention of the House was that the local authority would use discretion and grade the daily charge having regard to the circumstances of the family.  I do not want to be unfair to any local authority, particularly to the local authority about which I know most. They invariably charge 10/- a day but, on representations being made, in <Col N="1061" /> some cases&mdash;not in all cases&mdash;the charge is reduced and sometimes waived completely.  There should be a special officer of the local authority who would act as almoner and whose function would be to investigate the means of a family in circumstances where they are required to pay a lot of money for hospital expenses or for drugs or medicines.  That would go a good deal of the way towards satisfying people who are critical of the administration of the health services, particularly in regard to the issue of medical service cards.</P>
    <P>As I have said, my remarks would be more appropriate on the main Estimate.  I trust the Minister will have regard to what I have said in respect of medical service cards.  I do not wish to give a comprehensive survey of the health services now but perhaps the Minister will consider some of the points I have raised on this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point to which I wish to draw particular attention.  Deputies are naturally interested in providing the service at as low a cost as possible.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the case of persons who require artificial limbs or medical appliances. In the first instance they are provided but, in the case of renewals, unless the person concerned enters a hospital, he can be charged the full cost of the appliance by the local authority.  That applies in Cork city and county.  It is an extraordinary situation that by becoming a patient in a hospital while awaiting the replacement of the appliance the expense is covered whereas, if he were to stay at home, it would not be covered.  It should be possible, under the Health Act, to make such appliances available without the necessity of the person being admitted to hospital.  That would mean a saving to the State and to the local authority and would be more convenient for the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such cases have arisen in Cork and the matter was discussed at a recent meeting of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance, arising out of a case in which a person was presented with a very high bill because of the fact <Col N="1062" /> that he did not re-enter hospital for the purpose of having an artificial limb fitted.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of this Supplementary Estimate it would not be appropriate to have a general discussion of the health services but I should like to say that Deputies find it embarrassing at times when people ask them whether or not they are entitled to medical cards.  In my opinion, a great deal of the difficulty has arisen because the yardstick by which the manager or local authority decided whether or not a person was entitled to a medical card, namely, his income of a few years back, has not since been altered in respect of increases in wages in certain categories over the last few years.  The difficulty is that no allowance is made for the increase in the cost of living or in wage rates.  That is causing a lot of the trouble.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that in south Cork the officials of the local authority are doing their utmost to co-operate in the matter of charges for patients in local authority hospitals or other hospitals coming under the Health Act.  From my own experience, I know that they do go out of their way to examine carefully the financial position of the family before deciding on any particular charge.  I think it is right that we should issue cards to assist them in making as favourable an approach as possible to patients and patients' families.  On the other hand the discrepancies exising at the present time, based on the wage rate now as against what it was a few years ago, are I believe causing undue upsets in the minds of people who had, a few years ago, been favoured with medical cards.  These cards have since been taken from them.  As I say this is a Supplementary Estimate and it would perhaps be more suitable that we should confine ourselves to the item in it.  But I would ask the Minister to examine the cases of persons who are not re-entering hospital and who are at a disadvantage if they have to replace medical appliances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points raised by the Deputies who have spoken on the Estimate.  I <Col N="1063" /> merely want to say that there is no person more conscious than I of the imperfections of our health service and if a point of substance is made in this House by a Deputy in regard to these services I shall endeavour to ensure that, so far as I can, the matter is rectified.  But here we must have a very clear realisation of what the powers of the Minister are under the Health Act.  He is bound by the statutes, particularly in relation to the issue of medical cards to persons on the general medical services register.  That is an Act of the Oireachtas and it is a decision which the Oireachtas took on very substantial grounds because, unlike the case of social assistance as distinct from home assistance, the whole cost of the health services is not met by moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer pays 50 per cent. of the cost, and the local community, the local ratepayers, pay the remaining 50 per cent.  It is only just and proper that the local community on whom the payment of 50 per cent. may fall very heavily in its immediate incidence, should have the right to determine who, in their judgment, are by reason of their economic conditions entitled to secure free services at every level from the general practitioners up to the higher specialist services at a considerable charge to the local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we cannot, in the nature of things, deprive the local authority of the right and responsibility to control the issue of medical cards.  In the case of the social assistance code, the position is very different.  With the exception of home assistance, the full charge arising out of the existence of that code and its administration is borne by the Exchequer and you have social welfare officers and other who are competent to determine whether or not a person fulfils the conditions which entitle him to the qualification certificate under the Social Welfare Acts.  There you are up against the other difficulty which I think Deputies must consider.  That is that there is no flexibility in the administration of the social assistance code.  Either your income exceeds in <Col N="1064" /> rural districts £72 16s. and in county boroughs and other urban districts, I think £92&mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;or it does not.  If it happens to exceed that figure you are out for unemployment assistance and everything that derives from unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>In the case of health services on the other hand, there is a great degree of flexibility built into the code which allows the responsible officers of the local authority to consider the case of every applicant and the question of his need to secure a medical services card is determined ultimately by the economic circumstances of himself and his family.  Here, of course, there is room for infinite variation and infinite flexibility which you have not got in the case of social services under the social assistance schemes.  Taking it by and large I would say that it is highly probable that, if we were to depart from the existing scheme, a great deal of hardship which at the moment is avoided would be imposed upon individuals and upon families who are at the present moment enjoying the benefits of the Health Act&mdash;and they are justly entitled to enjoy them.</P>
    <P>We cannot have it both ways&mdash;the human approach to the particular circumstances of a family which we have under the Health Act and, at the same time, the automatic determination of whether a person is entitled, say, to a non-contributory widow's pension or unemployment assistance which we have under the social assistance code. And, of course, we could not possibly cover the number of families who are deriving full advantages of Section 14 of the Health Act if we were to employ some method of automatic regulation such as is built in in the social assistance code.  We would certainly have to set our targets more modestly; if we were setting a target in that way, our sights would have to be set very much lower than under the Health Act.  I think that a consideration which Deputies should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>The moment we withdraw the power and discretion and, of course, the responsibility that goes with discretion, from the local authorities, we begin to exclude from the benefits <Col N="1065" /> of the health services a very large number of people who are on the margin or whose circumstances, although apparently good, by reason of things which are not known to the public and can only be made known to an investigating officer, from the point of view of health&mdash;the demands which the provisions of health services for themselves or their families make&mdash;are far from being good.  I think we must not dwell all the time upon the fact, that sometime or other, this flexible approach is bound to pinch a few toes.</P>
    <P>By and large, having regard to the number of people who possess medical service cards throughout the country, I think the position must be from the medical point of view reasonably satisfactory&mdash;in fact so reasonably satisfactory that there would appear to be many people who, although they have medical service cards, are not taking the full advantages of them.  I find to my astonishment cases of persons who are in possession of medical service cards writing to me to complain that they have gone to this or that hopsital which is not a recognised institution for the purpose of the Acts and that they have been sent by their own medical attendants.</P>
    <P>They have gone, instead of availing of the local authority hospitals, into the voluntary health hospitals and then they have to suffer the consequences. How it happens that, instead of going to the local authority hospitals and availing of the great skill and competence of the persons now staffing the county hospitals, they come up to Dublin or to Cork just astonishes me. I often wonder whether, in fact, these unfortunate patients find themselves subsequently in the position in which to their surprise they are confronted with substantial bills because they have been wrongly advised in respect of hospital facilities by the practitioners whom they consulted in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I should be gratified if Deputies like Deputy Corish and Deputy Esmonde, who have just made these complaints, would communicate with me.  If they do so, I shall endeavour to have the situation cleared up to their satisfaction. I can try to get the local authority to ameliorate the position of the people <Col N="1066" /> who have been caught in this way. I shall endeavour to bring the facts before the notice of the local authority and ask them to reconsider the position. That is as far as I can go.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde argued from certain statements I made in my opening speech that people were flocking to the voluntary general hospitals in Dublin because they did not get the treatment they required in the ordinary county medical hospitals.  May I say that the general complaint in relation to the county hospitals is that they have not enough beds for the patients anxious to avail of them?  If people do come to the voluntary general hospitals in Dublin it is perhaps most generally because there is not a sufficiency of beds available locally. There may be the second consideration that perhaps some people are being sent by their local medical advisers quite unnecessarily to the voluntary general hospitals in Dublin and elsewhere.  I shall not enter into the reasons why this might be done but I am afraid it is being done in some instances.  I deprecate it and I am sure that Deputy Corish and Deputy Esmonde would also deprecate it.</P>
    <P>Another reason why such a large number of people are availing of the voluntary general hospital service is that many people, particularly in Dublin city and county where you have over 25 per cent. of the population of the whole country, are now becoming aware of the great benefit which they may derive from the Health Act of 1953 and are availing themselves of the hospital services which are more or less freely available under that Act. These are the reasons there is now greater occupancy of the voluntary general hospitals than in 1956 or 1957 when the Act was only beginning to come into operation.</P>
    <P>To come back to the reason for the Estimate, which should really be the only thing discussed at this stage, may I say that the reason is a very simple one?  It is just that the local authorities, no more than I am, are not prophets. When they were preparing their estimates for the year 1958-'59 they were not in a position to see for a year ahead, how many people would avail <Col N="1067" /> themselves of the services provided under the Health Act.  In some relative measure they were not able, in 1959-'60, to foresee the future in any great detail.  It was because they under-estimated the number of people and the charges which would fall upon them and on the Exchequer in 1958-'59 and 1959-'60 that we are bringing in this Supplementary Estimate today.</P>

    <P>The Contingency Fund provides the means by which may be met urgent or unforeseen expenditure not covered by ordinary Votes and for which it is impracticable to seek the immediate approval of the Dáil.  No payment is charged finally against the Fund, which each year is restored to its original figures of £20,000 through the Repayments to the Contingency Fund Vote and/or by the repayment, from the other Votes or Funds concerned, of any advances made thereto.  An account of the Contingency Fund showing the advances made, repayments effected and advances outstanding is published with the annual Appropriation Accounts.  The three items of expenditure which necessitate this year's Vote are shown on the face of the Estimate.  They are naturally unforeseen; first, triples, secondly, centenarians and thirdly, the expenses in connection with the installation of the President in June, 1959.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £277,000 be granted to defray the charges which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for Remuneration of Civil Servants.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, a general movement of wages increases commonly known as &ldquo;the seventh round&rdquo; has taken place since the middle of 1959. At the end of October last a claim was made by civil servants under the conciliation and arbitration scheme. Following discussions agreement was reached on increases which were in line with the general trend of outside pay. These increases were:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On the portion of 1948 basic pay up to £250 a year the existing addition of 37½% was raised to 49%.</P>
      <P>On the portion of 1948 basic pay above £250 a year the existing addition of 22½% was raised to 29%.</P>
      <P>The flat additions to pay, based on the 10/- a week formula, which were granted to arbitrable groups in the Civil Service as from 1st April, 1958, were also continued.</P>
      <P>Following representations from the Association of Higher Civil Servants, it was decided to extend the percentage and flat additions on the same basis to officers above the salary limit for arbitration. It is my intention to have these additions consolidated so that pay rates will be expressed in inclusive terms.</P>
      <P>To meet the cost of this pay revision, provision of the order of £1.1 million will be necessary in a full year.  For the 3½ months of the current financial year to which it applies, the additional sum required is estimated at £277,000, allowing for available savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Additional Estimate has been introduced, that is, for primary teachers and another will be, if it has not already been, introduced for the Army.  We are not yet in a position to <Col N="1071" /> say what may happen in regard to the vocational teachers, the secondary teachers or the Civic Guards. Deputies who are here to-day heard the Minister say that the Guards' case has gone to arbitration.  We do not know what the result of that may be. The vocational teachers are also applying for arbitration and we have not heard any decision as to whether the secondary teachers will agree to conciliation or go to arbitration.</P>
    <P>These three groups remain and I am sure Deputies will be asking me what will be the total amount of these increases. If the rate of increase in respect of these cases not already decided should work out at about the same as that of the civil servants, the total liability on the Exchequer will be about £2.4 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can follow the Minister, this Additional Estimate is necessary entirely as a result of the agreement reached at conciliation level under the Civil Service arbitration machinery.  Of course, the necessity for any such claim by the Civil Service arose out of the policy that was deliberately adopted by the Minister and by the Government.  It is that policy which is responsible for the increase of £2.4 million to which the Minister has just referred.  It is a matter of some consideration therefore to see not merely in relation to Government services as a whole but in relation to the nation as a whole, what the total cost will be finally, to work out in terms of money all the results of the action taken by the Government immediately after they came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the Minister the total cost of this increase in a full year is £1.1 million, and the sum of £277,000 for the period from 15th December last, makes it appear that there is a very small saving indeed. The amount involved looks more or less the proportion, on a day-to-day basis, of the total cost for a full year. I understood from the Minister that we were getting, and going to get, substantial staff savings.  The Minister expanded considerably on that theme in one of his Budget speeches.  It <Col N="1072" /> seems from this figures that the staff saving that was promised has not yet become a reality and I should like to hear from the Minister some indication of what progress has been made towards the saving that he promised us then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I could understand, this Estimate relates to the increases for civil servants, both for pay and pensions.  There is a considerable sum of money involved and yet there is one section of the community who have not yet had their grievances redressed.  It seems to me that a very small amount would cover the people to whom I refer&mdash;the teachers who retired prior to 1950.  I think the Minister mentioned that the Conciliation Board was sitting in relation to teachers' conditions, pay and pensions.  Would the Department or the Government review the outstanding claims of those people who retired prior to 1950?  Very few of them remain and it would cost the State a very small sum to satisfy them in relation to the amount we are now asked to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question asked by Deputy Sweetman, I did say in the Budget of 1957 that I expected to make a saving of £250,000 on the Civil Service, a saving which was actually made in that year as the Appropriation Accounts will show. But on the 1st April, 1958, the beginning of the next financial year, a pay increase was given to civil servants, a flat 10/- per week increase.  That, of course, made it impossible to have a further saving and will mean a very much bigger addition to the civil servants' pay.  I do not think we could possibly expect a net saving.  The Deputy's question, however, has suggested it to my mind to analyse the numbers and so on since 1957 to see if any attempt at saving has been made since 1958, apart from the increased pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, naturally, said this increase was due to Government action.  Our experience is that the cost of living remained fairly constant from 1923 to 1938 or 1939, when the war came.  Since the war there has been a <Col N="1073" /> continuous increase and, as a matter of fact, some small portion of this may be attributed to an increase in the cost of living between the end of 1955 and the time of the change of Government. I am not in a position to say what that proportion is at the moment but I could, I suppose, give some indication of it if the figures were examined.</P>
    <P>The second round of wages to which I referred made it obligatory on the Government, I would say, to consider an increase of pay for civil servants and everybody paid from the Exchequer.  It can be argued that they got in or about what was going to other people.  Deputies will be well aware that the civil servants have fairly able people to represent them, like everybody else, and a settlement could not have been reached unless they were satisfied that they got a fair increase compared with what was going generally.</P>
    <P>Personally, I was very glad that we were able to settle the matter by conciliation because we are likely to get a very much better response from the Civil Service through conciliation than through arbitration.  I was, therefore, very anxious to settle the matter by conciliation if at all possible and we succeeded in doing so.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,133,500 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of March, 1960, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office and for payment of certain Subsidies and Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the sum required is accounted for by the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme.  The amount voted for this Scheme in the current year was £3,500,000, which, with receipts estimated at £1,680,000, would have left the net cost for the year at £1,820,000 It is now estimated that the gross expenditure <Col N="1074" /> for the year will be £8,784,000 and that receipts resulting from salvage realisation on reactors will be £3,810,000, thus leaving the net cost at £4,974,000.  This is an increase of £3,154,000 on the net cost as originally estimated.</P>
    <P>The additional gross expenditure on T.B. eradication for which approval is now sought is, therefore, £5,284,000. The expenditure of this large additional sum is fully justified.  It is now more essential than ever before to press on as speedily as possible with the job of eradicating bovine tuberculosis from our herds, and the Government are determined that the marked intensification of effort which has developed during the past year and has given rise to this additional expenditure should not be hampered by lack of money.</P>
    <P>Since yesterday, 1st March, all Britain has been finally closed to untested store cattle, as her remaining free-testing areas then became Eradication Areas.  This closure should be a final warning to our farmers&mdash;if, indeed, any further warning is still needed&mdash;to get rid of reactors and build up their herds to accredited status.</P>
    <P>Over 95 per cent. of the additional provision sought is required to finance the purchase of reactors.  The number of reactors originally provided for was 56,000, but it is now estimated that the total number of reactors taken up by my Department during this financial year will be no fewer than 168,000. or three times the number originally envisaged.  Gross expenditure on reactor purchases for the year will, accorddingly, now amount to almost £7,600,000, representing an additional £5 millions over the amount already provided.</P>
    <P>The rate of reactor removal has been particularly high during the second half of the present financial year and shows no sign of slackening. The removal programme has been particularly heavy in recent months in the western clearance area, because, as the goal of eradication is being approached in those counties, there is close concentration on all reactor herds, which are kept under frequent <Col N="1075" /> retest until they become clear.  It is expected that the seven counties of the western clearance area can be declared accredited areas during this year, as the disease has now been virtually eliminated there.  In fact, the problem in those counties from now on will become mainly one of movement control.</P>
    <P>As regards the eastern counties, the position in the early autumn was that the initial round of testing had been almost completed and farmers were, therefore, then ready to start removing reactors.  At the same time, a more general awareness of the urgent need for eradication began to show itself, and has since built up, with the result that cow reactors were offered to the Department in all these counties in increasing numbers from October onwards.</P>
    <P>In the southern dairying counties, no fewer than 12,000 cow reactors were offered to the Department in the second half of September alone, prior to the coming into operation of the new eradication arrangements on the 1st October last.  Under this new scheme, an estimated 39,000 reactors will be removed by the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>There is an estimated increase of £190,000 in the cost of the fees payable to private veterinary surgeons for testing.  With the extension of the eradication measures to the entire country, there was an increased demand for initial testing as new herds joined the scheme, but it was also found necessary during the year to provide additional testing facilities. These include the &ldquo;60-day&rdquo; retest which is granted to any herd outside the clearance area from which all reactors have been removed and which complies with certain other requirements, or to a herd which was clear at its last test and is going accredited. Free retesting of animals in isolation in accredited herds has also been granted during the course of the year. The present position is that virtually every herd in 23 counties is under test; in the remaining three counties, viz., Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, full participation in the scheme has not yet been reached.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> In Subhead N2, which deals with the operation of the Bovine Tuberculosis Order, 1926, there is an increase of £17,000 due to a rise in the slaughterings of cattle clinically affected with T.B.  The number of cattle slaughtered in the year ended 31st December last was about 25% higher than in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead F.7, there is provision for an additional £34,110 for the University Colleges.  The amount already voted for the Agricultural Faculty of University College, Dublin, has proved insufficient to meet the increased operating costs of the Faculty, and it is proposed, therefore, to increase the grant in the current year by £30,000.  I might mention that the output of graduates in agricultural science has increased very considerably in recent times.</P>
    <P>More money is also required for the Dairy Science Faculty of University College, Cork, and I am seeking authority for an additional amount of £4,110 for this purposes.</P>
    <P>Because of the transfer of a number of institutions and services from the Department of Agriculture to An Foras Talúntais during the year it is now necessary to provide an additional sum of £95,690 under Subhead K.5.  The revised estimate of £145,690 under this Subhead includes a grant of £45,000 plus the expenses of running the transferred institutions and services for the proportion of the year during which they have been operated by An Foras Talúntais.  The institutions and services in questions include Johnstown Castle Agricultural College, Grange Farm, the Peatland Experimental Station at Glenamoy, and Peatland Investigations at Derrybrennan and Clonsast.  As a result of the various transfers, there will been savings under other Subheads which will very largely counter balance the increased provision for which I now seek authority.</P>
    <P>An additional £200,000 is required under Subhead M.7 to enable the Land Project to be continued without interruption for the remainder of the financial year.  The number of applications has shown a substantial increase during the past year and a larger <Col N="1077" /> number of grants has been earned; moreover, the average amount of grant per acre has been tending to increase. The indications are that this increase in the volume of work done will continue. The total number of applications received in the year 1959 was 24,800&mdash;an increase of over 2,000 on 1958.  The net additional amount required is £200,000.</P>
    <P>An item of £469,549 arises under Subhead S because of the necessity to write off losses incurred on superphosphate imported by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann from the Netherlands on behalf of the Department of Agriculture in the years 1950/51 and 1951/52.  Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, who acted as agents for the Department of Agriculture in importing and distributing the fertilisers, were guaranteed against financial loss in carrying out the transaction.  About 84,000 tons of superphosphate were imported in 1950/51 and of this some 18,000 tons remained unsold at the end of the season.  Because of the outbreak of the Korean war in 1951/52 and the danger that it might develop into a wider conflict resulting in shortages of essential commodities, it was decided to import a further consignment of some 40,000 tons of superphosphates. Prices had risen very steeply in 1951-52 under the influence of the War; as a consequence home demand fell and at the end of the 1951-52 season 55,000 tons remained unsold.</P>
    <P>With the improvement in the world political situation prices of fertilisers fell and prices of the imported stocks had, therefore, to be substantially reduced.  Stocks were, however, slow to clear.  Due to the slow rate of sale it was necessary to provide £923,000 to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann out of voted moneys in the financial year 1952-53 to enable the Company to reduce its overdraft.  This sum was to be refunded according as sales were effected.</P>
    <P>Because of the fall in fertiliser price levels, the cost of storage and the deterioration in the condition of some of the material during storage, the sales of superphosphate realised much less than expected.  Of the sum of £922,717 advanced only £453,168 was <Col N="1078" /> recovered by the Department, leaving a loss of approximately £469,549.  I now seek authority to have this amount written off.</P>
    <P>The submission of a Supplementary Estimated for this item was delayed because certain insurance claims remained to be settled.  Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, who are the Department's agents in the matter, have been actively negotiating a settlement of these claims but because of their complicated nature and the large number of underwriters involved, the matter has not yet been brought to finality. I understand that normally there is a long delay in the settlement of this type of marine insurance claim and that it may be some time before a final settlement is reached.  Payment by the insurance companies so far amounts to £1,475 and the amount still under negotiation is approximately £10,000.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £6,500 is also needed under Subhead B because a greater volume of travelling has been necessary than was anticipated when the original estimate was being framed.</P>
    <P>As a partial offset to the additional expenditure involved in the Subheads mentioned there are savings under other Subheads estimated at £1,525,849, which, with additional appropriations-in-aid of £2,447,500 reduce the total net amount required to £2,133,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain matters arising from this Supplementary Estimate which call for comment. I can, of course, emphatically endorse what the Minister says in regard to the need of farmers all over the country collaborating in the fullest possible degree with the Department of Agriculture in the task of eradicating bovine tuberculosis.  I am prepared to go a little further than the Minister appears to have gone, as I think farmers have on them a duty not only to do what they are asked to do but to offer their collaboration to the Department in any area where, by special effort, they can do even a little more than the strict regulations require of them.  In fact, I think it needs to be put on record pretty explicitly in this regard that in this <Col N="1079" /> matter particularly, as in so many other matters, the Department is not only the servant but the friend of the farmers of this country, but they cannot do for the farmers all that they would wish to do if they do not get from the farmers the most generous co-operation which it is in the power of the farmers to give.</P>
      <P>In another context I had occasion to criticise the public relations of the Department of Agriculture though I know from personal experience how difficult it is for any Department of State to conduct effective public relations when they are not geared to it. It is unfamiliar and it is not always readily understood by accounting Departments if an administrative Department, like the Department of Agriculture, seeks the resources effectively to publicise their activities, but I cannot help feeling that there is some failure to get over to the farmers of this country what the Department wants them to do.</P>
      <P>Now, I did get a helpful circular from the Department setting out four or five things that a farmers, who wishes to co-operate with the Department, ought to do and I assume that was widely distributed but, having read that, I could not help asking myself is there nothing more they want us to do?  That circular asked us to see that all reactors were removed from our herd and that we should refrain from buying any but attested cattle.  Having eliminated all the reactors, having ensured that all the cattle on my farm had green tags in their ears, and having arranged that we would not buy any cattle hereafter that had not a green tag, I could not help asking myself are there no instructions as to how we are to dispose of our cattle, or is there anything further we can do to help expedite the eradication of tuberculosis in our area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is all the Department wants I suggested to the Minister, having distributed that document, it would be no harm to repeat its contents pretty regularly in the provincial newspapers. I think country people read, and keep <Col N="1080" /> in their homes, the local newspaper pretty carefully.  It is one of the distressing facts all of us discover that stating the obvious once is not enough. I know when I was Minister for Agriculture it often exasperated me when we published advertisements exhorting people to do things which manifestly would be greatly to their own advantage, yet if I went down the country and asked a group of people &ldquo;Why have you not done so and so?&rdquo; to be told they never heard of it.</P>
    <P>The only method that I ever discovered for getting any kind of message like that over is constant reiteration to the point of boredom, but I do believe that if you can reduce its recommendations to four or five simple headings it is well worthwhile continually repeating that advice through the medium of the Press, and through the medium of circulation pamphlets, until the adoption of the measures recommended is no longer requisite but, so long as it is desirable, these producedures should be adopted and sustained.  I think it cannot be too often repeated that this is necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>I shall refer later to the desirability of a national advisory service but it is in circumstances such as this that I think we suffer so disastrously in this country for the lack of a national advisory service.  If we had a decent advisory service, with a good parish agent in most rural parishes, it would be the least we would expect at a time like this to see that one of the parish agent's first duties in calling on every farm would be to ask the five questions in the Department's leaflet&mdash;&ldquo;Have you done this, have you done that and the other thing?  If not, there is a copy of what the Minister is trying to do for your benefit! Nail that up on the door and ask yourself every morning have you given effect to these recommandations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the present time the Minister for Agriculture is asking county agricultural officers in every county to give him their closest co-operation but the individual C.A.O.s. interpretation of what &ldquo;closest co-operation&rdquo; is will vary very gravely from county to county and, if it does not conform to <Col N="1081" /> the Minister's estimate of what it should be, there is very little that he can do about it.</P>
    <P>That problem arises in regard to many of the activities of the Department of Agriculture which are in the national interest and one of the most distressing features is that where the Department of Agriculture is going about urging national business of that kind the liaison between it and the individual farmer for whom it is trying to work is deplorably insufficient.  I would therefore ask the Minister, with the resources he has at his disposal at the present time, to intensify the publicity on what he considers to be the necessary steps to give the Department the full co-operation that they must have if they are to complete the job. For instance, I have held my fire as far as I could because I do not understand the problems the Minister is confronted with at the present time in connection with this whole clearance problem.  I fully appreciate there is no use in adopting a certain line of our own if we cannot bring our principal customers with us, in confidence, in the precautions we are taking.</P>
    <P>I had hoped in the early days that when we tackled Sligo and Clare we could at an early date declare them attested areas.  I understand the Minister is now of the opinion that, in all the circumstances, it is best to wait until we can declare the whole area west of the Shannon an attested area and I am prepared to accept that, if that is the position, but I do not think I am being unreasonable if at this stage I tell the Minister that I think the time is overdue when we should be given the answer to two questions.</P>
    <P>When are we going to declare the area west of the Shannon an attested area?  The Minister says some time this year.  I wonder could he be more precise about that?  There are strong rumours circulating in Sligo that the Minister is going down to address the Sligo County Committee of Agriculture and that he is going to make a <i>pronunciamento</i> there.  I want to suggest to him that Dáil Éireann is a much more suitable place even that the Sligo County Committee of Agriculture although I recall that that body is entitled to special consideration, <Col N="1082" /> as is the County Committee of Agriculture of Clare, because these were the first two counties where the scheme was launched.  At the time of its launching there were a good many reservations in Sligo as to whether they ought to collaborate at all or not.  They overcame their misgivings and did collaborate in the early days and there would be something perhaps suitable in paying them a special compliment by making the pronouncement there. The matter is of national urgency and I think I am entitled to ask the Minister, if he has the date in mind, would he tell us because, out of his answer to that question, arises another query.</P>
    <P>Suppose we are able by the 1st July, say, to declare the Western area an attested area, what plans has the Minister in mind for the sale and transport of cattle from that area?  How are we going to get cattle out of the attested area in Ireland into the attested area in Great Britain?  Are we going to have special trains?  Are we going to have special boats?</P>
    <P>The more precisely the Minister can paint that picture for us in the future, the better prospect there is, in my judgment, of making the people west of the Shannon realise how eminently worthwhile it is to put their very best effort into completing the job in the shortest possible time because its completion will result in a manifest, obvious and immense benefit for all farmers in the area and, therefore, it is the interest and the duty of every farmer to be diligent in realising at the earliest possible moment the attestation of this area.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if attestation leaves unanswered the question of how are we going to get our cattle from the Irish attested area into the British attested area, there will be wiseacres locally who will be raising the question, &ldquo;What good is it going to do us to be attested unless plans are completed to enable us to get the full benefit of our attestation?&rdquo;  I do suggest to the Minister that if the vision of the benefit of attestation was sufficiently clear he could get the degree of collaboration that perhaps he is not getting at the present time, that is, if one neighbour saw another <Col N="1083" /> neighbour letting down the scheme the proximate prospect of real advantage from complete attestation in the area would induce that neighbour to bring moral pressure to bear on any delinquent in his neighbourhood who put the prospects of the whole area in jeopardy by his dishonesty.</P>
    <P>I am sometimes in the difficulty in which I find it hard to know what is best to do in matters of this kind. Generally, it is better for somebody in a responsible position, if he has any information of abuse, to communicate it to the Department of Agriculture and allow them to deal with it.  I have not any evidence but I think it is desirable to mention the matter here in public so that the Minister would be given the opportunity of scotching the rumoure, if it is a rumour, or dwelling on it if there is any substance in it.  I have heard it suggested that green ear tags were being trafficked in. I want to say this quite explicity: I have a long experience of rural life and my experience of rural life teaches me that if there is a possibility of impropriety there will always be found some dismal Jimmy to allege that it is rife and going on all over the place and when you come to investigate it with detachment and care you discover that there is really no substantial ground for the complaint at all.</P>
    <P>Where that kind of talk is proceeding it is better to mention it here so that the Minister may be in a position to say that the matter has been fully investigated and there is no truth in it.  To tell the truth, when I began to examine it, I asked myself who could benefit by taking a green tag out of one beast's ear and putting it into another beast's ear?  It did not seem to me to be clear how anyone could benefit.  Nevertheless, that kind of talk goes on and it is expedient for the Minister to say a word in regard to it to-day.  If that is the answer, let it be given.</P>
    <P>There may be other Deputies who have heard talk of this kind.  They can confirm me if they have because I am satisfied that in a matter of this kind it is better to let the Minister deal with it in public lest idle rumour <Col N="1084" /> of that kind grow in rural Ireland and operate to promote the suggestion that the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis is generally unsound and not worth helping on account of the abuses.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is any substantial foundation for allegations of this kind.  I am quite satisfied&mdash; and it is my job to find fault with the Minister when and if I can&mdash;that the administration of the tuberculosis eradication scheme is effective, on the right lines and is entitled to the support of every farmer, large or small, in this country.  It would be not only my duty but possibly my political advantage to say otherwise if I were in a position to do so.  In a matter of this kind it is vitally important that whatever the truth is should be faithfully recorded and if there is any other Deputy who has a different tale to tell then I consider, whatever side of the House he sits on, he has a duty to tell it because it is better that the Minister should be afforded the opportunity of dealing with such rumours, if they are in circulation anywhere in the country.</P>
    <P>I would be particularly grateful if the Minister would give us, if he is in a position to do so, a clear reply to the question, when we are attested West of the Shannon, how are we going to get our attested cattle from West of the Shannon to the attested areas in Great Britain?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the present position is that virtually every herd in 23 counties is under test; that in the remaining three counties, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, full participation in the scheme has not yet been reached.  Is that delay due to difficulty in getting staff heretofore?  Because, if it is not, I fully agree with the policy of getting the rest of the country well under way before tackling these three counties to which I have referred but I think the time is now overdue when we should take our courage in our hands and tackle the remaining counties.  The Minister is appropriating large sums of money in order to expedite the completion of the task.  I think he is perfectly right to do so and if excessive caution restrained him in this matter <Col N="1085" /> he would be greatly to blame.  The job has to be done.  The argument, from a purely financial point of view, could be made for spreading it out over a longer period, with consequently smaller annual appropriations, but such argument is utterly baseless and would be a great mistake.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate when the Minister talks of Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford that he may be confronted with very serious loss, because he had very large numbers of cattle to deal with but I think he should take his courage in his hands and if he has the staff he should tackle these counties without further delay.</P>

      <P>All I want to say, so far as this Opposition is concerned, is that if the Minister's problem in dealing with this matter is one of capital investment, we are prepared to support any measure to enable him to proceed with the utmost expedition in this matter.  We are satisfied that whatever the cost may be, the loss that would accrue to our economy if, through lack of courageous finance, this matter is not pressed forward with all possible expedition, would be out of all proportion to whatever economic problems will arise as a result of going full steam ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate there are various considerations which have to be carefully weighed.  One has to bear in mind the available outlets for the produce of intensive eradication in areas where there is a large cattle population.  I understand there are various outlets at present which fortunately are relatively buoyant and that is something of which I think we should take full advantage.  I want to press the Minister further to see that the position in these three counties is tackles.  I think I am <Col N="1086" /> entitled to say on the whole that, formidable as is the problem in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, the solution is now overdue and the longer we recoil from the task of facing it the more grievous the problem will become.</P>
      <P>It is a source of some surprise to me that under subhead (2) there has been more slaughtering of cattle than are clinically affected with T.B. I should have thought that with the scheme in operation for six years, the incidence of clinical T.B. as defined by the Act would become more and more infrequently encountered. Why anyone should keep a cow until it manifests clinical T.B. in accordance with the present Act is a mystery to me, when he could, by getting the cow tested to establish it as a reactor, get his market value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  And these will be perhaps dry cattle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  That same question puzzled me too.  I worked that out.  That was the only explanation I could find for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it argues all the more for pushing on with the bovine T.B. scheme so that in every county we should be able to arrange that any reactors that exist be eliminated before they become clinical cases of T.B. because as the Minister knows clinical cases are a public menace, not only to the farmer's own herd but to other cattle on adjoining farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead F7 makes provision for £34,110 by way of additional grants to University Colleges.  The Minister has said that the output of graduates in Agricultural Science has increased considerably in recent times.  Who is going to employ them?  I put it to this House: outside Bedlam is there any sense or meaning in our educating a steadily increasing number of agricultral graduates and shipping them to Rhodesia, to Canada and various places when it is notorious that in many parts of the country our advisory <Col N="1087" /> services are grossly inadequate for want of personnel and that it is quite impossible in many parts of the country to get the local authority, who happens to be the local county committee of agriculture, to employ a sufficient number of graduates whom we are educating at great cost, to benefit the farmers of the country? Their advice was never more urgently needed than it is at the present time.</P>
    <P>I am almost afraid to mention a matter of this kind in Dáil Éireann or anywhere else because bitter experience is beginning to teach me that I have only to mention the necessity for reform in the educational system of the country when I have the Minister for Education getting up and saying he is going to reform it; I have only to mention the need for intergration with Britain and the next morning the Taoiseach is in Britain trying to get an agreement&mdash;and failing.  I venture to suggest that if I now press upon the Minister for the establishment of advisory services, long before the next general election he will have established them.  Even at the great risk to myself of seeing Fine Gael policy implemented by Fianna Fáil, I do press upon him that it is the most urgent problem we have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a safe risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I rejoice.  I stand for the proposal that all these graduates should be kept at home and used for the benefit of the farmers of this country in the inestimable services that the Department of Agriculture could place at their disposal if they got the chance.  I take it the Minister's attitude is that the wider we export, the wider area our sowing will cover.  I say we should sow our own fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give my own view on that which is slightly different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it rejoices my heart that at last I have found an issue on which Fianna Fáil is not prepared to gallop away the morning after I mention it.  I have no doubt that the Department of Agriculture could treble, quadruple, the value of <Col N="1088" /> all the knowledge and all the inestimable wealth of assistance that is available in that Department to those farmers if they had at their disposal an effective advisory service and if these young graduates were enabled to get a living at home doing work of incalculable value which they would gladly take at one-half the salary that countries all over the world are willing and eager to pay, to work for the people.</P>
      <P>I take it that the provision made for Foras Talúntais is simply a bookkeeping entry.  We are taking it off the Department itself and handing it over to Foras Talúntais and that of course is the inevitable and necessary consequence of transferring certain activities of the Department to Foras Talúntais.  I cannot allow it to pass though, without reiterating something I took the satisfaction of saying in this House before.  I hope that when Foras Talúntais, as at present constituted with all its informed critics, took over from the Department of Agriculture these institutions like Johnstown, the pest experimental station and Clonsast, and saw what they had got, they made a soft retreat &mdash;I mean a retreat for reflection and examination of conscience&mdash;and asked themselves who built these establishments up to the state in which they were on the day they were transferred because they then might remember that it was the much despised Department of Agriculture who built these institutions up from the ground. They were the admiration of the world, I have no hesitation in saying; Johnstown certainly was.  They handed them over to Foras Talúntais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that in the years that lie ahead Foras Talúntais will do half as much with them as the Department of Agriculture did when they were there under its responsibility.  I thought that was particularly illustrated when the present Chairman of Foras Talúntais so kindly invited me to attend on the occasion of the handing over of the Glenamoy station by the Minister for Agriculture.  On that occasion I was constrained to reply thanking him for his courtesy in extending that invitation to me but inasmuch as I gathered that this was to be the inauguration of the peatland <Col N="1089" /> research station at Glenamoy I did not think it was appropriate that I should attend as I had twice already inspected it in operation as Minister for Agriculture.  I mention that only to emphasise again that I confidently hope Foras Talúntais will make similar good use of the splendid resources handed over to them and which were and are the fruits of the labours of the incomparable personnel of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I come now to subhead M. 7.  Perhaps I should be forgiven for throwing my mind back a few years to the day when we first inaugurated the land rehabilitation project in this House and the howls of Fianna Fáil that this was a scheme calculated to raise everyone's valuation.  So you remember that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then when that cock would not fight, the second Fianna Fáil allegation was that nobody but a lunatic would have his land resting on pipes.  When that cock would not fight they made up their minds that they had better get in on the band wagon themselves. All the Fianna Fáil farmers came in feeling fully confident that all the wrath of the Department, as administered by me, would be visited upon them.  They were shocked to discover that they were all taken in strict order and it is an unquestionable fact that under our administration everyone was taken in his turn without any inquiries being made as to how he had voted in the previous election.  That went on. The late Mr. Thomas Walsh, God rest him, kept it going and it is a distinct source of exasperation to the Fianna Fáil Party that the people have obstinately refused to dissociate the Land Reclamation Project from the inter-Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister announced his intention of wiping out section B without notice.  It was wrong to wipe out section B.  It has done very valuable work, work that could not be done under any other part of the project. Of course there were mistakes made.  I found, when I came back to office in 1954, that the Department was buried in a particular farm into which they <Col N="1090" /> should never have gone.  It appeared that an officer of the project who, I understand, is no longer with the Department, had made a mistake in signing contracts which bound the Department to carry out extensive drainage on a farm situated very extensively on rock.  The plain truth was that the Department could not get out of its undertaking and sustained tremendous loss.</P>
    <P>That would have happened whatever Minister for Agriculture was in office. There was no degree of care and supervision which would avoid isolated incidents of that sort.  That case has been trotted out in this House time and again as being typical of what happened under section B.  That is a gross distortion of the facts.  It happened once as far as I know and there may have been one or two other cases but when you realise the hundreds of thousands of farms where excellent work was done you can see that it was a great mistake to have suspended the operation of section B and I hope that some day we will be able to re-establish it on the basis on which it was inaugurated.</P>
    <P>There was a further gross inequity in the Minister's decision to wind it up without notice.  I know three brothers in a certain part of this country who had gone to England on public works and they saved between them between £3,000 and £4,000.  They came home and set up as contractors under the Land Rehabilitation Project and invested their entire capital in machinery to carry out contract work under section B.  In that part of the country you cannot get individual farmers to hire machinery.  They are not used to it and they know nothing about it.</P>
    <P>These three fellows were making a good income.  They worked hard and were doing well.  They were hard working fellows who had not to pay people because they were skilled in the use and management of machinery of that kind.  If they had got 12 months' notice of the suspension of section B, they could have got out of that machinery and sold it to the local authorities or somebody else. Instead, they were suddenly faced <Col N="1091" /> with the decision out of the blue. Two of those brothers have gone back to England to labouring jobs and the machinery is still on their premises, deteriorating.  Every penny of their savings is gone.</P>
    <P>I believe that that state of affairs was reproduced in many parts of the country.  That was done simply and solely as a result of the irresponsibility of the present Minister.  It could not have done any harm if 12 months' notice had been given and it would have saved infinite suffering to people who had made heavy investments at the request and with the encouragement of the Minister for Agriculture for the time being.</P>
    <P>Every Minister for Agriculture in this House is entitled to get from the people the fullest measure of co-operation but if there is a perennial feeling amongst the people that the instructions of one Minister are to be repudiated out of hand by his successor you will not get that measure of co-operation.  I am not implying that there never can be a change of policy.  That is obviously absurd, but what I am saying is that if one Government succeeding another Government decides there should be a change of policy, careful regard should be held to individuals who have made heavy commitments on foot of the previous Minister's policy and due regard should be had to any consequential losses that may accrue to them as a result of the incoming Minister's decision to change that policy.  Certainly in respect of this decision which, in my opinion was unsound in itself, great additional and unnecessary harm was done to hard-working individuals who had staked their savings on the belief that if they helped the Minister for Agriculture for the time being they would not be thrown on the refuse heap by his successor. They were bitterly disappointed and it is a grave reflection on the present administration that it was possible for such a thing to happen.</P>
    <P>I come now to the fertiliser business. I direct the attention of the House to the fact that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann imported superphosphate <Col N="1092" /> on a number of occasions. They first imported it in 1950/51.  I was the Minister for Agriculture at the time.  We had authority on that occasion to import 100,000 tons of super from Holland and my recollection is that the price paid for it was £9 per ton.  In fact we secured delivery within the season of 84,000 tons. At the end of the year all that was disposed of except 18,000 tons, and that 18,000 tons had been bought at £9 a ton.</P>
    <P>The price of super went up the following year to something like £24 a ton.  In any sanely operated establishment the 18,000 tons which had been brought in at £9 a ton would then have been worth twice what it cost to buy it under the new circumstances. But my successor, doing what he thought was the wisest thing, bought an additional 40,000 tons in the following year for which I think he paid over £20 a ton and, of course, he could not sell it.  As a result of that transaction we are now called upon to find a sum of £469,549 to recoup the loss as a result of that purchase of 40,000 tons.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of mixing up the 18,000 tons which cost £9 a ton. as far as I recollect, and which was left over from the 84,000 tons purchased in 1950/51, with the 40,000 purchased in 1951/52 at at least twice the price paid in the previous year? It is wrong to suggest the inter-Party administration were in some way responsible for a part of this loss.  I do not think it was.  I think all the 84,000 tons of superphosphate could have been marketed, some at a modest price and some at a very large profit, the latter being the 18,000 tons which were held over from 1951 to 1952.  The purchase of 40,000 tons at the inflated price that obtained in that year was ill-advised but I hasten to say that hind-sight is always better than foresight.</P>
    <P>I do not know what I should have done if I were Minister for Agriculture at that time.  It is true that at that time there was an acute shortage of superphosphate.  It was urgently necessary to bring it in.  Nobody would bring it in and I look back with <Col N="1093" /> satisfaction on the fact that when I got the opportunity of bringing in 100,000 tons I asked the Minister for Finance could I have £1 million wherewith to do it; he said: &ldquo;Yes, you may.&rdquo;  Unless my memory deceives me I remember the representatives of the Dutch combine being in my office and making me the offer in the confident belief I would not be allowed to accept, and getting a rude shock when I accepted it there and then, because the Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, was a man of vision and understood the situation.</P>
    <P>The purchase of superphosphate the following year was not, in my opinion, a wise decision but I hasten to add that I do not entirely criticise the then Minister for Agriculture, the late Mr. Tom Walsh.  His judgment was influenced by the fact that there was this acute shortage and the important thing was to get in plenty of it and send it out.  He failed to sell it and as it lay in store it became progressively difficult to dispose of it.  However, although one can be too rash in a matter of this kind, I think a Minister who takes his courage in his hands and does what he believes to be right even though sometimes it turns out wrong, is deserving of more praise from this House than the kind of Minister who is so cautious that he never does anything. Therefore, although this was a costly transaction I have no doubt everybody learned by the experience, and if a mistake was made I am prepared to say it was made in the right direction.  Anyone can make a mistake of that kind once and I am satisfied the same kind of mistake is unlikely to be made again.</P>
    <P>I have no complaint to make, therefore, in regard to that subhead of the Vote except I cannot fully understand Why the 18,000 tons bought at £9 a ton are brought in as being partly responsible for the loss when in fact the profit realised on the ultimate disposal must have operated to minimise the loss which was sustained on the 40,000 tons brought in the following year.</P>
    <P>There is one odd feature I do not fully understand and which the Minister's statement has not clarified for <Col N="1094" /> me.  If the Minister will look at subhead S he will see that losses are estimated at £469,549.  If you then look at the appropriations-in-aid you will see the figure for receipts in respect of amount provided under subhead S is £496,549.  Is this just a double entry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That covers that.  I would have been interested if somewhere we had details of the savings on the other subheads.  The Minister in his statement gave us no further enlightenment.  As a partial offset to the additional expenditure involved in the subheads mentioned there are savings on other subheads estimated at £1,525,849.  Bearing in mind the original estimate amounted only to £2,384,000, subsequently revised to £4,831,000, it is a bit offhand to tell us that the extra charge is reduced by savings of £1,525,849 on an original Estimate of £2,384,355.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is.  I can well imagine the proceedings that went on paring a bit off here and a bit off there, but I do not think it unreasonable to ask the Minister to tell us where there was a saving in excess of £10,000 on a subhead.  He should tell us the subhead on which the saving was made because it should be of interest to the House to know what other services had to suffer at the <Col N="1095" /> instance of the Department of Finance in order to effect this saving so as to reduce the Supplementary Estimate as I mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will find that at the end of the financial year there were rarely savings on any vote amounting, as in this case, to more than half of the original estimate.  Come now, I should not mind a saving, owing to incapacity to spend, of ten per cent. of the original Estimate but when a Minister rambles in and says that the explanation of the savings on his vote is that he was not able to spend half of the original Estimate he will not complain if responsible members of the Opposition raise an eyebrow and say: &ldquo;We would like to know where and how these extensive savings were made.&rdquo;  Subject to these comments, I wish the Minister luck in his bovine T.B. eradication drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said so much, I want to add that I feel I am bound in duty to say, and I mean no personal offence by it, that I think the Minister is a grossly incompetent Minister for Agriculture. If he succeeds, luck must play a large part in the success that attends his efforts.  I think if he can put his foot in it anywhere from horses to pigs you may depend on its being put into it, <Col N="1096" /> a size 12 boot with nails in it.  That is all right if it only affects the Minister for Agriculture but when his incompetence seriously prejudices the vital interests of our agricultural industry and of the country itself, that is another story.  I do not think the Minister ought to be where he is.  He was much happier in Local Government or anywhere else.  I know why, probably, they reconciled themselves to the horror of putting him back where he is&mdash;because Deputy Blaney dirtied his bib in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and they had to get rid of him out of that Department and they had to put him somewhere else or get rid of him altogether.  They could not leave him <i>in vacuo.</i></P>

The present Minister had to evacuate and some hole or corner had to be found to accommodate him and he was sent back to a post he was not deemed worthy to fill when the Government was first constituted. I think that has been a misfortune and we are paying for that unfortunate mistake now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not be honest if I did not say that much because I want the Minister to know quite clearly my belief in that regard, but however incompetent he may be in my judgment, he is Minister for Agriculture, of our Government&mdash;the present Government is our Government, the Government of our people freely chosen by the Oireachtas of which we are Members&mdash;and in that capacity because it is his responsibility to do national work of vital importance, I <Col N="1097" /> offer him in his work for the eradication of bovine T.B. the wholehearted support of this Opposition and our best wishes for the success of his endeavours.  I would urge him to recall that it is important in addition to doing his best to take good advice especially when he is opening his mouth in public or in circumstances which are liable subsequently to be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say that sometime during the coming year the western areas would be accredited or attested but I would like him to be more specific and tell us when.  My reason is purely selfish from the point of view of the west.  I know the Minister is quite well aware of the disastrous situation that has arisen in regard to store cattle and which, rightly or wrongly, is attributed to the T.B. eradication scheme which is blamed for freezing the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Government in the past has requested farmers to increase production. They have done so and figures released by the Central Statistics Office in regard to the number of livestock in the country have borne out that fact.  There has been a very substantial increase in production of livestock but the farmers are beginning to get very sour in many areas.  In the South, where milk production is one of the principal activities, they find more production pays less.  In the West we are beginning to find the same thing&mdash; that when we produce more cattle all that happens is that they are left on our hands.  I am sure it is within the competence of the Minister and the Government to do something about it especially when it is considered that the farmers have responded magnificently to the call of the present Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Dillon, who started the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.  The farmers have responded very well and the abuses, I think, are negligible.  As Deputy Dillon said, much of the talk about abuses was just a storm in a teacup.  One isolated case may give rise to rumours that spread all over the West of Ireland creating the impression that <Col N="1098" /> everybody in the West is involved.  On the contrary, I am glad to say that abuses were not substantial in number, and I think they are very few or non-existent to-day.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister that one of the big questions at present is the full accreditation of the Western areas from the point of view of the store cattle trade.  At present fields all over Connaught are filled with the very best store cattle and they cannot be sold or even given away.  Arising out of that I want to ask the Minister when the area West of the Shannon is accredited, and if British buyers of store cattle come over as they have always done up to now, has the Department any special arrangements made for the transportation of these store cattle across to England?  I think some special arrangement would have to be made seeing that the rest of the country through which they will travel, if they are going by train, is not accredited to safeguard them as the British regulations demand.</P>
    <P>The same applies to shipping.  Has the Department made arrangements, or is it possible for them to do so, to have direct shipping from western ports for green-tag cattle to the English ports?  These are very important questions and I would like the Minister when replying to say what exactly the future will hold.  He has asked for the co-operation of farmers and I know he is getting that co-operation very wholeheartedly in the wiping out of T.B. Leaving out Counties Sligo and Clare because they had the start on us by some years, the other counties, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Donegal, did not start so soon and it is certainly very encouraging to hear that we are so far ahead as to stand a good chance of being accredited this year.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to item 24. Appropriations-in-Aid, receipts from cattle slaughtered under the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme, £2,130,000.  I am sure the Minister has the figures.  For my own information I should like if he would tell me what number of cattle that sum covers and if he would have a segregation as between store cattle and, let us say, <Col N="1099" /> cows and heifers?  What did the Department pay for the cattle for which they received, from the canning factories I presume, £2,130,000? What I would like to know, and what most Deputies would like to know, is what is the loss to the taxpayer under this scheme.  While it is costing a lot of money I have a suspicion that the Department are not losing a whole lot on the purchase and resale of these reactor cattle.</P>
    <P>Most people I have met grumble and say that while they are willing to help the Department in getting rid of the reactors, the Department's buyers give very unsatisfactory prices even taking into account that the prices at fairs and markets are unsatisfactory. However, I do not blame the Department's buyers for buying the reactors as cheaply as possible, but I submit that if they do so they should not take advantage of the willingness of the farmers to get rid of reactors.  It is well known that some farmers have too much of a fear of a reactor beast in their place at all.  Perhaps the Minister would give us an idea of what these reactor cattle cost.  That would satisfy a lot of people who felt they did not get a fair price for their reactors from the Department's buyers.</P>
    <P>A circular on bovine T.B. was sent out recently to practically every farmer.  It was a very useful circular and was applauded by everybody to whom I spoke.  Those responsible for it certainly deserve a word of credit.  Very often we are inclined to criticise civil servants and it is only right that when a good job of work is done they should equally get the credit for it.</P>
    <P>I want to impress upon the Minister that the sale of cattle is practically frozen.  I am sure the Minister for Finance knows all about that by this time.  Things are in a very serious state because people cannot sell their cattle.  The Bovine T.B. Scheme is blamed for that.  Whether the cause is that the British will not buy our store cattle because of a doubt as to whether we are clear or not, I do not know.  I suppose that is a contributory factor.  Buyers in other parts of <Col N="1100" /> the country who are accustomed to buying our store cattle west of the Shannon are, I suppose, a bit scared until they know the area is accredited and they can buy safely.  As far as I can see, the truth of the matter is that the whole of the western area is now practically clear of bovine T.B., as much as ever it will be.  Of course, exceptional cases of an outbreak of bovine T.B. will occur from time to time.  In any event, some people in the West are very badly hit at present. The sheep farmers were severely hit last year, and most farmers there do a little in both cattle and sheep.  Sheep improved slightly during the Winter but cattle have frozen completely.  If the Minister could do anything to remedy that position, he would be doing something very necessary at present.</P>
    <P>I want to say something now on the Land Rehabilitation Scheme.  Is there any hope of re-establishing, even to a limited extent, the section B scheme? The Minister will probably tell me that the Department have sold all their machinery.  One of his predecessors in the Fianna Fáil Government did what he was perfectly entitled to do: he arrived at the decision himself, he did not have to come to the House for permission or even acquaint the House that he was going to terminate the B scheme and sell the machinery purchased by his predecessor, Deputy Dillon, who started the scheme.</P>
    <P>That B scheme did a vast amount of useful work&mdash;work that could not be done under any other scheme and is not being done to-day.  I do not want to make an issue of the matter but I want to impress on the Minister that if the B scheme could be reinaugurated, even at the cost of buying some new machinery, it would be well worth while.  At present everybody has to fall back on the A scheme where they undertake the work themselves or get a private contractor to do it.  Many small farmers&mdash;and I believe these are the people to whom the scheme should apply&mdash;have not the capital or the dry cash left aside to enable them to do it. The Minister for Lands, who is in charge of the Land Commission, has <Col N="1101" /> to come to the rescue of some of the smallholders by giving them additional land.  But a sizeable portion of the smallholders at present have land which could be brought into first class condition if they could get the benefit of the Land Reclamation Scheme.  In that way the Minister could help them out at much less cost to the State.</P>
    <P>The decision to terminate the B Scheme was a disastrous one.  I do not know what was the cause of it and I shall not hazard a guess.  It was a mistake.  Whoever advised it gave very foolish advice indeed.  It was a much more useful section than section A.  It may be contended that the Department were relieved of a certain amount of administration because the B scheme involved a good deal of difficulty.  At the present time the whole responsibility is thrown on top of the farmer who is contracting to get the work done.  That is all nice and easy for the Department but it absolutely removes the bottom from the whole basis of the Land Project.  The Minister should re-establish Section B and even if it were on a very limited scale he would be doing a very good job of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long but there is one matter which has always disturbed me in regard to the operations of the T.B. scheme.  That is the fact that a condemned animal is retained by the owner pending collection at owner's risk.  In cases where there is considerable delay between notification on the part of the owner of his desire to have his herd tested and the actual testing, and subsequent considerable delay of some weeks between the condemning of the animal and its collection, and during the latter period the animal dies, I do think it is most unfair that the owner should be deprived of all benefits.  That is particularly true when the number of animals owned by a farmer is small, a situation which occurs particularly in the western counties where the average holding is small and, consequently, the average number of beasts on it is minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the fact <Col N="1102" /> that rumours were circulating regarding traffic in green cattle tags.  I agree with him that if there is anything in these allegations they should be most carefully investigated by the Department, and I would like to say that in the last week I have heard two complaints regarding abuses of that sort in the vicinity of the town in which I reside and that I propose to give such particulars as I have been able to acquire to the Minister for very careful investigation.  I have some grounds for believing that in one case, at least, an abuse of the scheme was attempted if not successfully accomplished.</P>
    <P>I do not hold very much with Deputy Blowick's speech because I think he made the kind which he considers will appear well in the local newspapers next week.  I think it is contemptible to say, or indicate in any way, that the T.B. scheme has an adverse effect on the cattle industry. It is quite wrong of anybody to make that suggestion but it is very contemptible for a member of this House to do so, considering the issues that are at stake.</P>
    <P>The grave problem where the west of Ireland is concerned is the one referred to at the end of the Minister's speech.  That is the problem of the movement of cattle out of a clearance area.  That is a matter which has already been the subject of certain court proceedings but it is my view that the penalties exacted were not severe enough and that the law in respect to the movement of cattle out of a clearance area, or from a non-clearance area into a clearance area, should be tightened up considerably and that, after the western counties are declared accredited&mdash;I think I am using the right word&mdash;the penalties should be very severe indeed.  In that respect I am sure the Department will ask that the Garda give very special attention in the early stages so that punitive fines, and possibly terms of imprisonment, may be imposed on offenders and in that way act as a deterrent to others.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I wish to refer is one which was also raised by previous speakers in reference to Section B of the Land Project. <Col N="1103" /> I should like to say that I was satisfied at the time the decision was made that, from a national point of view, it was the correct decision.  I also felt, and feel more so as time passes by, that it has worked hardship, in particular on some western counties.  In that respect I agree with what Deputy Blowick said, that the small holdings in Mayo and Galway are of a nature which are not very well suited to Section A and that some consideration should be given to a re-introduction, perhaps on an area basis, of Section B.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there are difficulties in that but the plain facts are that the types of land vary enormously from one part of the country to another and the conditions under which people farm also vary to a tremendous extent.  Over the weekend I spent some time in the southern counties, particularly in Co. Limerick, and of course there is no comparison at all between the conditions there and those in the poorer parts of the congested western counties though, fortunately, we have on average a very low rate of T.B. in cattle, much lower than they have in Limerick.  In passing I think the Minister, in time, will have to give special attention to areas where the number of reactors is as high as two-thirds.  That, of course, is bound to put a tremendous burden on the farmers themselves because they will lose, even through subsidies, the replacement value of the cattle and per head will probably have to find something in the order of £15 for 40 or 50 cattle in each herd.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to mention these counties except to point out that the conditions of farming there, and the type of land they have, are vastly different from what we have and to support the contention that the Minister might consider reintroducing section B for certain counties, especially because I think the figures prove that since its discontinuance the volume of applications has substantially fallen, particularly in north Galway and Mayo.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's information and my records are different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to argue with the Minister; I am merely putting a point of view.  If the Minister can prove to me that the areas I am talking about&mdash;north Galway and the poorer parts of Mayo&mdash;have been able to keep up the impetus of the land reclamation scheme since Section B was discontinued, I will be prepared to swallow my words but I am not prepared to accept national records because the type of farms differs in other parts of the country from what they are in the parts to which I refer, and which I mentioned in the course of my speech.</P>
      <P>As I say, I am prepared to be proved wrong and I merely raised this question because I believe from my interpretation of the figures, and the information I have been given locally, that the discontinuance of section B, while being a proper decision from a national point of view, was a decision which worked hardship on certain areas in the west of Ireland and that the Minister, therefore, if he is satisfied, and only if he is satisfied that what I am saying is substantially accurate, might consider reintroducing that section for limited parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much if the Minister got in any way annoyed.  I am merely saying what is the result of my observations, of my discussions with the farmers and other people involved in the administration of the scheme, and something which I feel bound I ought to convey to the Minister publicly. I would welcome a statement from him on this, more particularly because of the way in which Deputy <Col N="1105" /> Dillon misrepresented the Minister's motives for his original decision and, for that matter, misrepresented the position under this scheme which was responsible for the Minister's decision in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The leader of the Opposition has made it quite clear that the Fine Gael Party fully support the provision of money for the purpose of eliminating bovine tuberculosis but many people believe that we are not getting value for the money that is being spent.  Farmers are hesitant and doubtful about availing of this scheme, one of the reasons being the uncertainty that has prevailed in the cattle trade in the last twelve months.</P>
      <P>I have called at the Department of Agriculture in regard to this matter and have been assured repeatedly that everything is all right, that the prices are as good as, if not better than, they were last year and that they are certainly better than they were the year before.</P>
      <P>The fact is that farmers who have attended marts and fairs in the last six months have been unable to sell their cattle.  That led to doubt and uncertainty.  I have seen cattle that passed the 14 day test being put up for sale shortly before other cattle which were not attested and the price differential was very small.  That caused farmers to ask themselves the question, if they went to the expense and trouble of having their cattle attested, would they be suitably remunerated for it.  The Minister ought to be able to make a statement to the House which would reassure the people concerned that there is some certainty of being able to dispose of such stock in the future.</P>
      <P>Another factor which affects the eradication scheme is that statements have been issued recently by experts in agricultural journals to the effect that British farmers have been perfecting dual pregnancy in cattle, by which a vast amount of their store requirements can be produced in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement by the Minister would help to remove the doubts that exist <Col N="1106" /> with regard to the sale of cattle. Farmers must be assured that if they succeed in eradicating tuberculosis, they will certainly sell their cattle, can earn substantial incomes from such sales.  If huge sums of money are spent in order to reserve the store cattle trade, we must be sure that they are not being spent in vain.</P>
    <P>The administration of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme is a matter for the professional section of the Department of Agriculture.  When Deputy Dillon was speaking here this evening the Minister assured him that there was no shortage of veterinary staff.  I think the Minister is perhaps misstating the case there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say such a thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw but that is what I understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I said we had made the same effort and given the same encouragement to all the counties, whether or not they all responded in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That clarifies the issue.  The position is that the Minister is short of veterinary staff.  Until he has the requisite veterinary staff he will not be able to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.  A scheme like this, for which we are voting large sums of money, requires supervision.  The major part of the work will have to be carried out by veterinary surgeons in private practice but there must be supervision from the Department in order to ensure that there will be a cohesive and practical scheme.  For that purpose, the Minister must have a skilled veterinary staff.  The salaries provided must be sufficient to attract veterinary surgeons. Since the inception of the scheme here, the incomes of veterinary surgeons have increased and their services are in constant demand. Veterinary surgeons cannot be expected to enter the Government service unless they are adequately remunerated. I understand that any difficulties that existed between the Minister and veterinary surgeons have been solved.  The Minister should employ <Col N="1107" /> a bigger veterinary staff and give it a much bigger say in the administration of this scheme.  In that way he will get better results.  A highly specialist scheme such as this cannot be administered by an enormous staff.  The Minister should create a small subcommittee within his Department, to be responsible to him for administering the scheme effectively and efficiently throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I may be wrong but from my contacts as a Deputy with the Department of Agriculture I am under the impression that in regard to many facets of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme there is considerable overlapping, that there are huge unnecessary files, that there is a great deal of unnecessary administrative work.  If the Minister wants to complete the scheme in a hurry, the further he gets from the Departmental mentality and all the administrative details connected with it, the better.</P>
      <P>With regard to the testing of herds in various counties there are delays which, of course, are due to lack of veterinary staff.  The herd testing scheme was initiated in Wexford a long time ago and there are literally hundreds of herds waiting to be tested. Repeated applications have been made. I have made applications on behalf of herd owners.  There is no certainty as to when the herds can be tested.  That boils down again to lack of veterinary supervision from the Department, though the West, and the other counties, Cavan, the Minister's own county and Monaghan, I am glad to hear, will soon be free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, notwithstanding all the money spent and the emergency facing us now, if we are to maintain our store trade I think that the scheme is not going ahead as fast as it should. I consider the staff&mdash;these are the buyers that are dealing with the reactors&mdash;must be inadequate, anyway in the part of the country in which I live.  That would include the country along the east coast as a whole because I think it is all administered from the one centre; it is administered as far as I know from Waterford.  I consider <Col N="1108" /> that there are not sufficient buyers to go round and buy in these reactors.  I am not saying anything against the price because, taking it by and large, the price offered in comparison with the competitive prices that exist now on the open market has been in the main pretty satisfactory.  But I do know certain cases, three or four cases, in which people have been waiting having had their herds tested.  Having had the second test done, they have been waiting for periods like three to four months to have their reactors bought.</P>
    <P>That is not a proper administration of the scheme.  I do not know who is responsible but I do know that the only person who can put it right is the Minister for Agriculture.  I ask him to accept those statements as facts of which I am personally cognisant in my own area.  The difficulty that I see is that it is impossible in counties that are not attested areas to get rid of the infection.  We get our herds tested and we can have our reactors bought; that is true.  We can have them bought out of our herds but what are we to do with the rest of our tested stock&mdash;the dry stock, bullocks of varying ages, two to three years or whatever they may be?  If we take them out and sell them&mdash;I am dealing entirely with stock that are stores&mdash;are we not, in effect, only passing them over the ditch and pushing them on to the next farm? It seems to me if we are to eradicate bovine tuberculosis, if we ever hope to do it effectively to the point where we would have the same system applying to the whole of Ireland, as applies at present to the attested areas, I say it cannot be done the way you are doing it.  Possibly there may be some change as a result of the new scheme that the Department are now considering introducing and I believe have introduced in some cases, a system about which many people know nothing.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would do well to advertise this scheme on a greater scale.  It is a system of farm attesting, under which fields are cleared for a month and are then considered attested areas.  If a farm is big enough the farmer can divide his stock into halves; he can then have one <Col N="1109" /> half attested and gradually eliminate any stock that does not pass the test, passing later to the other half.  I understand in that case the Department are willing, after the second 14-day test, to buy reactor stock whether of the herd or the ordinary dry stock.  That is a scheme that commends itself to me but I do not think the majority of farmers know anything about that scheme.  I do not think there is sufficient advertising to the public as a whole that such a scheme is in existence and that brings us back again to the question of agricultural advisers. If we had enough agricultural advisers, if those agricultural advisers could be, as Deputy Dillon believes they should be, stationed practically in every parish; if they could go round to the people giving lectures and interviews and discussing these things with the farmers as a whole; if they could make it clear to them that such a scheme does exist, I think that would be the road to the eradication of bevine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>Before I leave that subject I want to say that until such time as there is security of trade for the sale of livestock in this country, any scheme will fail so whether the Government are in a position to improve the trade or not I do not know.  We do not know what is going on in these negotiations but I feel that the Minister for Agriculture should put it to his counterpart or to whomsoever he has discussions with in the United Kingdom that this is of paramount importance, that if the British want to continue getting store cattle from Ireland, if they want to get tuberculosis-free cattle from him, they have to guarantee that they will buy those cattle over a long period.  If they do that, I think it will go a long way towards helping to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>A word on the land reclamation scheme.  I agree with what all the other speakers have said about the abolition of Project B.  I think it was a disastrous thing and that it caused tremendous hardship.  The case Deputy Dillon mentioned this afternoon of three people putting their life savings into this scheme, of later losing their employment and having to emigrate, <Col N="1110" /> is only parallel with many other cases. I think, apart from everything else, it imposed a hardship on the small farmers who were largely depending on that scheme.  I think it worked well and was a satisfactory scheme; the Minister would be well advised to reconsider it.  He said himself, intervening when Deputy Seán Flanagan was speaking, that there were only about 2,000 cases in the whole of Ireland. If there were only 2,000 cases in the whole of Ireland, was it worth wrecking a scheme when it could easily have been carried out?</P>

      <P>I am continually going to the Land Reclamation Office.  While the scheme may be going ahead in other counties&mdash;I am not qualified to speak for them but I am qualified to speak for my own county&mdash;the scheme is not going ahead in Wexford.

      <P>I think that the principal thing we are concerned with in this Estimate is the eradication of bovine T.B. I should like to see the Estimate trebled in this respect if I thought that a good job was going to be done.  However, I think the greatest mistake is being made in the dairying counties.  We have had a very good leaflet issued by the Department showing the danger of a farmer retaining those cattle in his possession. It showed very clearly the manner in which the infection is passed from those cattle but I think it is ridiculous to have half a dozen borders in this country as far as this matter is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that in County Cork the scheme is being worked very well indeed and I cannot express too highly my appreciation of the work of the officer in charge, Mr. Gilmore.  However, it is unfair that in a county like <Col N="1112" /> Cork a man like that, in charge of this scheme, should have to give two days in the week to other duties.  That is ridiculous and wrong.</P>
    <P>Then you have the position as regards what you call store cattle.  In some counties, if a bullock or a store beast goes down with T.B. it is compensated for and cleared out.  But the farmer in Cork and the dairying counties has to keep his bullock and endeavour to fatten it and sell it as best he can.  It is hard to put meat on a T.B. animal.  That results in a store beast remaining on a farm and spreading infection.  If we are to deal with this problem at all let us deal with it straightaway and get done with it.  Let us not have one law for Wexford, another for Cork, another for Waterford and another for the West of Ireland.  Let us deal with it from the point of view that if the Department are correct in issuing the leaflet they have issued in regard to the spread of infection by keeping a T.B. animal on the land, and from my experience they are correct, they should come along and compensate for the bullock and the store animal and get rid of them at the same time that they are getting rid of the cows. Let us make one shot at it.</P>
    <P>If a farmer finds that a couple of store cattle go down in a test, they are left on his hands.  There is no way of disposing of them; they are reactor cattle and they remain on his land.  The next time he has a test he finds that a couple of his cows go down owing to being infected by the reactor animals. We should have realism in this matter. An Estimate of £8,700,000 ought to bring home to everybody the enormous cost of this scheme.  If we are to approach it from that point of view, let us not leave on every farm infected beasts to carry on the disease after we have cleared the cows.</P>
    <P>I was amused when I heard Deputy Blowick complain of the bad prices paid by the valuers.  We experienced the same thing in Cork and we produced a scheme, through the kindness of the Minister, whereby the animal is sold and the Department pays the farmer £15 in compensation in addition to what he got for the animal.  I was surprised to find that in the last <Col N="1113" /> month in which the old scheme was in operation there was a rush of people to have the Department's valuer come in and do the job.  These people wanted the old scheme instead of the new one and a number of people still complain and seek to have the old scheme restored.</P>
    <P>I happen to be a member of the eradication committee in Cork and I saw what was happening there.  At every meeting you had delegates making complaints about the prices being paid by the valuer and when you got your list you found that the valuer was paying something from £15 to £22 over the value of the animal.  The two arguments could not be right so we came to the decision that the farmer should sell his beast for the best he could and let the Government take on there.</P>
    <P>I do not know how far the Department have investigated the question of the replacement of cows that have to be slaughtered.  I suggest to the Minister that this is a matter to which he should give very careful attention and I think that the Minister is on the generous side in the manner in which he is treating this question of bovine T.B. If a man has fourteen cattle, and ten cows go down under the test, he sells them for what he can get and then gets, in addition, £15 each for his reactors. There is a 60 day test and the other four or, in some cases, the other two are tested.  Again he gets £8 apiece.  He has already got £15, so that is £23 apiece from the State.  That is good compensation and I do not think any man has grounds for complaint.</P>
    <P>He has the price of his animal and he is entitled to £23.  I have seen it tried out by a few people up to now and I can say they had to add very little, if anything, to that to buy a heifer.  There seems to be a widespread dread that replacements may not be available and if the Minister could reassure the people in that respect it would speed up the clearance of reactor cattle.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to send somebody to help Mr. Gilmore in his duties in Cork.  At least one veterinary officer in charge of the <Col N="1114" /> whole county of Cork for bovine T.B. eradication should be a wholetime officer.  I cannot find words to express the appreciation of the committee in general of the manner in which Mr. Gilmore is carrying out his duties.  He has given some of us a far different impression of the Department of Agriculture from what we had.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the major question and that is the reason I am devoting my attention to it.  There is an additional sum of £5,284,000.  I am aware many people think that is only a bagatelle at the present day.  However, tied up in this Estimate is the whole future of our cattle trade.  I have endeavoured from time to time here to point out the foolishness of the Department and to indicate where they were wrong.  I cannot understand the Department clearing, for instance, Cork County and the Port of Cork. <Col N="1115" /> Where are the attested cattle to go now to be shipped?  We have about 80 farmers already clearing out cattle for attestation in Cork, and they are going ahead to finish the job.  I consider that fairly satisfactory.  Nevertheless I would set a limit to the period of clearing out reactors by the farmers. I think nine months is a reasonable period.  If there is a cow in full milk which has reacted it should be given a period in which the milking season would finish.  There is no use in spending £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 and at the same time having the danger of losing our cattle trade.  We must have some assurance in order to be able to carry on with confidence.</P>
      <P>That is my only anxiety in regard to this Estimate.  Deputies have been talking about the land project and how the different schemes under it have been worked.  As far as my constituency is concerned I can say the project is working satisfactorily.  I have not heard of the delays Deputy Esmonde complained of.  I do not think there is any farmer in Cork who applied who did not have an inspector down at least within a fortnight or three weeks.  As a matter of fact it is the one scheme in which great satisfaction is being given by the officials concerned.  I see no ground for complaints.</P>
      <P>Again I appeal to the Minister to consider the position of a farmer who has four or five cows which go down under the test, who also has a couple of store cattle which go down, and who, whether he likes it or not, is compelled to keep on these store cattle. I suggest it is time the scheme that applies in the west should also apply in the east.  Those cattle should be taken away and compensated for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be quite easy to vote large sums of money here but it does not seem to be so easy to spend the money wisely and to the best advantage of those who should benefit.  Unfortunately, the farmers do not always get the benefit of money which is intended for them.  That happens particularly in regard to the £15 bonus which dairy farmers in the southern areas were to get when the <Col N="1116" /> scheme started last October, because no sooner was the scheme put into operation in those counties than the price of reactor cows dropped at least £15 with the result that the position was no better after the introduction of the new scheme.  The result was that large numbers of reactors were taken back from the fairs and the marts to the byres of the farmers because of the uneconomic price offered last October, November and December.</P>
      <P>It may be a good thing that those cows are still there because some of them are now calving and producing calves which will be exported at some time.  They will also produce another season's milk but it will postpone the day for the eradication of bovine T.B. It was regrettable that such a thing should have been allowed to happen at that time and I think the Minister should ensure in future that when a scheme is put forward for the benefit of the farmers that the farmers will, in fact, benefit.  What happened last year slowed up the disposal of reactors but I would not want anybody to say that the farmers are to blame.  They certainly should not be blamed if they had to take back a reactor because of the low price offered.  I have plenty of experience of that in my own area.  The prices offered were shocking and nobody could expect the farmers to accept them for reasonably good animals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are more sure of the thousands we have taken up than the thousands the Deputy speaks about and about which, I suppose. nobody knows anything except for a bit of guess work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not guess work so far as I am concerned.  The cows are still there and only yesterday I heard Mr. Gilmore complaining of the poor co-operation he was getting from farmers, that they were not getting rid <Col N="1117" /> of the reactors quicker.  That is because of the drop in price.  I know prices have improved now but when cows are near calving nobody could expect farmers to sell them.</P>
      <P>As regards store and beef cattle, last Fall I saw where cattle for the canneries and the carcass beef trade went to higher prices than cattle sold for export on the hoof.  For that reason I think the all-important matter at present is to develop that trade as much as possible so that all reactor bullocks can at least be sold to the canning factories at reasonable prices. There was very little difficulty in getting £6 per cwt. for them last fall if they were in fair condition.  You could not do better even on the export market.  It is very important then that foreign markets should be explored by An Coras Tráchtála or other interested bodies, to get an outlet for dressed carcase beef or canned meat because there is no other way of disposing of our reactor bullocks, as far as I can see.</P>
      <P>Good housing for young store cattle is also very important in relation to T.B. eradication.  Most young cattle are born free of T.B. but because of bad housing they often become infected. I strongly urge the Minister to give every encouragement by way of grants for the building of houses for store cattle, especially young cattle, because at that stage they can pick up infection easily.  They are less liable to if well housed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some farmers who went into this scheme of bovine T.B. eradication five years ago have a grievance because they went to all the trouble and expense of getting rid of T.B. at that time.  They claim that they are getting no benefit from the scheme.  They were first in the field in getting rid of T.B. and the people who were slow are now getting all the benefit and encouragement. It would be appreciated if the Minister could see his way to give some compensation to such farmers by way of increased prices for milk from T.B. free herds.  It is not sufficient to encourage the people who have T.B. cattle to get rid of them; it is also necessary to back up the people who in the early stages succeeded in eradicating <Col N="1118" /> T.B. and to give increased milk prices to those who were enterprising and industrious enough to do so.  They were really the pioneers of the movement; they helped in no small way to lay the foundation of good herds and I think that after their labour and expense they are entitled to some recompense.</P>
    <P>Not alone would that give compensation to those who have got rid of T.B. in their cattle but it would also encourage those who are at the stage of being nearly rid of it to finish the job as quickly as possible.  I strongly urge the Minister to hold out that bait to all farmers now nearing completion of the job&mdash;give increased milk prices for milk from T.B. free herds.  If he does that I believe the eradication will be carried out much more quickly than at present.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in his great effort.  It is the most important problem confronting us today.  I believe the Minister will get the full co-operation of all the farmers.  But the farmers will expect common sense to prevail and will expect a fair deal in the matter of disposing of their reactors and of supplying their milk to the creameries when T.B. is eradicated. The attestation of farms is also a very important matter.  I would agree with Deputy Corry that the staff in Cork are not sufficiently large to cater for the present demand.  Sufficient staff must be provided to deal with the amount of work involved in the eradication of bovine T.B. Sometimes I hear farmers saying that if there was a demand for the cattle in the moming, we would hear very little about T.B. The same thing was said when the foot-and-mouth disease was in England, that if there was a demand for the cattle there would be no talk of foot-and-mouth disease.  However, the fact remains that we must supply the customer with what he wants.  I believe the farmer is doing a reasonably good job and I have no doubt but that he will make a reasonably good success of it in the space of a few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amused to hear some of the Deputies opposite express fears about the cattle trade.  A couple of years ago we had them going around telling us that the cattle trade was <Col N="1119" /> finished and thank God.  That is as far as I shall go in that.  I feel you would not allow me to go further, Sir.</P>
      <P>Under subhead F.7, I see here an additional figure of £34,110 for University Colleges.  The amount was voted for the agricultural faculties at U.C.D. and U.C.C.  The figure for Dublin for the current year is £30,000, and the figure for Cork represents an increase of £4,110.  We have passed resolutions in Galway asking for an extension of the agricultural faculty at University College, Galway.  I note that in the amounts before us there is nothing at all for the College in Galway, and I must express my disappointment at that.  There is a demand for an extension of the agricultural faculty at Galway, and the Minister should take up the matter.  We have heard that U.C.D. is completely overcrowded and is bursting at the seams.  The Minister can play his part in meeting the demand from Galway by extending the Faculty of Agriculture, there.  I put it to him that we have in Athenry one of the finest agricultural colleges in the country and that College in conjunction with the University could meet the demand from Galway while not costing a lot of money.</P>
      <P>I must change now to a very different subject and draw the attention of the Minister to the great dissatisfaction in the pig trade in Galway and the west generally.  This dissatisfaction has been caused by a system introduced by the bacon factories known as purchasing on dead weight.  The producer does not know from one fair to another what price he will get.</P>

However, I <Col N="1120" /> should like the Minister to look into them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate deals mainly with the provision of money for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and to meet the demands until the end of the financial year in connection with the Land Rehabilitation Scheme.  I want to take this opportunity of making an observation on both of these very important schemes.  If there is any section of the community seriously feeling the pinch of economic conditions today, it is the agricultural community. Therefore, the Minister for Agriculture is charged with very great responsibility, particularly in regard to the eradication of bovine T.B. In all fairness I want it to go on record that from the experience I have had&mdash; limited and all as it is&mdash;of the Minister's Department, particularly the section dealing with bovine T.B., I have found it efficient in the discharge of its duties and I am satisfied that the officers in charge of that section are capable and competent.  Furthermore, I believe they have a clear understanding of the problems facing the farming community and particularly of the problems facing dairy farmers and the owners of large herds of cattle.  From time to time I have had occasion to get in touch with the Minister's Department in regard to various aspects of this scheme and I am quite satisfied that whenever a farmer or group of farmers had any grievance concerning the purchase of reactors, the Department lost no time in dealing promptly with it.  They are doing a difficult and thankless job in a very satisfactory manner.</P>
      <P>It is most important that this scheme should be completed with the least possible delay.  Deputies on all sides know the importance of the eradication of bovine T.B. For that reason this issue cannot be described as a political issue.  It is absolutely necessary in the interests of the future of our livestock trade, and absolutely necessary in the interests of the health of the agricultural community that this problem should be tackled, and tackled courageously, with every speed and efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> It is true to say that farmers who are participating in this scheme may have suffered loss and may have their own problems, and I am inclined to agree with the observations made by Deputy Wycherley when he referred to the fact that there should be more generous schemes by way of grant to farmers in those areas for proper water supplies and proper housing accommodation for live stock.  I think the time has come when the Minister ought to give consideration to the question of grants to farmers for cow byres, for the provision of water supplies to farm yards, and that the time has come, in view of the increased cost of materials and the increased cost of labour, that there should be a general reorganisation of those schemes.  I would highly recommend to the Minister, in view of the importance of finishing this job with the least possible delay, that those grants be very substantially increased and that a greater measure of financial support be given to farmers as a source of encouragement to them and as an aid to securing their full co-operation.</P>
    <P>When this scheme was started some years ago, a certain number of years was set out in which progress was to be made, and it was emphasised at that time that it was absolutely necessary that the support of every farmer in the country be obtained.  I cannot say that the Party who are now in office as a Government gave that scheme their fullest co-operation and support and, by not doing so, I feel they have added to the difficult task which lies ahead of the farmers.  I also feel that they have made more difficult the job which lies ahead of the present Minister for Agriculture.  They did that by not driving home the importance of this scheme when they had the opportunity of doing so.  In other words, the scheme was practically shelved for a few years.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why it was practically shelved was that it was the inter-Party Government who were responsible for introducing it.  That is one of the great tragedies of this country as far as agriculture is concerned. There is an old legacy of spite which passes on from one Government <Col N="1122" /> to another.  If a Government introduces a scheme which benefits the community, the Government which follows it shows its spite against the Minister who introduced it by sabotaging the scheme, or giving it a rest in which it is surrounded by cobwebs and dust. They say &ldquo;That is a scheme he brought in and we will show him and his supporters that we are not going ahead with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That brings me to the Land Rehabilitation Scheme.  If any of us were to take up a newspaper and read of some continental country that was responsible for introducing a scheme which, over a very short period of time, was responsible for adding an extra million acres of arable land to the land of that country we would be inclined to say that whatever kind of Government they were they had appeared to have their heads screwed on, and that they were progressive.  Any scheme which adds a million acres of arable land to the land of a country is worth a certain amount of recommendation but the Land Reclamation Scheme, introduced by the inter-Party Government, which brought an extraordinary change on the land in rural Ireland has been slowed down.  Any Deputy in the Government Party can see that that scheme has not been carried on with the same drive and force as was the case before Fianna Fáil resumed office.</P>
    <P>It was the intention of the originators of that scheme, and it is the policy of the Fine Gael Party, that that scheme will remain in operation until its full and final purpose has been achieved, until the last acre of land has been reclaimed for the biggest as well as the smallest farmer in the country.  From my own experience I know that a large volume of applications is still coming in from farmers but the usual reply from the Department is that applications are dealt with in strict rotation.  That may be so but nevertheless the amount of work that has been carried on under that scheme in very recent years is not in accordance with the volume of applications coming in from farmers to avail of the facilities offered by it.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that Section B <Col N="1123" /> was discontinued and the reason put forward by the Minister for Agriculture was not one that would carry weight.  I do not know if Deputy Dillon dealt very fully with this matter when he spoke this afternoon.  I expect he did and I expect he made it very clear, not alone to this House but to the farmers of the country, that when the Fine Gael Party resumes Government after the next general election one of the first steps to be taken will be to implement Section B of the Land Scheme so that the Department of Agriculture may undertake work for those farmers who were denied its benefits by the fact that the present Government cancelled it.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture must know quite well that one of the greatest assets to a farmer is to have his land free of flooding, free of rocks, and shrubs, and furze, and all that was done under the scheme.  The farmers readily appreciate the amount of work which the officials of the Department of Agriculture did in connection with that scheme and I would be unjust to myself, and to the Department of Agriculture, if I did not point that out. That was one of the best and most progressive schemes introduced in this country since the State was established and it is a great pity that it did not find more favour with the present Government.  The reason for that is the story I have just told, because it was not brought in by themselves, because they did not think of it themselves, and because of spite for the Government who were responsible for it. They tried to sabotage the scheme and they have been successful in holding up a vast amount of useful and valuable work that could have been carried out under it for the benefit of the farmers.</P>
    <P>Land drainage is of the very greatest importance and when we see the major schemes of drainage that have been undertaken on the Clyde and Dee, the River Brosna, and other main drainage schemes, it is clear that there are sufficient falls to carry water off farm land but it has been my experience that in many cases where joint applications were made by <Col N="1124" /> groups of farmers there has been unreasonable and undue delay in dealing with their applications.  There has, of course, never been any question of delay in dealing with correspondence but there has been great delay in putting the works into operation. Whether that delay has been due to difficulty in obtaining suitable contractors to carry out the work, I cannot say.  Any scheme which would improve the fertility of the soil, which would provide additional land for small holders, is of the greatest possible importance.  It is difficult enough to eke out an existence at present on land that is properly drained, in a high state of cultivation and in good heart.</P>
    <P>The Government would be well advised to change their tune so far as the land rehabilitation scheme is concerned. That scheme has the support of every farmer.  Even the most outstanding supporters of the present Government have admitted publicly that the land rehabilitation scheme was one of the best schemes ever introduced in this country.  Therefore, I am rather disappointed with the amount of money provided in the Estimate for last year and the amount that it is anticipated will be provided in the coming year.  In my opinion, the amount of money so provided is not sufficient for the large volume of work that farmers are anxious to undertake.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to hear from the Minister if his Department have any fixed time by which they hope to complete the land reclamation scheme. There is a large volume of applications that have not yet been dealt with.  I cannot say that in respect of my own constituency.  I can say that schemes which are easy to undertake are the schemes that are carried out and difficult schemes seem to be deferred for consideration.  I would be very glad if steps were taken to expedite work under this scheme.</P>
    <P>There was a time when emigrants who had saved money by their industry and thrift returned to this country and invested their savings in the purchase of machinery.  Land reclamation machinery costs thousands of pounds.  The complete equipment <Col N="1125" /> may cost £7,000.  Many land project contractors have been in a very serious plight as a result of the curtailment of the scheme.  Such contractors were a great asset to the country in providing productive employment.  Land reclamation is important from the point of view of increased fertility of the soil and the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>Farmers generally are under the impression, perhaps correctly, that this Government are not favourably disposed to the land rehabilitation scheme.  I trust that in the Estimates for the coming financial year there will be a vast increase in the provision for that scheme.  The amount of money provided in the Estimate last year was not sufficient.  That may be the reason for this Supplementary Estimate.  If sufficient money had been provided at the commencement of the year, more useful work could have been undertaken.</P>
    <P>I had a number of aspects to deal with concerning the Minister's behaviour.  It is no harm to place on record here that from a Minister for Agriculture, responsible for the land rehabilitation scheme and the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, a little more diplomacy would be welcomed by everybody who has reason to contact his Department.  I do not intend to be personal.  I should not like to be personal on this occasion but everybody knows that the Minister for Agriculture is not noted for his kindliness, hospitality or friendliness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. S. Browne Mr. S. Browne">

      <P>I said I did not want to be personal.  If I were personal, I would have said something.  Farmers who have come in contact with the Minister have not been impressed by the manner in which they were received.  A Minister for Agriculture should have a little more diplomacy when dealing with people in connection with schemes sponsored by his Department.  The N.F.A., Macra na Feirme, land project contractors, associations connected with the Department, do not want to get a slap in the mouth when they offer their co-operation.  There have <Col N="1126" /> been occasions when agricultural organisations and associations that were prepared to help the Minister in implementing schemes provided for in this Supplementary Estimate and in other votes got a slap in the teeth.  I do not propose to elaborate on that matter.  I will have something to say in regard to it on the main Estimate. By having made this observation in regard to the land reclamation scheme I hope and trust that if those in charge of the various organisations which are concerned with the scheme have occasion to approach the Minister they will be received with hospitality.  I know that courtesy is not provided for in this Estimate.  Nevertheless, it is no harm to warn the Minister that he lacks courtesy.</P>

      <P>I am concerned with dairymen in so far as this Supplementary Estimate is concerned.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to a matter which nobody else has mentioned.  My experience is that when a man gets his cows tested, half of them may react.  The best cows generally react and he finds it very hard to part with them.  I want to say at the outset that I do not consider this sum of money anything out of the way for the purpose for which we are to vote it.  It is a big <Col N="1127" /> sum of money by any standard, £5 million, but it is small when we look at the purpose for which we are to vote it&mdash;the saving of the cattle trade, a business worth £50 million a year to the country.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House will support the Minister in this field.  We have no intention of sabotaging the scheme.  We shall ask the farmers to co-operate.  I would only respectfully point out to the Minister that if a farmer has a cow which is registered, a non-pedigree shorthorn say, and he is getting more than one thousand gallons and she reacts, it is a great sacrifice to ask from him to have that cow sold, at a break-up price possibly, plus the Minister's subsidy.  Where a man has been a member of a cowtesting association and his cow is on record as a milker with a yield of from 900 to 1000 gallons, where it is clear that it would be impossible for that man to replace that cow, with the money he is paid, even if he added £30 or £40 to it, I think there should be special consideration for that type of case.  When the cow is a registered animal and the record is shown to be all right, an exception should be made and an increased grant paid.</P>
      <P>Complaint has been made about slowness on the part of the Department in taking up the cows.  I have seen an enormous number of cows that the Department bought going into the various places around Waterford. I have seen the enormous number of cows offered and I must admit it was a rather difficult problem for the Minister and his Department to meet because the more successful the testing scheme, the greater amount of reactors coming on to the market.  I bear with the Minister in that difficulty.  I would ask him to remember the case I mentioned where a man might have an exceptional milker and can show that that cow was an exceptional milker through her being on the Department's register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of pigs, I would say that there is great dissatisfaction amongst farmers whom I know in the matter of the grades they have been getting for some time past.  Even though <Col N="1128" /> curers say there are many fat pigs coming into them, they are penalising the farmers inasmuch as the bacon from these fat pigs is sold over the counter in the country at the top price. When it is sold over the counter in the country at the top price, I do not see why the farmers should not get top price for them.  I have drawn the Minister's attention to that matter on other occasions and I again draw his attention to it now.</P>
    <P>A certain proposition was put up to the Minister.  I asked him to increase the reward to farmers who have attested herds by giving them an increased price for milk.  I think that is a question that would bear re-examination as it would help the scheme.  The great difficulty that the Minister will meet is the overholding of reactors&mdash;not overholding them because farmers are not getting the price for them, but overholding them because if they got rid of them they would have very little milk to send to the creameries or little milk at all for their farms.  These are the problems that have been there and that are showing themselves as the Minister breaks on to a successful conclusion of the scheme. Beyond yea or nay, we must as a nation see to it that this scheme is brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>In the matter of agricultural education and development, a colleague of mine here made the complaint about money not being given to his constituency in the same proportion as it was given to Cork and Dublin. Well, I would not blame any Deputy for fighting here for his constituency. I am not now claiming something for my constituency but I want to draw the Minister's attention to one feature in regard to agricultural education and development.  There are some splendid officers in the Minister's Department: there are some splendid agriculturists attached to the universities and we constantly read of lectures given by experts brought in from other countries here in Dublin, Cork or other centres.  But not enough of these lecturers are brought down the country to reach the ordinary farmers' sons and these boys are anxious to attend agricultural lectures.  I can tell the Minister that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> I happen to be a member of the Vocational Education Committee for the city of Waterford.  We used to have so many lectures a year, and I suggested we should have lectures with an agricultural bias.  Up to that we would have very few people attending there. We might have a lecture on the renaissance in painting and there might be ten or fifteen of an audience.  We then said we would have lectures with an agricultural bias.  The first was on the scientific eradication of weeds and you could not get into the building.  People came from fifteen miles around the city to it.  I want to suggest to the Minister that whenever possible, if a lecture on an important or a new science is given here in Dublin, or even a series of lectures, and then given in Cork or Galway, and if the lecturers are competent to speak authoritatively on their subjects they should be sent to other centres in the country, more especially to places like Wexford, Waterford, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Tralee and Athlone.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That in view of the failure of the use of compulsion in regard to the language revival to appreciably further the objective of making the Irish language the spoken language of the people, and of the apparent growing disquiet and dissatisfaction among responsible authorities and among parents and pupils alike about compulsory methods, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should seek by means of a public referendum to ascertain whether a majority of the people would favour the replacement of compulsory methods, where used in the attempted revival of the language, by voluntary schemes for its encouragement. &mdash; (Deputies Dr. Browne and McQuillan.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to-night to go into the question of the Irish language in general as it has been argued by the chief sponsor of the motion that our policy in relation to Irish is to some extent a barrier to the unity of the country.  I cannot accept that contention. Nationhood is an integer, and to abandon the Irish language in the hope of smoothing the way towards the ending of partition would be to try the impossible feat of dividing an integer, of yielding on one principle for the sake of another.</P>
      <P>Besides, I believe it would be futile. Neither our Northern fellow-countrymen nor anyone else is going to be impressed by any lowering on our part of our national self-respect with an eye to pleasing them.  One hears on all sides these days suggestions that we should discard this, that or the other part of our national ideals in the hope of uniting the country.  Such people should realise that when the outer rampart of principle is surrendered, further demands grow by what they feed upon, until eventually the citadel itself has fallen.</P>
      <P>Of course, it may be possible that we could solve partition as such by the abdication of our nationhood&mdash;and abandoning the language would be a big step in that direction.  I take it that there is no self-respecting Irishman who would even think of such a piece of bartering or huxtering, and I merely mention the point in order to stress that initial weakness may eventually lead us to the loss of the very citadel of our principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question of submitting the problem of Irish to a referendum I suggest that we should not lose sight of fundamentals.  The Irish language is inextricably bound up with love of our country, its history and its traditions.  In short, it is an integral part of our national heritage. It would be an insult to our <Col N="1131" /> people to ask them, in essence, whether they are prepared to abandon an integral part of that heritage.  I would not be a party to such an insult.  Even if the question of a referendum was merely to deal with methods it would be objectionable since it would carry the implication that the State was abandoning part of its duty to the nation.</P>
    <P>No referendum is required to make an appraisal of the methods hitherto employed and no referendum is necessary for us to alter in any way these methods should we think it necessary to do so to hasten the fulfilment of our aims.  What we should strive for would be to take the question of the Irish language out of the field of controversy and to have it accepted as an agreed policy among us all.  I thought, from some of Deputy Dr. Browne's remarks, that he implicitly agreed with this.</P>
    <P>Táim ag iarraidh ar gach aoinne bheith ag cuimhneamh ar conas is fearr is féidir cabhair a thabhairt agus conas is fearr is féidir aon aighneas i dtaobh na Gaeilge a sheachaint.  Leanaimís an lorg san.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather disappointed with Deputy Dr. Browne's approach to this matter as indicated in his submission of the motion and, indeed, I was also disappointed with the approach of Deputy Corish to the motion.  I accept completely the suggestion of Deputy Corish and the implication of Dr. Browne's statement that opinions on this matter should be received with the greatest consideration and that facts should be looked at in the clearest possible way. I feel that, apart altogether from the general tone of the remarks made by Deputy Browne in supporting his motion, it would have been rather interesting, and constructive and informative if, instead of suggesting that we have a referendum on the matter, the Deputy had approached the matter from the point of view of looking at the facts through the light of his own particular experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mover of the motion had the interesting and informative experience of looking at the Irish language in <Col N="1132" /> administration and in the position in which it is in the country from the point of view of a Minister, a Minister who gave very considerable attention to the use of the language in so far as it could be used.</P>
    <P>I think it would have been better, if, instead of stating what the position is in the schools and what people are saying, he had given us his experience because there is no question that he is going on the same note as everybody else when he says that there is nobody satisfied with the progress made.  On the other hand, there are many people who, when they look around with a careful and sympathetic approach, see what has been done and who must feel that, whatever the generation which comes after the present one does with regard to changes of methods and approach, they will be very grateful for the work done and for the spirit that has been spread in so many directions by the people who have gone before them.</P>
    <P>The motion that is before us is that we should have a referendum.  If the mover of the motion wanted a referendum the proper thing for him to have done would be to have framed a question that could be put to the electorate in a referendum.  I would be very interested to see the mover of the motion, instead of moving the motion, drafting a Private Members' Bill for a referendum which would indicate the question upon which he wanted to have an answer given by the electorate. I do not see that any considerable minority within the House would approve of a referendum on the subject that is referred to here but it would be a serious exercise for a person who thought there was any possibility of a referendum to draft a question he thought the people could answer.  I do not think there is any question the people could answer at the moment.</P>
    <P>The question is, is the Irish language to be left to fend for itself or is the State going to assist its development and its spread at every step of the way?  As far as the schools are concerned the whole argument that is made by those who have spoken on this motion is the injustice being done to the children and the damage being <Col N="1133" /> done to education by reason of the fact that the language is, as they say, compulsory in the schools.  I notice Deputy Corish does not pin himself down to a complaint against that.  He emphasises the case of a person who because he did not pass in Irish did not get an examination.  If that is to be made the subject of a referendum, a question should be framed asking people to vote whether, in an examination where Irish is a subject a person who does not pass in Irish should or should not get the examination. That is a typical straight question the people could be asked to vote on.</P>
    <P>A question asked by way of referendum should be simple to understand. There is no simplicity in any general aspect of the language which could be put to the people in a referendum. There is dissatisfaction.  Are you going to ask the people: &ldquo;Are you satisfied with the present policy in relation to Irish or are you not?  Vote &lsquo;tá&rsquo; or &lsquo;níl&rsquo;, as the case might be.&rdquo; That would not lead you anywhere.</P>
    <P>The report of the Council of Education dealt thoroughly and effectively with the work of the schools and they say at one point that if there has not been achieved what was hoped for 30 years ago there have been very good reasons for that.  There are reasons of all kinds.  However, the Minister has just made an appeal that the general policy of the language would not be made a matter of Party controversy. Up to the present no aspect of the Irish language policy has been a matter of Party controversy.  There have been political effects on the language.  The Gaelic League would have been better if it had functioned differently after 1925.  The Gaelic League might have been better if it had been encouraged to develop differently and if, say, a semi-State assisted body was not set up to supplant it.  These are matters which have affected all kinds of people outside and have influenced people pro or con the language.</P>
    <P>So far as the Oireachtas is concerned the policy in regard to the language is not a matter of party politics.  There has been no cleavage of opinion between the main sections of the <Col N="1134" /> Oireachtas on it.  There is a danger that for particular reasons it could become a matter of various Parties wanting to strike a particular note which might take the fancy of a section of the people.  Happily we do not seem to be in that situation and while some people might not agree with the particular examination that is being carried on by the committee set up by the Government to deal with the matter they are prepared to take that in good faith and to see what kind of evidence will come from it.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, people are looking at the language and the problems connected with it from various points of view.  We have been asked by some speakers in this debate to admit that no progress has been made in the last 40 years.  I could go back not more than 40 years to a school in Thurles where Irish was not being taught.  I could visit there as a Minister a few years ago, speak to the whole school entirely in Irish and be fully understood. I could go to see the Arch-bishop of Cashel being consecrated, feting his guests and listen to him making his address entirely in Irish.  I could listen to other members of the hierarchy, the clergy and laymen one after another making some part of their contribution in Irish.</P>
    <P>In the face of all that we are told here: &ldquo;Speak to any children of 12 to 14 years of age and ask them if they are in favour of Irish and the great majority of them will say &lsquo;no&rsquo;.&rdquo; Remarks along those lines were made during this debate.  Surely there is no foundation for statements such as those in the face of what you can hear in any school you go into, or at any public meeting where you will hear speakers addressing their audience in Irish, at an assembly such I spoke of in Thurles or indeed at the annual meeting of the Cumann Gaelach in Clonmel.  It is simply just stirring up dust, or throwing dust on a road where there is enough dust already.  But dust that can be cleared away, or is being cleared away at the present time, is that particular kind of obscurity with regard to Irish in the school, Irish in administration or Irish elsewhere that could not afford to be looked at, perhaps, in the years <Col N="1135" /> we have passed through or would be made a matter for Party division or Party criticism or complaint of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>A very considerable amount of time has been lost because&mdash;both where Irish is used in administration, or in the development of Irish in the schools, the general objective, No. 1, but particularly the immediate objectives, which are the things without which in a problem of this particular kind you cannot reach surely towards your general objectives or see where your general objective is&mdash;these immediate objectives have not been examined in any way at all, you might say, or at any rate in any systematic way.</P>
    <P>This committee that dealt with primary school programmes up to 12 years of age have, by an overwhelming majority, approved of the work that is being done in the schools and made the complaint that if work is being done more satisfactorily outside by public bodies and by official bodies outside the schools and others, that the schools would give a very much more effective contribution as a result of such encouragement but that the child can hardly be expected to become a pioneer in the use of Irish.</P>
    <P>To leave the question of schools, I would just refer to the American School Curriculum, the volume of the American Association for 1953.  One of the chapters deals with how to appraise classroom achievement and on page 311 it says:</P>
    <P>...curriculums are badly overcrowded. The time has come to assess realistically the specific responsibilities and the degree of responsibility which schools can and should assume.  However, Cureton points out that &ldquo;... responsibility has no meaning in the absence of some method for determining whether it has been discharged effectively or ineffectively.  If the school wants to accept some responsibility, but lacks either the necessary authority to discharge it or the ability to evaluate, however crudely, the results of its proposed efforts, <Col N="1136" /> we must conclude that it is unable to accept this responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While the Department of Education and the schools here have accepted a very considerable amount of responsibility in connection with the language the following remarks, I think, are relevant:</P>
    <P>The preceding statement implies that decisions as what achievements should be evaluated and as to how they are to be evaluated should not be delayed until after the curriculum has been constructed, and certainly not until after construction has been completed.  Rather it implies that, both in formulating objectives and in devising means for the attainment, decisions as to how and what to evaluate play an important part. In other words, curriculum construction and plans for evaluation should go hand in hand.  A realistic consideration of how the achievement of any objective can be appraised will contribute markedly to its clarification and aid in determining whether or not its achievement is a responsibility which the school should accept.</P>
    <P>One other thing that the Council of Education Report in relation to primary education recommended was that a research department should be set up.  That has not been done or, at any rate, there has not been any kind of systematic&mdash;not so much research but&mdash;examination and assessment of what has been achieved in the schools and without that I do not think it is possible to state in respect of our schools at any particular stage what the immediate objective was where the primary schools or the secondary schools are concerned in relation to the general language problem.  I take it that the schools do their own work in a particular way or on a particular curriculum but even on the amount of circumscribed objective that the schools have themselves I doubt if, in relation to the general problem, there has been that particular type of systematic assessment of the work that would enable it to be changed here and improved there at various stages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> However, I think that is not a matter that we can transfer to this Assembly either to discuss effectively or on which to advise effectively.  We have very highly-qualified educational authorities on the managerial side, in the Church, and in the teaching line and we would be very ill-advised to attempt to decide either at referendum or at Oireachtas level, questions that are properly to be decided at the level of those engaged in education on the various strata.  Only comparatively recently have we, in a general way, come to examine things in that regard.  It is quite true that the Department of Education has been in touch with various groups from time to time but it was only a few years ago that the Council of Education was set up for the purpose of reviewing things generally.  The very slowness with which the Council have done their work may be a matter of grave disappointment, say, on the primary side, but that slowness is not at all out of keeping with the slowness with which the Department and the Government have done their work in taking the facts as disclosed and the recommendations as made by the Council. It is a matter of considerable surprise to me that the second request that was made to the Council to deal with the curriculum for secondary schools was made nearly five years ago and I do not think the Department has yet got the report on that although it was a rather constrained thing.</P>
    <P>That may be disappointing but there may be very sound reasons for it and I think those who realise how securely the foundations of our educational policy and institutions are laid will not in the long run have any fault to find with the great slowness in this matter.  To me, personally, it is a bit disappointing because I thought when the primary and secondary sides were dealt with that what came in after 12 in the national schools and in the vocational schools would be reviewed and time is rather important in educational matters at present although it is much more satisfactory to spend time in examination rather than take decisions and thus involve a futile waste of time in following a type of blueprint that might affect, if not the present, the next generation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> At this particular time in the development of the general language policy we ought not fall into the danger of making any small aspects of it, in relation to schools or administration, a matter of Party irritation on the one hand.  We ought to avoid as much as possible taking things out of the hands of the educationists, things that are entirely theirs.  On the other hand, we ought to encourage them to understand that their recommendations will be understood, their approach understood, and that we are anxious only to get the best possible thing done in our schools.  We ought all be satisfied at the present time so far as the school are concerned with the opinions that have been expressed by the Council up to this that there is no diminution of the educational effectiveness of our schools by reason of what has been done in these schools for the Irish language, whether you object to what is being done here, there and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated fairly what the general situation is.  However, we are concerned with the whole of the Irish language policy.  I think that the mover of the resolution is a bit depressing when he summarises the situation by saying that the present generation, for all they did and all their ideals, have failed in everything, the &ldquo;everything&rdquo; being the three things the mover set out: to solve Partition, restore the Irish language and bring about social justice in a state in which there would be security for everybody.  However, a referendum in that particular atmosphere will not settle anything for anybody.</P>
    <P>The general position of the Irish language depends on what is being done in the Gaeltacht, upon the position of Irish in the Civil Service and the position of Irish with the Local Appointments Commission.  It also depends on what kind of contribution can be made to the schools by cultural traditions.  Being cultural traditions, they are the heritage of our people and may be viewed in terms of the people and their mentality.  I think it is time there would come from the Department of Celtic Studies of the Institute for Advanced Studies something <Col N="1139" /> of what came to our generation through the Standish O'Gradys and the Eleanor Halls and those who introduced us first to Cuchulainn, the Fianna Cycle and all the old Irish mythology.</P>
    <P>I think there has been from the very early days of the old Gaeltacht Orders under Local Government and Agriculture a very slipshod approach towards seeing that the Irish-speaking districts were served with Irish-speaking officials, while on the other hand very great play was made of requiring Irish standards from people appointed in other places.  On occasion there have been suspicions as to the equity and fairness with which that was done under certain circumstances. All kinds of suspicions, jealousies and disappointments of various kinds have all helped to add to a disparagement of Irish as a requirement in public appointments.  For years now there has been a document awaiting approval or decision by the Government with regard to the use of Irish in the Civil Service.  The sooner some of these things are settled the better.  For years there have been considerations as to the necessity for reviewing the position in regard to Irish and the Local Appointments Commission.  The same applies to that. There are many other aspects of Irish and its use that require examination.</P>
    <P>As far as the schools are concerned, there is no use in running away and making a case of weaknesses here and hard cases there.  Let the situation be looked at from an educational and national point of view.  Let us understand at the same time how necessary it is to see that there will be an appreciation of what the language means.  I feel that something more than a three hour discussion, and a lot more information than is available at present to anybody engaged in such a discussion, would be required to deal satisfactorily with the matter the mover of the resolution wished to be dealt with.  I do not think he really meant that there would be a referendum on the question of&mdash;I really do not know what question.  I think if <Col N="1140" /> he did desire a referendum he would have framed the question upon which he wanted the people to say &ldquo;níl&rdquo; nó &ldquo;tá&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>Lean an scéal mar sin go dtí ré an Phiarsaigh agus ba chóir dúinn cuimhneamh anois ar an gcéad uair agus an uair dheireanach dár labhair an Piarsach i gcúirt dlí na nGall. Séard a thug ann é ná seanduine as Tír Chonaill a chosaint.  Cuireadh an dlí air sin toisc go raibh a ainm i nGaeilge ar leathlaí na trucaile aige. Buadhadh air agus cuireadh fíneáil air.</P>
    <P>Ina dhiaidh sin arís in aimsir na nDubhchrónach cuireadh an dlí ar dhaoine a labhradh nó a thugadh a n-ainmneacha agus a sloinnte i nGaeilge.  Sampla amháin de sin is ea Peadar Ó hAnnracháin.  Cuireadh fineáil nó seal i bpriosún air sin toisc go dtug sé a ainm i nGaeilge do phíléir.  Níor dhíol sé an fhíneáil agus cuireadh fé ghlas é.</P>
    <P>Mholfainn don Teachta de Brún agus dá lucht leanúna machnamh a dhéanamh ar staid na Gaeilge sna scoileanna nuair do cuireadh an Stát seo ar bun.  Bhí slua oidí ag múineadh sna scoileanna an tráth úd. Daoine ab ea iad a oileadh sna Coláistí oiliúna ar bheagán Gaeilge. Chuir an Roinn Oideachais cúrsaí <Col N="1142" /> Samhraidh ar bun dóibh agus, idir óg agus aosta, rinneadar freastal ar na cúrsaí sin agus chaitheadar laethanta saoire an tSamhraidh ag saothrú na Gaeilge.  Ba mhór an éacht dóibh a leithéid agus tá moladh dá réir ag dul dóibh.  Ón uair sin i leith rinne gach Aire Oideachais, bíodh sé ar thaobh Fhianna Fáil nó ar thaobh Fhine Gael, a chroí-dhícheall chun cothrom a thabhairt d'urlabhra Gael.  Pé deighilt pholaitíochta a bhí eatarthu bhíodar go léir dílis do phríomhchómhartha an náisiúin.</P>
    <P>Ó shoin i leith rinne an Roinn Oideachais, na cigirí, na bainisteorí agus na hoidí cion fir chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sna scoileanna.  Ní airítear puinn díobh siúd i dtreis agam ag cur síos ar Ghaeilge éigeantach sna scoileanna.  Trua ná faigheann siad cuidiú ó na daoine atá de shíor ag caint fé Ghaeilge éigeantach.

    <P>Dá bhfaighimis dea-ghnúis is deaghmhéin ó dhaoine mar an Teachta de Brún b'fhéidir go n-éireodh linn cuspóirí an Phiarsaigh a thabhairt chun chríche.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta de Brún tagairt do bhuachaill bocht a bhain an tArd Theistiméireacht amach i scrúdú na bliana seo caite.  Adeir sé linn go raibh ar an mbuachaill bocht sin aghaidh a thabhairt ar Shasana agus nár éirigh leis post ar bith a bhaint amach ann toisc go raibh sé ar cheal Béarla.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. I believe that in discussing this important motion we will have to avoid two extremes.  There is undoubtedly certain proof over the years that so far as the Irish language is concerned as a whole it has not made the progess we would wish for it, yet at this stage I believe that two extremes can be dangerous, one swinging away completely from the Irish language and the second that we must learn Irish and forget everything else.  As a member of this House I oppose the holding of a referendum on this question. In asking the parents to decide we are, of course, asking everyone over 21 who has a right to vote and from our experience in relation to referendums in the past we can have speakers go out in a fair, honest, manner pointing out that we do believe in the Irish language but that we have our doubts about how it may be improved in certain directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be two factions.  I am not suggesting that any member of the House will adopt that line but outside there will be one faction saying that they want to do away with Irish.  The proposers of the motion are not suggesting that but if the matter should go to the country it will go out of their hands.  There will be one faction who will suggest that <Col N="1144" /> not alone do they want compulsory Irish abolished but want to go even further away from the language while the other faction will put the opposite argument.  The result will be that the position in regard to the Irish language will be worse than it is today.</P>
    <P>I must congratulate the Minister on a recent speech.  It is my belief that there should be less concentration in the schools on points of grammar in connection with the Irish language and that the children should be encouraged to speak the Irish language, even if at times there might be grammatical errors.  I have in mind an old seanachaidhe, a native Irish speaker, from whom I learned Irish before I learned English.  That old man was illiterate but he could express himself in the Irish language most fluently because he had heard the language and used the language all his life.  The children in the schools should be encouraged to converse in Irish.  Grammatical errors should be overlooked.  In that way we can hope for better results than have been achieved so far.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the results to date do not warrant the 100 per cent. praise we would wish to give the efforts made to restore the language. Let us learn from past mistakes.  The Irish language may not be used to the extent that we would wish but we represent only one generation and when we have gone to Tír na nÓg or elsewhere, the Irish language can survive if we encourage the children to use it in their everyday life.  Let us get away from the two factions, those who want to do away with the Irish language and those who want to do away with everything else but the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make one or two points before Deputy Dr. Browne replies.  This is a simple motion which asks the House to leave it to the Irish people to decide whether or not the methods which have been used in the last 40 years are the correct ones to save the language, apart altogether from the question of spreading the language and making it the spoken language.  Surely the Irish <Col N="1145" /> people have some rights in this matter or is it that we are afraid to face the people on this issue?  Deputies will describe me&mdash;and they are welcome so to describe me&mdash;as a West Briton.  I do not mind how they describe me.  I want to say clearly that our system of priorities has been haywire in the last 40 years.  I agree with Bishop Lucey of Cork when he says, &ldquo;save the people first&rdquo;.  Bishops have been quoted here all night as being in favour of the revival of the Irish language.  We are told about an Archbishop who was consecrated the other day, who spoke in Irish.  Were the people who were listening to him able to understand him?</P>

      <P>We know your history.  Bishops and Archbishops are quoted here as being in favour of the revival of the Irish language.  We can also quote sincere bishops who believe that the methods used up to this have proved disastrous.  Will any Deputy describe Dr. Lucey or Fr. O'Doherty as West Britons?  Let us be clear about it.  The people who have a vested interest in the system used to-day are those in this House and outside it, with full bellies, who have done well out of the Irish language.  I restrained myself when the Deputy opposite, on his first, and possibly his last visit to this House, made his maiden speech.  He was long in the tooth before he got an opportunity of making it.  One-third of the population of his own county are working in Manchester and Liverpool since his chief took over here.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that statistics were not available to prove anything about the Irish language.  I will give the Minister statistics in regard to University graduates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After 30 or 40 years of the system in operation, surely we should see the results amongst the educated class of <Col N="1146" /> our people.  I want to refer the Minister to a survey, carried out in 1953 by the Central Statistics Office, of Irish university education.  The period covered is 1939 to 1953.  The survey shows significant changes in all the faculties since 1938.  In Science and Architecture the number of students doubled in that year.  The number of Dental students quadrupled.  The number of students taking Arts, Medicine, Agriculture, Commerce, Divinity and Law showed a terrific increase.  The popularity of the Arts is shown in the number of students who have taken foreign languages.  In 1953/54 the most popular foreign language was, of course, French.  There were 64 honours primary degrees awarded in French in 1953 as against 37 in 1938.  In 1939 there were no honours primary degrees in Italian but in 1953 there were ten.  The study of History and Economics shows a huge increase in popularity.  Only two subjects declined in popularity amongst the educated element of our people. One was the Classics; the other was Irish.  The Classics showed a temporary set back only but the figures for the Irish language can only be described as startling and showed a prolonged decrease from 1938 to the present moment.  I will give the figures as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting a Central Statistics Office publication as given on 4th December, 1955, in the <i>Irish Times.</i>  The number of honours primary degrees in Irish in 1938-39 was 44; in 1953 the number was 15. The number of advanced students of Irish&mdash;and we know who the people outside this House are who are keen on the question of advanced Irish&mdash;in 1938-39, was 12; the number in 1953 was three.  These are facts.  These are statistics.  They refer to the educated element of our community.  They are dissatisfied because of the methods used to teach Irish.  They have been disgusted, disillusioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally feel that although the situation is very serious at the moment <Col N="1147" /> with regard to the language there may be a possibility of relieving the situation by changing the teaching methods. I am doubtful about it.  I want to be quite honest; every Deputy should be honest in his approach to this matter. I cannot be more frank than that.  As a last resort, the system will have to be changed or those who have stood by this system for 40 years must take the blame if the language disappears.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the Gaeltacht as one of the places where the language must be held.  Surely he knows that people are flying from the Gaeltacht and have been all down the years, that the population of the Gaeltacht is dwindling.  I am as familiar with West Galway as any Deputy who represents it.  I know what happens in West Galway today. Most of the hotel properties and the fishing and shooting rights are in the hands of non-nationals.  I am not criticising non-nationals.  I am merely pointing out that in those areas the property belongs to non-nationals.  If an Irishman wants to get a day's shooting or fishing he must go to their agent in order to get a day's shooting or fishing.  The only employment given is to young girls who are brought into toy factories&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the economic condition in the Gaeltacht is such that the people have to leave it, then the language goes too.  Of course it has a bearing on it.  I suppose there is no use appealing to even what I consider the reasonable members of the Fianna Fáil Party at this stage because the grip of the banshees is upon them.  The banshees are behind the present Minister whom I have always found to be a courteous and gentlemanly Deputy at all times.  I am sorry for him.  I would ask him, if at all possible, to allow his Party to decide for themselves on this matter and have a free vote of the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Mulcahy's contribution, he has been consistent in that line for years.  I have no personal criticism of him on that because at any rate I believe he is sincere in it.  I also believe he is mistaken in his approach and also that his Party does not see eye to eye with him on the line he adopted here to-night.  I feel that in his Party there are other members who feel that a great deal of damage has been done.  I hope when this debate ends we shall get in the division lobby the support of these elements of the Fine Gael Party, if they are allowed to vote without having the Whip imposed on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the Minister's speech disappointing because, being a young man of my own generation, I felt that he was at liberty to assess the position in a new light, to give the views of a person who has given deep thought to the great problem involved here, and that we would have a new approach to the question.  I can understand a Deputy or any of the people who have been closely associated with the revival of the language movement being reluctant to admit failure because of their association and because of the sincere efforts which, I believe, failed.  But it is disappointing to find a new generation should continue the old fallacious ideas on the <Col N="1149" /> question of the revival, ideas which have clearly proved themselves to be unsuccessful in the objective which they set out to achieve.</P>
      <P>As to Deputy O'Kelly's speech, may I say how much I envy his fluency and how much I sympathise with the passion he feels over this question.  All I would like to say is that I think he dealt unfairly with us in so far as we do not want to contribute to the decline of the language.  We want to stem the demonstrable decline; we want to preserve it.  We are not trying to get rid of it at all.  He associated us with the British and made that kind of comment, which was unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  In reply to Deputy Mulcahy who raised the point that we might suggest the lines of the referendum, the obvious ones that occurred to me are, of course: first, would the people like the language retained as a compulsory subject or as a voluntary subject in primary and secondary schools?  Secondly, would they like the language to be retained as a subject for passing examinations, such as the Leaving Certificate? Another question which could be asked is: if they fail in Irish, do they fail the whole examination?  There is also the question of the necessity for having the language in relation to professional appointments and the Civil Service.  Those are the questions which would occur to me as being reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was mention of an isolated incident, the recent consecration of a Bishop in Clonmel, the speech in Irish and so on.  That is, I think, an exception.  If General Mulcahy had told me that the Bishops had laid down that, in future, prayers for children in schools and churches shall be in Irish, I would say that was a very definite advance towards restoring the language.  General Mulcahy asked me as to my own experience in the Department of Health.  My attitude to the language was&mdash;I tried to show at that time&mdash;that in every way I could, speaking on the radio, preparing advertisements for newspapers and so forth, to use Irish as much as I could.  Equally, I think I was the <Col N="1150" /> first Minister in the history of the State to make films entirely in Irish for children, from the point of view of health propaganda.  Those were some small ways&mdash;questions and answers and so on in the Dáil&mdash;in which I tried to make a contribution towards the voluntary restoration of the language because I believe the voluntary method of learning the language is the way in which one can learn the language and love it at the same time.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy O'Kelly learned it in a voluntary way.  Many Deputies who, because of their inherent love of the country decided to learn the language&mdash;Deputy de Valera, as he was, Deputy Mulcahy and the late Deputy Josie Mongan,&mdash;spoke Irish extremely well and were enthusiastic about the language but I believe they used the language because they loved it.  They felt they wanted to preserve it, but why do these people when they have the power to decide whether they will have compulsion or not, presume that another generation would not have that same sense of nationality or same love of devotion to this beautiful heritage we have?  I think it is a presumption which is ill-founded and led to the policies which have shown themselves in the ultimate analysis to have failed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy chastised me for making the statement that the language policy had been a failure.  I do believe it has been a failure, broadly speaking and in making the statement I was depending on the support of a most honest speech by Professor Hayes.  I think the older generation have shown a much greater measure of honesty in their assessment of this problem.  It must be very difficult for someone like Senator Hayes to say: &ldquo;I am examining my own conscience in this matter because I was in at the start.&rdquo;  Then he went on to say: &ldquo;I think it has been a complete failure.&rdquo;  Senator Baxter supported that.</P>
    <P>I am not the only one who believes it has been a failure.  The Minister for Education mentioned that the Department of Education insisted on the teaching of geography, history, <Col N="1151" /> mathematics and arithmetic and all these other subjects.  He suggested I thought that that was all right, that compulsion was all right for those subjects but was not all right for the Irish language, and that to that extent I was denigrating the Irish language. That is not so.  The reason why one forces a child to learn arithmetic, geography or Latin is that a child will not learn these subjects voluntarily, but there are many people who will learn the Irish language voluntarily.</P>
    <P>It is for reasons of its unpopularity that a language has to be taught compulsorily. The reason I believe the language should be taught voluntarily is that it would then be much more popular than it is at present.  If one examines the question of the different subjects taught to children in schools one will understand what I mean.  You compel children to go to school. Children dislike school.  You compel them to go to school, because otherwise they would not do so.  They dislike it.  It is an unnatural state for them; I know that I disliked going to school anyway.  When it comes to subjects like arithmetic, mathematics and geography we force them to learn them.  They do not love them and they drop them as soon as they leave school.  Most of us did that and only continued the subjects which were necessary to earn our bread.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to single out the Irish language and say it is disliked in the schools.  There are many subjects disliked because people are forced to learn them.  It is not in any way denigrating the Irish language to say that it is disliked.  It is an established fact that it is declining and that is an established fact because of the method we use to teach it.  Just as the children forget their mathematics they forget their Irish if they are not compelled to continue it and the only way you can compel them to do that is to make it impossible for them to survive without Irish.</P>
    <P>The general atmosphere facing the children when they leave school is an English one.  We have become Anglicised in our whole way of life.  For <Col N="1152" /> that reason the child forgets the Irish language when he leaves school just as readily as he probably forgets his arithmetic and geography.  The former Taoiseach, President de Valera, emphasised that point when he said on one occasion that if you were in a Gaeltacht area, and you were starving, you would learn the few words of Irish necessary to keep you alive.  That is what happened with the English language. The people were forced to learn it if they wanted to live.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties which every generation has to face is that there is no use in giving the Irish language an importance which the children will not accept.  The present generation may attach great importance to the revival of the language but the next generation will not know what it is all about.  It is impossible to convey to the children of this generation the reasons that impelled the men of this generation to impose it compulsorily on the children of today.  I think that point has been emphasised by the fact that the children have refused to speak the language. I wonder to what point the Minister is prepared to go in order to insist on this policy of compulsion.  I have quoted various authorities on the matter, politicians, psychologists and doctors.</P>

      <P>There is one further quotation I should like to make.  On page 103 of the Report of the Council of Education the Irish National Teachers' Organisation stated:</P>
      <P>The average child comes to school already equipped with a vocabulary sufficient to express in simple language the experience of his everyday life.  He is suddenly transferred into a new and unnatural world. The simplest expressions of the teacher or of the more advanced pupils are quite unintelligible to him....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give this matter further serious thought and to bear in mind that the general view of people, whether in the Seanad or in the Dáil, is in favour of a complete readjustment of the whole question. <Col N="1153" /> The whole underlying dynamic on this question of the revival of the language is the question of compulsion.  It is that matter which needs examination and the people of Ireland should be given an opportunity of considering it for themselves.  I do not agree with Deputy Mulcahy that this is a matter <Col N="1154" /> for the managers.  The parents definitely have a right in the matter.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NOTES.</P>
    <P>(1)  These figures are subject to review at audit.</P>
    <P>(2)  Borough corporations are not required to pay compensation in respect of malicious injuries.  They must, however, contribute to the council of the county in which they are situated their portion of any amount levied on an area of which the borough forms a part and the whole of any amount levied exclusively on the area of the borough.  Thus in the year 1958-59 Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation contributed £293 to Dublin County Council in respect of malicious injuries. </P>
