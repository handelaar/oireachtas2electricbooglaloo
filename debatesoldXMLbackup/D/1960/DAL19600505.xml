      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to return to one aspect of what I was saying last night and to refer again to the Minister's proposal for the reorganisation of the Civil Service which is occasioning considerable <Col N="737" /> worry amongst many people.  The Minister hopes to reduce the cost of the Civil Service by replacing male employees by female employees and, by so doing, to get the same work done by girls who will not be paid the same amount as might have to be paid to men.  In our economy, where even the male labour market is so depressed, a development of that kind is to be deplored.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be a matter of administration rather than policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, Sir, but in his Budget speech, the Minister sought to receive praise because of the reorganisation he is carrying out in the Civil Service.  With respect, I feel it is necessary, at this early stage, to have emphasis placed upon that undesirable development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a discussion on administration and that seems to be a matter of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is administration, but it deals with the very considerable cost of Government.  Surely the purpose of the Budget is to provide for the cost of Government, and it Deputies have suggestions as to how the cost might be varied, with respect, I submit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go over all the administrative acts of the Government in order to deal with economies.  The Budget is the method of securing finances to run the country and, if we discuss all the administrative acts of the Government, we shall travel far beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, Sir, but, with respect, I felt it was relevant in so far as the Minister was suggesting economies which would reduce the burden of taxation which he would have to impose on people. I feel that if he does that in this way, by replacing the fathers of Irish families who work in the Civil Service with female staff, he is taking a retrograde step.  That is something he should be very slow to do because, not only will he deprive many men <Col N="738" /> of the opportunity of developing and improving their conditions in the Civil Service, but he will also be saving himself the children's allowances which are paid to civil servants.  It is undesirable that the State should give such an unchristian example in relation to the employment of the available labour.</P>
      <P>I want, quite bluntly, to ask the Minister and the Government why they are so anti-city.  The tendency since they took office has been to impose burden after burden on the city dweller and not on his cousin in the country.  They have been urging the people to increase production in the past year and the only section who did increase production were the industrial workers.  The agricultural end of the economy showed a considerable depression last year.  The manner in which the Minister has rewarded the efforts of the industrial section has been to impose on them an additional burden to provide subsidies for that section of the community which has failed to achieve the increase in production demanded by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I certainly think the Minister will be judged by his actions and not by his words.  All that urging of people to increase production has been shown to be just so much hot air when we think of the additional burden of 3d. on the lb. of butter, ½d. on the pint of milk and the increased burden of transport charges which were imposed on the city dweller for the purpose of assisting his cousin down the country, who is not pulling his weight, relatively speaking, in relation to the increased production which the Minister boasts about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In an area of about 20 square miles in Dublin, there is far greater depression, poverty and need than anywhere in Ireland.  The tendency of Governments to provide support for industrial activity in what are called &ldquo;undeveloped areas&rdquo; needs to be re-examined.  It is a very desirable social objective to spread industrial activity and to give the opportunity of employment throughout the length and breadth of the country. However, our first and greatest need is to increase production and to increase the markets available for Irish produce.  We cannot do that if we impose on our industry the additional burden so often entailed by locating it in a situation which is basically uneconomic.  When we do that, not only has the particular industry concerned but the whole economy to bear the additional burden.  That is one of the reasons we have not been able to make a greater impression on the international market.  We have the extra costing entailed by industry being wrongly located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are really serious about the matter, our first objective should be to increase our industrial output by every means in our power and to use the best sites and best labour markets available.  In Dublin, the degree of <Col N="740" /> emigration is as great as, if not greater than, the emigration from the western seaboard.  The only reason the population of Dublin is not falling is that people are coming into it from the whole of the 26 counties and, indeed, the 32 counties.  The degree of emigration amongst people born in Dublin is as great as it is from any part of Ireland.  The sooner the Government are prepared to face that fact, the better for the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>We certainly cannot afford to continue the present situation in which we are pricing our products out of international markets because we are locating our industries in the wrong places. There is ample labour available in Dublin.  There are ample sites in Dublin.  All the facilities industry needs are available in Dublin and in the larger centres of population throughout the country.  They are not being properly availed of and, as a consequence, we are losing.</P>
    <P>The Minister assured us that we are very well off indeed and that conditions in Ireland are good.  He said the living standards of the people are rising.  I question that.  I base my facts not on any political stand I might be expected to take but on the <i>Irish Statistical Survey</i> issued by the Statistics Office. It is unfortunate that it is not up to date.  However, it indicates that, in the first couple of years of the Government, our food consumption dropped considerably. The consumption of creamery butter fell.  We are now eating less creamery butter than we were eating three years ago when the Government came into office.  We are now eating less cheese, less eggs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>They were never so cheap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are cheaper, and we are eating less than we did three years ago, then we must be far worse off.  We are eating less poultry, less sugar, less bread, less flour and less potatoes.  We are drinking less tea and we are not drinking more beer.  Does that indicate a rising standard of living or is the Minister joining with Marie Antoinette and saying that if we are not eating the commodities I have <Col N="741" /> mentioned we are eating biscuits, cakes and jam?  However, the consumption of these commodities also is falling and it is not surprising.</P>
      <P>We are now paying 10d. extra for the lb. of butter.  We are paying extra for milk, bread, flour and all the necessary and vital commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>And television sets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This clearly indicates the failure of the Government not only to raise the standard of living but even to maintain it at the relatively low level of three years ago.  Notwithstanding the considerable drop in the consumption of the commodities on which the poor man depends, the Minister has seen fit to add an extra 3d to the price of the lb. of butter and an extra ½d. to the price of the pint of milk.</P>
      <P>How serious is the Minister when he says we are living better than four-fifths of the people of the world?  I suppose he is referring to the starving millions in Asia.  If I proceed with this any longer, the Minister will probably ask me to name some of the starving millions in order to prove my point.  In such a situation, I cannot understand how the Minister has the neck to call upon the non-agricultural worker to bear the additional cost entailed to subsidise agriculture because of the failure of the Government to give it the injection it needs.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that agriculture needs extra help.  If the failure in that industry is due to the Government, they should find some means of rectifying the position other than to ask the non-agricultural worker to subsidise it. Unfortunately, that is what has happened and the Government should be condemned for it.  The extra 3d. on the lb. of butter, the extra ½d. on the pint of milk and the extra 5½d. on the 2-lb. loaf will not improve the economy one bit.  There is nothing in any of those measures which can possibly increase production either in industry or in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's talk to the effect that all actions must be directed towards increased production has been shown to be so much empty talk on his part. He has taken from the non-agricultural <Col N="742" /> worker a portion of the increase to which he was entitled because of the increased production he brought about.  The Minister is giving portion of the increase which was earned by the non-agricultural worker to the agricultural section of the community but it will not increase our exports, which are supposed to be what we are all after, except, again, at the expense of the non-agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>If butter production increases this year, the non-agricultural worker will again be called on to subsidise Irish butter so that it may be eaten cheaper by the people in Britain than it can be eaten by the Irish people at home. I cannot understand these crazy economic trends.  I fail to follow the line of reasoning in the Minister's speech that all efforts must be directed towards more production, more exports and lower costs, when, in relation to the main budgetary provisions which affect the price of every meal consumed in Ireland, he has taken steps which, though they will bring about a re-distribution of income, will not increase production.  They certainly do increase costings; they are certainly going to continue the trend which has been clearly shown by the official statistics of the past few years&mdash;a trend of declining consumption of the basic needs of the people of Ireland because they are now eating less bread, less butter and less sugar and they are drinking less tea and milk than they were a few years ago.  I think that is a most unfortunate situation and nobody can be blamed for this except the present Government who led people to believe that, if they were returned to power, there would be a radical alteration in our economy so as to ensure that this trend would not alone be halted but reversed.</P>
    <P>Quite the opposite has happened. We have desperate depression, indeed and, unfortunately, it appears that the Minister is not even aware of it.  If he was, despite the Party from which he comes, I do not think he could have glossed over the matter in the rather trite way he did in his Budget speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister heaped some abuse on <Col N="743" /> those who are not as optimistic as he. I know I was sent into this House by thousands of people for the purpose of trying to open the Minister's eyes to what is going on round him and of trying to disturb the obvious complacency of the Government.  A Government who are as complacent as this about the economic life of the country and the woeful conditions in which so many people live are not deserving of the confidence of the people.  I hope that the day is not long distant when the Government will test whether or not the people have confidence in them because it is clearly obvious to any impartial person that the country is declining all the time.  In a situation in which money values have fallen over the past three years, we still have not reached the degree of productive capacity which we had three years ago and we were then very far from achieving our full productive capacity. We still have not reached the point at which we stood three years ago.</P>
    <P>In the past 10 years we had two serious economic collapses, both brought about by the right wing Tory reactionary Budgets of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The first one was in 1952.  There was another in 1957 and the fact that this Budget makes no change in that situation is the reason the Budget and the Government must be condemned.  There are those who feel that the Government must be patted on the back because they did not do anything in the Budget.  My criticism is that they did so little to correct a situation which was crying out for a remedy.  We have the same clap-trap thrown out to us here with no hope or policy for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many of its predecessors, this Budget will be described by various appellations.  Those who are responsible for its introduction will praise it and pour enconiums upon it, whilst those who constitute an Opposition in the House will probably endeavour to criticise the Budget because of its many serious shortcomings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, however, that the Budget is a cute and crafty Budget.  It is designed, <Col N="744" /> obviously, to win approval from important and influential sections of the community, but if the Budget is to be, as the Budget should be, an instrument of economic policy, then this Budget fails utterly to meet the needs of our situation here or to provide a solution for the evils which faced us for more than 40 years.  It dispenses favours here and there but it leaves the main problems untouched and hopes that, because of the small Party gifts to certain sections of the community, the Government will win approval from them as a progressive Government.</P>
    <P>In my view the most vicious aspect of the Budget is the complete absence of any sense of social or human values. That is clearly evident from the parsimonious attitude of the Government in relation to old age pensioners and other social welfare classes, especially when you contrast the relative generosity of the Government in the Budget towards other sections of the community who are already well endowed with this world's goods.</P>
    <P>I do not think you can judge a Budget such as we have by the terms of the Minister's speech or by the particular language selected by the Minister to announce the Budget.  Nor do I think that to compare the economic position in 1959 with the position in 1958 is calculated to give us an adequate or realistic picture of the economy in which we live or of the basic difficulties underlying that economy.  It cannot give us nor does it give us a picture of the probabilities that our problems are being brought under control.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the course of his speech that there should be an end to depressing talk.  That is strange advice from the present Government because during two periods of inter-Party Government in this country many members of the present Government, led by the Tánaiste, paraded the country in the garb of professional &ldquo;keeners&rdquo; or, to use the Taoiseach's more elegant expression, banshees for the purpose of denigrating in every possible way the efforts of inter-Party Governments to grapple with the problems which then faced the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> I said that the Budget had a warped sense of human and social values. Under the Budget we have made dispensations of a substantial kind to certain classes of people in the community but for old age pensioners, that is, for those who have withstood the battle of life and survived it until they have passed 70 years of age, the greatest contribution which we make towards an easement of their difficulties is to give them one shilling per week increase in their pensions.  That means 2d. per day with no 2d. on Sunday or, to illustrate better the value of that 2d., we give the old age pensioner one cigarette per day with no cigarette on Sunday.  Does anybody imagine that by that parsimonious distribution of a shilling to old age pensioners, 2d. per day to cover three meals per day, we can say we have discharged our social obligations to that long-suffering class?</P>
    <P>The Minister says in his Budget statement that we are on the road to prosperity and seeks, as those behind him have sought, to paint a picture of a country moving rapidly towards prosperity.  If there is prosperity, if the Budget testifies to that, how is it that we can only afford such a microscopic gift for old age pensioners as 2d. per day and then not for every day?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explain why others have been getting priority in the matter of dispensations under the Budget while the old age pensioners have been reserved for the most niggardly gifts of all?  Why are the old age pensioners so far down in the queue? Why is it a case of giving to those who are already fairly well off? If things are good and prosperity surrounds us, then I ask why does the Minister not share that prosperity at least equally with the old age pensioners and with the various other social assistance classes and all those people who are not as well endowed with goods as many of the recipients of gifts under this Budget already are?</P>
    <P>I met a person the other day who said to me: &ldquo;What do you think of the Budget?&rdquo;  I replied: &ldquo;You are a more impartial commentator than I am&mdash;what do you think of it?&rdquo;<Col N="746" /> He said: &ldquo;I think it is an excellent Budget.&rdquo;  To that, I replied: &ldquo;Do you mind giving your reason for saying that.&rdquo;  He answered: &ldquo;Well, for example, I get £70 a year off my licence duty; I get another £20 a year increase for income tax purposes; there is one penny off my oil for heating and I get something from the cinema in which I have an interest as well.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let us take one example.  Let me calculate it roughly.  The £70 a year which you are getting off your licence duty would give ten old age pensioners an additional 2/6d. a week.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;That may be but do not blame me.  I did not give the money away, I got it and I have no complaint to make about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We give to a person who is paying a licence duty of £74 a year a gift of £70, the cost of giving 2/6d. a week to ten old age pensioners.  We salve our consciences here by saying this Budget, however, makes provisions for rectifying our economic wrongs and adjusting our social inequality, while we do things so obviously glaring as the example to which I have just referred.  The fact that Governments dress their political window by means of a Budget is something which I do not criticise.  Governments are entitled to play their cards in their own way. All Governments have done so and I do not object to this Government endeavouring to do it but the very fact that the Government dress their window in a particular way and seek to give their wares an exorbitant value does not exempt them from liability to have their administration questioned, or the conditions under which a Government are trading examined.</P>
    <P>My complaint against this Budget is that it does not penetrate, for the purpose of examination or rectification, the basic evils from which the country is suffering.  I want to get the facts examined and it is not in order to apportion blame, because we are all to blame for this.  It is not a matter for this Government; it is a matter for all Governments.  It is an indictment of our political and economic intelligence and our failure to use over 40 years the powers which <Col N="747" /> we believed, 40 years ago when we had not got them, we would use so beneficially.</P>
    <P>Let us take industrial production. This country's standard of living must be based on what it produces because there is nothing a nation can live on except what it produces.  Look at the picture and listen to the chirrups of pleasure which accompanied this Budget.  Let us look at the Grey Book.  I take this publication to be a truthful document.  It is published by the Government Stationery Office and it is on sale at the Government Publications Sale Office and issued with the authority of a branch of the Government.  Therefore, it must be assumed to be a correct appraisal in statistical form of the basic situation in various aspects of our national life.</P>
    <P>In this document, we are told that the volume of production for all industries and services for 1959 was 106.9.  That is regarded today as a gigantic achievement and as something which justifies whoops of pleasure by the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.  But let us go back to 1955.  We find that in that year the volume of production for all industries and services was not 106.9 but 107.8, so that if we make a comparison between 1959 and 1955, we find we are now at a lesser stage of industrial production than we were in 1955.</P>
    <P>We are told that more people are engaged today in industrial production but again let the Grey Book speak for itself.  It shows that, in 1959, the average number of persons engaged was 155,100, but, in 1955, we had 156,600 engaged, so that again the progress we are making now is so rapid that it is less than in 1955.  These are facts that cannot be gainsaid.  It does not matter what Government are in office.  These are the facts and these facts put against the position of every other free democracy in Europe show that today we are crawling while Europe is striding in the matter of increased production.  These facts afford no ground for consolation either on the Government benches or on the Opposition benches.  They indicate and confirm <Col N="748" /> that compared with Western Europe, with all its wartime devastation, we are lagging behind in the volume of industrial production and that today, both in the number in industry and in the volume of production, we have reached targets which are less than those reached in 1955.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to employment.  Here we find a situation which is no more consoling.  According to Table 16, on page 27, of this Grey Book there were 692,000 persons employed in non-agricultural activities, in the main branches of our non-agricultural activities, in 1959.  In 1956, 718,000 were employed and in 1955, 726,000 were employed, so that from the point of view of providing additional employment, we have reached this position: in 1955, we employed 726,000 and in 1959&mdash;the so-called year of recovery and progress&mdash;we employed 692,000 or 34,000 fewer.  This is in non-agricultural economic activities but if agricultural activities be included still fewer persons are employed because each year more and more people are leaving the land and, unfortunately, very large numbers of them are not getting employment in the production of machinery for the mechanisation of land work.</P>
    <P>The workers leave the land here in many instances due to increased mechanisation in agriculture.  In Britain and some Continental countries that fall in employment on the land may be taken up by additional employment in factories manufacturing agricultural machinery, but what is happening here is that mechanisation of agriculture does not go hand-in-hand with the stepping up of production of agricultural machinery.  It frequently means that the Irish worker goes off the land and gives better prospects for the Continental agricultural machinery manufacturer to increase his staff to provide instruments for the Irish agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>So far as employment in the non-agricultural branches of our activities is concerned there are 30,000 fewer persons in employment today than in 1955.  We have less industrial production than in 1955, less employment. These are two facts which cannot be <Col N="749" /> gainsaid merely because reliefs of one kind or another are given to certain classes in the Budget.</P>
    <P>Let us take employment.  I turn to Table No. 18.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question which I asked recently I was informed that there were 707,000 persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts which means that when we have 70,000 persons unemployed we have ten per cent. of our insured population idle.  When we have 80,000 unemployed, as we had a few months ago, we have much more than ten per cent. idle.  I shall take the 70,000 for the purpose of easy comparison.  With 70,000 unemployed, ten per cent. of our insured workers are idle.  No other country in Western Europe has touched a figure of ten per cent.  I think the British figure is less than two per cent; the European figure, on average, is less than three per cent. and in some cases less than two per cent. but here we have been able to keep a hard core of at least 70,000 unemployed.  That is an extremely high percentage of unemployment; it exists to-day only in the most undeveloped countries.  It has no comparison on the whole Continent of Europe, particularly in the free democracies to which one has access for this statistical information.</P>
    <P>So, if you test the record over the last five years on industrial production, employment and unemployment, these grave, disquieting figures are there in all their nakedness to show how little progress we are making in grappling with the basic problem which underlies our entire economy.  At one time the Government, of course, was supposed to have a plan to relieve unemployment. I do not think the figures I have quoted can be denied.  I do not think they can be denied by the Government's advisers.  What I blame the Government for is the sense of self-satisfaction, of complacency, which prevents their making a bigger and more serious effort to deal with these problems than in this or in last year's Budget.</P>
    <P>On the question of providing employment I charge the Government with definitely and deliberately deceiving <Col N="750" /> the people, with making speeches they know are fraudulent, with publishing literature promising things which they know cannot be fulfilled and which they do not intend to fulfil.  In the last general election a leaflet was published in Cork headed: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil plans the end of Emigration&rdquo;.  A subhead said: &ldquo;Quick action needed to avert national Disaster.&rdquo;  In the course of the pamphlet they went on to say:</P>
    <P>The present spate of emigration is the most serious now facing the nation.  The recent census report has shown that the situation must be righted quickly if disaster is to be avoided.  In contrast to the inaction of the present Coalition, Fianna Fáil has been preparing plans for the day when the Party would again take up the reins of Government. The full employment proposals recently announced by Fianna Fáil show how the Party intends to deal with the problem of emigration by providing jobs for our own people at home.</P>
    <P>This follows in heavy type:</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil plan proposes an increase over five years in the number of new jobs by 100,000.  This would result in full employment and the end of abnormal emigration.</P>
    <P>What was inside the head that produced that last statement&mdash;that Fianna Fáil was going to provide 100,000 new jobs in five years and bring about the end of emigration?  That was in February, 1957: this is May, 1960. That is three-fifths of the time gone and we ought now to have 60,000 of those new jobs available, but, as I quoted earlier, we now have 34,000 fewer people in employment than in 1955 in non-agricultural activities alone.</P>
    <P>When the Fianna Fáil Party or Government issues a pamphlet of that kind saying they have a plan to end emigration and provide 100,000 new jobs in five years, and when it takes office and we see the volume of employment shrinking year after year, we can only feel convinced that these promises are deliberately made to <Col N="751" /> deceive the people or that they are condoned at high level because it would be politically inconvenient to draw attention to their obvious and fundamental dishonesty.  The Government which promised 100,000 new jobs in 1957 in that pamphlet should now tell us when we are to get evidence of an overall increase in employment having regard to that promise and to the fact that overall employment is now decreasing.</P>
    <P>The question of prices has been raised in connection with this Budget discussion.  One significant thing is not yet fully appreciated, I find, judging by the reply to a recent Parliamentary Question.  The reply showed that since 1957, 148 of the 200 items which comprised the cost-of-living index figure have increased in price in the past three years.  Out of the 200 items used as the basis for measuring movements of the cost-of-living index figure 148 have shown increases in the last three years under this Government. I do not want to read out a long litany of these increases.  Everybody is familiar with them, but a few are worth quoting.  The Minister said our people can get good food.  They could get good food in 1954, too, and they got it much cheaper than the prices at which they can buy it now, and they got more of it because it was cheaper.</P>
    <P>When the inter-party Government took office in February, 1954, the 21b. loaf was 9d.  It remained at 9d.  The 21b. loaf to-day is 1/3d., an increase of 6d. in the last three years.  Flour during the inter-Party Government period in office was 4/3d. per stone.  It is now 7/9d. per stone.  In both cases the increases have been due to the abolition of the subsidies and other Governmental action.  Butter, which was 3/9d. per lb. when the inter-Party Government were in office, is now 4/7d. per lb.</P>
    <P>Take these items alone and see the impact of them on the domestic budgets of our people up and down the country.  See the impact of them on those unfortunate people who have to depend on social welfare benefits as a means of subsistence.  See the effect on the small farmer who cannot control <Col N="752" /> the methods by which he is remunerated. See the effect of them on the small self-employed man who finds that he has to work and toil in a really competitive market.  Trade unions have very fortunately been able to secure wage increases for organised workers but, for the social welfare classes, the small farmer and the small self-employed man, and the unorganised worker generally who is found in every town and village in the country, there has been virtually no increase adequate to compensate him or her for the substantial increase in the prices of all these basic foodstuffs, and unfortunately this Budget does not provide adequate compensation either.</P>
    <P>Housing has been the subject of much disputation here in recent weeks. Allegations have been made that the inter-Party Government cut back on housing and that this Government is the fairy godmother of the housing industry.  I should like to put some information on record now.  The information comes in the form of answers to Parliamentary Questions.  I asked a question here which was answered on 22nd March.  I asked the number of houses under construction by the Dublin Corporation and all other local authorities for each of the half-years July to December 1956 to 1959 and the average number of persons employed on such housing schemes.</P>
    <P>I shall take the Dublin Corporation now.  No one can deny that houses are needed in Dublin.  The Dublin City Manager's estimate is for 5,000 new houses, quite apart altogether from any provision for the annual influx of people from the country to Dublin.  In the six months from July to December, 1956, the average number of houses under construction by the Dublin Corporation was 2,159 and the average number of persons employed on these schemes was 1,883.  In the six months July to December, 1959, the average number of houses under construction was 392, showing a fall from 2,159, and the average number of persons employed was 482, showing a fall from 1,883.  If you take all other local authorities you will find that in the six months ended December, 1956, the <Col N="753" /> average number of houses under construction was 3,584 with 3,836 persons employed on these schemes.  In the six months ending December, the number had fallen from 3,584 in December, 1956, to 1,381 in December, 1959, and the number of persons employed had fallen from 3,836 to 1,604.  So that, so far as helping to build houses is concerned, these figures speak eloquently for the factually widespread character of the inter-Party Government's housing programme.</P>
    <P>To put it another way: Deputy Corish asked a question here on 8th March soliciting particulars of the number of men engaged on house building for local authorities.  He got the information as at 31st January of each year from 1956 to 1960.  Listen to the figures.  In January, 1956, there were 6,147 persons employed building houses for local authorities.  On 31st January, 1960&mdash;that is five years afterwards&mdash;the number had fallen to 1,181.  Now, who is responsible for cutting back on housing?  Can there be any indictment of the inter-Party Government housing programme when the figures then are contrasted with the figures to-day?</P>
    <P>If you want to ascertain the grants for new houses you will find the information set out in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 8th March of this year.  That reply shows that the amount of the grants in 1956/1957&mdash; I do not want to weary the House with figures&mdash;was incomparably greater than anything that was given in 1958, 1959 and 1960.  All this adds up to the one conclusion; it is only against the background of what is now being done in respect of housing that the very substantial achievements of the inter-Party Government can be clearly seen.</P>
    <P>So long as we have problems of the character to which I have adverted we make a fundamental mistake with ourselves and with our people.  I think, by trying to underestimate the character of the rate of progress.  I am not a pessimist.  I refuse to be a pessimist, but I do not think one can harness the enduring goodwill of a people by giving them just the embroidery of a problem without telling them what the fundamentals <Col N="754" /> are.  If we are to harness our people for action, a national renaissance and a widespread policy of national reconstruction, we will only do it if they are made aware of the dangers which threaten to engulf them, of the serious problems which they should tackle now, while there is time to tackle them so that we may not have to tackle them in a more painful way, perhaps, in the light of events which we have no power in the world either to influence or direct.</P>
    <P>We have got to realise that we can neither talk nor wish ourselves into prosperity, that ignoring facts will be a short-lived and a futile form of self-pity. As I said, our basic evils are unemployment, emigration and underproduction. These problems are not problems of to-day or yesterday.  They have continued here for 40 years.  Is there anybody in this House to-day, or anybody who could come back from the grave, who would imagine that we could have said and believed in the year 1920 that, by the time an independent Irish Government had been 40 years in office, in the year 1960 our population would be less than it was 40 years ago?  But that is true.  Our population to-day is less than it was 40 years ago.  We can blame nobody else for that.  We have got to stop making excuses for ourselves.  The power of direction and correction is in our own hands.  The very fact that we take no steps to correct the position and sit quietly by, with normal &ldquo;business-as-usual&rdquo; tactics, whilst we are losing our population&mdash;and we are the only white nation in the world to lose its population&mdash;is a clear indictment of our inability to face up to the problems which threaten the existence of the nation.</P>
    <P>I saw a paragraph in the paper the other day about a meeting of Galway County Council where somebody said that the number of tinkers was increasing year by year.  I do not know whether that is true or not.  If it is, is it not a sorry comment on our position that while our population is falling the number of tinkers is increasing year by year?  And this 40 years after we got the power of self-government into our own hands!  It is not just a phenomenon but a grievous challenge to our <Col N="755" /> existence that we are the only white country in the world losing annually the entire natural increase in its population.</P>
    <P>Virtually every child in this country might as well be born in England or America as born here because that child, or at least a substitute for it, will leave the country in the form of an emigrant.  Can you imagine any other country in the world tolerating a situation in which every new-born child is virtually given away?  That is what we are doing.  We are not actually giving the child away but we are giving away a substitute for the child.  The child's father, brother or sister is going.  That is what is happening in a situation over which we have the power of adjustment.</P>
    <P>My complaint is that there appears to be no plan in sight to stop this mass emigration.  A balanced Budget still represents our highest sights in the economic field.  The little embroidery gifts, such as in this Budget, represent the best we can do in the social and human fields.  I see no proposal on the horizon, no evidence of any change calculated to arrest this mass emigration which, I think, is going on to-day at a more accelerated rate than during the past two years.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from a constituent the other day.  While I think he exaggerates the situation, he said that if many more people left his village there would be no need for Civic Guards or clergymen so few would be the population. That is an exaggeration.  But the fact that he felt impelled, because of what he sees happening all round him, to make a comment of that kind shows the stage of depression which is being reached by people who are witnessing the outpouring of the youngest and more virile of our people, leaving those who are aged and for whom the residue of the working population must necessarily make provision under social welfare and other schemes when they no longer have the physical stamina to earn for themselves.</P>
    <P>One has only to take up to-morrow's paper and turn to the advertisements, if they are not crowded out by the <Col N="756" /> Spring Show.  There will be large advertisements that young men and young women are wanted for almost every aspect of industrial work in England, for commercial activities, transport undertakings and so on.  Substantial pay and reasonable conditions of employment are offered, and in these circumstances it is expecting too much that our people at home, especially with the standards operating in the rural areas, can withstand the temptation of advertisements of that kind.  So long as these advertisements appear and so long as we cannot raise the living standards in the rural areas, that outpouring of our people will continue.</P>
    <P>Only the young and the vigorous are going.  The elderly people are remaining here.  But in many respects there is evidence all over the country that emigration is taking on a new aspect, that, assured by those who have preceded them that there is a good living for them in England, whole families are now abandoning their homes, going to England and settling down there to be lost permanently to the Irish nation. Therefore, when Deputy Booth complains that people are not eating as much bread as they previously ate and when Deputy Ryan says that less and less of certain commodities is being consumed, it is because the consumption of these commodities which previously took place here is now taking place in England.  The bread, cheese and butter that used to be eaten here are now being eaten in England.  The footwear that used to be bought and worn here is now bought and worn in England.  Our population is declining and our home market falling, and all that is due to the fact that our emigration continues at an unprecedented rate.</P>
    <P>While these endemic problems crowd around us, we see emerging in Europe two rival trade blocs to neither of which we belong.  While we talk prosperity here at home through the Budget, our status in Europe is of an entirely different character.  In Europe we are numbered among the five under-developed countries.  In fact, a new appellation has been applied to us; we are now one of the &ldquo;Forgotten Five.&rdquo;  Anybody who examines the possibility of a trade war between these <Col N="757" /> two groups in Europe or even the possibility of co-operation between them at a time when we are not a member of either must be alarmed at the reaction these groups are capable of having on our economy.  Only time will tell what this means for us.</P>
    <P>As far as our position in the British market is concerned, the British have already been compelled to make substantial concessions to Denmark in respect of bacon, and she may be compelled or induced to make other concessions in the agricultural field. In any case, her membership of the Free Trade Seven will oblige her to give substantial tariff reductions to the other six members constituting the Stockholm Seven so that, as far as our exports to the British market are concerned, they will have to compete more and more with the exports of those countries, until ultimately a day will be reached when they will have to compete with them on the same terms, instead of having the preferences which they now enjoy under our Trade Agreements with Britain.</P>
    <P>That is a situation which we cannot control.  It is just a bleat to lament these things because we can do nothing about them.  These events are taking place.  They will be shaped by the respective countries in accordance with their own needs and requirements and there is nothing we can do at this distance to direct the course of events in our favour, nor can we tell half of Europe not to make these changes because they would hurt us.  None of these countries owes us a living and we have got to stop blaming them for our misfortunes at home.  What we have to do is to meet, as far as our resources and ingenuity permit, the challenge which is emerging from the development, the existence and the growth of these two powerful trade groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to have told us in the course of his Budget speech what exactly we are doing to meet the challenge from these two powerful groups.  The Budget, however, does not tell us and I do not see any organised or co-ordinated plan to deal with these basic problems, whether inside or outside the country.  Apart <Col N="758" /> from that vital trade competition, which may affect us more profoundly than anything else has done for the last 40 years, we still have our old enemies&mdash;unemployment, emigration and underdevelopment&mdash;permanently present in our midst.  I think the solution of these problems is vital, not only to the Government Party but to each and every Party in the country. These are national problems which call for solution.  These are not just Party problems and on whether we solve them or not will depend the standard of living of our people.  Not only that, if we fail to solve them, and fail to equip ourselves to meet the events taking place in a developing Europe, then the whole viability of the Irish economy may be called into question.</P>
    <P>If I complain that these problems exist it is not for the purpose of apportioning blame as between one Government and another.  It is to warn against any feeling of self-satisfaction or complacency whilst these problems continue with us.  A small development which results in the export eventually of any particular commodity this year or next year, or some bright momentary spark on the industrial or agricultural horizon, are small things compared with the basic problems which remain unsolved.  As I said, their solution calls for the utilisation of every grain of ingenuity that can be mobilised.  For 40 years various Parties in this House with various policies, various programmes and various majorities, have sought to solve the problems but they remain there in all their pristine unity for everybody still to see, and nobody yet can say that they have a solution, or can give a date for the solution or even the mitigation of these problems in their present aggravated form.</P>
    <P>I say this with regret, as a born optimist, as one who can see our position as an island in Western Europe <i>vis-a-vis</i> our own problems and the emergence of powerful nation-shaping events in Europe, that the whole viability of this nation may well be challenged unless we can bestir ourselves to face up to the problems which confront us.  That is not just the responsibility of the Government; <Col N="759" /> it is the responsibility of all of us.  It is the responsibility of Parliament and it is the responsibility of the people.</P>
    <P>I should like to end by posing one question.  Knowing our political differences, and at the same time knowing how vital it is that the nation should survive, is it not possible to devise some type of national organisation to generate the goodwill of all Parties and a new approach to find a speedy solution and make a substantial advance towards a mitigation of these evils which are with us far too long?  It will afford little consolation to all of us if events in Europe make life more difficult here, or if they succeed in reducing our standard of living.  If that happens we have nobody to turn to except ourselves.  It may be easier to do things now while the situation does not call for any immediate alarm, whereas it may be very painful to have to reappraise the whole situation against a background in which we have no influence over the course of events which are shaping not merely the destinies of Europe but perhaps the ultimate destiny and viability of our own economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened this morning with great interest to Deputy Norton.  He has been in this House for many years.  He has been Leader of the Labour Party for many years, he was twice a Minister in a Government of this country and I must confess grave disappointment at his contribution today.  For instance, in dealing with emigration he says we have the power in our own hands to direct it or correct it, but not one word did I hear from him as to how we were to do it, or what his plan was for stopping emigration.  Even at the end of his speech, when he referred to a new approach by all Parties, he did not mention what his Party's approach would be.  Having dealt for a long time with the problem of emigration he makes a characteristic gesture, refers to these endemic problems surrounding us, and there he leaves them.  That is not good enough and I do not think that it is true or right to say that in every <Col N="760" /> respect the Government have the power to direct and correct the economy and to solve emigration and other problems which are endemic to the State.</P>
      <P>I want to give Deputy Norton and the House a few examples of the sort of thing I mean.  I want to ask why a person earning £16 a week, happy in his employment, with his own home, leaves the country and goes to America to work on a standard of living that is lower than the one he is leaving? What can the Government do about that?  What can Deputy Norton's Party, the Fianna Fáil Party or any other Party do about it?  It is no use wailing and saying that the Government have the power to direct and correct the economy.  It is true that there are houses which are empty, new houses, reconstructed houses, on fair sized farms.  It is true that over the past few years they have been locked up and that the owners have left.  It mystifies me.  This Government, this Party, has purchased the land, provided the houses at the entire expense of the State, except perhaps for £200, rearranged the land, fenced the land, put the people into economic holdings and, as soon as they have signed on the dotted line, they close up and go away.</P>
      <P>It simply is not true to say that this Government or any other Government has a complete answer to the problem of emigration.  I do not want to echo the banshee wailings of any Party, because I have great faith in the future of this country, provided the people themselves begin to realise that a Government does not take them up out of bed in the morning and put them to bed at night, that it is not the Government's responsibility, that they themselves have to do something for their own country, in their own country, and that ultimately the Government, like a sign on a road, can only point the way, provide the means, the money and the opportunity and that it is for the people themselves to grasp it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, true that we are lagging behind other European countries in the matter of industrial production. Again, Deputy Norton says <Col N="761" /> this, but he neglects to say why.  I am not for a moment accusing him of not knowing why.  He knows perfectly well.  We have neither the raw materials nor the technical know-how that European countries have.  We have to purchase the raw material and slowly and painfully acquire the technical know-how.  Over the past 12 months, this Party and this Government have made spectacular provision towards the expansion of the industrial side of our economy, but, again, it will remain for the people who are interested to avail of the Government's measures.  That, I know, is happening at the present time.</P>
    <P>More and more enterprises are being studied by the Industrial Credit Company, by Foras Tionscal and by the other bodies which are concerned with the promotion of industries, particularly in the west.  More and more money is being spent in the examination of projects and the actual setting up of projects, in sending people to Germany, France and elsewhere to acquire the technical know-how which we do not have, and on all the other things which will redeem the promise made by this Party and by other Parties that the industrial production of this country would rise in such a way as to provide the necessary alternative employment to that proportion of the people (a) who want to stay in Ireland and (b) whose emigration could be regarded as unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Another criticism that I fear I have to make is of an attitude of mind that some Irish people have and which has done us considerable damage down the years, that is, the partiality to the quick penny.  Of course, in a country which is occupied and controlled by another State for a very long time people have to accept their opportunities when they offer but, now that we have our freedom, many of our people still seem to have the same attitude of mind, even though it is their own country that they are now hurting.  When we arrange a contract for any agricultural or other product it is up to the people themselves who are parties to the contract to fulfil it honestly and in a desire to improve the prestige of the country and its products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> I do not like to give examples but there have been one or two instances in recent years where we had opportunities, from an agricultural point of view, which we threw away.  Again, it was not the fault of the Government in power or that of any Minister but the fault of the person who had the attitude of mind, &ldquo;Here is something out of which I can turn a quick penny.  I will do it and to blazes with any damage that may be done to the prestige of our country.&rdquo;  I believe that attitude of mind is changing, that people are beginning to realise that in the competitive market of to-day it is a bad policy as well as being unpatriotic to try to make a quick profit by not giving fair value.  I believe that in years to come we shall get over any unfortunate impression that might have been created about our products by a few failures on the part of people who deliberately sabotaged their own and the country's good name.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Budget and the provisions in it.  It is a great tribute to the Government that it was possible in 1960 to bring in a Budget providing the benefits and reliefs embodied in this Budget.</P>
    <P>I would particularly refer to the very important provision whereby there will be no estate duty in future on estates of less than £5,000.</P>

      <P>Before I deal with amendment No. 1, which I propose in <Col N="763" /> consequence of the point raised by Deputy McGilligan on Committee Stage, I should like to refer to another point he mentioned and explain in respect of it why I am not taking any action.  It referred to Section 10 (2) which deals with disclosure of information obtained by virtue of the powers conferred by Part II of the Bill.  Deputy McGilligan suggested that disclosure of information by an authorised officer should not be the subject of any action against him, if the disclosure is given for the purpose of legal proceedings.  He suggested that that should be sufficient protection for any authorised officer and, therefore, paragraph (a) of subsection (2) is not necessary, that is, &ldquo;a communication made by an authorised officer in the execution of his duties under this Part of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) is intended to deal with disclosure of information by the authorised officer to his own Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce, which information would be necessary to enable the Minister and, if necessary, the Attorney General to decide whether or not a prosecution should be made against an individual.  I am advised that for that purpose paragraph (a) should be continued in subsection (2), as well as paragraph (b).  I think that should satisfy Deputy McGilligan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second major point made by the Deputy and which is the subject of amendment No. 1 was that in Section 6 the powers of regulation conferred on the Minister were too wide in so far as they permitted the Minister to make orders for regulation and control in respect of sale upon credit as opposed to credit-sales.  Deputy McGilligan's point was that &ldquo;credit-sales&rdquo; is a term which is well known and which is, in general, part of the hire purchase code, that sale upon credit is far too wide.  While he did not give this instance, perhaps, I could give the example of the procuring by a housewife of groceries upon credit, perhaps, by paying her bill at the end <Col N="764" /> of a month or even at the end of a week.  The definition as it stands would catch such transactions and it is not the intention of the Bill so to catch them.  For that purpose, I propose to have Section 6 amended by submitting the amendment now before the House.  The point made by Deputy McGilligan was a good one and I think I have met it in this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, as the Minister says, improves the section and we agree to it.  Could I inquire at this stage from the Minister if it is clear from sections 9 and 10 that officers who visit premises are confined entirely to hire-purchase transactions and any matters connected with hire-purchase, or is it possible that they could investigate other matters not covered in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is clear now that the officer's inspection would be confined to such matters, but when I agree with the Deputy in this respect, I should like to use the term &ldquo;hire-purchase&rdquo; in a broader sense to include credit-sales and the letting of goods in circumstances which might indicate there was an attempt to evade regulations made to control hire-purchase.  If I might expand that, during the period of the operation of the order made under the Supplies and Services Act of 1956 and even under the current restrictions on hire-purchase in Britain, the intention was to ensure that the letting of goods, say, for a period of 12 months at a certain rental, would not ultimately evolve into hire-purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suppose goods were let for a period of 12 months at half-a-crown a week and at the end of 12 months, the owner of the goods, the person letting them, said: &ldquo;I have so many of your half-crowns.  I shall treat that as a deposit and from now on it will be an ordinary hire-purchase transaction.&rdquo;  The intention is to ensure that such transactions will be caught by the regulations and to ensure that there will be no evasion of the Act.  Therefore, when I say that the activities of the investigating officers will be confined to hire-purchase, I should like the Deputy to <Col N="765" /> understand that it includes such transactions as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 39 and 40 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 5 of the Principal Act shall not apply in relation to hire-purchase agreements made after the commencement of this Act in respect of plant or machinery (other than mechanically propelled vehicles) which is intended for use in an industrial process and the cash price (within the meaning of section 3 of the Principal Act) of which exceeds two hundred pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommittal is necessary in respect of this amendment because it involves a new matter which did not arise on Committee Stage.  This amendment arises as a result of a suggestion by the Industrial Credit Company having regard to their experience of creating hire-purchase facilities for the provision of industrial machinery.  Under the 1946 Act, it was provided that a person who had goods on hire-purchase <Col N="766" /> could at a certain stage return the goods and absolve himself from any further liability.  He could return the goods as long as he paid any arrears of rentals due at the time of the termination and as long as any payments he had made, including all arrears and otherwise, made up half the hire-purchase price.  For instance, in the case of a radio if a person, having paid half the hire-purchase price, could terminate the hire-purchase agreement and return the radio, the owner of the goods would then have the benefit of the repayments and of the return of the article hired.</P>
    <P>In the case of industrial machinery, and particularly industrial machinery of a very specialised character, it would be inequitable, to say the least of it, if a person, having used the machinery for a short period, and having paid half his hire purchase commitments, were permitted to return the machinery then, and more particularly in the case of machinery subject to a high degree of obsolescence.  It would be impossible for the owner, in this case, let us say, the Industrial Credit Company, to realise anything near the outstanding value of the machinery, perhaps because of the limited market, or perhaps because of the degree of obsolescence from which the machinery had suffered in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The intention is, therefore, to introduce a section to take out of the Act hire-purchase agreements in respect of industrial machinery for that reason. I think it is a sound reason and, if the amendment were not adopted, the danger would be that the Industrial Credit Company, having regard to their experience in such matters, would have to restrict the facilities they offer to industrial firms in this respect.</P>

    <P>£7,657,987 méid iomlán an Mheastacháin don bhliain 1960/61 agus, tar éis Leithreasuithe-i-gCabhair a bhaint de, is é £7,472,740 a ghlan-mhéid. Sin £742,661 níos mó ná glan-mhéid an Mheastacháin don bhliain 1959/60 mar mhéadaigh sé féin de shuim £6,179 a aistríodh ón Vóta le haghaidh Luach Saothair i leith méaduithe pá na Stát-Seirbhíse. <Col N="768" /> Caithfear cur san áireamh, áfach, méid breise de £32,000 a vótáladh le déanaí i leith méaduithe pá an Airm agus nach dtaispeántar in Imleabhar na Meastachán.  Dá bharr sin, is é £710,661 agus ní hé £742,661 an méadú.</P>
    <P>Is í an chuid is mó den Mheastachán na Soláthairtí atá ann do phá, do liúntais agus do chothabháil na mBunn-Óglach.  Tá na soláthartaí sin roinnte ar fho-mhírchinn áirithe agus, i bhfigiúirí móra, is ionann iad san iomlán beagnach £4,700,000 nó tuairim is 63 faoin gcéad de ghlan-mhéid an Mheastacháin.  Faoi mar a thárla sna blianta roimhe seo, rinneadh amach an Meastachán, sa mhéid go mbaineann sé leis na Buan-Óglaigh, ar fhoras lán-Bhunaíocht Shíochána de 1,325 oifigeach agus 11,561 fear agus ansin, rinneadh laghduithe ar na figiúirí sin i leith na n-uimhreacha ar dócha ar dá réir a bheidh an Bhunaíocht féin faoi bhun lín i rith na bliana.</P>
    <P>Fagann sin, dáiríre, go bhfuil soláthar á dhéanamh leis an Meastachán do líon glan-mhéanach de 1,152 oifigeach, 79 dalta agus 8,250 fear de na Cóir agus de na Seirbhísí uile.  Tá beartaithe meán-líon de 8,250 fear a bheith ann i rith na bliana 1960/61&mdash; is é sin, 250 níos mó ná an meán-líon dá ndearnadh soláthar le Vóta na bliana 1959/60.  Fiú amháin leis an líon méadaithe beidh na Buan-Óglaigh lán-gnóthach chun na dualgais breise a bhaineann leis an bhFórsa Cosanta Áitiúil maraon lena bhfuil riachtanach maidir le traenáil agus gnáth-riarachán an Airm a chómh-líonadh.  £72,260 agus é roinnte ar fuaid an Mheastacháin, a chosnóidh an dá chéad agus caoga fear.</P>
    <P>Amhail ón 15ú lá de mhí na Nollag seo caite, ta rátaí méadaithe pá i bhfeidhm d'Óglaigh na hÉireann.

    <P>I rith na bliana seo caite, lean an mheanmnacht, an t-iompar agus an araíonacht de bheith sásúil i ngach brainse d'Óglaigh na hÉireann.  Bhí an earcaíocht go sásúil freisin agus dá bhárr sin, feadadh an meán-líon de 8,000 fear dá ndearnadh soláthar le Vóta na bliana 1959/60 a choimeád. Tógadh isteach tuilleadh earcach faoi na Scéimeanna do Phrintísigh agus dóibh sin a tháinig isteach go lom díreach agus, lena chois sin, liostáladh roinnt fear le déanaí lena dtraenáil mar shuirbhéirí i gComplacht Suirbhéireachta an Chóir Innealtóirí.  Maidir leis an gCúltaca, bhí mion-mhéaduithe ar líon an Chúltaca Oifigeach (An Chéad Líne) agus sna lín éifeachtacha den Fhórsa Cosanta Áitiúil agus den Slua Muirí.  Tá laghdú ar líon éifeachtach an Chúltaca Fear (An Chéad Líne).  Níor mhiste a rá gur ar an méid daoine a aistrítear ón mBuan-Fhórsa a bhíonn líon an Chéad Líne ag brath, aon am áirithe.</P>

    <P>Ar an lú Deireadh Fómhair seo <Col N="770" /> caite, tháinig an scéim i bhfeidhm chun An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil agus na Buan-Óglaigh a chónascadh go hiomlán le chéile.  Tríd is tríd agus mar is eol do Theachtaí, is é cuspóir na Scéime sin, eagraíocht a sholáthar d'Oglaigh na hÉireann in am síochána trína bhféadfaidh siad, ar shlógadh dóibh, fórsa a chur ar machaire, a bheidh níos mó agus níos oiriúnaí ná mar ab fhéidir roimhe seo.  De thoradh an chónasctha sin, bunaíodh trí bhriogáid nua agus aonaid eile machaire.  Is í tábhach na scéime nua seo nach dócha, i gcás cogadh domhanda a theacht, go mbeidh mórán ama ann chun féachaint d'eagrú agus do thraenáil tar éis don chogadh briseadh amach.</P>
    <P>Athrú bunúsach is ea an scéim uirthi sin a bhí ann cheana.  Táthar tar éis beart nua a thabhairt le déanamh don Fhórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, is é sin, an chuid is mó de phearsanra na n-aonad comhraic a chur ar fáil. Tá a lán nua-aonad comhraic tar éis a n-eagrú sna cóir éagsúla agus ní foláir, anois, iadsin a thraenáil agus a dhéanamh oiriúnach chun a n-ionaid a thógaint leis na briogáidí nuachumtha agus, i gcásanna áirithe, leis na briogáidí a bhí ann cheana.  Is é is mó a thagann de sin gur gá don Fhórsa Cosanta Áitiúil anois bheith oilte ar a lán arm nua a láimhseáil. Cuirfear ar lucht gach céime san FCÁ bheith eolgach ar oirbheartaíocht agus are theicníc a n-aonad nua i slí go gcothófar go seasta, an comhar sin atá ró-riachtanach i gcogadh na haimsire seo.</P>
    <P>De thoradh an fháis atá ag teacht ar an FCÁ leis na blianta, tá ar chumas an fhórsa sin anois an obair thábhachtach nua seo a ghabháil de láimh agus a dhéanamh go héifeachtúil. Tá a lán oifigeach agus fear eile de na Buan-Óglaigh tar éis a gceaptha chun na haonaid nua den FCÁ a thraenáil.  Is dá thoradh sin, an chuid is mó den mhéadú de £15,848 ar Fho-Mhírcheann G&mdash;Liúntas Cothaithe agus Liúntais eile agus is dá thoradh sin, freisin, cuid den mhéadú de £14,164 ar Fho-Mhírcheann H&mdash;Trúpaí a Iompar. Táthar tar éis áiseanna agus <Col N="771" /> modhanna nua traenála a scrúdú agus a thástáil chun a áirithiú go mbainfear an tairbhe is mó is féidir as tréimhsí traenála an FCÁ.  Tugadh an obair sin chun críche gan aon mhéadú ar líon bunaíochta na mBuan-Óglach.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh Scéim an Chónasctha i bhfeidhm le linn na tréimhse nach raibh traenáil an FCÁ faoi lán seoil. Caitheadh an chuid is mó de na míonna seo a ghabh tharainn ar na haonaid nua a bhunú agus ar chaoi a thabhairt don phearsanra eolas a chur ar na hairm nua.  De réir gach comhartha, éireoidh go maith leis an Scéim agus táthar lán-mhuiníneach go bhfuil bonn daingean leagtha anois ar a gcuirfear eagraíocht chomhraic éifeachtúil ar fáil.  De thoradh an chónasctha, ardaíodh 102 Chaptaen chun bheith ina gCeannfoirt.  Is é seo an chéad uair ag oifigigh den Fhórsa céim shinsearach a bheith acu.</P>
    <P>Níor mhiste a rá, de dhroim an chónasctha, go bhfuil á bhreithniú faoi láthair éide chaighdeánach de dhearadh nua a thabhairt isteach don dá bhrainse d'Óglaigh na hÉireann.</P>

Agus ag iarraidh dúinn aerárthaí nua a sholáthar in ionad na meaisíni &ldquo;Spitfire&rdquo;, caithfimid coimeád i gcuimhne nach bhfuil <Col N="773" /> ar fáil a thuilleadh lena gceannach sa scaird-aois seo, aerárthaí traenála ardchéime den saghas neamh-scairde nó loine.  Ar ndóigh, fiú amháin le haghaidh traenála bunchéime, is amhlaidh atá scaird-eitleáin á bhforbairt agus á n-úsáid anois i dtíortha áirithe.  Is gné bhunúsach d'eagraíocht an Aer-Chóir, Scéim an gCoimisiún Gearr-Sheirbhíse, agus is príomhchuspóir na Scéime sin, píolótaí a chur ar fáil chun folúntais in Aer-Lingus a líonadh.  Níl aon eagraíocht náisiúnta eile ann go fóill, ar aon chuma, óna bhféadfaí píolótaí den saghas sin a fháil agus, ar an ábhar sin, tá sé fíorriachtanach leanúint den scéim a oibriú go héifeachtach.  Chun léargas éigin a thabhairt ar a tábhacht sin, is leor a rá gur scaoileadh sé phíolóta dhéag den Aer-Chór so bhliain 1959-60 amháin chun dul ar seirbhís le hAer-Lingus.  Agus ó 1952 i leith, scaoileadh timpeall le sé phíolóta is tríocha ar fad chun folúntais a líonadh sa Chuideachta sin.</P>
    <P>Ós mar sin atá an scéal, tá beartaithe trí cinn eile de Scaird-Eitleáin &ldquo;Vampire&rdquo; a cheannach.  Tá soláthar ina chomhair déanta i bhFo-Mhírcheann O&mdash;Stórais Ghinearálta&mdash; agus tá an soláthar sin ina chúis le £147,000 den mhéadú de £169,470 ar an bhFo-Mhírcheann sin.  Tá an chuid eile den mhéadú inchurtha i leith an riachtanais a bhaineann le trealamh Comharthaíochta chomh maith le trealamh agus uirlisí eile a bhfuil géar-ghá leo, a cheannach.</P>
    <P>I dteannta aer-thraenáil agus dualgais mhíleata eile a chomhlíonadh dó, b'fhéidir nár mhiste a lua anseo go gcuireann an tAer-Chór seirbhísí fóntacha ar fáil do Ranna eile Stáit.  I gcúrsaí grianghrafachta, d'oibrigh sé ar feadh na bliana i gcomhar leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta, an Roinn Tailte, an Roinn Poist agus Teileagraf, Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí agus an tSuirbhéireacht Gheolaíochta i mórán aerghrianghraf&mdash;tuairim is 4,000 díobh&mdash; a thógaint agus a chur ar fáil i dtaca le scéimeanna móra a iniúchadh agus a chur chun cinn.  Bíonn an Cór ar glaoch rialta freisin chun cuidiú leis an Roinn Iompair agus Cumhachta i dTrealamh Cabhair-Loingseoireachta a thástáil ag Aerfoirt na Sionainne agus <Col N="774" /> Bhaile Uí Choileáin agus, lena chois sin, chun cleachtadh a thabhairt do lucht oibrithe an Radar Shibhialta sna háiteanna sin.</P>
    <P>Lean An tSeirbhís Ghabhlaigh de bheith ag caomhnú na hiascaireachta i rith na bliana.  De dhroim na mbonn-línte nua arna n-údarú faoin Acht um Dhlínse Mhuirí a thabhairt isteach ar an lú Eanáir seo caite, méadaíodh go mór an réimhse farraige nó na huiscí is gá a chaomhnú. Tagann de sin, ar ndóigh, gur méadaíodh ar chúram agus ar dhualgais na Seirbhíse Cabhlaigh, freisin.  Rinneadh mór-athghléasadh ar L.E.  Maev le déanaí agus, anois, tá trí chairbhéid fhóntacha ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an iascaireacht faoi lán seoil amach ón gcósta thoir theas i dtosach na bliana seo, bhí dhá chairbhéid ar fáil chun faire bhuan a dheanamh ar an líomatáiste.</P>
    <P>Tá socair go ngabhfaidh An tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh de lámh, ón lú Aibreán amach, teachtaireachtaí muirghuaise a ghlacadh agus a chraobhscaoileadh agus, fós, na bearta tarrthála nach mór a dhéanamh dá ndeasca sin, a chomhoirniú.  Roimhe seo, ba é cúram na Roinne Iompair agus Cumhachta an tseirbhís sin a chur ar fáil.  Ina thaobh sin, tá socruithe á gcríochnú chun go ndéanfar an comhoirniú is gá leis an Roinn Poist agus Teileagraf, leis an nGarda Síochána agus leis na comhlachtaí eile lena mbaineann an scéal.</P>
    <P>Socraíodh tuairim is dhá bhliain ó shin go mbeadh ar dhaltaí nua na Seirbhíse Cabhlaigh a dtraenáil go léir mar dhaltaí a dhéanamh sa tír seo.  Roimhe sin, ba ghá daltaí a chur go Fundúireachtaí Cabhlaigh Shasana chun a dtraenáil thosaigh a dhéanamh.  Ach leis an méadú a bhí ag teacht ar éifeachtúlacht na Seirbhíse agus mar gheall ar an taithí a bhí á fáil ag na hoifigigh de thoradh traenála agus cúrsaí a dhéanamh cois baile agus amuigh, measadh nár ghá a thuilleadh, leanúint den nós sin. Leagadh amach scéim traenála trína socraítear go ndéanann Daltaí Cabhlaigh a dtraenáil céad-bhliana sa Choláiste Mileata i bhfara le Daltaí Airm céad-bhliana agus dtraenáil dara bliana sa Scoil Chabhlaigh in Inis <Col N="775" /> Sionnach.  Tá an tathrú an-oiriúnach sin i bhfeidhm anois agus, dá bharr, thosaigh an tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh ar a céad scata de cheathrar dalta a thraenáil in Inis Sionnach, lá Feabhra seo caite.</P>
    <P>Ar nós an Fhórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, fanann An Slua Muirí ar lán-líon agus leanann sé de fheabhas a chur ar a thraenáil.</P>
    <P>Mar a fheicfidh Teachtaí, tá méadú de £96,520 ar Fho-Mhírcheann P-Trealamh Cosantach.  Téann £19,522 den mhéid sin chun méadú ar thabhairt-anonn a ghlanadh, is é sin, stórais a ordaíodh ach nár díoladh astu&mdash;toisc seachadadh moillithe&mdash; roimh an 31ú Márta, 1960.  Sa bhFo-Mhírcheann seo, is í an phríomh-mhír agus an t-aon mhír nua amháin, an soláthar de £50,000 atá á dhéanamh chun roinnt arm nua fritanc de mheánraon agus lón lámhaigh nach raibh againn cheana, a cheannach.  Is leor chun riachtanais traenána na huaire an méid atá á cheannach ach ní leor é dá mbeidh ag teastáil ó Óglaigh na hÉireann ar ball.  Is chuige, i gcoitinne, an chuid eile den mhéadú ar an bhFo-Mhírcheann&mdash;is é sin, timpeall le £27,000 chun costas méadaithe na n-arm agus an lóin lámhaigh a ghlanadh, nithe nár ceannaíodh ach fíorbheagán díobh le blianta beaga anuas.</P>
    <P>I rith na bliana airgeadais 1959/60 críochnaíodh agus osclaíodh Lútharlann Nua sa Churrach, b'ionann is criochnuithe Halla Nua Bia agus Cocús in Áth Luain agus tosaoidh ar cheithre cinn is fiche de cheathrúnapósta a chur suas do shaighdiúirí i gCorcaigh.  Sa Churrach, críochnaíodh an Eaglais nua Chaitliceach a thóg Coimisinéirí na nOibreacha Poiblí agus, lena chois sin, meastar go mbeidh Halla Nua Bia agus Cocús atá á dtógáil i nDún Phluincéid ag na Coimisinéirí, freisin, ullamh lena n-áitiú i mbliana.  Leantar d'aire a thabhairt do thaitneamhachtaí eile a chur ar fáil do shaighdiúirí atá ina gcónaí sna beairice, freisin, agus is é sin is mó is cúis leis na méaduithe de £10,780 ar Fho-Mhírcheann R agus de £13,955 ar Fho-Mhírcheann V.  Ní bheidh ach dea-thoradh ar na taitneamhachtaí seo go huile a chur ar fáil, agus is léir gurb é leas na ndaoine <Col N="776" /> atá ina gcónaí iontu, na tithe maithe a cuireadh suas cheana féin i mBaile Átha Cliath, sa Churrach agus in Áth Luain.</P>
    <P>Den mhéid iomlán de 1,599 bhfostaí, dá bhfuil soláthar déanta faoi Fho-Mhírcheann C, beidh 988 nduine acu ar fostú leis an gCór Innealtóirí, go mór mór, ar aireachasú agus cothabháil na bhfundúireachtaí agus na mbeairicí atá ann faoi láthair agus ar oibreacha nua i dtaca le maoin mhíleata.  Is méadú beag é sin ar an bhfigiúr don bhliain 1959/60.  Is ceardaithe, fir oibre, stórálaithe, cléirigh, clóscríobhaithe, etc., atá ar fostú leis na Cóir éagsúla, an cuid eile de 611. Tá laghdú ar an uimhir atá á soláthar don tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh de bharr mór-athghléasadh na gcairbhéidí a bheith críocnaithe.</P>
    <P>Tá beartaithe go rachaidh Foireann Mharcaíochta an Airm sna comórtais léimní mar ba ghnáth, ar an Mór-Roinn, sna Stáit Aontaithe agus cois baile i mbliana, agus dá dhroim sin, tá soláthar déanta i bhFo-Mhírcheann A. 2&mdash;Caiteachais Fhoirne Marcaíochta ag Taispeántais Chapall&mdash;chun £10,000 a chaitheamh ina leith, is é sin, méadú de £7,500.</P>
    <P>Le roinnt bliana anuas, tá aire ar leith á tabhairt do fheabhas a chur ar Fhoireann Mharcaíochta an Airm. Tá sé an-deacair foireann mhaith a bhunú i ndálaí an lae inniu ach ní mór bheith foighneach san obair agus cuimhneamh air go &ldquo;mbeireann buan bua&rdquo;.  Is deimhin liom go bhfuil dul ar aghaidh á dhéanamh agus go bhfuil againn anois lárlíon de chapaill agus de mharcaigh sár-mhaithe a bhfuil ar a gcumas, ach cuid den ádh a rith leo, cáil a bhaint amach dóibh féin san am le teacht.</P>
    <P>De thoradh an tsoláthair mhéadaithe a rinneadh anuraidh chun capaill a cheannach, cuireadh ar chumas Bord Ceannaithe na gCapall sé cinn d'ainmhithe a cheannach ar luachanna Ó £500 go £1,500.  Ainmhí óg ab ea beagach gach ceann acu sin, áfach, agus iad i ngá le tréimhse fhada traenála, agus, dá dheasca sin, tógfaidh sé cúpla bliain chun a bhfuil ar a gcumas mar léimeadóirí ag taispeántais idirnáisiúnta a thabhairt chun cinn.  Ba mhór an mhaith don Scoil Eachaíochta <Col N="777" /> anois cúpla léimeadóir a bheith inti ab eol a bheith thar barr ach is beag an chosúlacht go mbeidh a leithéidí le fáil.  Is é is dóichí go mbeidh orainn dul sa seans le hainmhithe óga agus, trí thriail agus cuileáil, féachaint le foireann de léimeadóirí fíor-mhaithe a chur le chéile, ach leanfaidh Bord Ceannaithe na gCapall de bheith san airdeall ar aon léimeadóirí oiriúnacha is eol a bheith ar fheabhas agus a bheadh ullamh chun dul sna comórtais idirnáisiúnta láithreach.</P>
    <P>Le hionchas líon na marcach a bheadh ar fáil a mhéadú agus chun soláthar a dhéanamh do mharcaigh eile a theacht ina ndiaidh, coimeádadh ceithre dhaltas ar leithligh anuraidh d'iarratasóirí a mbeadh taithi acu ar mharcaíocht ach is trua nár tháinig aon iarrthóirí oiriúnacha i láthair.  Táthar ag súil leis an tairiscint chéanna a dhéanamh i mbliana.  Ba cheart go mbeadh tarraingt ag na caíonna sin ag daoine óga a bhfuil spéis acu i bhfiach nó i léimneach taispeántais mar spórt nó mar chaitheamh aimsire.  I dteannta gairm beatha a chur in áirithe tri ghlacadh leis an tairiscint, tá caoi ann freisin do dhaoine óga cáil idirnáisiúnta a bhaint amach dóibh féin, don Arm agus don tír.</P>
    <P>Tá laghdú de £10,935 ar Fho-Mhírcheann P.1.&mdash;Cosaint Shibhialta. Tá laghdú ar an soláthar a rinneadh d'éidí mar tá stoic áirithe á gcoimeád ag mo Roinnse in oirchill ar a gceannach ag na húdaráis áitiúla lena dtabhairt amach do phearsanra Cosanta Sibhialta.  Is leor na stoic sin agus na stoic laghdaithe dá ndéantar soláthar anois do riachtanais na bliana seo.  I ngach slí eile, méadaitear an soláthar atá déanta do threalamh agus do stórais i gcoitinne.  Ar na nithe móra, tá oirnéisí breise radiac chun pearsanra Cosanta Sibhialta ar fuaid na tíre a thraenáil in astitim raidighníomhach a bhrath agus a thomhas; roinnt d'innill nua-aimseartha dóiteán chun pearsanra den Fho-Sheirbhís Múchta Dóiteán a thraenáil, agus otharchóistí chun pearsanra de Sheirbhís Taismeach na Cosanta Sibhialta a thraenáil.</P>
    <P>Cé gur lú go mór ná mar is gá an méid earcach atá ag teacht isteach sa Chosaint Shibhialta, is ábhar misnigh <Col N="778" /> a fheiceáil ó fhigiúirí na n-údarás áitiúil, mar sin féin, go raibh méadú de timpeall le 1,000 ar an uimhir a tháinig isteach anuraidh.  4,800 nó mar sin, méid iomlán na ndaoine faoi láthair a thairg iad féin chun na seirbhíse seo.  I gcoitinne, tuigeann na húdaráis áitiúla go maith an gá atá le breis saorálaithe agus tá a ndícheall á dhéanamh acu chun iadsin a fháil.  Tá a coin á dhéanamh ag mo Roinnse, freisin, trí éidí agus trealamh dá lán saorálaithe, a bheith ar fáil inti.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Eagraíocht seo, an Chosaint Shibhialta, is ró-shásúil an rud é, mar a dhealraíonn anois, go bhfuil lárlíon úsáideach á bhunú ina lán bailte móra ar fuaid na tíre, ag na daoine a chuaigh isteach inti.  Bíonn Cleachtais agus Campaí Deireadh Seachtaine ar siúl ag cuid de na grúpaí sin agus, i gcontaetha áirithe, tá siad ag socrú eatarthu féin chun Cleachtais a dhéanamh le chéile.  Rud spreagúil is ea é sin agus, i mo thuairim, comhartha chomh maith go bhfuil an Eagraíocht á daingniú go teann agus bun láidir fúithi ar a bhféadfar tógáil i dtráth.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart dom a rá, freisin, go bhfuiltear ag dul ar aghaidh le pleanáil ghinearálta na Cosanta Sibhialta don Stát.  Mar shampla, sna míonna seo chugainn, táthar ag súil go mbeidh socair ag gach údarás áitiúil cad iad fo-ranna teorann an chontae-bhoirg nó an chontae, i dtaca le rialú ginearálta don Chosaint Shibhialta ina líomatáiste feidhmiúcháin.  De thoradh an cor seo sa phleanáil, is usa go mór múnla na heagraíochta i ngach contae-bhorg agus contae a thabhairt chun cinn. Fairis sin, tá a lán gnéithe eile den phleanáil á mbreithniú faoi láthair ar a n-áirítear cumarsáidí, rabhaidh a thabhairt, beartas i dtaobh scáthlán, aslonnú agus a leithéidí sin.</P>
    <P>Is chuige an obair sin chun teacht ar réitigh a fhéadfaí a chur i bhfeidhm ar na fadhbanna éagusúla a bheadh ann don tír seo, agus droch-iarsmaí cogaidh ag cur uirthi.  Go deimhin, tá an ghné seo de phleanáil na Cosanta Sibhialta ar na gnéithe is mó le rá mar, má thagann éigeandáil orainn, beidh socair againn ar a laghad, cad í an tslí is fearr ina bhféadfaimid a droch-iarsmaí ar an bpobal a mhaolú.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> Roimh dhul ar aghaidh dom ón gCosaint Shibhialta, ba cheart a rá, b'fhéidir, go ndéanfar feasta, mar a rinneadh cheana, gach cabhair agus gach misneach uaimse agus ó mo Roinn, a thabhairt go fonnmhar do na húdaráis áitiúla i gcomhlíonadh a n-oibleagáidí reachtúla.</P>
    <P>Tagann na hoibleagáidí i gceist faoi na hAchtanna um Réamh-chúram in aghaidh Aer-Ruathar, a thugann ar na húdaráis áitiúla a ullmhú agus a chur i bhfeidhm maidir lena líomatáistí feidhmiúcháin féin, scéimeanna chun daoine agus maoin a chaomhnú ar dhíobháil nó damáiste i gcás amas ón aer agus chun iarsmaí na díobhála nó an damáiste sin a mhaolú.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana, tuigeann formhór na n-údarás áitiúil a bhfuil ceangailte orthu de réir dlí ina thaobh sin agus tá siad ag obair i gcomhar iomlán le mo Roinnse ag iarraidh bearta éifeachtúla i dtaca leis an gCosaint Shibhialta a chur á ndéanamh.</P>
    <P>Is eol dom áfach, ó thuairiscí a bhí sna nuachtáin le déanaí, agus is dona an scéal é, gur dhiúltaigh cúpla údarás áitiúil do sholáthar ar bith nó do sholáthar cothrom a dhéanamh ina meastacháin le haghaidh na Cosanta Sibhialta sa bhliain atá romhainn.  De réir na dtuairiscí adúradh, nochtadh tuairimí áirithe á phléadáil nach ceart go n-iarrfaí ar an údarás aitiúil aon cuid de ohostas na Cosanta Sibhialta a íoc.</P>
    <P>Dúradh, mar shampla, gur ceart go ndéanfadh an tArm an obair seo.  Taispeánann dearcadh den sórt sin nach bhfuil eolas ar bith ag na daoine sin ar an gCosaint Shibhialta&mdash;eagraíocht arb é a bun agus a barr, an pobal a eagrú agus a thraenáil ina nduine is ina nduine i slí go bhféadfaidh siad, iad féin, a gclanna agus a gcomharsana a chaomhnú ar na contúirtí a ghabhann le cogadh eithneach.  Má thagann cogadh den sórt sin, is é rud is tábhachtaí ina thaobh, oiread daoine agus is féidir a thabhairt slán as agus, mura ndéanfaidh na daoine an t-ullmhúchan is gá chun iad féin a chosaint, go mór mór ar an astitim raidighníomhach, is ró-mhairg dóibh ar uair na héigne.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> Ní fhéadfadh an tArm na feidhmeanna go léir a bhaineann leis an gCosaint Shibhialta a chomhlíonadh. Tá a lán do na feidhmeanna sin cosúil le seirbhísí a chuirtear ar fáil ag na húdaráis áitiúila de ghnáth, fiú amháin in am síochána agus, orthu sin tá :&mdash; daoine breoite agus daoine gortaithe a chur in ospidéal; múchadh dóiteán; tithe a chur ar fáil do dhaoine a bheadh i ngá leo; cabhrú le daoine i gcruatan; is é sin le rá, feidhmeanna a mbaineann gach ceann acu le fóirithint ar dhaoine agus le maoin a shábháil; a dhéantar ag na húdaráis áitiúla mar chuid de ghnáth-obair an lae; agus nárbh fholáir a mhéadú go mór i gcás cogadh a theacht.  Is ar éigin is gá a rá nach bhféadfadh an tArm na dualgais sin a chur díobh.</P>
    <P>Ar chuma ar bith, is cosaint ghníomhach príomh-fheidhm an Airm agus is chuige sin a eagrú agus a thraenáil.  Dá dtagadh cogadh, chaithfí an tArm a leathnú agus a mhéadú go mór chun go bhféadfadh sé a phríomh-ghnó a dhéanamh agus, dá dhroim sin, ní bheadh ar a chumas cúram na Cosanta Sibhialta a thógaint air féin.  Ní ionann sin is a rá dá dtarlaíodh, i gcás amas ón aer, an tArm a bheith saor ó ghníomhaiochtaí eile, nach dtabharfadh sé gach cabhair ab fhéidir do lucht na Cosanta Sibhialta.  Ach dá bhféadfaimís bheith cinnte féin go mbeadh an tArm ar fáil chuige sin, níor lú an gá Cosaint Shibhialta a bheith ann, go mór mór sa mhéid go mbaineann le bardaigh, múchadh dóiteán, an tSeirbhís Taismeach agus an tSeirbhís Leasa.</P>
    <P>Cé gur cheart liom an argóint sin a bhréagnú go bhféadfadh nó gur chóir go bhféadfadh an tArm amháin bheith freagrach sa Chosaint Shilhialta, caithfear cuimhneamh ar an ní tábhachtach seo gur cuma cad iad na tuairimí atá ag corr-chomhaltaí de na húdaráis áitiúla nó cad í an dilseacht lena nochtar iad, ní dhéanann siad difríocht dá laghad don dlí atá ann sa scéal.  Tiocfaidh de bhearta den sórt atá luaite agam, ní amháin drochthoradh ar na hiarrachtaí mall-réidhe atá á ndéanamh chun an lárlíon is lú d'Eagraíocht Chosanta Sibhialta a chur ar a bhoinn, ach rud níos measa fós, is é sin, baint ó mhisneach na <Col N="781" /> saorálaithe atá toilteanach a n-am saor a chaitheamh le traenáil Chosanta Sibhíalta.</P>
    <P>Ba mhór an dochar a dhéanfaí don éifeachtúlacht agus den mheanmnacht dá gceaptaí nach raibh na Comhlachtaí atá freagrach sa tseirbhís seo, fabhrach don Chosaint Shíbhialta.  Agus cé go bhfuil mé muiníneach go leanfaidh na húdaráis áitiúla dá gcion féin a dhéanamh go héifeachtach san obair seo, is féidir go mbeidh orm an beart a bhreithniú ba ghá a dhéanamh i gcásanna nach bhfuil na hoibleagáidí reachtúla á gcomhlíonadh.</P>
    <P>Tá an méid £15,450 atá á sholáthar i bhFo-Mhírcheann X3 mar dheontas-i-gcabhair do Chumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann £2,500 níos lí ná an méid a soláthraíodh anuraidh.  Gach bliain, bíonnan deontas-i-gcabhair is gá ag brath ar na gníomhaíochtaí is dealraitheach a mbeidh an Cumann páirteach iontu agus, lena chois sin, an méid airgid a mbíonn sé féin ag súil lena bhailiú.  Ar an bhfigiúr de £15,450 i meastacháin na bliana seo, áirítear £10,000 i leith imeachtaí laethúla an Chumainn; £5,000 mar chothabháil ar ghrúpa de Dhídeanaithe Bán-Ruiseacha ón tSín Thuaidh, a bhfuil ocht nduine dhéag díobh faoi chúram an Chumainn anois sa Teach ar a dtugtar &ldquo;Naomh Aindrias&rdquo; i Ráth Maonais; agus tá £450 ann mar shíntiús ón Stát do Choiste Idirnáisiúnta na Croise Deirge.</P>
    <P>Leanann An Cumann dá obair inmholta&mdash;ag tabhairt faoiseamh do dhaoine i gcruatan agus i nguais. Ghabh sé air féin an achainí a dhéanamh ar son na nDídeanaithe Domhanda, agus tugadh deontas le déanaí mar fhóirithint ar dhaoine i ngátar éis an crith talún tubaisteach i Maracó.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil cur síos déanta agam anois ar phríomh-ghnéithe an Mheastacháin agus, le linn dom an díospóireacht a chur chun críche, beidh áthas orm aon eolas eile is gá a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>The gross Estimate for 1960/61 is £7,657,987, and the net Estimate, after deduction of Appropriations-in-Aid, is £7,472,740.  This is an increase of £742,661 over the net Estimate for <Col N="782" /> 1959/60 as itself increased by a transfer of £6,179 from the Vote for remuneration in respect of Civil Service pay increases.  There must also be taken into account, however, the supplementary amount of £32,000 recently voted in respect of the increases in Army pay and not shown in the Estimates volume.  Therefore, the increase is one of £710,661 rather than £742,661.</P>
    <P>The major portion of the Estimate is accounted for by the provisions for the pay, allowances and maintenance of na Buan-Óglaigh.  These provisions are spread over a number of subheads and total, in round figures, almost £4,700,000 or about 63% of the net Estimate.  As in previous years, the Estimate, in relation to Na Buan-Óglaigh, is framed on the basis of the full peace establishment of 1,325 officers and 11,561 men, deductions being then made in respect of the numbers by which the actual strength during the year is likely to be below the establishment.  In effect, the Estimate caters for a net average strength of 1,152 officers, 79 cadets and 8,250 men of all Corps and Services.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to maintain an average strength of 8,250 men during 1960/61&mdash;an increase of 250 on the average strength for which the Vote for 1959/60 provided.  Even with the increased numbers na Buan-Óglaigh will be fully taxed to carry out the increased duties in connection with An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, coupled with the demands of training and normal military administration.  The cost of the 250 men, spread over the Estimate, is £72,260.</P>
    <P>As from the 15th December last, increased rates of pay and allowances have come into operation for Óglaigh na hÉireann.  These, together with the increases for the Civil Service staff of the Department and civilians employed with the Forces, account for approximately £440,000 or almost 60% of the net increase in the Estimate.  The increases are shown or embodied in Subhead A&mdash;Pay; Subhead B&mdash;Marriage Allowance ; Subhead C&mdash;Pay of Civilians attached to Units ; Subhead E&mdash;Pay of Officers of the Medical Corps, etc.; Subhead K&mdash;Provisions <Col N="783" /> and Allowances in lieu ; Subhead P.2&mdash; Pay of An tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh ; Subhead S.1&mdash;Pay of Crews of Transport Vessels ; Subhead Y&mdash;Departmental Salaries, etc., and Subhead Y.2&mdash;An Cúltaca.  The increases of £20,730 in Subhead M&mdash;Clothing and Equipment, and £3,471 in Subhead W&mdash;Insurance, are due mainly to the proposed increased strength.</P>
    <P>During the last year, the standard of morale, conduct, deportment and discipline continued to be satisfactory in all branches of Óglaigh na hÉireann. Recruitment was also satisfactory and enabled the average strength of 8,000 men for which the Vote for 1959/60 provided to be maintained.  There were further intakes of recruits for the various apprentice and direct entrant schemes, and a number of men were also recently recruited for training as surveyors in the Complacht Suirbhéireachta, An Cór Innealtóirí. As regards An Cúltaca, there were slight increases in the strength of An Cúltacha Oifigeach (An Chéad Líne) and the effective strengths of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí.  The effective strength of An Cúltacha Fear (An Chéad Líne) shows a decrease.  The strength of that component at any particular time depends largely, of course, on the number of transfers from the Permanent Force.</P>
    <P>Two officers are still serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation&mdash;one as Chairman of the Egyptian-Israeli Mixed Armistice Commission at Gaza and the other holding an appointment with the Israel-Syria Mixed Armistice Commission in Jerusalem.  The fifty officers who served in the Lebanon have been awarded the United Nations Medal, and the medals were presented to them recently.</P>
    <P>On 1st October last, the scheme for the complete integration of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with Na Buan-Óglaigh became operative.  The broad purpose of the scheme is, as Deputies are aware, to provide, in peacetime, an organisation for Óglaigh na hÉireann which will enable it to put into the field, on mobilisation, a greater and more suitable force than could <Col N="784" /> hitherto have been achieved.  Three new brigades and some other field units have been formed as a result of integration.  The importance of this new concept lies in the fact that, in the event of a world conflict, little or no time may be available to organise and train after the outbreak of hostilities.</P>
    <P>This scheme is a radical departure from that which existed previously.  A new rôle has been given to the FCA, that of providing the bulk of the personnel for the combat units.  Many new combat units have been organised within the various corps which must now be trained and fitted to take their place with the newly-formed brigades and, in some cases, with the brigades which already existed.  In the main, the effect upon the FCA is that they are now required to become efficient in the handling of many new weapons. All ranks of the FCA will be required to become proficient in the tactics and techniques of their new units so that the teamwork, so vital in the modern battle, may be steadily built up.  The development of the FCA over the years renders the force quite capable of undertaking its new and important task.</P>
    <P>Many more officers and men of Na Buan-Óglaigh have been allotted to the task of training the new FCA units. The increase of £15,848 in Subhead G &mdash;Subsistence and other Allowances&mdash; is due mainly, and that of £14,164 in Subhead H&mdash;Transport of Troops&mdash;is due partly to this factor.  New training devices and methods have been studied and tested to ensure that the FCA training periods are most profitably used.  This has been achieved without any increase in the establishment strength of Na Buan-Óglaigh.</P>
    <P>The integration scheme became effective during the quieter period of FCA training.  The past months have largely been spent upon the setting up of the new units and the introduction of the personnel to the new weapons. All indications point to the success of the scheme and it is confidently expected that a firm basis to provide an efficient combat organisation has been laid.  As a result of the integration, 102 Captaein of the FCA have been <Col N="785" /> promoted to the rank of Ceannfort. This is the first time on which officers of An Fórsa have attained senior rank.</P>
    <P>I may mention that, arising out of the integration, the question of the introduction of a standard uniform of new design for both branches of Óglaigh na hÉireann is being examined at present.  I cannot say at this stage, however, what the outcome of this will be as, among other things, increased costs and the utilisation of existing stocks will be important considerations.</P>
    <P>In order that An tAer Chór may carry out its commitments for the advanced training of cadets and pilot officer personnel, it is necessary to provide for the purchase of suitable aircraft to replace the &ldquo;Spitfire&rdquo; machines which have reached the end of their service life.  In fact, were it not for the very high standard of maintenance in the Corps, these aircraft would long since have been unserviceable.  With the disappearance of the Spitfires imminent, the only aircraft available for advanced training are the three Vampire jets and these are quite inadequate for the number of personnel in training.  In seeking to provide new aircraft to replace the Spitfires, we have to face the fact that, in this jet age, suitable advanced trainers of the non-jet or piston type are no longer available for purchase.  Indeed, even for elementary training, some countries have developed and are going over to jet aircraft.</P>
    <P>A fundamental feature of An tAer Chór organisation is the Scheme of Short Service Commissions which has as one of its principal objects the production of pilots to fill vacancies in Aer Lingus.  There is as yet no other national source from which such pilots can be provided and consequently the continued and effective operation of this scheme is essential.  Some idea of its importance may be gained from the fact that in 1959/60 alone, 16 pilots from An tAer Chór were released to take up service with Aer Lingus. Altogether since 1952, some 36 pilots have been released to fill vacancies with that company.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the purchase of <Col N="786" /> three further Vampire jet aircraft is proposed.  The provision is made in Subhead O&mdash;General Stores&mdash;and accounts for £147,000 of the increase of £169,470 in that subhead, the remainder being attributable to the necessity to purchase signal and other badly-needed equipment and tools.</P>
    <P>It may not be amiss to mention that, in addition to its air training and other military duties.  An tAer Chór provides valuable services to other Departments of State.  In the * field of photography, it has cooperated during the year with An Roinn Talmhaíochta, An Roinn Tailte and An Roinn Poist agus Telegrafa, Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí and An tSuirbhéireacht Geolaíochta in the taking and provision of large numbers of aerial photographs&mdash;actually about 4,000&mdash;required for the study and advancement of various important projects.  An Chór is also on regular call to assist An Roinn Iompair agus Cumhachta in the testing of air navigational aid equipment at Shannon and Collinstown Airports, including the exercising of the civil radar operator personnel at these places.</P>
    <P>An tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh continued to carry out fishery protection duties throughout the year.  The introduction, from 1st January last, of new base lines authorised under the Maritime Jurisdiction Act has greatly increased the area of sea, or waters, for which protection has to be provided.  This, of course, means increased responsibility and duty for An tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh.  L.E. Maev has recently had a major refit completed and there are now three corvettes fully serviceable.</P>
    <P>During the active herring fishery period off the south-east coast at the beginning of this year two corvettes were available and in constant surveillance of the critical area.</P>
    <P>It has been decided that, commencing on 1st April, An tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh will take over responsibility for the receipt and dissemination of marine distress messages and co-ordination of consequential rescue measures.  This service has hitherto been the responsibility of An Roinn Iompair agus Cumhachta.  Arrangements <Col N="787" /> are being completed for the necessary co-ordination with An Roinn Poist agus Telegrafa, the Garda Síochána and other agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>It was decided some two years ago that in future all cadets entering An tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh should receive their entire cadet training in this country.  Up to that time, it had been necessary to send cadets for their initial training to British naval establishments.  With the increasing efficiency of the service and the consolidation of experience of the officers derived from training and courses, both at home and abroad, it was considered that the time had come when this should be no longer necessary.  A scheme of training has been evolved which provides that naval cadets undergo their first year's training at An Coláiste Míleata along with first year Army cadets and take their second year's training at the Naval School, Haulbowline.  This desirable development is now in operation and An tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh commenced training its first batch of four cadets at Haulbowline on 1st February last.</P>
    <P>An Slua Muirí, like An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, continues enthusiastically to maintain its strength and perfect its training.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, Subhead P&mdash; Defensive Equipment&mdash;shows an increase of £96,520.  Of this, £19,522 is to meet an increase in carry-over, i.e. stores ordered but not paid for before 31st March, 1960, due to protracted deliveries.  The principal and only new item in this subhead is a provision of £50,000 in respect of the purchase of a quantity of a new medium range anti-tank weapon and ammunition of a type which we have not had previously.  The quantity being purchased will be sufficient to meet immediate training needs but does not provide for the eventual requirements of Óglaigh na hÉireann. The balance of the increase in the subhead&mdash;approximately £27,000&mdash;is required generally to defray the cost of increased purchases of weapons and ammunitions which have been kept <Col N="788" /> extremely low in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>During the financial year 1959/60, a new gymnasium at the Curragh was completed and opened, a new dining hall and cookhouse at Athlone was all but completed and work was commenced on the erection of 24 new married quarters for soldiers in Cork.  The new Catholic Church at the Curragh, erected by the Commissioners of Public Works, has been completed and a new dining hall and cookhouse, also being erected at Dún Phluincéid, by the Commissioners, should be ready for occupation this year.</P>
    <P>Attention also continues to be given to the improvement, in other ways, of amenities for soldiers living in barracks, and this accounts to a large extent for the increase of £10,780 in Subhead R and £13,955 in Subhead V. The provision of all these amenities is bound to have beneficial effects, and there is no doubt that the benefit of the good housing already provided in Dublin, the Curragh and Athlone is reflected in the well-being of the occupants.</P>
    <P>Out of a total of 1,599 employees provided for under Subhead C, 988 will be employed with An Cór Innealtoirí mainly on the care and maintenance of existing military establishments and barracks and on the execution of new works on military property.  This represents a slight increase in the figure for 1959/60.  The balance of 611 employees are tradesmen, labourers, storemen, clerks, typists, etc., employed with various Corps.  There is a reduction in the number provided for An tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh, due to completion of the major refits of the corvettes.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that this year Fuireann Mharchaíochta an Airm will undertake a normal Continental, American and home programme and provision is made, therefore, in Subhead A.2&mdash; Expenses of Equitation Teams at Horse Shows&mdash;for expenditure of £10,000, an increase of £7,500.</P>
    <P>During the past few years, a great deal of attention has been devoted to the improvement of Fuireann Mharchaíochta an Airm.  The difficulties of producing a good team under <Col N="789" /> modern conditions are very considerable, and efforts in this direction call for patience and perseverance.  I am satisfied that progress is being made and that we have now a nucleus of some very good horses and riders who, with reasonable luck, should make a name for themselves in the coming years.  The team is at present on tour in France and results so far have been encouraging.</P>
    <P>Thanks to the increased provision made last year for the purchase of horses, the Horse Purchase Board was enabled to buy six animals at prices ranging from £500 to £1,500.  Nearly all these, however, were young animals needing prolonged training and it will take a few years to develope their full capabilities as international show jumpers.  A few top-class proven jumpers would be a great asset to An Scoil Eachaíochta at this juncture, but the prospect of getting them appears to be remote.  We shall very likely have to take our chances with young animals and, by a process of trial and elimination, try to build up a team of really good jumpers, but the Horse Purchase Board will continue to look out for any suitable proven jumpers which would be ready for immediate international competition.</P>
    <P>Last year, with a view to augmenting the number of available riders and to provide for succession, four cadetship vacancies were specially reserved for applicants with some equitation experience.  It is regrettable that no suitable candidates presented themselves. It is hoped to repeat the offer this year.  These openings should prove attractive to youths who are interested in hunting or show jumping as sport or recreation.  They offer a career as well as an opportunity of gaining international distiction for themselves, for the Army and for the country.</P>
    <P>There is a decrease of £10,935 under Subhead P.1&mdash;Civil Defence.  Reduced provision is made for uniforms as certain stocks are held by my Department in anticipation of purchase by the local authorities for issue to Civil Defence personnel.  These stocks, together with the reduced quantities now provided <Col N="790" /> for, will meet estimated requirements for the coming year.  Otherwise, increased provision is made for equipment and stores generally.  The major items include additional radiac instruments for the training of Civil Defence personnel throughout the country in the detection and measurement of radio-active fallout; some up-to-date fire engines for the training of Auxiliary Fire Service personnel, and ambulances for the training of Casualty Service personnel of the Civil Defence Organisation.</P>
    <P>While Civil Defence recruiting falls very much short of requirements, it is nevertheless encouraging to find that according to local authority returns, there was an increase in the last year of about 1,000 in the numbers who have joined Civil Defence.  The total number of Volunteers is now in the region of 4,800.  In general, the local authorities recognise the need for more volunteers and are doing their best to get them.  My Department is likewise doing its part in having available the uniforms and equipment for many additional volunteers.</P>
    <P>One of the gratifying features which is now becoming apparent in relation to the Civil Defence organisation is that those who have joined are building up a useful nucleus in many towns throughout the country.  Some of these groups are engaging in exercises and week-end camps and some counties are combining to carry out joint exercises. This is a heartening development and it shows, I believe, that the organisation is now taking root and that we have a good foundation on which to build.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that progress is being made with the overall Civil Defence planning for the State.  For instance, within the next few months it is hoped that each local authority will have decided upon the territorial sub-divisions of the county borough or county for the purpose of an overall Civil Defence control in its functional area.  This phase in planning will greatly facilitate the development of the pattern of the organisation within each county borough and county.  In addition there are many other aspects <Col N="791" /> of planning now being studied, including such matters as communications, warning, shelter policy and evacuation.</P>
    <P>This work is aimed at providing solutions for a variety of the problems that would arise should this country suffer from the effects of war.  Indeed one of the most important factors of Civil Defence planning is that, should a crisis come on us, we shall have at least worked out the manner in which we can best provide ways and means of mitigating the effects on the people generally.</P>
    <P>Before passing from Civil Defence, I should perhaps say that every encouragement and assistance that I and my Department can give to local authorities in the carrying out of their statutory obligations will as hitherto be most readily forthcoming.</P>
    <P>These obligations arise under the Air Raid Precautions Acts, which impose on local authorities the duty of preparing and carrying out, as regards their own functional areas, schemes for the protection of persons and property from injury or damage in the event of attack from the air and for the minimising of such injury or damage.  As I have already indicated, most of the local authorities recognise their statutory responsibilities in this regard and are co-operating fully with my Department in endeavouring to organise efficient Civil Defence measures.  Unfortunately, I am aware, however, from recent press reports that, in a couple of instances, the local authority has refused to make either any or adequate provision in its estimates for Civil Defence for the coming year.  According to these reports, certain views have been expressed as to why the local authority should not be called upon to bear any part of the Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>For example, it has been stated that the Army should do this work. Such an attitude reveals a complete lack of appreciation of the nature of Civil Defence, which is essentially the organisation and training of the individual citizens so that they may protect themselves, their families and their neighbours from the hazards of nuclear <Col N="792" /> warfare.  If such a war comes, the emphasis will be on survival, and unless the people take the necessary steps to protect themselves, particularly in relation to radio-active fallout, survival will not be possible.  The Army could not possibly carry out all the functions visualised by Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>Many of these functions are similar or analogous to services normally provided by the local authorities even in peace time, such as hospitalising the sick and injured, fire-fighting, re-housing those in need, assisting the destitute&mdash;all life and property saving functions performed as part of the normal day-to-day work of the local authorities, which in the event of war would need to be greatly expanded. The Army obviously could not carry out these duties.  In any event, the primary function of the Army is active military defence and it is organised and trained towards that end.  In the event of war, it would have to be greatly expanded to fulfil its primary role and could not undertake direct responsibility for Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>Should it happen that the Army is not otherwise committed in the event of attack from the air, it could and would, of course, render all possible assistance to Civil Defence.  But even if we could be sure the Army would be available for this purpose, the necessity for Civil Defence would still remain, particularly as far as the warden, firefighting, casualty and welfare services are concerned.</P>
    <P>While I thought it well to refute this particular contention that the Army could or should be solely responsible for Civil Defence, the main fact remains that, whatever views individual members of local authorities may hold and however sincerely those views may be expressed, they do not alter the existing law in the matter.  Actions such as those to which I have referred can result not only in a very adverse effect on the slow but steady efforts which are being made to build up the minimum nucleus of a Civil Defence organisation, but are also most discouraging to the volunteers who are prepared to sacrifice their spare time for Civil Defence training.  It would <Col N="793" /> indeed have an undesirable effect on efficiency and morale if the impression were to be created that the bodies responsible for this service were not sympathetically disposed towards Civil Defence.  While, therefore, I am confidently expecting the continued effective co-operation of local authorities in this matter, I may have to consider what action may be necessary in cases where the statutory obligations are not being fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The amount provided in subhead X3 as a grant-in-aid of Cumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann at £15,450 represents a reduction of £2,500 as compared with last year's provision. The grant-in-aid required each year depends upon An Cumann's anticipated activities and the amount which it expects to raise itself.  The figure of £15,450 in this year's estimates includes a sum of £10,000 in respect of the normal day-to-day activities of An Cumann, a sum of £5,000 in respect of the maintenance of the group of White Russian refugees from North China&mdash;there are at present 18 being looked after by An Cumann in the premises &ldquo;Naomh Aindrias,&rdquo; Rathmines&mdash;and £450 in respect of the State contribution to the International Committee of the Red Cross.</P>
    <P>An Cumann continues its commendable activities in the field of humanitarian relief.  It undertook the appeal for subscriptions in aid of World Refugees, and a grant was recently made for the relief of distress following the Moroccan earthquake disaster.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered all the main provisions of the Estimate and, when concluding the debate, shall be glad to supply any further information required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin </NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it would be best if, before becoming critical, I said the nice things first.  It might sweeten whatever has to come afterwards.  I want to congratulate the officers assigned to the United Nations Commission that their service was so effectively recognised by the bestowal upon them of <Col N="794" /> United Nations medals.  While not wishing to be too critical, I think, in regard to that ceremony, the Minister should have had a wider representation of the public present.  I know it is not always easy to manage these matters, but it was a very important occasion and there should have been more publicity for it.  It is gratifying to learn that the officers did their work well and in the discharge of their duties demonstrated that this country could produce first-class material, both in administrative and executive capacity.  I join with the Minister in congratulating them on that work.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that the integration of the F.C.A. with the Army is progressing but he did not give us any indication that he was satisfied with the progress made.  I know that was inferred, and that the integration will leave the Army with a strong striking force, but I should like him to tell us just exactly what progress has been made, and if he is satisfied that the number of training officers and the expenditure provided are sufficient.  In a case like that there should be no cribbing.  Ample facilities should be made available.  Some of these officers, N.C.O.s and men, are out in the country and I think it is only fair that all their expenses should be met, and that there should be no danger of any of them suffering financial or other difficulties in the discharge of their duties. I know that some of them are young and it might not be too easy to satisfy them fully but, at the same time, it is important that they should not be confined.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the Estimate is framed on the basis of a full peace establishment of 1,325 officers and 11,561 men but that in effect it caters for an average of 1,152 officers, 79 cadets and 8,250 men of all corps and services.  When I was Minister for Defence I could never understand why we had this fictitious figure of what the strength of the Army should be.  We have this figure on paper but in actual fact we never realise it, and I think it should be dropped. Of course it can be argued that it is the ideal to be achieved but I do not think it is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> I am glad to note that the Minister pays tribute to the standard of morale, conduct, deportment and discipline which continues to be satisfactory in all branches.  That is something which every Deputy in the House is glad to hear and I want to congratulate both the Minister and the General Staff for that happy state of affairs and, of course, the men also who themselves contribute to it.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that there is not sufficient appreciation of the need for training in civil defence.  I should like the Minister to tell us the number of local authorities that are not participating as effectively in this matter as he would wish.  The idea of trying to leave it to the other fellow to do is not good enough and, should another war break out, which God forbid, everybody will be blamed for not seeing to it that the people were prepared.  I join with the Minister and the Government in appealing to local authorities, and the public generally, to volunteer for this work and to undergo the necessary training required to meet danger should it arise.  There is an imperative duty upon people as citizens of the State to do that, and I should like to add my voice in encouraging them to take it up in a more effective way.  If there was an outbreak of war, and there was any atomic fall-out, it would be too late then to learn what to do.  It would be of great advantage to themselves, their friends, relatives and neighbours if they were prepared and I am glad to learn that the Red Cross is doing its usual valuable work.</P>
    <P>I do not want to press the Minister but I should like him to tell us what headway is being made with regard to the rehabilitation of those in St. Andrew's in Rathmines.  Are they to remain there for a long time or are they going to get employment?  It is not satisfactory to have them there for a long time without any fixed plan as to what their ultimate destinies may be.</P>
    <P>I had just one reason for moving that this Estimate be referred back&mdash; to give me an opportunity of saying to the Minister that, when he is addressing a section of the Army, he is not <Col N="796" /> to regard it as a political organisation. The Army is the Army of the nation, of every one of us.  It is ours and its problem is a problem of defence, not the defence of any one section of the country but of every one of us.  Since the State and the Army were established every Minister for Defence, as far as I am aware, took particular care that no controversial matters were raised in addressing the Army at any time.  I shall leave it at that, but I feel it is a thing that had to be mentioned.</P>

      <P>In answer to a question about Clonmel barracks on the 3rd March, 1960, the Minister said it was not the intention to reduce the force there to any great extent.  He said there would be no appreciable reduction, but in answer to a further question it was pointed out that the strength there was around 400, 334, 344, and so on, and it is now down to 211.  He did not keep his promise in that matter.  However, I suppose there is some explanation of that, and that it would be his intention to increase that number once he gave the undertaking.  I again leave that matter in that particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Air Corps must keep up with modern developments and it is imperative that they be trained in the new jet aircraft but very great cost is involved. Maintenance and training cost a great deal.  The Minister proposes to purchase three Vampire jet aircraft. I suppose we have to take it that that <Col N="797" /> is necessary but it is a serious matter. It is true, of course, that the Air Corps train pilots for Aer Lingus and other Irish air companies.  I am glad to see that 36 pilots who were trained in the Air Corps have been taken into Aer Lingus.  That is better than taking pilots from any other Air Corps.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Naval Service is still inadequate.  We still have the three corvettes.  In view of the necessity to protect our fisheries, it is time we had a speedier and more manoeuvrable type of boat.  I presume that the Minister has been advised on that matter by the naval authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the naval authorities are satisfied that it is no longer necessary to send personnel for training outside the country, that they can now be trained here.  That is very gratifying.</P>
    <P>With regard to defensive equipment, we have never been told exactly what the purchases are but I am glad that the new medium range anti-tank weapon is being made available and that all arms of the Forces will be trained in that weapon.  It is important that they should have that training.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that progress has been made with the new Church in the Curragh, the provision of married quarters and other developments during the year.  These amenities are of great benefit to all concerned.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary position that more than one-eighth of the total number in the Defence Forces are civilians.  It takes one civilian and a number of officers to run eight men. However, that has been the position for a long time.</P>
    <P>The distinct improvement in the Equitation School is very gratifying. I would suggest to the Minister that young horses are better than the so-called experienced jumpers.  The experienced jumper you can get today is experienced because of the handling of some individual.  He is a one-man horse.  It is almost impossible to get a good jumper that will jump well, no matter who is riding him.</P>

I would suggest that the Equitation School should take their time, even though there may be criticism if they do not do well or suggestions that civilians would do better.  By taking time, by having patience, a first-class team can be built up.  I am glad to note that four vacancies were offered to young boys with equitation experience, but I do not think that that was sufficiently advertised or generally known. The Minister says that four such vacancies will be offered this year. This is an opportunity for young fellows of which they should avail.  I wish I were a youngster again and could avail of it.</P>
      <P>Every young Irishman is a horseman, unless he is a coward in the sense that he is afraid of a horse. Any fellow who has courage can be trained if he has the desire to become a good horseman.  A boy who has a fear of horses, of course, will never be a good horseman.</P>

      <P>I do not think he has any responsibility for that.  He can leave that to Deputy McQuillan and myself.  I should like to know if it is still intended to send Army personnel on training courses abroad. The vote is there, but it is considerably reduced.  This is a valuable asset and the Minister should make full use of it.  The Minister referred to the apprenticeship scheme, but he did not give us any indication as to how it is progressing.  This is also a very valuable scheme, and it is important that Deputies should know what progress has been made in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, the reports I have from the Army&mdash;although I have not sought reports to any great extent &mdash;are good.  They seem to be making progress in every direction.  I am glad to know that the Irish language is being acquired and fostered in the Army.  It is important that our armed forces should be fully equipped to carry out all their duties in the native <Col N="800" /> language.  It has always been one of the hallmarks of our defence forces and I am glad the Minister has introduced his Estimate in the manner in which he has.  Use of the language by the Army could have far-reaching effects on the community as a whole and I wish every success to the efforts being made.  There is no person who could be otherwise than happy that such a development has taken place.</P>
    <P>In general the report of the Minister is satisfactory and it is not my intention to proceed further with the motion to refer back the Estimate for reconsideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I wish to remind the Minister that the water mains to which I referred previously are still there.  Since he has transferred this responsibility to the Office of Public Works I should like him to get in touch with his pal in the Office of Public Works.  We do not want the conditions in this respect to continue as they have been for the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of money has been spent over the past 12 months in repairs to our naval vessels.  Would the Minister have any idea why these vessels are lying almost derelict in Haulbowline?  This is the only part of our armed services which gives a direct return to the people, that is, in the protection of our fisheries.  Would it be correct to state that the reason they are lying idle is the lack of engineers?  Is the Minister aware that there is extreme dissatisfaction amongst naval personnel who are engineers that they are paid only the ordinary Army rate and get nothing extra for engineering services?  I should like him to tell the House what number of naval engineers are leaving the Navy on account of dissatisfaction in that respect.  It is my anxiety to have the matter remedied.  How long have these vessels being lying there?  I was there last week and I made inquiries.  The reply I got was rather illuminating and I should like the Minister to investigate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish also to refer to the housing conditions on Spike Island.  On a few occasions our housing inspector <Col N="801" /> had to go over there to inspect premises which unfortunate lads in married quarters are trying to leave. They are anxious to get houses on the mainland.  Our housing inspector reported that the conditions there are appalling.  If the Minister is spending money in other districts on housing, I would suggest that he would have the married quarters on Spike Island and also the housing conditions in Haulbowline investigated.  The Minister should provide better housing accommodation or subsidise the local housing authorities to provide houses for them on the mainland, if the houses in these places are incapable of being repaired.  I think that is the condition they have got into through the negligence of the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>Married men in the Army are entitled at least to decent housing conditions and decent homes.  If the Minister is not prepared to provide those housing facilities in Spike Island or in Haulbowline, he should subsidise the local housing authority for this purpose.  We have already provided for a considerable number of such people, but there is not a week that I go into Cobh that I do not find these unfortunate fellows travelling around there in an effort to find housing accommodation.  On at least four or five occasions on which our housing inspector went to Spike Island the report he gave was that these houses were unfit for human habitation.  It is unfair that the whole burden of this should be thrown on the local authority.  These were good houses but, due to the absolute negligence of the Department of Defence, they were allowed to go into disrepair.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to deal with for the moment on this Vote.  I am rather alarmed at the condition of affairs with regard to the naval service, and I should like the Minister to have the situation rectified as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Let me say, first of all, that the Minister spoke here today for 35 minutes, in Irish, introducing his Estimate. I have no objection whatever to the Minister speaking in Irish in this House.  Let us be clear on that. He then proceeded to give us, in English, the same rigmarole as he gave us in Irish, with some omissions.  Was there any need to waste the time of the House with that type of performance? Would it not have been a more courteous attitude on the Minister's part to make a copy of his speech available to the limited number of Deputies who are interested in this debate so that there would be no need for repetition in the manner in which he repeated himself today?  I can assure him that his attitude on this matter is more harmful to the Irish language than anything else.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter upon which I respectfully suggest I am entitled to comment.  It would have saved time, and there would have been a lot more cooperation with the Minister, if he had shown more courtesy and thoughtfulness to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to civil defence, and he threatened a number of local authorities&mdash;&ldquo;threatened&rdquo; is the word I have to use&mdash;that he is likely to take serious action, in the near future, against the local authorities <Col N="803" /> who have failed to carry out the directions given to them by the Minister. In fact, without giving away any secrets at this stage, the first authority in Ireland to thwart the Minister on this matter of civil defence was the Roscommon County Council.</P>
    <P>The fraud that is being perpetrated on them in the name of civil defence should be clearly brought home to the public.  If the Minister is serious about civil defence, why is it that there is a reduction of £10,000 in the Estimate for Civil Defence?  At the same time, why is it that there is an increase of over £700,000 in the Estimate for the Army?  The Minister shows a lack of interest in civil defence by reducing the Estimate and, at the same time, increasing the Army Estimate, and what he is really doing is saddling the local authorities with the cost of civil defence and allowing the taxpayers' money to be used for luxury purposes within the regular Army itself.</P>
    <P>There is no good in the Minister coming here and telling us that he is seriously considering what action he will take against the local authorities in this matter.  He has power to suspend a local authority, I presume, for failing to carry out what he describes as its statutory duty.  I here and now challenge the Minister to suspend any local authority in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair challenge, and there was never a more glorious opportunity of testing it than there will be between 23rd and 27th June next.  At a time when the people of this country are entitled to expect some reduction in Government expenditure, we find in the Estimate for Defence over the past two years, that there was an increase of over £1 million in spending by the Department of Defence&mdash;an increase of almost £1 million because of the danger of war. I know of nothing more outrageous at the moment than to ask the people to give more of their hard-earned money for some nebulous purpose, for the purchase, shall we say, of defence <Col N="804" /> equipment which, in the light of modern developments, can be described only as belonging to the Stone Age. That equipment is out-of-date before it even reaches our shores.</P>
      <P>The people's money is being spent in that fashion.  It is nearly time we were afforded an opportunity of reexamining the whole question of our Defence Forces.  I tried last year, and the year before, to have a special commission of this House set up to examine into expenditure on Defence in the light of modern development in various fields.  That suggestion of mine was rejected with contempt by the Government.</P>
      <P>The people who decide the over-all policy of Defence should not be the brass-hats; they should be the Government of this State.  We know what happened&mdash;this is no comparison perhaps &mdash;when the brass-hats in Germany and other countries were able to over-rule the civilians in the matter of expenditure. We have seen the results when planning has been left in the hands of these people.</P>
      <P>As I say, there is an increase of almost £750,000 in this Estimate over last year's Estimate.  There is an increase in the number of officers and a decrease in the number of privates. The Minister said, in his opening remarks, that the limited number of personnel available are fully taxed in the carrying out of their duties, whether for F.C.A. purposes or duty purposes within the Army barracks, and so forth.  Let me say that the ordinary private soldier, at the present time, is carrying a very heavy burden in the line of duty.  There are not sufficient private soldiers at the moment to carry out the duties imposed upon them.  It has now got to the stage that a large percentage of the private soldiers are fully occupied as servants of the officer personnel and their wives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had a number of complaints over the past 12 months by private soldiers and their relations in connection with their duties.  I have sought, through a question in this House, to have made available to every private <Col N="805" /> soldier what his duties really are in so far as the position of batman is concerned. Surely a soldier is entitled to know, when given an order to take up duty as a batman to a particular officer, what his duties are, or will it be suggested that once he joins the Army he must carry out every order given to him by his superior officer?  We shall have to change that outlook and have a new look in the Army if we are to make it a happy one and keep up the morale which the Minister spoke about today.</P>
    <P>I shall make a suggestion to the Minister in that regard.  We should look upon the N.C.O. and the private soldier as a citizen in uniform who is the social equal of his military superiors.  In a matter of military discipline, he must accept the orders of his superior officers.  We are a small nation with a proud record of military prowess.  There should not be that distinction which obtains today between the officer personnel and the N.C.O. and the private ranks.</P>
    <P>The system we have adopted is based on both the British and the old Prussian systems&mdash;class distinction of the worst type, mixing up the functions of the soldier and his position as a normal individual.  Once he is a soldier in our Army, he is segregated, for social purposes, from his military superior officers.  Why should that be?  Recently, I have been reading about the new German Army.  The development there is most enlightened and one which we could well emulate.</P>
    <P>The old Prussian idea that the N.C.O. and the private soldier was not on the same basis, socially, as his military superiors has gone by the board.  Instead, the Private and the N.C.O., when off duty, is the equal of the officer personnel.  He mixes in social events and in private life with his superior officers.  It has not been found that there is any reduction in efficiency or in discipline.</P>
    <P>A further innovation which should be noted is the appointment of a Public Relations Officer or an Ombudsman as they have in Sweden. He acts as a medium for the private <Col N="806" /> soldier, N.C.O. and junior officer.  He acts as a direct link between the German Parliament and the Forces, so far as grievances in the lower ranks are concerned.  At present, in the Irish Army, if a soldier or an N.C.O. feels he has a genuine grievance he must go right up the steps of the ladder to the top, inside the Army.  He is not entitled to come to any Deputy in this House to make a complaint. He can be disciplined for so doing. Is that not an outrageous situation?</P>
    <P>Do we not realise that the grievance the soldier is suffering from is the result of action by his superior officer through whose hands the very source of the grievance must pass?  Is that an incentive to an unfortunate man with a grievance to try to have it remedied?  Is there a real opportunity for him, under those circumstances, to make his case known at the very top?  Of course, there is not.  Of course, he is blocked all along the line.</P>

Before this debate, I was of two minds about dealing in detail with a number of grievances which were made known to me by private soldiers. I do not intend to use this debate for that purpose.  Instead, I offer that suggestion.  At times it is heartbreaking to Army personnel when they know they have no genuine way of making their grievances known.  It will not harm discipline.  I think it will improve the morale all round.  It will make what one might describe as &ldquo;those cranky individuals in high places&rdquo; be far more careful in future about infringing on the rights of their juniors in rank in the Forces.  I hope the matter will receive serious consideration. From now on, I shall have Questions on the Order Paper to keep reminding the Minister about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that under Subhead O., there is provision for the expenditure of £147,000 for the purchase of more training aircraft.  I thought all this thing was finished with.  A few years ago, this Department was responsible for saddling the public with an expenditure of almost £1,000,000 on the purchase of jet aeroplanes and the construction of a runway to carry those <Col N="808" /> jet planes.  The runway cost £600,000 and the equipment, spare parts and everything connected with the three jet planes concerned brought the remainder up to almost £2,000,000.  At the time I discovered it was the intention of the Department to purchase a full squadron, namely, six more jet planes. I am very glad that, when I found out the position and had it aired in this House, the matter of the purchase of these six extra planes was dropped like a hot brick.</P>
    <P>Now we find here again that the matter is being resurrected.  The country is being asked to buy three more planes at a cost of £147,000.

      <P>I am protected as far as interruptions are concerned but I want to suggest that one of the reasons Deputy Loughman was appointed a Whip was to keep him out of the House.  Surely he should be about his business in that connection?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the former Minister for Defence accepting so calmly, on behalf of his Party, that it is necessary to purchase these three planes before we meet what should be the priority need, namely, the purchase of helicopters.  I take it that is the official policy of the chief Opposition Party.  Their official line is that they support the expenditure of £1,000,000 on a jet runway in Baldonnel and on the purchase of these jet planes for training.</P>
      <P>Let me deal with the argument put forward here&mdash;it was put forward before&mdash;that the reason for the purchase of these planes is to enable us to train a number of pilots so that Aer Lingus will avail of their services. It is very desirable that we should have Irishmen as pilots for Aer Lingus.  Is it suggested, however, that it is necessary to spend £1,000,000, capital investment, you might say, in order to train a number of pilots so that they can at a later stage become employed by Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose for a moment we said that on this basis it is costing in the region of, perhaps, £20,000 to train one of these pilots and that we could get an Irish pilot equally well trained and, perhaps, with greater experience if we were prepared to spend a few thousand pounds on his training in Britain, America or elsewhere, what is wrong with that?  Is it not a fact that at the present moment it is highly desirable that pilots should have the widest possible experience on all types of modern aircraft?  Surely, it is not suggested that it is necessary for Aer <Col N="810" /> Lingus pilots to be trained in Baldonnel and that, because of the training in Baldonnel, the best possible Irish pilots are available?</P>
    <P>I think it is a disgraceful subterfuge to pretend it is necessary, in order to get pilots for Aer Lingus, to spend £1,000,000 on jet aeroplanes.  I do not for one moment believe that the majority of the Opposition realise what is going on at this minute.  The Government could only afford a shilling increase to the old age pensioners last week.  That may sound very funny to Deputy Loughman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should cease talking about that.  We are sick of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Deputy is sick of it.  As far as the country is concerned, the people will be very sick of Deputy Loughman and others, if this wasteful and disgraceful expenditure on jet aeroplanes is allowed to proceed.  There would be no criticism whatever by the general public of an expenditure on the purchase of helicopters.</P>
      <P>It was sought, I think, by Deputies on all sides of this House that we purchase at least four helicopters at a cost ranging from £30,000 to £40,000 each.  Perhaps, the over-all expense of having four helicopters fully equipped with spare parts and so forth might run into £200,000.  I think it would be money far better spent than spending £147,000 on aircraft, an additional £96,000 on defensive equipment and an additional £22,000 on general stores &mdash;for what purpose?  For an Army equipped to defend us against what and against whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always stated that it should not be the duty of each Deputy to put forward his ideas in regard to what our Defence Forces should be, but I believe that there should be a special committee of the House set up to examine into the whole position and that that committee should have the advice and assistance of our leading military experts, so that, between the civilian and the military representatives, we could arrive at a sensible arrangement which would be supported <Col N="811" /> by the country and which would not cost what it is costing us today, nearly £7,000,000.  I appeal again for the setting up of such a committee instead of going on year after year with this expenditure.  Deputy MacEoin stated here today that he did not understand why these figures were given about the number of soldiers and officers year after year when we know they are only on paper.  What is the idea of this paper Army being produced in this House?  Whom is it supposed to fool and what is the purpose behind it?</P>
    <P>I had not got an opportunity of studying this Estimate in a very detailed way.  I see under Subhead C that there is an increase in the number of civilian employees, tradesmen and helpers, employed by the Army.  I wonder would the Minister let us know what is the cause of the increase because it is rather unusual to find that in a year when the number of people in building construction and so forth in the country as a whole have decreased by thousands the numbers in the Army in similar occupations have increased.</P>
    <P>The position about the corvettes has been queried.  It will be of great importance in the near future to ensure that our fishing rights are preserved, that we will cut down poaching by foreign trawlers to the minimum, and at the same time, expand our fishing fleet.  That, however, is a matter for another Estimate.  In view of the great likelihood that agreement will be reached on extending the fishing limits of our territorial waters, we should be making provision here for safeguarding our fishing rights within those limits.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the boats, with their equipment and so forth, which are available at the moment, are not at all capable of fulfilling that important task.  Again, it would be more desirable, if there is money to be spent, that we should concentrate on expenditure on that field.  That would be much more desirable.</P>
    <P>The question of cadets was mentioned, and I heard for the first time that four cadetships have been reserved for young men with some experience <Col N="812" /> of horses.  I should like a little more information on the reserving of these four cadetships because, to my mind, it looks very much as if these cadetships will be reserved for a very limited section of the community. I may be wrong, but, to my knowledge at any rate, the hunting section of our community is rather a wealthy one.  The numbers in that section are limited, and it would seem to me that it is from that element of the community it is expected these cadets with equestrian experience will be selected.  I think that is restricting the rights of the community.  I do not think that the Government are entitled to make reservations of that nature.  If there is a question of men coming in as cadets, and we hope to turn out a first-class team for international events, every youngster who goes for a cadetship should have an equal opportunity.</P>
    <P>The fact that one man's son, through wealth, has an opportunity of being more skilled in horsemanship, should not mean that he will have a greater opportunity of becoming a cadet.  It is all very well to say that a farmer's son in the country will have an opportunity to become a cadet.  It is not quite fair to suggest that, because the majority of the farmers' sons I know have very little experience in that field.  Very few of them can afford to appear at the various hunt meetings to which Deputy MacEoin referred.  Most of them I have seen at these hunt meetings have been there as onlookers more than as participants.  They generally follow up the gentry on horses.  I do not know whether it is suggested that it is this element of the gentry who are to get the opportunity of special privileges reserved to them in the form of four cadetships.  That is what it looks like to me, and I hope that it will be clarified before the debate finishes.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is only fair to say that I believe that if the Minister were serious about curtailing Defence expenditure, he could, without doing any hardship whatever, save one million pounds after a 24-hours examination. That would be a very important saving <Col N="813" /> and it would set a very good example for the rest of his colleagues.  Having made that saving, the next action is for the Taoiseach and the Cabinet to consider, in the light of modern development and in the light of present day circumstances, the necessity of having a Minister for Defence at all.  It is quite a reasonable suggestion that the Departments of Justice and Defence should be under the one Minister and that a Parliamentary Secretary could handle one or other of the Departments under that Minister. We would have a further saving there.  I know that the Taoiseach wishes to reduce the number of Cabinet posts if the opportunity arises and I can sympathise with him in his present difficulty in doing so.  I think that the question of friendships or of hurting people's feelings should not enter into this important problem.</P>
    <P>The time has come when a committee of the House should be set up to examine the whole problem of defence expenditure.  There is no use in the Minister or the Opposition telling me that defence is a problem for the Army authorities and the Government alone.  It is a problem for the people of the country as a whole, and a problem in which at least they should be consulted in the sense that this House, which is the governing body of the State, should have an opportunity of deciding what the policy should be, taking all the advice available to it into consideration.  Then we would have a far more satisfied public opinion than we have at present.</P>
    <P>There is no end to the number of points which I could raise on this Estimate, particularly in regard to the sheer waste of money at present.  As I say, there is a reduction in the number of troops and an increase of £1,400 for petrol and oils in this year's Estimate.  When the people in the country see lorry after lorry rolling along the main roads, with perhaps two or three individuals in each, they are amazed.  They feel that a lot of money is being wasted, money we can ill afford and money which should be put to some useful purpose.</P>
    <P>All these matters should be discussed <Col N="814" /> by a committee, in addition to broader aspects.  I do not like to appeal but I shall appeal to the Government again to set up such a committee&mdash;and I can assure them they will have the goodwill of the community&mdash;rather than have this annual, shall we say, dispute on the question of expenditure on our Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my humble appreciation of those workers who give their time for their training in Civil Defence.  I think that young men and women who come out and give their time to this work are to be appreciated by all.  We also have the co-operation of the other voluntary bodies who have come forward and we should appreciate that also.  There is not sufficient appreciation in this country of what the situation would be if we were not properly equipped to deal with a situation we have not experienced up to now.  We can learn a lot from what has happened elsewhere. I am referring to the question of atomic fall-out.</P>
      <P>At this stage it is natural that one should want to know who is the leader of Civil Defence.  Is that leadership in the hands of a civil servant?  I am not questioning the civil servant by any means but an Army is entitled to its Chief of Staff, someone to whom it can look for leadership.  I think we have plenty of men suitable as leaders, people who could be looked-to.  When I say looked-to, I am thinking that a civil servant cannot show his hand. When any decision arises, he will refer it to a Minister.  He may be better than any man I suggest but it is not to a mystic that we should have to look in time of need.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the possible use of the military in co-operation with the Garda on the occasion of, say, a big influx into towns outside Dublin.  We often have a great influx of traffic in certain areas and I think the military police or certain Army personnel&mdash; they would be required very often&mdash; could play a great part in helping to cope with such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other members, I notice an increase for the provision of aircraft. <Col N="815" /> I hold the same view as one of the other speakers on the provision of a helicopter.  I did not wait until today: I mentioned this here six years ago.  I have heard it raised several times since then and I think we do not sufficiently realise the possible uses to which such a craft could be put.  Before the year is out, we may have as we have had in the past, grave need for such an aircraft, and I think the Minister should give a lead at some time in taking steps to provide it.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the grave dissatisfaction there is in regard to promotion in the Army.  I have been given two instances, and not by the personnel themselves but by their inlaws&mdash;the personnel themselves were not prepared to come forward and give the information.  That was in regard to the ranks at Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa, Renmore Barracks, Galway.  I think the Minister should see that fair play is given to men who have given their time in the Army and he should look into the grievances that prevail.  It is not in the interests of the Army, and you cannot hope to have recruits, if such a situation is allowed to obtain.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note the increase in the provision of horses for the Army but I note a reduction for veterinary attendance from £30 to £5.  I wonder how that comes about.  Have we our own veterinary service in the Army that allows us to make that saving? I do not think we should cheesepare when it is a question of a good type of horse.  Our Army Jumping Team has been one of our best ambassadors in the past.  It has drawn the attention of the world to the fact that this country has something to offer or, rather, that we exist.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the question of intrusion by certain members of the R.U.C. across our Border.  That may be a delicate matter but I think I would view an R.U.C. man with greater disfavour than an I.R.A. man.  I think the R.U.C. have no love for this part of the country.  They cross our Border continuously&mdash;I have that on good authority.</P>

      <P>In Galway, we need houses fit for heroes to live in.  If the Army are heroes, I think the Minister should direct his attention to the needs of Army personnel in Galway.  Galway Corporation is being sorely pressed to provide for the people as a whole.  The Department should play its part in providing houses for the increased personnel in Galway.  The Minister and his Department will have to take some steps to meet the situation there and, when he comes to reply, I should like him to give us some information as to what steps he proposes to take. Unless people are satisfied in regard to promotion and housing they will not be encouraged to enlist.</P>
      <P>As far as I understand the position, 60 per cent. of the increase in this Vote&mdash;£400,000&mdash;has been mentioned as earmarked for pay.  No one suggests that the Army should not be paid, but we would like to pinpoint the cause for the increase. It turns on the famous Budget under which the subsidies were withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to our Jumping Team, my advice is: &ldquo;Get the best.&rdquo;  We have it in the country.  We have the men and we have the horses.  I do not care whether a man is a member <Col N="817" /> of the finest hunt in the country or someone trucking a donkey out in the wilds of Connemara, drawing turf, so long as he brings honour to our country, he should be welcome.  The Vote has increased from the point of view of the purchase of horses.  I know quite a bit about horses.  I believe that horse and rider should, as it were, grow together in their training and become one unit, understanding one another fully.  I hope that by taking all the steps necessary we shall have honour brought to our country once again.</P>

      <P>The Vote for the Department of Defence is one in which we all have a certain interest for different reasons.  Some of us possibly imagine we know a great deal about it and probably that is the reason we take an interest in it.  We know something, I suppose, and we learn more by taking an even greater interest.  My interest is akin to that of many people who make a hobby of reading about defence, studying defence, and so on.  I think I can claim to be a very keen student of military history.  That helps one to take a general interest in the subject. In fact, without a keen interest in and some knowledge of military history, it is difficult for people to know what they are talking about.  One may talk about the details of the account, but there are other features apart from mere accounting details.  There is the question of the policy and the purpose of the Department itself.  In order to express an opinion on that subject one has to have a knowledge of the subject itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told the Vote for the Department of Defence is up by approximately £742,661 on last year.  Naturally people are anxious to know why we need to spend so much money on Defence.  Most people are cynical; even people here are cynical.  They ask: &ldquo;What can we do?  We are throwing money down the drain.&rdquo; Any responsible person must admit, however, that, whether or not it appears as if we are throwing money down the drain, a defence policy is something we have to have.  Just as in the case of the Garda, there may be no offence against the civil authority but one never knows when there will be.  A definite policy will guarantee that the Garda will be respected if the law is broken.  Even if that should happen only every half century, it is justification for the existence of the Department of Defence.  Apart from the larger question of outside aggression, there is always the question of the need for coming to the assistance of the civil power.  Except for a small number, the Guards here are not <Col N="819" /> armed.  It is possible that the civil population might get out of hand at some time and it would be essential to have an armed force come to the Guards' assistance.</P>
    <P>However, the mere possibility of civil disturbance is not sufficient justification for the expenditure of £7½ million.  There is the larger issue of the danger of outside aggression.  Anybody with a knowledge of history will realise that from time to time every country is engaged in war or involved in some way.  It is only common sense that the existence of a defence system might deter a potential aggressor from invasion.  I do not say it will prevent aggression but the aggressor, in making his calculations, will take into account whether there is a Defence Force or not.</P>
    <P>At one time the Romans bragged that they could take over this country with one battalion.  They were in England at the time and somebody said they were afraid of invading Ireland. They regarded that as a big joke and said they would send a battalion to take it.  It might happen that other countries could think likewise and decide as part of their operations to take over the country.  But if they knew we had a fairly good defensive system and that a substantial part of their forces would be required for the operation, they might calculate that the loss of that force would constitute a danger to their main objective.</P>
    <P>However, we must decide what our actual defensive policy will be, and we are entitled to express an opinion on whether or not we are faced with such dangers as to warrant the expenditure of approximately £7½ million every year.  We know that periodically there are great wars in Europe.  We can remember that there was one not many years ago and, a generation before that again, there was another.  We had other small wars: the Boer War, the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon's Wars, the Seven Years' War, and so on down history.  Common sense tells us that there will always be wars.</P>
    <P>It is silly to say that nuclear weapons will end war.  They will do no such thing.  There will be an agreement not <Col N="820" /> to use certain weapons of overwhelming destructive power, but more conventional type weapons, even atomic ones, will be used, and these will be far more devastating than the weapons used in the last war.  You might as well say there will be no more politics in this country and that Fine Gael will be satisfied to let Fianna Fáil stay where they are.  But they will not.  It is the same in international affairs.  The League of Nations and all that kind of thing is only the preliminary to the real thing.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that there will always be wars and we have to decide to what extent we shall be involved. Any student of military affairs knows the existing trends and, basing his knowledge on those, knows what is likely to happen.  Commonsense tells us that the next trouble on the Continent will be between Russia and the other Powers.  Inevitably we would be concerned in that.  If such a struggle occurred there is every possibility that Russia could over-run the entire Continent much more easily than the Germans over-ran it in the last war.  If that happens it will mean that the Russians will not be very far from this country.  If modern weapons are used, even apart from the more devastating kind, England may have to be evacuated and taken over by the Russians.  The question is: what could we do about it?  Not a lot.</P>
    <P>However, there are other dangers involved.  If such an event should happen I believe there would be an overwhelming rush back to this country of our emigrants from England.  That is where the need for an armed force to support the civil authorities would be felt.  If the British Government decide to leave their island and go to Canada, we would also have a problem in regard to the North.  It might be necessary for us, in the interests of national unity, to go up there and prevent some junta from taking over.  These are the trends with which I am concerned, not how many pilots we have, how many guns we have or how many rounds of .303 ammunition we have.</P>
    <P>Last year, on the Vote on Account, I expressed my opinions about our <Col N="821" /> system of defence.  I said it appeared to be conventional: if someone attacks you, you just dig in and defend yourself.  If that is the way our defence is organised, you might as well throw that £7½ million down the drain.  With a defence of that nature facing an aggressor equipped with superior weapons, we would be overwhelmed in hours, not to mention days.  If we are to get value for this money we should organise our defence in such a way that we would at least be able to give a good account of ourselves and not, as happened in certain other countries which spent huge sums on defence, flop in half an hour or so.  I believe we should forget conventional systems of defence and organise a system of guerilla defence.</P>

      <P>As regards the second part of the question, it is provided in Section 3 of the Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1914 that free school meals may be supplied only to children attending recognised national schools, who are unable by reason of lack of food to take advantage of the education provided for them.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, a statutory grant-in-aid of £1,175,000 is payable to C.I.E. from the Exchequer in each <Col N="826" /> of the five years ending 31st March, 1964.  It is not proposed to provide extra moneys to C.I.E. for pensions or any other purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that these pensioners during their years of service worked very long hours for very little pay, and that the pensions they have at present are not worthy to be called pensions?  They are only pittances.  In view of that, would the Minister see to it that moneys will be provided to increase their pensions?  The Minister who has answered my question was generous enough to see to it in another service before he left the Department of Education.

      <P>The great majority of Sub-Postmasters have other sources of income and are therefore not solely dependent on their Post Office earnings. A Sub-Postmaster's salary is revised periodically in accordance with the volume of work at his office, and there are wide variations between small and large offices.  Sub-Postmasters got an increase of salary in February 1959 following a revision of the basis of payment recommended by the Sub-Postmasters' Consultative Council.  A claim from the Irish Sub-Postmasters' Union for a cost-of-living increase in line with that awarded to civil servants from 15th December last is at present being considered by the Sub-Postmasters' Consultative Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking when progress was reported on the question of the policy of the Department of Defence and the Government and stated my view that a conventional type of defence such as the Department have in mind is not the type of defence that would be of any advantage to this country, for the simple reason that we would not be able to withstand a conventional attack.  Therefore, the defence that we should develop should be a guerrilla type, which would afford an opportunity to prolong our defence and to do the utmost damage to any aggressor.</P>
      <P>That being so, any expenditure on heavy weapons is waste of money.  Expenditure on military aviation is also a waste of money because, in case of aggression, one of the first things to suffer would be all surface forces on our side.  We would not get a chance to use heavy weapons or military aircraft and no purpose could be served by having them.  We should devote every penny to a form of defence which would give us a reasonable chance of making it tell on any possible aggressor.  If we want to spend money on armaments we should spend it on portable weapons for use by a guerrilla force, not tanks or big guns, but such things as mortars that could be used to attack a barracks, anti-tank weapons and so on.  Expenditure on any other type of equipment is a waste of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> Some years ago a large accumulation of heavy equipment belonging to the Egyptians was completely destroyed overnight.  That gives some idea of the waste involved in the preparation of that kind of defence by the Egyptians against such forces as the British and the French.</P>
    <P>This country should plan entirely on terms of guerrilla defence.  There would be no need for heavy equipment and the account could be considerably less than it is.  It should not be £7½ million.  The expenditure could be reduced considerably if some attention were paid to having a proper line of defence, not one that, to my mind, is mere show.  That is the only purpose it can serve.</P>
    <P>Apart from that subject, which is a rather heavy subject, there are other matters on which I should like to comment now.  Last year, I expressed an objection to the use of Irish as a means of promotion in the Army.  The Minister indicated that while some Irish was necessary, it was not entirely essential for promotion.  I am not a fanatic about Irish.  I agree that we should try to cultivate some of our ancient culture and not allow it to die.  I have very little respect for quite a lot of our alleged culture because it is something that can be adopted, but the language is one part of our culture which we should try to sustain.  I am quite prepared to accept that, but I do not think it should be used for jobbery.  That is my objection.</P>
    <P>A knowledge of Irish does not make a man more intelligent or more brilliant. Anyone with plenty of time on his hands could learn Irish.  I learned a little Irish in jail, but I was shifted around so much that I did not finish learning it, and I have been too busy since earning my living to learn it.  It does not follow that if we were at war, I would be a more brilliant soldier if I had a knowledge of Irish.  In actual defence, guts and animalism are more necessary.  In war, language is of very little concern, so, on that score, we cannot accept that a knowledge of Irish makes men more brilliant.  There might be men in Defence who might have no gift for the language but who otherwise <Col N="838" /> are very brilliant men.  I should hate to think that those brilliant men were penalised just because they did not know the language and that some fellow just out of college with such a knowledge would be given such responsibility as might lead to a military collapse.</P>
    <P>The question of military brilliance does not depend on a knowledge of the language, or on education, either.  We know there must be certain standards but, in a real issue, those matters are superfluous.  The purpose of defence is defending a country in the best way possible and in the most ruthless way possible.  If it ever comes to a showdown, it is military brilliance and not brass bands and the wearing of medals that we want.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Estimate that the cost of service medals has increased by almost 100 per cent.  Last year, £500 was spent on service medals and this year, the figure is £940.  That little point amuses me.  How can that account be doubled in one year?  I thought all the people entitled to medals had got them and I thought that many people who were not entitled to them had got them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They are probably now giving them to the people who are entitled to them.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Mac-Eoin was Minister for Defence, he said he would set up a commission of inquiry.  Some of those people are &ldquo;phoneys&rdquo; and the Minister should do something about them.  There would, therefore, be fewer service medals involved.  I cannot see how the account for service medals can be doubled this year.  That is a little matter which tickles my fancy, anyway.</P>

      <P>Thart fá bliain ó shoin shocraigh an t-Aire atheagrú a dhéanamh ar na Forsaí Cosanta sa tír seo.  Is é a bhí beartaithe aige a dhéanamh ná An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil a thabhairt isteach go díreach faoin Arm.  Roimhe sin bhí dhá roinn sna Fórsaí, an tArm agus an F.C.A.  Ar ndóigh bhí ceangal eatorra, ach bhí an ceangal seo iontach scaoilte agus níor chuidigh sin le héifeacht na bhfórsaí i gcoitinne.  Bhí roinnt oifigeach airm ag cuidiú leis an bhfórsa ach is beag a thiocfadh leo a dhéanamh faoin chóras mar bhí sé.  Bhí an córas sin ceart go leor i rith an chogaidh cion is nach rabh caoi ag an Rialtas athrú a dhéanamh air san am.  Ach nuair a bhí an cogadh thart bhí sé in ann athrú a dhéanamh a d'fhágfadh an F.C.A. níos éifeachtaí agus níos foirfe. Anuraidh tosaíodh ar eagar úr a chur ar an fhórsa.  Anois tá an F.C.A. go díreach faoin Arm.  Tá siad ag fáil traenála le gunnaí úra, gunnaí nach rabh acu roimhe seo.  Thig liom a rá gur beag an difir, go dtí seo, a bhí idir an traenáil a bhí á fháil ag an F.C.A. agus an traenáil a fuair siad i rith an chogaidh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá mé go láidir den bharúil gurb é an córas cosanta is fearr a thiocfadh a bheith againn ná córas a bheadh <Col N="840" /> bunaithe ar an F.C.A.&mdash;arm beag a bheith againn, oifigigh agus fir oilte go maith a bheith againn mar cadre traenála don F.C.A.  Laghdoidh sin costais an Airm go mór, ach chomh maith le sin, bheadh arm againn den tsaghas is fóirstiní don tír seo againn. Ní thiocfadh linne arm a bheith againn a bheadh láidir go leor le seasamh in éadan arm as tír láidir chumhachtach, ach thiocfadh linn arm a bheith againn a chuirfeadh moill ar arm ar bith agus a thabharfadh seans dúinn cuidiú a fháil.</P>
    <P>Mholfainn don Aire, an aois a cheadaítear do dhaoine óga le dhul isteach san F.C.A. a laghdú go dtí sé bliana déag ar a laghad.  Níor ghá arm ná éide a thabhairt do na daoine óga sin go dtí go mbeadh an toifigeach ceannais sásta ligean dóibh na rudaí sin a bheith acu.  Dá dtiocfadh linn daoine óga mar sin a mhealladh isteach san F.C.A. thiocfadh linn rudaí a chur ar siúl a rachadh chun tairbhe do na daoine óga sin.  Thiocfadh linn léachtaí a thabhairt dóibh ar an ghrá ba cheart dóibh a thabhairt dá dtír féin agus ar an spiorad poiblí is ceart a bheith acu.  Dá mbeadh cúrsaí speisialta traenála trí Ghaeilge againn agus cead ag comhaltaí an F.C.A. freastal orthu, chabhródh sé go mór.  Táim cinnte dá dtigeadh linn an spiorad náisiunta a mhúscailt ins na daoine óga&mdash;a chur in iúl dóibh go bhfuil tír acu agus gur fiú meas í&mdash;go gcuirfeadh sé feabhas ar eacanamíocht na tíre, mar sílim gurb é sin an rud atá in easnamh, spiorad níos fearr a leathnú i measc na ndaoine.  Is é an rud tabhachtach ná go dtagann daoine isteach san F.C.A. dá ndeoin féin.  Sin é an saghas duine is fearr sa tír so, an duine atá sásta dul isteach i bhfórsa mar seo agus traenáil a dhéanamh chun a thír a chosaint, saor in aisce.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart rud éigin a dhéanamh faoin chulaith éadaigh atá á chaitheamh ag comhaltaí an F.C.A.  Bhí na héadaigh sin ceart go leor le linn an Chogaidh agus ar feadh tamaill ina dhiaidh sin, ach tá athrú mór tagtha ar na héadaigh atá á ghaitheamh ag an gnáth-shaighdiúir agus tá cuma níos fearr ortha.  Táim den bharúil nach bhfuil na daoine óga sásta leis na <Col N="841" /> héadaigh atá acu faoi láthair go mór mhór nuair atá siad ag dul ar chuirm ceoil nó céilí no damhsa faoi stiúrú an F.C.A.</P>
    <P>Mura mbeadh sé ro chostasach ba chóir na héadaigh a dhéanamh sa chuid sin den tír in a bhfuil an F.C.A. bunaithe, cur i gcás i gCo. na Midhe agus deisceart Co. Lúbhaidh d'fhéadfadh monarchana i nDroichead Átha na h-éadaigh a sholáthair don F.C.A. agus i dtuaisceart Lúbhaidh agus Mhuineacháin thiocfadh le monarchan i nDúndealgan iad a dhéanamh.  Dá mbeadh an tAire sásta éadaigh níos fearr a chur ar fáil do na daoine óga atá san Fhórsa seo, chuideodh sé sin leis an spiorad a árdú ann.</P>
    <P>Tá gearrán i measc cuid de na hoifigigh Dara Leifteanant, sna F.C.A. go bhfuil siad ag fanacht ró-fhada le árdú céime, agus go bhfuil siad ag cailleadh airgid nuair a théann siad ar an traenáil bhliantúil.  Mar gheall ar sin mholfainn don Aire dul isteach sa chás sin agus an cheist a shocrú comh luath agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Níl fhios agam an bhfuil sé mar ghnás ag an Aire cáipéisí seirbhíse a thabhairt do na fir óga a chaitheann tréimhse san F.C.A.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh cáipéisí mar seo ag fir óga i ndiaidh cúig bliana a chaitheamh san fhórsa mar chuideodh sé leo post a fháil.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom focal molta a rá faoi na daoine atá sa chosaint shibhialta.  Tá obair á dhéanamh ag na daoine san eagraíocht sin cosúil le hobair an F.C.A.  Tá siad ag déanamh traenála saor in aisce chun a dtír a chosaint dá dtagadh cogadh eile.  Ní féidir linn moladh ró-ard a thabhairt dóibh.  Ba mhaith liom fosta a iarraidh ar na daoine óga dul isteach sa chosaint shibhialta agus san F.C.A.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom fosta an tAire a mholadh as an méid atá á dhéanamh san Arm i dtaobh na teangan.  Bhí áthas orm éisteacht leis an Ghinearál Mac Eoin ag rá go bhfuil sé iontach sásta leis an tslí in a bhfuil an tArm ag dul ar agaidh maidir leis an teanga. Bhí daoine anseo inniú ag magadh faoin teanga agus ag magadh faoin <Col N="842" /> Arm agus ag rá go bhfuilimid ag caitheamh airgid ar an Arm gan tairbhe.  Thig linn dul siar agus cuimhniú go raibh daoine ag magadh faoi lucht 1916 fosta.  Comh maith leis sin, is fiú smaoineamh gur árachas atá san Arm.  Sa chogadh deireanach bhí daoine ag rá go raibh an tArm beag ach bí an tArm ábalta, dá dtagadh taobh amháin den dá thaobh a bhí sa chogadh isteach anseo, an tír a chosaint go dtiocfadh an taobh eile chun cuidiú léi.  Sin an rud a chaithfimid smaoineamh air anois, gur árachas atá san Arm agus go bhfuil sé in a árachas don tír uilig.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Happily on this occasion the House is considering the Estimate for the Department of Defence in circumstances in which all the pointers are to a satisfactory situation.  The aim of our national Army should be to provide a kind of shop window display for our country and to bring home to every one of our own people who do not yet appreciate the fact, and particularly to people who visit this country from outside, that we have developed, over a very short period, a force which can be complimented in many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the character and bearing of the members of the Defence Forces of all ranks. When people visit different countries they are impressed by the bearing and conduct of those they see in uniform. We may expect, therefore, the people who visit this country are affected by the bearing and conduct of those they see in uniform here.  In the Garda Síochána and the National Army we are happy to have two forces which we can claim are a credit to this country, when one considers the difficulties under which both Forces were set up.  Some of our people did not realise for a long time that these men were the servants of a new State which was practically free to exercise its own Government and its own institutions and represented a country which could look to a great future.  I suppose that that was natural, when one considers that so many residents of this country had never seen anybody in <Col N="843" /> uniform who did not represent forces of occupation and oppression.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a growing recognition of our people's capacity to operate the services of a civilised community. In that respect, those who lead our Army have played no small part. In recent years, an opportunity was presented through the United Nations to the Government which preceded this Government to send some Irish officers to the Lebanon.  That gave an opportunity to some of our Army officers to meet officers of other democratic countries.  It is heartening that the Government were in agreement with that policy and that our officers brought credit to their country as a result of their service in that part of the world.</P>
    <P>Nowadays there appears to be a growing difficulty arising out of attractions offered to men to take up vocations outside.  There is a need to combat this trend by sympathetic attention.  The emphasis throughout the world is rapidly changing to scientific armaments and a reduction in the importance of the infantryman.  I contend that in this country the members of the Army have a rewarding future.  The history of the Force is such as to inspire pride in the heart of any young man who serves his country. It was born of the glorious fight for independence and developed in the atmosphere of the establishment and maintenance of our democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>Our present-day Army enjoys a position unsullied by an oppression of other peoples.  It is unique in this respect in the world to-day.  Countries that are to-day quite democratic in the conduct of their affairs and in their associations with their neighbours and less fortunate countries are bedevilled by unfortunate instances as has been instanced in the not too distant past. In this respect, any member of our State personnel can confidently raise his head in any part of the world in relation to our past.</P>
    <P>I am gratified to note the improvement in the standard of our Army Jumping Team.  On past Defence Estimates, I had occasion to refer with some concern to the fact that the <Col N="844" /> standard of our Army Jumping Team seemed to be deteriorating and that it was a great loss to us that it was not meeting with the successes we desired. I hope that whatever advance has been made in recent times will continue.</P>
    <P>We are not blessed with the number of Army Bands which one can hear in other countries.  Our people look to the Army to provide musicians on very many occasions.  I should like to see every encouragement given to the recruitment and training of suitable instrumentalists to replace those who are retiring.</P>
    <P>We have reason to be proud of our officers, both senior and junior.  I was horrified to learn that one question asked of a young aspirant to cadetship was his opinion on the Treaty controversy. That question may have been put in good faith.  No doubt, all members of the Army should be familiar with the history of our country but a young boy who has just left school and who is asked this question by a board might well be excused if he felt his entire future hinged on the answer he gave to that question.  I regard it as an unfair question to pose to a young lad in present times.</P>
    <P>I realise that cadets are, let us hope, brought into the Forces completely on merit.  No opportunity should be given to any aspirant to officer rank in the Army to think that he was not accepted because of some answer he gave to such a question.  Whoever was responsible for the compilation of the questions was certainly not on the right lines in including such a question.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach assumed office Deputies were gratified when he linked the names of Éamon de Valera and Michael Collins as the leaders of the movement for the creation of the State and responsible for the national advancement we now enjoy.  The State has conferred every possible honour on Éamon de Valera but Michael Collins did not live to see the development of the infant State.  Surely it is incumbent on us to revere the memory of the late Michael Collins?  I am confident the people do and will revere his memory.  There is just one blot on the situation.  The Government persist in refusing permission to the Army to <Col N="845" /> pay tribute once a year to his memory at Bealnablath.  I again appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter and, in the atmosphere of the speech made here by his Taoiseach&mdash;if those words are to be regarded as genuine and not hypocritical&mdash;to allow the Army to pay that annual tribute to the man who founded the Force.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I must refer with still more regret.  The Minister saw fit when he visited my constituency to make an intemperate speech during which he ascribed all kinds of base motives to people who may have certain views in relation to the language.  As a member of the Government, the Minister for Defence is surely as concerned as any other member of the Government with all aspects of policy.  His speech was detrimental to the interests of his Department. The reaction locally and, in fact, amongst those responsible for inviting him was serious.  It sparked off a feeling of deep resentment.  Even if people hold views which are not the same as those held by the Minister, they may hold them in good faith.  It does not augur well that, on that occasion, he should have embarked on such an intemperate speech.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on the same line as I commenced by paying a tribute to the personnel of the permanent Army and also to those young men who, in times which are not as attractive to young men to give the attention to military affairs that they could so willingly and at such sacrifice give during an Emergency, are doing their bit in the ranks of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather disappointed that we still have not got any statement from the Minister as to the over-all rôle of the Defence Forces, with particular reference to the land and air aspects of those Forces.  The Minister said this morning that the policy was to have such close co-ordination with the F.C.A. that at very short notice a considerable land force could be made available. Later in his speech he referred to the role of the Civil Defence Organisation which he appeared to visualise as being <Col N="846" /> primarily concerned with protection against the effects of nuclear warfare.</P>
      <P>I think we should face up to the point that it is difficult to plan policy for the Defence Forces, unless we have some conception of the sort of war or sort of hostilities we are envisaging.  It seems at least highly unlikely that our Army will ever be involved in hostilities using only what are now known as conventional weapons.</P>
      <P>The really important part of the Minister's speech in this regard was his stressing of the necessity of defending ourselves against the effects of nuclear explosions.  If that is our main danger, I cannot see why at any date in the future we would need to raise any considerable number of men to serve in the land forces at all.  I believe that the day has now gone when in this country there is any tactical or strategic significance in the defence of Europe.</P>
      <P>It was quite different in the days of the last wear.  Now with the inter-continental ballistic missile and supersonic aircraft, we are of no advantage to anyone, either as an ally of Great Britain or as a base against her.  I am not at all sure, therefore, that we are wise in organising our Defence Forces in such a way as to be able to put 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 men into the field at comparatively short notice.  Even if we were able to do that, I do not know what those men would be expected to do.  I would hope, therefore, perhaps not today but at some time, we might have some statement from the Minister as to his conception of the general rôle of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have excluded from this the role of the Naval Service because I think that is quite different, yet, to some extent, it comes under the same criticism.  Its main duties at the moment appear to be fishery protection but to confine a naval service to fishery protection again appears to be rather unusual and rather hard to justify.  If we are to have a Naval Service and if we are to justify such expenditure, I think we shall have to show that something, apart from fishery protection, is required.  I personally cannot see what additional <Col N="847" /> service is required, apart from fishery protection.</P>
    <P>The size of the Naval Service which we could have at any time would preclude anything in the nature of engaging in naval warfare, that is, assuming that ordinary surface naval warfare is something which will ever happen again, which I greatly doubt.  It might be said that a naval service would have some function as regards harbour protection but I do not think that could be sustained either.  Again, it might be said that a naval service should be some protection against submarine warfare but certainly our corvettes are quite unsuitable for that rôle.  The present development of submarines is such that, even with those submarines which are not powered by nuclear power, submarines would be able to outsail any one of our ships, even when submerged.  The chances of our corvettes catching up on a submarine, even if they could find it, would be absolutely nil.</P>
    <P>With the Naval Service organised as at present, I think we are wasting money to be training new personnel as cadets, as ordinary naval cadets as in the naval services of the Great Powers. I would hope that here again we could have a new assessment of what we require in this regard with a considerable saving of expenditure.  Even the small corvettes we have cost a lot of money to maintain and run and the regular re-fits which are necessary, if they are to be kept seaworthy, are very expensive indeed and require the maintenance of a considerable shipyard and shore personnel.  I hope, therefore, that we can have a reassessment of that service as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I should hope, too, that we would be able to face up to the decision that all that we require is fishery protection and that we should then proceed, as soon as possible, to dispose of the corvettes and replace them with smaller and faster surface craft which will be able to give better protection to our fishermen at a very much reduced cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed to find that we are still in possession of anti-aircraft artillery. That has no function whatever in any Army anywhere any more.  I am <Col N="848" /> not saying that purely as a matter of my own opinion.  Anti-aircraft artillery simply cannot hit modern aircraft and never will be able to do so.  The time was when it was possible.  I know that we have spent&mdash;and I think very properly spent&mdash;in the past years a considerable amount of money on radar control for anti-aircraft artillery. There was some chance 10 or 15 years ago.  There is now no chance of an anti-aircraft gun or even an anti-aircraft battery hitting anything in the supersonic range.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that some new type of medium anti-tank artillery has been purchased.  I can see quite some point in such a purchase because anti-tank artillery is not restricted in its use to firing against tanks.  High velocity armour-piercing shells might be very useful in any artillery action which might be undertaken in almost any circumstances.</P>
    <P>Now, if the Minister will forgive me, I should like to come back to my old complaint about coastal defence artillery. When I was on holidays in Cork last year, I saw the report of the annual shoot of the coastal batteries in Cork. The target was towed across 2,000 yards from the guns.  Quite a number of very near misses were reported and one or two direct hits.  That seems to me to be a waste of time and money, because we can never hope that an enemy will be sufficiently foolish to cruise up and down within 2,000 yards of an artillery battery.  That sort of thing does not happen.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows this coastal artillery was necessary for harbour protection and ordinary harbour duties in time of war and emergency.  To be perfectly frank, that does not make sense to me at all because we did extremely well in the port of Dublin, and even in the port of Dún Laoghaire without any coastal defences at all.  So far as I know, we never had any there, even during the war years.  There was a small battery of extremely ancient 18-pounders on the East Pier at one time but my recollection is that nobody ever knew what they were there for and they were used more as a saluting battery than anything else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> I have a horrible suspicion that they would have been more dangerous to the crew manning them, if they were fired, than to anybody on the other end because they were extremely ancient weapons.  Even though the very heavy coastal defence guns are no longer exercised, they must involve considerable expenditure.  When we find that even fixed sites for inter-continental ballistic missiles are now being abandoned as being hopelessly vulnerable to attack, the idea of our maintaining coastal defence artillery batteries seems to be entirely ludicrous.  In an Army you must always be able to show the men who are serving that they are doing something intelligent and I cannot see how anybody in the coastal defence artillery can seriously consider he is serving a useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the Army Bands.  I agree with what he said but I should like to go a little further.  I always feel it is a pity that these bands are known only by their numbers, the No. 1 Army Band, No. 2 and so on.  That does not seem to me to be giving them a proper standing. It would be very much better if the authorities could think of some name for each band such as the Band of the Eastern Command, the Band of the Western Command, the Band of the Curragh Command, or whatever you may like, or even of attaching them to the Brigades.  But to have a band which is not attached to a unit does not seem appropriate, nor does it give it a proper dignity.</P>
    <P>As I did last year, I should like again to criticise the continued occupation of some old city barracks in Dublin.  There is at least one modern barracks, Clancy Barracks, with some excellent accommodation.  When you compare that with the very dingy and depressing circumstances of Griffith Barracks, Collins Barracks or even Cathal Brugha Barracks&mdash;which is not quite so bad&mdash;I feel the continued occupation of these old and rather prison-like barracks is very depressing for the troops.  They are almost certainly costing an awful lot by way of maintenance.  I hope that if possible one, or even more, of these old barracks will be closed down and no <Col N="850" /> further maintenance undertaken on them so that any money voted in respect of barrack maintenance can be spent on barracks which are kept at least moderately full.  It is very depressing to be one of a very small party in a very empty barracks.  These old barracks involve heavy duties on the troops themselves and if we could have more troops in a lesser number of barracks, the duties would be much more evenly distributed.</P>
    <P>Last year, I commented on the number of infantry battalions.  I do not credit myself with being responsible for it, because I think it was obvious that the number would have to be reduced, but I am glad that the Minister has reduced the number of battalions by one.  It was unfortunate that he selected the last battalion with which I myself served.  I was sorry to see it go but there was every reason for that decision.  It was the 7th Battalion and while I was sorry to see it go, the decision was perfectly correct.</P>
    <P>Last year, I commented on the need for more battle training for the troops and I feel I should comment again on it.  I still feel that their physique is not good enough.  They are not being trained in modern battle technique, or being hardened up, and if I look at them individually or in a body marching from here to there on parade, I cannot feel they are really hardened troops ready for action.  I think that is partly because there is not a sufficiently realistic approach to the whole question of what the Army is supposed to be preparing for.  I would hope for more battle training, a greater hardening of the troops and less routine duty.</P>
    <P>A good example of the bad effect of this lack of realism can be seen in the sentries on duty outside Leinster House.  I do not want to be too general in my criticism.  One sentry whom I saw on duty last night was behaving in a singularly soldier-like way and quite clearly he thought he was doing something important. He was very smart and very soldierly in his bearing.  The previous day there was another sentry whom I noticed for a considerable time and for whom I have the greatest sympathy because <Col N="851" /> I think he knew he was not doing any sort of job at all, just knocking off his two hours' duty and hoping and praying that the two hours would not be too slow in passing so that he could get back to the guard room for a rest.</P>
    <P>To be perfectly frank, I do not know what those sentries are doing and why we should have sentries only from sunset on.  I cannot see that there is any likelihood of greater danger after sunset than before it.  If there were to be an attack, anyone with two eyes in his head could see that sentries would not be on duty until sunset.  The sentry could not go into action anyway, unless he took shelter behind a couple of parked cars. He has no protection whatever.  Consequently, I believe he is not there for defensive purposes and I wonder what on earth he is there for because he is not a ceremonial soldier.  He is an ordinary soldier not on ceremonial duty or equipped for it and he has not got the uniform for it.  Sometimes, I am sorry to say, he has not got the bearing, either.</P>
    <P>I hope we can clear up small matters like that.  If they are required for ceremonial purposes, they should be in the better uniforms and be drilled in a better fashion.  I am not a great believer of ceremony of that kind and I feel they would be much better withdrawn out of sight.  If, for defensive purposes, it is necessary or desirable to have a body of troops on immediate call for defence of the House in case of trouble, they should be kept out of sight in the guardroom and not be asked to parade up and down in the way they are called upon to do at the moment.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say that he was considering standardising the Army and the F.C.A. uniforms.  For a long time, I have considered that that should be done. I believe it will do nothing but good. I can quite see that old stocks will have to be used but this differentiation between the Army and the F.C.A. personnel can do nothing but harm and I think it puts it into the heads of the F.C.A. that they are an inferior group.  If they are to be integrated <Col N="852" /> with the Army and be ready on a moment's call for calling up with the regular units, they should be dressed and equipped exactly as the Regular Army is.  I hope some thought will be given to an appropriate uniform.</P>
    <P>I am not at all happy with the design of the ordinary uniform of the Regular Army.  The idea of having a closed-neck tunic is absolutely abhorrent to me.  It is very unhealthy and an open-neck tunic or one which can be worn open at times is very much better.  Whether what is known as the battledress form of tunic is preferable and whether the skirt of the tunic should hang outside the trousers is a question I leave to somebody else, but the idea of standardisation has been mooted and I urge the Minister to proceed along these lines as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>One item of uniform that always irritated me is the forage cap.  Very few people can wear it properly and I was never one of them.  I tried it and I looked more foolish, perhaps, than usual.  I was delighted to be able to get a peaked cap.  I believe the forage cap is expensive because it takes an enormous amount of material and I think it should be abolished.  There is a lot to be said for the Glengarry of the F.C.A. or else the ordinary beret which is much more serviceable and in which it is much easier to look smart.</P>
    <P>I also want to congratulate and thank the Minister on having at last got round to the promotion of the Reserve Officers.  These reserve lieutenants served for very many years and have at last achieved the third bar and I think everybody is delighted that action was taken.</P>
    <P>Greater care could be exercised by officers commanding units to make sure their troops turn out well.  I have seen soldiers walking around the city who were not a credit to the Army.  They were exceptions but I was sorry to see them at all.  Sometimes you see soldiers out wearing dirty leather, unpolished leather belts, both leather and brass not cleaned at all.  Personally, I hate leather belts and even military police, I think, should be equipped with the web belt <Col N="853" /> and web holster rather than leather belt and leather holster which they carry at the moment.  The leather holster hangs awkwardly.  The revolver carried in that holster is sometimes quite unsafe because of the tendency it has to fall, whereas in the web holster the revolver is held straight up on the belt.  It looks smarter and is very much safer.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been asked to give consideration to the question of payment of children's allowances to officers.  The facts are well known to him and, I think, to most people, but it does seem to be a great pity and a source of grievance amongst the officers that while civil servants receive ordinary children's allowances, Army officers do not.  There are all sorts of arguments backwards and forwards as to hospital treatment and other facilities which officers may or may not get for their families, but I feel this is a genuine grievance on the part of officers and I think it is bad that anything looking like a genuine grievance should remain.  I would urge the Minister to give very serious consideration to this and see if he can persuade the Minister for Finance&mdash;if he needs persuasion&mdash;to allow payment of children's allowances to officers.</P>
    <P>On the question of Army pay, as far as I can see, there has been no increase in the professional pay of legal officers. As one who was a legal officer for a short period myself, I feel sympathy for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There as been an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted.  Instead of making any criticism, may I congratulate and thank the Minister for having done that?  I made a calculation on the Estimate which appeared to show he had not done it.  I am delighted to find I was wrong.  I suggest that consideration be given to the payment of marriage allowances to soldiers directly instead of to their wives.  I know that has been considered before and I know that the wives would prefer it should not be done, but at the same time the amount of administrative <Col N="854" /> expenses involved in paying these allowances to the wives as well as paying the soldiers themselves is quite excessive.  So far as I know, no other Government servant is paid individually himself while his wife receives a marriage allowance separately.</P>
      <P>I am sure this is a carry-over from the British Army days when British soldiers were actually serving in India, China or elsewhere and obviously it would be far too difficult for them to send money home to their wives from great distances.  Our troops are not serving abroad.  Most of them are living in married quarters or in their own houses adjacent to the barracks and there are no difficulties about soldiers giving housekeeping money to their wives.  I do not see why soldiers should be treated differently from anybody else, especially when it obviously causes much more expense to public funds.</P>
      <P>The total number employed on the civil side of the Department deserves comment.  We have provided in the Estimate for a total of about 1,100 officers and we are providing also for the employment of 504 civil servants. That number of 504 civil servants at Army Headquarters excludes the Minister's personal staff so that anything I may say, I can say it with present company always excepted.  To have 504 civil servants to deal with slightly over 1,000 officers and 8,000 men seems to me to be an enormous figure.  I am sorry that there seems to be an increase this year of 17: 14 extra are employed on civil defence; there is a decrease of one in the accounts section and an increase of four on pensions administration.  It seems to merit comment that at this time we have to employ even more people on the administration of pensions when many of the pensions are in respect of service which has long since terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to any economies possible on the civil side and, in conclusion, I want to mention one matter which I also mentioned last year about which I feel as keenly now as I did then.  I refer to the annual parade of the armed Forces and the Auxiliary Services through the city on Easter Sunday.  Easter Sunday to me&mdash;and I <Col N="855" /> think to most people&mdash;is primarily a feast of the Church and the anniversary of the Rising is celebrated on the nearest Sunday to the calendar anniversary. Granted that the Rising took place in the Easter period, it was not on Easter Sunday and I feel it is entirely improper that Easter Sunday morning, after religious observance, should be devoted to taking part in, or observing, an Army parade.</P>
    <P>I know that nobody wants to spoil Easter Monday as a bank holiday and I do not want to persuade the Minister to employ the troops on that day either, but if the parade is regarded as desirable&mdash;and I think there is a lot to be said for it because it gives an opportunity for the people to see what the Army looks like&mdash;I would ask the Minister and those in authority to consider very seriously leaving Easter Sunday as a Sunday should be and especially as Easter Sunday should be.  Do not let us have men under arms on a day such as that. I do not say that in any contentious way.  Generally speaking, this Estimate is well justified but I hope we shall have a re-thinking and a restatement of the general rôle of the Defence Forces on land, on sea and in the air.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt don Aire agus don Roinn as an obair atá á dhéanamh sna scoileanna san Arm. Anuraidh chuaigh an chéad scata a raibh a gcúrsa críochnaithe acu amach as an scoil i Nás, agus is breá an rud é a chlos go bhfuil ag dul ar aghaidh go maith leo.  Ceist faoin scoil sin&mdash;an féidir séipéal a chur ar fáil ann agus séiplíneach dá gcuid féin a thabhairt dóibh?  Tá fhios agam go mbíonn Cúrsa Spioradálta ag na buachaillí agus go mbíonn ceachtanna acu sa Teagasc Críostaí agus go dtugann an sagart paróiste agus na sagairt eile gach cúnamh dóibh, ach sílim go mba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh séiplíneach dá gcuid féin acu.  Ceist eile faoi na scoileanna &mdash;cad chuige nach bhfuil ceannfort ar Scoil Póilíní an Airm?  Tugtar ceannfort ar an gceannasaí, ach níl ann ach captaen, agus tá céim níos <Col N="856" /> aoirde ná sin ag gach ceannasaí eile.</P>
      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as ucht an socrú a rinne sé anuraidh le Coiste Gairm-Oideachais Chill Dara maidir leis an scoil ar an gCurrach, ach tá scoil náisiúnta ag teastáil leis. Tugadh freagra dom le déanaí go raibh ceist na scoile sin faoi scrúdú. Tá súil agam go mbeidh tairbhe ar an scrúdú sin agus go dtosófar ar an obair i mbliana mar tá gá géar le scoil nua ansin.</P>
      <P>Cuidím leis na teachtaí a d'iarr ar an Aire liúntas leanaí a thabhairt do na hoifigigh.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil an cheist sin faoi scrúdú leis agus tá súil agam nach dtógfaidh sé rófhada go mbeidh réiteach sásúil againn.  Cuidím leo-san freisin a d'iarr ar an Aire rud éigin a dhéanamh faoin éide atá ag an bhFórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  Tugadh geallúint cúpla bliain ó shoin go ndéanfaí rud éigin, ach níor deineadh.  Tá súil agam go gcomhlíonfar an gheallúint anois.</P>
      <P>There are some few matters which are perennial sources of complaint in my constituency.  The first is promotion. There is a feeling that there are not enough outlets for men who join the Army.  There is a growing feeling amongst the younger men at present that the Army is not a place in which they should spend the rest of their working lives.  Many of them feel that they should get out now and try to do better for themselves outside because there is not enough scope for promotion for them in the Army.  If the Minister could do something to shorten the period in which promotion falls due, that would be a step in the right direction.  If there is dissatisfied personnel now the time will come when we shall have no Army at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the selection of cadets, this year in particular there have been many complaints.  Nobody seems to know what the standard looked for is.  School authorities who prepared boys specially for the examination this year and who considered the boys eminently well fitted for an Army career are at a loss to understand what exactly is required.  Many of these boys were rejected.  I should <Col N="857" /> like the Minister to consider the matter because there is grave dissatisfaction, particularly this year, in relation to selection.</P>
    <P>With regard to civilian employees on the Curragh, there is also a feeling of insecurity.  They never know when they will be let go.  I know that some men regard themselves as permanent but there is really no such thing as a permanent staff.  I am told there is sufficient work to justify making these employees permanent.  From what I see myself at the Curragh, and in Kildare, there is plenty of work. I understand Kildare Barracks cost £250,000.  It is rapidly falling into disrepair.  There are fewer than 100 men in it and the repair work being done is not sufficient to keep to in the condition in which it should be kept for occupation purposes.  The unoccupied part of it is, as I said, falling into disrepair very rapidly. There is sufficient work there to keep men permanently employed on it.</P>
    <P>It may be that there is not sufficient money allocated for upkeep.  It is certainly not because of a shortage of work.  The work is there.  Those men who have this feeling of insecurity could be kept in continuous employment if that work were taken in hands.  Any work that has to be done should be done throught the Corps of Engineers so that these men in civilian employment with the Army could have some guarantee of permanent employment.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch de na Teachtaí a labhair ar an Meastachán.  Thug an chuid is mó díobh Cothrom na Féinne don Roinn sa méid a bhí le rá acu, ach tá daoine eile ann agus is é an nós atá acu locht a chur ar an Roinn gach uair is féidir leo ach is dócha gur cuma é sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá rud amháin a dúirt an Teachta Mac Eoin, an tAire a bhí ann romhamsa, agus tá mé an-bhuíoch de toisc go ndúirt sé é, is sin ag tagairt do cheist na Gaeilge san Arm, dúirt sé go raibh sé mar chomhartha ag an Arm i gcónaí bheith i bhfabhar na teanga.  Is féidir liom a rá go bhfuil sé sin fíor.  Scrúdaigh mé roinnt trodán a bhí ann beagnach ó thús an Airm agus bhí sé soiléir dom go raibh <Col N="858" /> an-iarracht á dhéanamh san Arm i gcónaí chun úsáid na teanga a chur chun cinn ann, nach bhfuil aon rud á dhéanamh agamsa anois nach raibh in aigne na ndaoine a bhí i gceannas an Airm ó thosach báire.  Ar ndóigh, ní raibh cúrsaí an Airm fabhrach an t-am san chun go n-éireodh leis an iarracht sin.  Ní raibh an t-eolas ar an teanga ag na hoifigigh an t-am sin.  Tá athrú scéil ann anois agus tá eolas ag na hoifigigh ar an teanga.  Tá sin mar atá toisc go raibh sé mar choinníoll i gcónaí, sula dtógfaí fear óg isteach san Arm mar dhalta nó cadet, no mbeadh eolas maith aige ar an nGaeilge.  Ó thosach báire is mar sin a bhí agus, mar sin ó tháinig mise isteach fuaireas amach go raibh Gaeilge mhaith ag an gcuid is mó de na hoifigigh agus, mar sin, bhíos in ann níos mó a dhéanamh, b'fhéidir, chun an teanga a chur chun cinn ná mar a bhí ar chumas na ndaoine a bhí ann cheana.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, tá mé buíoch den Teachta MacEoin as ucht an méid a dúirt sé faoi sin.  Ní maith liom aon chreidiúint speisialta a ghlacadh chugam féin de bharr an iarracht atá á dhéanamh. Tá fhios agam nach bhféadfaí é a dhéanamh murach an socrú a rinne na daoine a tháinig romham.  Tá áthas orm an chreidiúint sin a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom, mar a dúras, go bhfuil aon rud speisialta á dheanamh agam.  Níl á dhéanamh agam ach ag leanúint leis an iarracht náisiúnta a bhí ann i gcónaí maidir leis an teanga. Más rud é go bhfuil ag éirí liom go réasúnta maith&mdash;níl ag éirí thar barr&mdash; is de bharr a ndearnadh cheana féin é.</P>
    <P>Dar ndóigh, bhí Teachta eile ann a thug fúm faoin méid atá á dhéanamh. Ní dóigh liom gur gá aon rud a rá faoi sin.</P>
    <P>D'iarr an Teachta Mac Eochagáin orm na buíonta den Fhórsa Cosanta Áitiúil in áiteanna mar Ghaillimh a chur á dtraenáil in áiteanna i gConamara in ionad iad a chur go dtí Fionnabhar i gContae Dhún na nGall.  Ba mhaith liom é sin a dhéanamh ach, de réir mar atá an scéal faoi láthair, níl aon áit oiriúnach againn i gConamara ná i nGaillimh, agus ní mór iad a chur go dtí Fionnabhar.  Tá mé ag féachaint <Col N="859" /> isteach sa scéal.  Más féidir é, déanfaidh mé campaí a chur ar bun sna Gaeltachtaí i gcoitinne.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil buíon eile den Fhórsa Cosanta Áitiúil seachas iad sin atá i gConamara gur mhaith leo a dtraenáil a dhéanamh sna h-áiteanna sin agus ba mhaith liom cuidiú leo ach tá deacrachtaí sa tslí.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh ar ár gcumas na deacrachtaí a shárú.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta céanna gur mhaith an rud é dá dtabharfaí breis pá do na saighdiúirí sa Chéad Chath toisc go ndéanann siad a gcuid dualgas trí Ghaeilge ar fad.  Níor mhaith liom rud mar sin a dhéanamh. Ní dóigh liom gur ceart go mbeadh aon ghá leis.  Níl aon seirbhís sa bhreis á tabhairt ag na daoine sin.  Tá mé cinnte nach gceapann siad féin gur ceart breis pá a thabhairt dóibh toisc go labhrann siad a dteanga féin ag déanamh a gcuid dualgas dóibh.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ceist eile ar thagair an Teachta céanna di, is é sin, feabhas a chur ar sheomraí codlata na bhfear, bionn aire á tabhairt don rud sin i gcónaí agus tá feabhas á chur i ndiaidh a chéile ar na seomraí codlata i gcoitinne ar fúd na tire.  Ní féidir é sin a dheanamh i ngach áit ag an am céanna.  Tá a lán déanta cheana féin agus déanfar a thuilleadh amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tithe cónaithe, tá aire á tabhairt dó sin freisin.  Tá mórán áiteanna ar fud na tíre ina bhfuil tithe cónaithe nua ag teastáil.  Mar is eol do Theachtaí, le blianta beaga anuas tógadh tithe i mBaile Atha Cliath, Áth Luain agus sa Churrach agus tá 24 theach á dtógáil i gCorcaigh faoi láthair.  Nuair a bheidh siad sin críochnaithe, tosófar ar scéim tithe in áit éigin eile.  Ní féidir liom a rá fós pé acu i nGaillimh, Luimneach nó cad é an áit eile a dtosófar leis an gcéad scéim eile.  Is féidir leis na Teachtaí a bhfuil suim acu sa cheist a bheith cinnte nuair a chríochnófar an scéim atá ar siúl faoi láthair go dtosófar ar scéim eile agus go leanfar ar aghaidh mar sin go dtí go mbeidh go leor, nó beagnach go leor, tithe ar fáil i ngach áit a bhfuil an tArm suite ann.</P>
    <P>D'iarr an Teachta Ó Fachtna orm an aois is isle inar féidir le duine dul <Col N="860" /> isteach san Arm a laghdú go 16 bliana. Ag caint dó ar an gceist sin thug sé féin cuid mhaith de na hargóintí ina choinne is é sin, go bhfuil daoine mar sin ró-óg chun bheith ag láimhseáil arm, agus argóintí mar sin.  Ba mhaith liom, áfach, a chur i gcuimhne don Teachta go dtógtar buachaillí óga mar phrintisigh isteach sa Scoil Printiseachta i Nás na Rí, agus tógtar isteach buachaillí óga san Aer-Chór i mBaile Uí Dhónaill.  Tugtar traenáil an-mhaith do na buachaillí óga ansin agus nuair a théann siad amach as an Arm ina dhiaid sin bíonn ceird an-mhaith acu.  B'fhéidir go mbeidh ar ár gcumas an scéim sin a leathanú tar éis tamaill agus níos mó daoine óga a thógáil isteach faoi na scéimeana sin. Bíonn go leor iarrthóirí ann i gcónaí agus b'fhéidir go mbeidh ar ár gcumas iad a leathnú as seo amach.  Maraon leis sin tógtar buachaillí isteach chun traenáil do na bannaí ceol agus tugtar traenáil an-mhaith dóibh.  Ag tagairt don cheist sin, na bannaí ceol, rinne duine eile tagairt dó freisin.  Ní cuimhin liom cé hé, ach dúirt sé nach maith an rud é Uimhir a haon, Uimhir a dó, Uimhir a trí, agus Uimhir a ceathair a bheith mar ainmneacha ar na bannaí ceoil agus dúirt sé gur ceart teideal de chinéal eile do chur orthu.  Is iad na téarmaí cearta Banna Ceoil an Iarthair, Banna Ceoil an Deiscirt, Banna Ceoil an Churragh, agus mar sin, agus ní úsáidtear an teideal Uimhir a haon, Uimhir a dó, Uimhir a trí agus Uimhir a ceathar de ghnáth.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Ó Fachtna tagairt don chineál éide a bhíonn le caitheamh ag muintir an Fhórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  Nuair a labhair mé ag tabhairt isteach an Mheastacháin dúirt mé go raibh muid ag smaoineamh faoi láthair ar éide chaighdeánach a thabhairt isteach do na Buan-Óglaigh agus don Fhórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  Is é mo thuairim féin go bhfuil an t-am foirstineach chun tús a chur leis sin toisc an cónasc atá idir na Buan-Óglaigh agus an Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, ach tá deacrachtaí ansin freisin.  Caithfimid an méid éide atá ar láimh againn anois a úsáid.  Sin ceist atá á scrúdú againn, ach is dóigh liom go mbeidh sé ar ar gcumas é a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Bhí ceist eile a d'árdaigh an <Col N="861" /> Teachta Ó Fachtna, go raibh muintir an Fhórsa Cosanta Áitiúil ag fanacht rófhada le hárdú céime.  Níl fhios agam an bhfuil sé sin fíor, ach má tá sé fíor is dócha go mbeidh ar ár gcumas é a cheartú.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Ó Dubhlaoich gur ceart séipéal a bhunú i Nás na Rí.  Is dócha gur mhaith an rud é sin, ach ní dóigh liom go bhfuil mórán mí-cheart nuair atá orthu freastal ar dhualgais an chreidimh sa séipéal sa bhaile mór, ach b'fhéidir go mbeimid in ann rud éigin a dhéanamh.  Níl an scoil sin ar siúl ach le ceithre bliana anuas agus ní féidir linn gach rud ba mhaith linn a bheith ann ó thosach.</P>
    <P>Thagair an Teachta sin freisin do scoil náisiúnta nua a thógáil do na cailíní sa Churrach.  Tá beartaithe againn sin a dhéanamh agus ní dóigh liom go mbeidh sé rófhada go mbeimid ag tosú ar an obair.  Maidir leis na hoibreacha sibhialta sa Churrach is rud deacair é, ach caithfidh na daoine atá i gcionn na hoibre sin an scéim a leathnú amach ar feadh na bliana ar fad.  Mura ndéantar sin bheadh níos mó daoine ag cailleadh obair.  Nuair a chuirtear críoch le hobair áirithe ní féidir a shocrú i gcónaí go mbeidh obair eile ag tosú díreach ina dhiaidh sin.  Déanaimid gach iarracht obair shibhialta a chur ar fáil do na daoine seo, ach ní féidir iad go léir a choiméad ar siúl an t-am ar fad.</P>
    <P>Rinne cuid de na Teachtaí tagairt don Scoil Eachaíochta agus is maith liom a fheiceáil go bhfuil go leor daoine i bhfabhar leanúint leis an scoil sin, agus go bhfuil meas ar an bhfoireann Eachaíochta.  Ní dóigh liom go raibh aon rud eile le rá ag na Teachtaí a labhair i nGaeilge nach ndearna mé tagairt dó.</P>
    <P>First of all I thank the Deputies who spoke on this Estimate for their approach to it.  I consider their general approach to have been very fair, though critical in places, and, of course, there are certain Deputies who make a habit of attacking the Army and everything about it.  I suppose we cannot expect anything better from them but, generally speaking, the <Col N="862" /> approach was reasonably fair.  I would particularly like to thank my predecessor, Deputy MacEoin, for his concluding remarks in regard to the modest effort that is being made at present to promote the use of the national language in the Defence Forces.  He made one statement which I think is very true and I am glad he made it because it gives me the opportunity of endorsing it.  I think the gist of what he said was that an effort to expand the use of Irish has always been the hallmark of the Defence Forces and I can say, from a study of old files, that I can definitely endorse that.</P>
    <P>I do not think anything is being attempted at present that was not in the minds of the people in control of the Army at the outset.  In fact, I would say that the ideas that prevailed as far back as 1923 were even more ambitious than the present ideas.  Attempts have been made continuously since then to expand the use of Irish and what is going on now is no more than the obvious and logical development of what has been the policy from the outset.  Previous attempts may not have been so successful, the obvious reason being that the teaching of the language has not been in progress for a sufficiently long time and, therefore, the actual knowledge of Irish in the Defence Forces was not sufficiently widespread to allow of the success desired.</P>
    <P>The position is different now, due largely to the foresight of my predecessors in making a knowledge of Irish a condition for the recruitment of cadets, and it is now possible to make some advance.  I want particularly to thank Deputy MacEoin for his remarks in that regard.  There is nothing extraordinary at all going on in the Army.  What is happening is the development of the position that has always been there.  I am glad to say it is being received enthusiastically by the Army and is progressing very favourably.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to the scheme for the integration of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with the Army.  The progress of that scheme appears to be satisfactory.  The military authorities <Col N="863" /> believe that the F.C.A. will be able to undertake satisfactorily the new rôle being allotted to them and that the scheme will be a success.  Some progress has already been made in forming the new units of the F.C.A. and in training them in the new weapons and techniques required.</P>
    <P>The question was raised as to whether there are sufficient officers available to carry out this training of the F.C.A. and whether the expenses provided for them are sufficient.  I can only say that the appointments with the F.C.A. are the most popular ones in the Army.  In the scheme of reorganisation, we were able to allocate officers to the F.C.A. without having any overall increase in the peacetime establishment.  Certainly the scheme is not suffering from any lack of suitable training officers at present and I would hope it will not in the future.</P>
    <P>There were some criticisms of the system of cadetships.  I did not understand some of them.  If any Deputy has a particular point he would like to bring to my notice, I shall be only too glad to look into it.  One statement made by Deputy O'Sullivan surprised me very much.  He stated that a certain question, which he considered an unfair one, was put to candidates. That is the first I heard of that question. Certainly, I would think myself it was a question that should not have been asked.  A person's opinions on such a matter are purely his own concern. I do not know if the question was asked&mdash;Deputy O'Sullivan may have been misinformed and I do not know the source of his information; certainly it was a source not available to me&mdash;but if it was asked, I hope that similar questions will not be asked in future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dooley complained generally about the standard set for cadetships. I do not know that there is any general complaint in that regard.  I suppose it is only natural that any Minister for Defence will get representations that certain boys were turned down who appeared to be eminently suitable.  The system laid down for choosing cadets is that a board of Army officers nominated by <Col N="864" /> the Chief of Staff interview the applicants who have already satisfied certain educational and physical requirements. The board recommend the applicants considered to be most suitable.</P>
    <P>In this connection also, some people seem to think that the reservation of four cadetships for suitable applicants who also have some experience of equitation is likely to result in these vacancies being reserved for people of a certain class.  From that they tried to draw the analogy that we here were attempting to establish an officer corps on the same lines as the imperial armies of Great Britain and Prussia.  I do not think that tendency would ever develop here.  Our traditions of military leadership are completely different.  In those countries, the traditional military leadership has come from a certain stratum of society. Here, the tradition is, if anything, the opposite.  The leaders of the Army which brought us the measure of independence we have were drawn from the ordinary people of all classes.</P>
    <P>It is only natural then that in selecting material for officers of the Army, we should bear our own traditions in mind and model the officer corps of the Army on the people who led the struggle for independence.  I should be very surprised indeed to hear it suggested that an opposite trend was being followed here.  I am quite sure that trend will not develop and that we will bear our own distinctive traditions in mind in that regard.</P>
    <P>When referring to the four vacancies reserved for candidates likely to be suitable for the equitation team, I should like to point out that it is not insisted upon that these people should be expert horsemen already, but that they should be people who have had contact with equitation and who have a liking for it.  It is also essential that they should be suitable officer material. In other words, they are not recruited solely as riders but also as officers of the Defence Forces.  Therefore, if by any chance they do not make the grade as members of the equitation team or when they come to the end of their careers, they will still be officers of the Defence Forces and can be given other duties.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister one question with reference to equitation, which is a very important industry here?  Would the Minister make available to the civilian equestrian Olympic team facilities in Army barracks?  The present facilities they have are most inconvenient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the civilian Olympic team have solved their problems in that regard.  The facilities available in McKee Barracks are not all that good and are fully taken up with the training of our own team.  I am afraid it is unlikely that it will be possible to do anything like that.  The first requirement is to train our own team.  As a number of Deputies have already pointed out, a certain amount of success has already been achieved in that regard.  I am glad some Deputies have referred to the fact that the team is beginning to show results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> Deputy MacEoin seemed to disagree with me when I said we were trying to get some ready-made horses for the international jumping team. He said it would be better to buy in young horses and train them up with the men.  I agree with that. However, the fact was that the school had reached a fairly low ebb so far as suitable horses were concerned, and it was purely as an interim measure, in order to bring some needed improvement, that that policy of trying to get ready-made jumpers was adopted.  We are also proceeding with the policy of buying young horses which can be trained up with the team.</P>

      <P>The source of the particulars of males engaged in farm work, for both employees and others, shown on page 22 of the 1960 issue of <i>Economic Statistics</i>, was indicated in my reply of 28 April, 1960.  Instructions are not issued to enumerators concerning the classification of employees into &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; and &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The annual series of figures for males engaged in farm work are used to provide an indication of the current trend in the level of employment in agriculture.  It is considered undesirable to make any alteration in the basis of compilation which would affect the continuity of the series. Consequently, it is not proposed to include in the 1960 Agricultural Enumeration an additional question on the number of farm employees who have been continuously employed in agriculture since June, 1959.</P>
      <P>The determination of reliable and meaningful data for the turnover of hired labour on farms would necessitate a special detailed inquiry which it is not proposed to inaugurate.</P>

      <P>The average number of persons in insurable employment, based on the sales of Insurance Stamps, for each quarter since March, 1957, is set out in the following table. Owing to the distortion caused by the exchange of insurance cards for males in the first quarter of each calendar year, the average number, based on the number of stamps sold, is higher than it should be in that quarter and correspondingly lower in some or all of the other three quarters.</P>
      <P Just="Center">AVERAGE number per quarter (000)</P>

      <P>Particulars of the quarterly total numbers of social insurance stamps sold in respect of the employment of males and females in agriculture are not available for the following reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the 3rd September, 1956, the contribution rate for male agricultural workers was increased from 2/6d. to 3/2d. and that for female agricultural and female domestic workers and certain other classes was increased from 2/- to 2/6d.  For a considerable <Col N="835" /> time after the 3rd September, 1956, the 2/6d. stamp was purchased both for current stamping in respect of the female agricultural and domestic and other workers referred to and for late stamping in respect of male agricultural workers.  No segregation is available of the 2/6d. stamps sold after <Col N="836" /> that date as between agricultural and non-agricultural employment or as between male and female employment in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The following statement shows the number of social insurance stamps sold at the 3/2d. and 2/6d. rates in each quarter of the past three calendar years and the totals for each year:</P>
