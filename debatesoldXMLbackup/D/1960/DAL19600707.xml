      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, section 13, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where a person who is less than seventeen but not less than sixteen years of age is convicted of an offence for which he would, if he were not less than seventeen years of age, be liable to be sentenced to a term of penal servitude or imprisonment and the court considers that none of the other methods in which the case may legally be dealt with is suitable, he may be sentenced to be detained in Saint Patrick's Institution for a period not exceeding the term for which he might, if he were not less than seventeen years of age, be sentenced to penal servitude or imprisonment, as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage I accepted in principle a proposal by Deputy Declan Costello and Deputy Ryan that the Bill should enable district justices to sentence boys aged 16 to detention in St. Patrick's <Col N="1126" /> Institution.  The amendment now before the House provides that where the court considers that none of the other methods by which the case could be dealt with is suitable, the boy may be committed direct to St. Patrick's in the same way as the court could commit in the case of a boy aged from 17 to 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>At present what happens is that the district justice in his own judgment can decide either to send the boy to Marlborough House for a month or, if he deems the offence bad enough, to send him to a reformatory.  What the Deputies have in mind, apparently, is that instead of sending the 16-year-old boy to Marlborough House or a reformatory, in the case of sentences longer than a month he should be sent to St. Patrick's Institution where he would get what the Deputies described as &ldquo;corrective training.&rdquo;  If the district justice sentences him to a period of more than 12 months, the justice would have to refer the matter to the circuit court to have the boy sent to what was formerly known as the Borstal but is now known as St. Patrick's Institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like clarification on this.  Under existing law has the district justice any power to send anybody to Borstal for a long term? Before this if you wanted to get a boy sent for a long term of Borstal treatment in St. Patrick's Institution had you to go to the circuit court?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are extending that power to a district justice?  What concerns me is this.  There is mention in this amendment &ldquo;... for a period not exceeding the term for which he might, if he were not less than seventeen years of age, be sentenced to penal servitude or imprisonment, as the case may be.&rdquo;  There is certainly no power in the law at present for a district justice to sentence anyone to penal servitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the period were for longer than twelve months, he would still have to refer the matter to the circuit court.  At present, under an Act of 1908, I think, in the case of a boy of unruly or depraved character, where sending him to a reformatory would not have the desired effect, the justice actually has the power to send him for corrective training.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1960. &mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The House has just passed the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1960. which provides for the introduction of contributory old age pensions, substantially increased rates of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity allowance, widows contributory pensions and orphans contributory allowance and other valuable concessions to recipients of these social welfare benefits who have more than two children.</P>
      <P>This measure is mainly concerned with those in receipt of assistance payments of one kind or another, though it does deal with certain other matters as well.  Its main purpose is to give effect to the decision of the Government as announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 27th April last, to increase certain social assistance payments from 1st August next.  In addition to the increases then announced it also gives a number of other concessions to recipients of social assistance.  I shall explain these and other provisions later.</P>
      <P>In the first place the Bill, giving effect to the increases announced in the Budget, provides for additional payments of 1/- per week in respect of all old age pensions, and blind pensions. Rates of unemployment assistance are also being increased by 1/- a week for applicants themselves, 1/- a week for adult dependants, and 1/- a week for each child dependant.  The extra shilling will be paid for every dependent child and not only for the first two qualified children to whom payments are confined at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thanks to these proposals a man with a wife and two children will qualify for an increase of 4/- a week while a man with a wife and six children, who at present receives the same amount as a man with a wife and two children, will now receive an <Col N="1129" /> increase of 8/- a week.  For widows with non-contributory pensions the Bill grants an increase of 1/- a week for the widow herself, plus an increase of 1/- for first and second qualified children of a widow.  Widows with three or more children will receive an additional 3/6 for each child in excess of two.  Thus, a widow with four children will receive a weekly increase of 10/-.  Orphans non-contributory pensions are also being raised by approximately 50 per cent.  All the increases mentioned will come into effect from the 1st August next.</P>
    <P>The Bill furthermore proposes to make a number of other important changes in the law, in favour of recipients of old age pensions, widows pensions and unemployment assistance. One of these, Section 6, affects old age pensioners who go to live in Northern Ireland.  As the law stands, payment of their old age pensions must be suspended when they cross the Border and they cannot have their pensions restored unless they come back here. Neither can they qualify for assistance under Northern Ireland legislation until they have lived there for at least five years.</P>
    <P>This Bill will make it possible for such people, provided, of course, they continue to qualify otherwise, to get their pensions in the North for five years, or until they are granted an old age pension or national assistance under Northern Ireland legislation. This pension would of course be paid directly to the pensioner whether he is living in his own dwelling or in a home for the aged and infirm.</P>
    <P>As an explanatory memorandum setting out in some detail the other provisions in the Bill has been circulated to Deputies it will only be necessary for me to mention some of the more important additional provisions. The Bill also provides in Section 25 for the repeal of a long-standing disqualification for old age pension, one dating back, in fact, to the original Old Age Pensions Act, 1908.  I refer to the provision in that Act whereby a person who is detained in a mental hospital is debarred from receiving old age pension.</P>
    <P>The effect of repeal of Section 3 (1) <Col N="1130" /> (c) of the 1908 Act, provided for in this Bill, is that such persons will be no longer ineligible for old age pensions, as they have been up to this.  Nothing would please me better than the knowledge that all those who will be affected by this change in the law would be able personally to enjoy the full benefits, but I have no need to remind the House that many of these unfortunate people would not be capable of managing an income or deriving any personal benefit from the pension at all.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to provide, therefore, for the appropriation of the pension, by the authority responsible for the maintenance of the pensioner in such cases, as a contribution towards his maintenance and upkeep.  This of course will have an appreciable effect on the demands which the mental hospitals will make on the various health authorities.  Those who would be capable of deriving some benefit from the pension, however, will be able to obtain, at the discretion of the Resident Medical Superintendent, up to ten shillings a week, towards such things as extra comforts.  I think there will be general agreement that we must leave it to the discretion of the R.M.S. to decide the matter in these cases.  The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to repeal subsection 3 of Section 3 of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908.  This subsection, which is in effect a dead letter, empowers a court to disqualify a convicted person over the age of sixty and liable to have a detention order made against him under the Inebriates Act, 1898, from receiving old age pension for a period of up to ten years.</P>
    <P>When the matter was raised in this House some years ago the Minister then in office stated that the subsection would be repealed at the first opportunity. This is being done now by Section 25 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of important concessions in relation to the assessment of means are also being made.  Section 13, for example, makes a change in favour of widowed working mothers, who are claiming or receiving non-contributory pensions.  Earnings of a widow from insurable or excepted employment, under the First Schedule to the Social <Col N="1131" /> Welfare Act, 1952, up to a limit of £39 per annum for each qualified child of the widow, may, when this provision becomes law, be disregarded when assessing her means.</P>
    <P>Other concessions affecting the assessment of means concern those in receipt of allowances or pensions under the Army Pensions Acts and pensions under the Military Service Pensions Acts are conceded by Section 10.  They also apply to those in receipt of Connaught Rangers pensions.  Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the first £80 of each of the first two types of pension which I have mentioned are already disregarded in calculating means for old age and widows pension purposes.  The present Bill proposes to extend the disregard to those claiming or receiving unemployment assistance, and, in addition, to apply the disregard of Connaught Rangers pensions for all purposes.</P>
    <P>In calculating means for old age pension and widows pension purposes, the maintenance allowances payable to disabled persons under Section 50 of the Health Act, 1953, are legally assessable.  The present Bill provides in Section 13 for the disregard of these allowances and proposes to put them on the same footing as the allowance, of a somewhat similar nature, payable under Section 44 of the Health Act, 1947.  This is being done by adding them to the relevant portion of the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and thus excluding them from reckoning as means in old age and widows pension cases.</P>
    <P>Another concession provided for in the Bill is one favouring old age pensioners who are also receiving a small statutory pension from some other source.  It sometimes happens in this type of case under the existing legislation that a small increase in the other pension can bring about a much greater decrease in the old age pension, the net result being that the pensioner's total income is actually reduced.  This is the sort of hardship which we should try to avoid, if possible, and the necessary provision for doing so is made in Section 9 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The provision in Section 11 of the <Col N="1132" /> Bill is intended to benefit people who have endured a long spell of unemployment. Deputies will, no doubt, be aware that a person making a claim for either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance is required to serve what is known as a three days waiting period before he can receive the benefit, or assistance, whichever he may be seeking.  During that period of three days he cannot receive either benefit or assistance.  If he remains unemployed long enough to exhaust his title to unemployment benefit and then looks for unemployment assistance he is required, as the law is at present, to serve a further three waiting days, during which he can get neither benefit nor assistance.  There can be little doubt that this latter requirement is a definite hardship on people who have the misfortune to be unemployed for a long period.  The section to which I have referred will abolish this waiting period.</P>
    <P>One of the contribution conditions for maternity allowances is that not less than 26 employment contributions have been paid before the relevant time&mdash;that is the date of commencement of the sixth week before the end of the expected week of confinement.  If the contributions due in respect of insurable employment before that time have not been paid, the insured woman cannot receive any maternity allowance, even though the contributions may have been paid within a short time after the relevant time.  The amendment which is being made by Section 15 of this Bill will enable the allowance to be paid in future from the date the contributions are paid.</P>
    <P>I am also taking the opportunity in Section 14 of the Bill to clarify the law on one or two points relating to the insurable classes, about which some doubts have arisen as a result of recent court decisions.  The amendments concern some classes of civil servants and student and trainee nurses and midwives.</P>
    <P>Civil servants of the State, as distinct from civil servants of the Government, and certain student and trainee nurses and midwives are being added to the employments scheduled as insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

      <P>I shall have to refer the Deputy, to find out the exact distinction, to a long judgment which was delivered.  The point is this.  It was held that a person who is employed in the State Solicitor's Office was a civil servant of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Every year considerable sums of money are lost to the State as a result of fraudulent claims to pension and false statements regarding means.  Accordingly I have included in the Bill, Sections 16 to 22 inclusive, the object of which is to reduce as much as possible irregular overpayments of old age payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in question are intended in the first place to deter people from making fraudulent claims and giving false information in order to get pensions to which they are not entitled.  Where people have succeeded in getting such pension money in these circumstances this Bill will facilitate recovery of the money from them or from their personal representatives.  I should like to emphasise that the strengthening of the law in this respect is aimed solely at dishonest claimants or pensioners, who get, or attempt to <Col N="1134" /> get, public money to which they are not entitled and who represent, of course, a small minority, perhaps I should say a very small minority of the general body of old age pensioners. With a few exceptions the provisions and penalties are not new, and are to be found already in operation in relation to other social welfare services.</P>
    <P>The old age pensions code differs in some respects from these services, and to the disadvantage of the State, in relation to proceedings for the recovery of money overpaid.  The amendments which this Bill proposes to make will bring the old age pension code into line with the other services in that respect. Some of the provisions relating to the recovery of overpayments of pensions are new ones.  Among these is the requirement obliging the personal representative of a deceased pensioner before distributing an estate, to give not less than three months notice in writing of his intention to distribute the assets and making him financially liable if he fails to do so.  Another is the establishment of a legal presumption that once a pension is proved to have been awarded, and payment made during any period, the pensioner shall be deemed in the absence of evidence to the contrary to have received payment from the date of the award.  I think that every fair-minded person will agree that this is a reasonable presumption.</P>
    <P>These provisions will be reinforced by Section 17 which authorises the suspension of pension where a pensioner refuses or fails to furnish information or produce books or documents, reasonably required to establish his continued entitlement to pension and by new provisions requiring the personal representative of a deceased pensioner, under penalty, to furnish similar information regarding the pensioner.</P>
    <P>The provision in Section 12 of the Bill arises out of the need to adjust on a legal basis a claim in respect of overpayment by a local authority of its contribution towards the cost of unemployment assistance in its area under Section 26 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>Under that Act local authorities in areas where the higher rates of unemployment <Col N="1135" /> assistance are payable are required to pay to the Minister in each financial year as a contribution to the cost of unemployment assistance certain sums levied on the rateable valuation of their areas.  For the purpose of determining the rateable valuations, certificates are obtained annually from the Commissioner of Valuation.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands the Commissioner has no power to amend any certificate furnished by him or to issue a revised certificate.  Previously the Commissioner had included the valuation of certain small dwellings in the certificates furnished by him.  The local authorities concerned held that this was wrong and their view was upheld by legal opinion.</P>
    <P>Since legal opinion was obtained that the relevant legislation did not give the Commissioner power to amend his certificates the overpayments were adjusted by allowing the local authorities concerned credit in subsequent years in respect of the amounts over-contributed. Both the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee have considered this procedure and have concluded that it is unsatisfactory and the Committee expressed the view that amending legislation should be introduced when the opportunity offered.</P>
    <P>A further application for a refund of amounts erroneously contributed by a local authority in respect of the valuation of small dwellings was recently received and the present amendment will enable the Commissioner of Valuation to issue a revised certificate as to rateable value where the facts so warrant and thus enable this, and any other cases which may arise, to be dealt with on a legal basis.</P>
    <P>Over 250,000 people, old people and blind persons, widows and their children, orphans, the unemployed and their dependants, will benefit by this Bill as it stands apart from the 200,000 or so men, women and children who will receive new or extended social insurance benefits under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill 1960, which has just been passed through this <Col N="1136" /> House.  In all, therefore, nearly half a million people will benefit, in one way or another, through both pieces of legislation.</P>
    <P>A Bill containing so many concessions and providing for increases benefiting so many people could not be anything but a costly one and this brings me to the all important question of the increased expenditure which the provisions of the Bill will involve.  The expenditure will, of course, be governed to some extent by the effect which the new contributory old age pensions will have on the number of people drawing the ordinary old age pension.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned when moving the Second Reading of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1960, a short time ago, it is very difficult to forecast with any precision what this effect is likely to be, owing to the absence of statistics to show how many formerly insured persons are now receiving the old age pension.  On the basis of the present numbers of pensions, however, the cost in a full year of the increases announced in the Budget Statement and which are provided for in this Bill is estimated at approximately £657,000. Of this sum £421,000 a year is in respect of old age pensions, £150,000 is in respect of unemployment assistance and £86,000 in respect of non-contributory widows pensions.  In addition to these sums the proposal to allow an extra 3s.6d. for each child of a widow in excess of two will cost roughly £15,000 a year and the decision to increase orphans non-contributory pensions £4,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Apart from these direct increases in pension and assistance rates the various concessions and relaxations being made by the Bill will also involve extra expenditure.  The provision for disregarding the earnings of widows up to a limit of £39 for each child, for instance, will cost a further £25,000 yearly, the proposal to continue old age pensions for a limited period to pensioners who go to live in Northern Ireland will cost approximately £7,000 and the proposal to abolish the three-day waiting period on transfer from unemployment benefit to unemployment assistance is estimated to cost a further £8,000 a year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> The removal of the disqualification for old age pension arising out of detention in a mental hospital will it is estimated increase the outlay on old age pensions by another £153,000, though I shall have more to say about this in a moment or two.  The figures I have quoted all add up to a yearly bill of £869,000, additional to the £21,354,000 already voted for Social Assistance requirements for the current year.  I mentioned a figure of £153,000 in connection with the proposal regarding payment of old age pension in respect of persons detained in mental hospitals.  The net cost to the Exchequer will be somewhat less than the figure I mentioned, arising out of the provision for appropriation of the pension towards the cost of maintenance of the pensioner in such cases. The Exchequer provides 50 per cent. of the cost of the mental hospital services and if the pension were being fully appropriated in all cases the net cost to the Exchequer of this repeal would consequently be only half the figure I gave, that is £76,500.  Since, however, it is being provided that up to ten shillings a week may be retained by the patient if he is capable of using the money beneficially the net cost to the Exchequer of repealing this particular disqualification will be substantially more than £76,500; in fact it may be over £100,000 depending on the extent, which there is no means of estimating, to which patients will be found able to avail themselves of the provision enabling them to get up to ten shillings of the pension for their own use.</P>
    <P>When the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill was before the House for its Second Reading I mentioned that, including the commitments which would be required under that Bill and under the present measure, the total amount which would be required in the current year for social welfare schemes runs at the rate of nearly £27¾ millions per year net.  I pointed out that this was an enormous figure in relation to our taxable resources, representing, as it does, almost 26 per cent. of the tax revenue which, it is estimated, will be raised in this year for the general purposes of the Budget. I referred then to the great influence of <Col N="1138" /> social welfare expenditure upon the Budget and therefore upon taxation also and I mentioned that no other category of public services makes such heavy demands on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for referring to these facts again especially for the benefit of those Deputies who suggested, when the Estimates for my Department were before the House, that the increases announced in the Budget might have been greater.  It is well that we should remind ourselves that any increase in social welfare expenditure requires, of necessity, a corresponding increase in tax revenues and that the ultimate governing factor in expanding these services is the capacity of the community, or, rather, of the producing elements in the community, to pay.</P>
    <P>Nor should the increases now proposed be looked at in isolation.  They represent in fact the third increase in social assistance payments since the Government took office, and the last increase took place only a year ago. It gives me great pleasure to recommend this measure to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare can always be depended upon to put a good face on anything he introduces no matter how miserable it is.  He has shown that this morning in dramatising what is being done and glossing over the hard fact that this Bill is designed to restore 1/- per week to the old age pensioner in compensation for what the Government did deliberately in increasing the cost of living since they assumed office.</P>
      <P>The House will recall it was indicated when this Government decided to withdraw the food subsidies that adequate compensation would be paid to certain classes to compensate them for the Government's action.  Since then we know that other sections of the community in their dealings with the private sector and with the Government as employers have secured some compensation for the effect of the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we have a further effort by the Government to redress the harm done by the abolition of the food subsidies. The Minister in his opening statement referred to concessions and <Col N="1139" /> relaxations.  Relaxation of what? Relaxation of the conditions the Government themselves created.  To whom are the concessions being made?  They are being made to the more unfortunate sections of our community who have been hardest hit by the Government's action in increasing the cost of living.  I may say we are very far from reaching the end of the queue of all the sections of the community who expect and deserve relaxation.  There is nothing in this to provide small farmers with any improvement in their income.  In fact they have suffered a severe drop in their income in the past two years.  There is nothing in this to provide them with anything to counteract the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>While we welcome anything done to improve the lot of the old age pensioner, this is a puerile effort on the part of the Government to compensate for making things so difficult for those unfortunate people.  The Minister talked about 500,000 people benefiting. Again there are benefits, concessions and relaxations.  He forgets that at least three times that number of people were hit, and hit hard, by the present Minister when he was Minister for Finance.  One would have thought they would have learned their lesson in consequence of the way the people rejected them from office for their action when he was Minister for Finance.  Despite the assurances of the former Leader and the present Leader of this Government following their return to office after the last general election, they decided completely to abolish the food subsidies.  At the last general election they implied that the amount of money which had to be found by the Exchequer to meet the cost of subsidisation of food could be chopped off our national expenditure. The implication was that taxation would be reduced if the Government did not have to find this money to subsidise essential foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Today there is a reduction in the consumption of butter and a reduction in the consumption of flour and bread, notwithstanding the increases in wages and salaries.  The Government have made niggling efforts to compensate the <Col N="1140" /> social welfare classes and the hard facts are that our people can no longer buy Irish creamery butter, that we are prepared to pay the foreigner to eat it, that we see our people smuggling it into this country because they cannot afford to pay the price demanded in consequence of the removal of the subsidy on that essential item of food.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that old age pensioners have to depend on a possible three meals per day, constituted in the main of bread, butter and tea. They are seriously affected because of the high cost of living.  I have no doubt that I may safely suggest that at the moment the Minister is making a note in reference to the price of butter.  I have no doubt that he will indicate that there will be an increase to the creamery milk supplier.  He will not, however, indicate that there was a levy of one penny per gallon imposed on milk delivered to the creameries since this Government took office.  As a result of that the price of milk to the consumer went up.  But the price to the producer did not go up.</P>
    <P>The actions of the Government have all tended to increase the cost of production. Consequently the price of butter for the old age pensioner has increased.  It has increased also for social welfare recipients generally.  None of these increases was transferred to the producer. The indications are that there is a reduction in consumption.  Despite the efforts of the Government and the efforts of private employers people are no longer in a position to purchase the essential commodities to the extent to which they purchased them three years ago.</P>
    <P>I wonder what this additional 1/- will do to assist these people.  Apart from the impact resulting from the Government's deliberate action in withdrawing the food subsidies there is another increase in the cost of living. The Government have failed to exercise control over the rising cost of living and any efforts they made to nullify the results of their own deliberate action, or their failure to minimise the effect of their action on the cost of living, have been wholly unsuccessful. <Col N="1141" /> The meagre effort being made here will help nobody.  Indeed, there is something of cynicism in this increase of 1/-.  Why the delay in giving this increase?  Governments in the past have given such increases immediately.  Why the delay now between the Government's announcement of its intention and the implementation of that intention on 1st August next?  In the intervening period those whose lot it is intended to alleviate have to suffer on.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the cost of social services generally.  Admittedly the services take quite a large part of the national expenditure.  One must bear in mind, however, that the value of money today is less than it was some years ago.  One must also bear in mind that the money is being found for other schemes.  Only yesterday the Minister for Transport and Power informed the House that within a matter of weeks we will expend £5,000,000 on three jet planes.</P>

      <P>No doubt.  I shall look forward to it.  It should be comparatively simple for the Government to increase social welfare benefits.  It is only a few years since the Taoiseach assured the country in Clery's Restaurant, and no doubt secured support from large sections of the community as a result of his assurance, that he would create 100,000 jobs if he were elected to Government.  He has been elected.  Recently he reduced his estimate of the number of jobs by 50,000.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a puny effort on the part of the Government, perhaps the puniest in a succession of puny efforts they have had to make despite their assurances that they would march Deputies repeatedly into the Lobbies to prevent any increase in salaries or wages resulting from their outrageous decision to withdraw the food subsidies. This meagre assistance will in no way ameliorate the lot of the unfortunate people who need alleviation and it is the deliberate action of the Government over the last two years which has created their unfortunate situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to remark, we do not oppose the slight increase proposed <Col N="1143" /> in this measure.  Whilst, as the last speaker said, the Minister has tried to dress up a good case he has, I think, condemned himself.  He certainly gives the lie to the exaggeration inherent in his claims when he admits that approximately £800,000 will have to be provided over a full year among 250,000 people.  If my figures are correct, and I think I am being generous to the Minister when I say £800,000, each recipient will benefit to the extent of about 60/- per year.  I suppose the average benefit, as is generally suggested in the Bill, would be a shilling per week and, as I said, we welcome any increase that is given.  In my opinion, however, whilst arguments for greater increases might be all very well in themselves they are of secondary importance to a matter that I consider of the utmost importance at present&mdash; to ask ourselves who is responsible for poor people in this country?</P>
      <P>Nominally the Minister for Social Welfare is responsible for people who have no income, who are sick, who are unemployed, who are widows or who are old age pensioners, but in actual fact there does not seem to be anyone who takes absolute responsibility for the provision of assistance to people who have no money.  A sort of see-saw game takes place between the local authorities and the Minister in this connection.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, particularly at Question Time, when asked about the amount of various allowances given by his Department, has often said that he does not expect people to live on these allowances exclusively and that local authorities should, and in many cases do, come to the assistance of the recipients of such assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plain fact of the matter, however, is that boards of assistance and public assistance authorities do not take anything like the responsibility that has been imposed upon them by this House for people who find themselves poverty-stricken.  The usual attitude of local boards of assistance is that if a person has any sort of allowance, an old age pension, unemployment assistance, sickness benefit, disability <Col N="1144" /> benefit or any other allowance, that is the full extent of the responsibility of the people of the country towards that individual recipient and they refuse to assist him further or, if they do, give only a very small pittance.</P>
    <P>I shall take for example an old age pensioner who lives on his own and who, at the present time, receives 27/6d. a week.  Under this Bill he will receive 28/6d. a week and there is no necessity for me to hold up the House in describing how difficult it is for anyone to live on 27/6d. or 28/6d. a week.  To say the least of it, we all appreciate it is very difficult.  The responsibility one local authority assumes in such a case is to give an extra 5/- a week which means that person has 32/6d. a week on which to live and I do not think that is good enough.</P>
    <P>On the one hand we have the Minister for Social Welfare and his Parliamentary Secretary saying that the public assistance authorities should assist such people but, on the other hand, we have the public assistance authorities who say it is the State's responsibility to cater for many of our unemployed, whether they be on the dole or in receipt of benefit.  The State has a particular responsibility for them and so have the local authorities but between these two bodies what I describe as the utmost responsibility is not taken for people who find they have no money by reason of sickness, old age, widowhood and many of the other hazards of life.</P>
    <P>On page 14 of his speech the Minister for Social Welfare referred to the &ldquo;great influence of social welfare expenditure upon the Budget and therefore upon taxation&rdquo; and went on to say:</P>
    <P>I make no apology for referring to these facts again especially for the benefit of Deputies who suggested, when the Estimates for my Department were before the House, that the increases announced in the Budget might have been greater.</P>
    <P>I think we have far too many statements of that kind.  Some of us in this House seem to think that a big Bill for social welfare is something to be ashamed of but I do not think <Col N="1145" /> so.  When talking about social welfare some of us seem to think that it merely means payment to people who are unemployed, to people who are sick, to old age pensioners, to widows and orphans, but these from only one category of social welfare and there are many other categories for which we should have regard as well.</P>
    <P>I remember Deputy Dr. Browne asking the Minister for Finance how much we spend on social welfare from the Budget each year and the Minister replied, I believe rightly so, that about 90 per cent. of our State expenditure goes on social welfare.  We never criticise the fact that we spend practically as much on agriculture as we do on social welfare. If my memory serves me correctly the amount we propose to spend on agriculture this year ranges from anything between £22,000,000 and £30,000,000.  I am not objecting to that in the slightest.  As far as this House is concerned that could also be regarded as a social welfare expenditure.</P>
    <P>Any person who wants to build a house for himself gets a free grant provided he fulfils very simple conditions. He gets something like £300 and that is another reason why we should not complain, or appear to complain, about the amount we spend on social welfare. Another item of social welfare that could well be mentioned is the amount we give by way of assistance, call it what you will, social assistance, or industrial assistance, for the improvement of hotels and the building of new hotels.  Someone may say that is all productive work and that we shall get a return in industry and in agriculture, but surely it is unfair to distinguish between the type of people who cannot give a return through no fault of their own, and those people who not alone will give a return to the country but will give a pretty good return to themselves?</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why I believe this shilling all-round increase is not good enough.  To say the least, I do not think it would do any harm to give much more to people who are unemployed, to people who are sick, to widows, old age pensioners and <Col N="1146" /> orphans because the State can at least be assured that the money they get will not be sent out of the country.  The old age pensioners almost exclusively will but Irish produced goods because their main items of expenditure are food and clothing, things which are produced here.  It seems to me a very contradictory situation.  On the one hand the Minister for Social Welfare and his Parliamentary Secretary, as is his wont, say this country cannot afford any more than one shilling a week increase in such assistance.  That has been the cry of the Minister this morning&mdash;that though we would love to do it we cannot afford to do it.  On the other hand, we have had a virtual boast from the Taoiseach and members of the Government that in the past two years we have not alone recovered from what they describe as the disastrous years of 1956 and 1957 but our economic position has vastly improved.</P>
    <P>In the Budget debate and in all the main financial debates in this House during the present year members of the Government Party were at pains to describe how the national income has gone up, how unemployment has gone down, how industry has boomed, how agriculture is holding its own, how the tourist trade has developed and improved.  We have heard a lot about the great prospects for the tourist industry this year and for the years to come.  Nevertheless, all we can do is to give the old age pensioners, the widows and the unemployed an increase of 1/- per week in their pensions. Surely it is a Gilbertian situation where on the one hand we boast that the country is improving economically by great strides and on the other hand we say we cannot afford any more than 1/- per week increase in pensions to old age pensioners and to people on unemployment assistance?</P>
    <P>The present Government have given three increases to old age pensioners since they came into office in March, 1957, which total 4/6d. per week.  They point out that in the period of office of the last inter-Party Government only 2/6d. was given.  Those figures are correct.  I suppose that at this stage there would be no use in saying, without a gibe and maybe a justifiable one, that the inter-Party Government had two <Col N="1147" /> Budgets and, therefore, two opportunities, so to speak, to make provision for such people as against four Budgets which the present Government have had.  That is not the point I want to make.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare or any member of the Government may try to argue that there has been no appeciable change in the cost of living index number in the past 12 months and that any increase given to old age pensioners and such persons is a generous gesture on the part of the Government.  I think they will have to go beyond the past 12 months.  As far as old age pensioners are concerned, I think they will have to disregard to some extent the cost of living index number.</P>
    <P>The people with whom this Bill deals are not concerned with a large number of items in the cost of living index.  It includes many items of expenditure that are usual in respect of a big majority of our people.  However, many of these items of expenditure are not peculiar to old age pensioners, to people on the dole and to many widows and orphans.  These people are concerned mainly with the price of food and, say, the rents of houses, two items which have increased to a very large extent in the past three years.</P>
    <P>In two Budgets in a period of three years, the inter-Party Government gave an increase of 2/6 to old age pensioners.  That was a period during which the price of the food, according to the cost of living index figure, increased by 4 per cent.  However, from March, 1957, to February, 1960, the price of food, again according to the cost of living index figure, increased by 12 per cent.  For that reason and for no other reason there should be a much greater increase for old age pensioners and for recipients of unemployment assistance and benefits such as widows and orphans pensions, and so on.</P>
    <P>Apart from what the last Government, the previous Fianna Fáil Government, or any Fianna Fáil Government did, or what a Cumann na nGaedheal Government did, it is time we tried to pin responsibility in respect <Col N="1148" /> of poor people with no means.  I believe the local authorities are not doing their job in that respect and I have no hesitation in saying so.  As far as I know, under the Public Assistance Act, 1939, this House imposed upon local authorities&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo; I means also boards of assistance&mdash;and the ratepayers of each county responsibility for looking after people with no incomes but they do not do it.  It is not the officials who do not do it; it is the elected representatives who do not do it.</P>
    <P>Why talk about legal responsibility in respect of poor people?  There is a grave moral responsibility on each and every county to look after people with no means.  Nobody wants them to look after wastrels or spendthrifts but they are expected to look after the genuine poor.  If the local authorities are not prepared to do that and, up to this, they have not shown evidence that they are prepared to accept their full responsibility we must consider the early introduction of a scheme on the lines of the British system of national assistance and let the State pay.  I do not means the State should take on the full responsibility and allow the ratepayers to get off scot free.  If necessary, we should get a contribution from them.</P>
    <P>It is pathetic to see or to know a person who has no money, who is not an old age pensioner, who is not receiving unemployment assistance, sickness benefit or disability benefit, a person who has absolutely nothing and who is handed out 10/- or even 15/- per week by a local authority.  Very seldom if ever do they go to £1 per week.  Sometimes one hears it said about such a person: &ldquo;He is a wastrel. I saw him at the pictures last night. He was at a dance last Sunday.  He has got a new suit.&rdquo;  They give him nothing because of what may appear to them to be signs of prosperity.  The Minister should seriously consider what should be done about what I would term the poor of this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the changes which may appear insignificant in this measure.  One does not come across such cases very often but they are <Col N="1149" /> very irritating when one does. Especially do I welcome the Minister's proposal to allow pensions to inmates of mental hospitals.  His proposal is that a sum of money, the pension, may be used by the inmates of a mental hospital.  Has the Minister considered making some part of that pension payable to a near relative who, say, has to undergo certain expense in providing comforts for the inmate? Many relatives travel frequently to mental hospitals and take comforts with them to the patient which in the ordinary course of events would not be provided by the hospital.  If the Minister would consider covering that point, the Bill would be further improved.  The proposal for an easement of the means test in respect of widows pensions is also welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party naturally welcome the abolition of the three day waiting period.  It is something which was a source of annoyance to workers generally for very many years and I am glad the Minister has got sanction from the Government to do away with that burden on workers who transferred from unemployment benefit to unemployment assistance.  There never did seem to be any good reason for it and its removal is a very good improvement.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 11 of his speech, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>In calculating means for old age pension and widows' pension purposes the maintenance allowances payable to distressed persons under Section 50 of the Health Act, 1950 are legally assessable.</P>
    <P>The present Bill Provides in Section 13 for the disregard of these allowances and proposes to put them on the same footing as the allowance, of a somewhat similar nature, payable under Section 44 of the Health Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>I do not think he need have bothered about that at all.  It is very difficult to obtain a distressed person's maintenance allowance from the local authority where one is in receipt of any social assistance allowance from the Department.  However, for many <Col N="1150" /> of the good local authorities, it is a lead and it does prevent them from assessing a distressed person's maintenance allowance as means.</P>
    <P>The Minister also introduced an excellent proposal.  I am sure it will not cost him a great deal of money but it is a proposal that will ease the means test in respect of a person who is in receipt of an old age pension and who also has a pension from some other source.  I think that is an excellent improvement.  In many parts of the country, this point crops up from time to time.  There are people who had pensions from the British navy or army or some other similar source and who, when they got an increased pension from Britain, discovered, when their means were reassessed, that they suffered a big reduction in their Irish old age pension.  In the final analysis, it meant that in total pension, they had less.</P>
    <P>The only thing I should like to refer to, in conclusion, is the general question of the means test.  I do not remember what it would cost the Minister or the State to make an improvement in that respect but I think these figures in the reassessment of means have obtained for quite a long time. We all agree that money values have changed.  Incomes have changed and values generally have changed.  I think there is a good case for an easement of the means test.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that an easement of the means test will affect to any great degree the existing recipients of the old age pension because I think that well over 50 per cent of them are old age pensioners who have the maximum pension and who have no means whatsoever, but there are, I suppose, many other cases where an easement of the means test would mean an increase in the old age pension.</P>
    <P>This is described as a Social Welfare Bill but I do not know whether it would include this item or not.  There seems to be an impression that the Minister for Social Welfare contemplates centralising the administration of the services for which he is responsible and that the tendency is to centralise <Col N="1151" /> the administration of all these services in Dublin.  How that can be done successfully, I cannot imagine. I complained here on one occasion about the discontinuance of the post of local agent in a particular part of the country and confessed afterwards in the House that I thought it had worked out pretty well in respect of sickness benefit.  I do not think that the same sort of thing would apply in respect of old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions, particularly where there must be a man on the spot to interview these applicants. I do not think means can be assessed from Dublin.  The personal interview is of tremendous advantage, not alone to the Minister and his Department but to the applicant.  However, the Minister has not mentioned it.  Is it only a rumour that the centralisation of the sickness benefit administration is a pointer to the centralisation of the administration of all the services in the Minister's Department?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this as a good Bill because it makes advances in a number of items concerning the social welfare code.  The Minister is to be congratulated since he took up office that a number of very useful improvements have been made.  This is a follow-up in the same direction.  Of course, it is in keeping with the policy of the Government that we must in this country advances not alone in social welfare but in all other spheres of Governmental and Departmental activity so that the finger of scorn cannot be pointed at us and that our social welfare and other services will not lag behind other nations, especially our neighbours.</P>
      <P>Any improvement in the social welfare code to bring it in line with the social welfare code in the Six County area or Britain will go a long way towards improving the relations between the people here and the people in the North and show them that we, under our own Government, are a highly progressive nation.  For that reason and because it helps our people here, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being the representative of a <Col N="1152" /> northern constituency, I welcome the section which will in future enable residents in the Twenty-Six County area, who go, either permanently or temporarily to reside in the six northern counties area to receive the old age pension.  That is a very good section in the Bill.  There was a certain amount of hardship in many cases where old people, who went to reside with their married son or daughter in the Six County area, found that they could not become eligible for the old age pension is that area until they had a certain period of residence. This very useful section in the Minister's Bill takes care of that.</P>
    <P>One point which has cropped up very often as far as I am concerned and on which representations have been made to me is that old age pensions should be paid to persons who go to live in homes in the Six County area.  I have in mind the Nazareth Home in Derry into which go many Donegal people, especially people from the Border area. They find themselves alone, as all the members of their families have departed, and they have to go in there to receive treatment and are very well looked after.  Unfortunately heretofore they could not receive old age pensions while they were in that Home.  I hope that this section of the Bill which makes provision for the payment of old age pensions to people who go to reside in the Six Counties will cover people who go into that Home and similar places.</P>
    <P>The means test, of course for very good reasons, is discussed during every debate here on social welfare.  The first thing that strikes me about the means test and the method of investigation is that it cannot be uniform. Where you have a large number of officers dealing with this means test it is very difficult to secure uniformity. One may find in one area that certain classes are catered for while similar classes in another area may be turned down.  I do not know if the Minister can do anything about that or if he has done anything about it but it is causing a lot of discontent.  A full investigation and full consideration of the means test, with special reference to present <Col N="1153" /> day values, should be undertaken. Many of the regulations concerning the means test were drafted years ago with the result that they are not in line with modern trends.</P>
    <P>For instance, since the means test was introduced we have had a very big advance in private house building.  The Government and the Department of Local Government are laying particular emphasis on the fact that as many of our people as possible should own their own houses.  Every encouragement is given to people to build houses of their own and every encouragement is given by the Government by way of grants and by way of loans to the councils to enable the various councils to finance applicants for loans.  The county councils have made available in many cases one-third grants etc.</P>

I would urge the Minister to investigate fully this whole question of the means test so that we will not have cases of hardship such as that I have mentioned.

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill seems to be an indication of the confidence that the present Government have in themselves.  We are repeatedly hearing about the re-establishment of good sound financial conditions.  There is an anticipated buoyancy of revenue and, if such is the case, surely it would have been possible for the Government who must be alive to the hardships that have been inflicted on, shall we say, the indigent classes, to realise that these people are entitled to a greater measure of security.  Be that as it may one welcomes anything which alleviates in any way the difficulties under which old age pensioners, blind pensioners and widows have to exist.</P>
      <P>I use the word &ldquo;exist&rdquo; advisedly because they do have to exist.  What they are getting is barely enough to provide them with the normal necessaries of life.  If the Minister and the Government believe what they say, that conditions are so promising here, they could have taken a jump in the dark and at least offered these people more than 1/- a week.  The total sum included in this Bill is somewhere in the neighbourhood of £800,000 a year while the revenue of this country is running to £100,000,000 a year.</P>
      <P>Is there no room in the imagination of the Government, and in the efforts of the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary, for the provision of a little more for the people they represent? We must all bear in mind that even a married couple, living together and drawing the old age pension, have only just enough to procure for themselves the ordinary necessaries of life.  We must consider the purchasing power of the £ to-day.  Rents are going up and, in spite of what members of the Government say, the cost of living has gone up continuously since they assumed office a few years ago, entirely due to their deliberate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help describing this Bill as a somewhat mean Bill.  I remember when we introduced a Social Welfare Bill offering the old age pensioners another 2/6d. a week, it was described, by a Fianna Fáil Deputy of many years standing in this House, as being one of the meanest Bills that ever came <Col N="1156" /> before Dáil Éireann.  If an extra 2/6d. is mean, I wonder what is 1/?</P>
    <P>I agree with the last speaker, who was subjected to a good deal of criticism because he delved into matters dealing with housing and so on, that it is time we had a reappraisal of the means test.  What was applicable 20 years ago is not applicable to-day.  I want to make a suggestion to the Minister. There are many people I know who have worked hard all their lives for a fairly decent income or wage. They put money by: in some cases, they invested it in house property, and in other cases, they invested it in securities and so on.  They were an asset to the country not only by virtue of the service they gave to the country, but by virtue of being stable decent members of society.</P>
    <P>When they come to the age of 70 years quite a few people in that category, exemplary, first-class citizens, find themselves subjected to a means test, while living beside them in the same street, there may be someone who lived up to the full value of his pay, spending every shilling, not necessarily in the best or the most suitable way, but who is entitled to draw a full pension or full social benefits.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I should like to suggest to the Minister that he should take a look at the means test, and I should like to offer another suggestion to the House as well.  Recently we enacted through the Budget a provision whereby those who have money on deposit in the banks are entitled to a relief in taxation.  It would be easy for the Minister to embody in the legislation before the House at the moment a system whereby it would be possible to disregard, in its entirely, any money on deposit, in assessing the means of those seeking social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well answer me and say that is not possible or feasible. He may say that anyone could sell a farm and put a huge sum of money on deposit in order to get these benefits. Be that as it may, I would suggest further that if the Minister falls in with my suggestion, for the purpose of national health insurance benefit, unemployment benefit, or widows' and old age pensions, he could confine it to those who have <Col N="1157" /> genuinely been in insurable employment throughout their lives.  By doing that, not only would he undo an injustice which, in my opinion, exists, but he would encourage saving, and that is what we all want to encourage.  People should be encouraged to save and to put something by for another day.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything in this Bill which gives any increase whatsoever to those who are entitled to benefits for total disability.  I think there is a liaison between the local authorities and the Department of Social Welfare, whereby those who are certified as being totally disabled are entitled to a pension of £1 a week.  Fortunately, there are not terribly many people drawing that benefit, and surely it was possible for the Minister to have included them in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Minister's pardon.  I welcome the provision of the Bill with regard to mental hospitale, whereby it is left to the discretion of the medical officer to pay back the 10/- per week, if he thinks it is possible for the inmate to utilise it himself.  I ask the Minister to go further and consider having that sum paid to the dependants, if the inmate is not in a position to use it himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was raised previously by another Deputy, but I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the case of two old age pensioners living together.  One may be transferred to a mental institution.  When they were living together, they had 27/6d. a week each and two of them could live more comfortably than one could when the other had gone to the institution.  The other still stays in the home, still has to pay rent and still has to carry on housekeeping on 27/6d. a week less.  In the event of the individual concerned not being able to utilise the 10/- for himself, I think the Minister could embody in this Bill a provision whereby it would be payable to the <Col N="1158" /> dependant.  It is a fact that there are many people such as I have cited in institutions and if an individual had the power to do so, it is very likely he would hand the 10/-, or the greater part of it, to his partner who is not in an institution, to assist the partner with the housekeeping and the rent.  I should like the Minister to give due consideration to that suggestion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In regard to blind pensions.  I do not know what the position is in other counties, but in my own constituency, I find there is a very rigid application of the law with regard to qualification for blind pensions.  I am not referring now so much to the actual means test as to who is or who is not entitled to a blind pension.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that an undue number of cases in Wexford are being turned down.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate to us who actually come within the scope of the blind pension. I know people who are not actually blind but who at the same time, are not able to engage in ordinary activities. In recent years, anyway, I have noticed a very stringent administering of this law.  I know a number of people unable to work&mdash;they cannot see sufficiently to work&mdash;but still they are not considered to be entitled to a blind pension because they are not, in the strict sense of the word, totally disabled in the matter of vision.  Therefore, I think the Minister might ask those acting on his behalf to give a more liberal interpretation to the law relative to this matter.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for anyone with bad sight to procure employment of any sort, and I know cases of considerable hardship.  They are not eligible for the old age pension; they are not really considered eligible for national health insurance and, in fact, in a great many cases they have no national health insurance benefits to get because, due to the impediment of bad sight, they have been unable to obtain employment and, therefore, unable to be insured.  There are quite a number of people scattered up and down the country&mdash;I know them in my own county and I am sure they exist to quite a large extent elsewhere&mdash;who <Col N="1159" /> find themselves thrown back on the local authority to look for a few shillings to maintain themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the actual position is, whether at the moment there is a full appeal for a blind pension or not. I think that one can, when the matter is turned down, apply to the Minister for Social Welfare.  However, on applying to the Minister for Social Welfare, I think one always receives the same stereotyped reply: that the applicant does not comply with the conditions relative to the drawing of a blind pension. In other words, there is nothing doing and he gets no pay of any sort. Therefore, I think it is a matter that wants review generally.</P>
    <P>Another thing that has struck me over the past few years is the very stringent application of the test in regard to old age pensions.  I know quite a number of cases in my own county where the local pensions committee have awarded pensions and when the appeal comes from the Minister's Department, in a great many instances, these cases are turned down. Does that mean that the pension committees who are, I think, in the main elected representatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These pension committees should be given greater jurisdiction in future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish talked about the means test and it was also referred to by Deputy Esmonde.  A person in receipt of £52 per year gets the full old age pension and up to £104 the minimum pension can be got. Deputy Corish referred to the people who have no means whatever.  It is calculated in the Department that they represent 15 per cent. of the total recipients of old age pensions.  The Deputy advocates relaxing the means test, but at the same time advocates more generous treatment for that 15 per cent.  In an economy such as ours, we could not afford to carry out his wishes in both cases.</P>
      <P>The means test has been very much relaxed over the past few years.  The scales now in operation are as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> With £52 10s., you get the full pension; from £52 10s. to £65 10s., there is a reduction of 5/-; from £65 10s. to £78 10s., there is a further reduction of 5/-; and from £78 10s. to £104 15s., another reduction of 5/-.  After £104 15s., the claimant is out.  That is very liberal compared with what operated 10 years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the food subsidies.  I have heard him on several occasions talking about them in this House.  I want to put this to him, through the Chair.  If his Government come back into office, will they restore the food subsidies?</P>

I take it from Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, a spokesman for Fine Gael, that when his Government come in, if they do come in, the first thing they will do is to restore the emergency food subsidies.  That is information for the electorate and is going to cost a few pence.</P>
      <P>Great stress has been placed on minimising the effect of the 1/- increase in old age pensions.  Since we came into office, we have given increases amounting to 4/6d. in contrast with our predecessors' 2/6d.  While their increase cost £900,000, the total impact on the Exchequer of our 4/6d. is £1,405,000. That more than compensates for any rise in the cost of living.</P>

In relation to the general standard of living of the community as we know it in rural parts, it is a very fair contribution towards the needy.  Fianna Fáil were pioneers in all this legislation, in widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment assistance, children's allowances, the free fuel and free milk schemes and to be twitted that we have no consideration for the particular beneficiaries under these schemes is just talking nonsense.</P>
      <P>We have these people under consideration all the time.  When you are dealing with a small group of people like the Civil Service or the Garda Síochána and giving them increases, you are dealing with a different group from all the insured people and the people in receipt of social assistance, who number approximately half a million people.  An increase of £1 a week to a group of people in the Civil Service amounts to only so many thousand pounds a year but an increase of 1/- a week to old age pensioners costs about £420,000 and an increase of 2/6d. a week amounts to about £1,000,000.  You have to bear that in mind.  You cannot wreck the economy in order to carry out your wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> There were interruptions to the Minister in the course of the Minister's statement about various industries which are producing the revenue which is meeting the cost of these increases. You just cannot interfere with the operation of these.  You have to bear in mind that the producer must be protected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the last straw will break the camel's back.  You have to bear in mind the capacity of the individual to bear the burden.  Consequently, when we take out of revenue sums amounting to approximately £30,000,000 to help the needy, we are doing a fair day's work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Corish talked about the 10/- proposed to be given for their comfort to people who are patients in mental hospitals.  Deputy Corish advocated that it should be given to the people who go to see them. I say to the Minister that he should not entertain that idea.  Some people would be conscientious and see that the 10/- was spent on comforts for the patients but there would be a great many who would abuse that privilege.  That sum of money would be far better in the hands of the R.M.S. and the staff than in the hands of relatives, some of whom might be third or fourth cousins.  I should be very slow to give that power under this Bill.  From my knowledge, I would not recommend to the Minister that such a thing should be done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish is worried about the centralisation of services in relation to the administration of various things such as unemployment and old age pensions.  We certainly do not stand for centralisation.  We believe the social welfare officer in the field is one of the most important officials we have and that he has a very difficult task which, by and large, he does very well.  Whatever we may do to increase his powers of investigation we shall certainly take nothing out of his hands and administer it centrally.  I have my own opinion about this, as Deputy Lynch heard in the Dáil the other day in regard to old age pension committees, but I shall not bring in that red herring now.</P>

If by centralisation Deputy Corish means the short-circuiting of the investigation of a claim we are all in favour of that but if, on the other hand he means that we give all power to the central administration and take away power from the team in the field, who represent a very big percentage of our employees, we do not stand for that at all. I should be inclined to recommend to the Minister that in the administration of the new code more power should be given to the local officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary quite forgets that, as he provides this 1/- to compensate the old age pensioners for the increased cost of living, the producers to whom he referred and on whose behalf he spoke and of whose condition he warned us to be vigilant, have to meet the 10d. on the butter, the 5d. on the 2-lb loaf and 3/7d. on the stone of flour and, as we shall be discussing later this day on the Agricultural Estimate, their income, far from having been increased, has fallen by £17,000,000 a year.  Well may he say that this is the penultimate straw on the back of the producers of this country, but he should not forget that the mountain of straw which is making their backs bend at present, according to his story, was put there by him in spite of our warnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary advert to the fact that within the last 12 months there have been served upon the producers of this country about seven huge bills, all of them in justice due for payment, for old age pensioners, civil servants, Civic Guards, Army personnel, not to speak of the sixth and seventh rounds of wage increases, all brought about, in justice, as a result of the abolition of the food subsidies by the Fianna Fáil Government? I put the additional cost laid upon the consumers by the abolition of the food <Col N="1167" /> subsidies at £9 million a year.  I say that is what the Exchequer saved the day when they abolished the food subsidies. Since that I believe that, in compensatory payments of one kind and another, the producers of this country have had to meet bills of about £12 million.  So that, looking at this from a purely fiduciary point of view, instead of saving ourselves money in the Budget of 1957, in fact, we have increased the burden on the backs of the producers to whom the Parliamentary Secretary referred by at least £3 million.</P>
    <P>The maddening thing is that when this Government embarked upon that course of conduct we warned them that quite apart from debasing the whole coinage of public life by repudiating their own undertaking and their solemn promises on the hustings, over and above that very fundamental injury that they were doing to our institutions, they were going to involve us in very grave economic complications as a result of their actions.  I believe they did that out of spite.  They recognised that in the previous three years we had, if anything, leant backwards in trying to maintain price stability. I admit we leant backwards and I admit that we got caught in the matter of tea prices.  So anxious were we to maintain stability that we took the chance that the steep rise in the price of tea would come back and we carried the burden on the Exchequer of that steep price for tea simply for the purpose of maintaining stability.</P>
    <P>People can find fault with us that we took a chance that did not come off. We ultimately had to meet the cost out of the revenue because the price of tea did not come down.  I am glad that we took the chance.  I think we made the right decision, the right effort and it should have carried conviction to our people that we were following a consistent policy all the way through, that we were going to maintain a steady cost of living figure and that the rises and falls we would take on the Exchequer for the purpose of maintaining economic stability.  I think our policy paid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall get back to the strict limits of the Bill.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will excuse me for having travelled thus far in pursuit of the penultimate straw of which the Parliamentary Secretary spoke so eloquently in his intervention in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to certain specific matters that arise in connection with the Bill.  Section 18 deals with the power to ask personal representatives to make a true return of the assets of a deceased person with a view to enabling the Minister to claim from the estate of a deceased person who, he believes, has collected old age pension incorrectly whatever sum has been improperly paid.  I want to make this case to the Parliamentary Secretary in that regard.  It is a perfectly natural thing to say that if people get money from the State or from anybody else by a false pretence it is reasonable and just that they should be asked to refund it but has the Minister considered this situation?  I imagine these circumstances must be fairly familiar to him in his own experience.  You get an old person in rural Ireland and he has a man or a woman working for him in the house.  Not infrequently, the wages run into arrears in a case of that kind and instead of being paid weekly they are paid a lump sum from time to time.  The old person dies and leaves a small estate.  A small shopkeeper may have been providing the domestic necessities through a pass book for a period.  It is found that the old person now deceased owes the shopkeeper perhaps £17&mdash;and for a country shop that is a big bill; he may owe the woman who is working in the house anything up to £50; he may owe the agricultural worker on the <Col N="1170" /> farm, who is looking after the livestock and so forth, a similar sum.  Ordinarily, whoever takes out administration of the estate will pay these people off out of whatever assets there are.</P>
    <P>Section 19 subsection (1) provides:</P>
    <P>The personal representative of a person who dies after the commencement of this Act and who was at any time in receipt of a pension shall, before distributing the assets of the person inform the Minister by notice in writing delivered to the Minister not less than three months before the distribution commences, of his intention to distribute the assets.</P>
    <P>That in itself is a very grievous delay but, over and above that, under the existing law the Minister has a prior claim on assets.  At first glance that may seem to be just because the Minister is recovering money improperly taken from him but the penalty does not fall on the deceased person.  The resultant penalty of the prior claim upon the assets of the deceased's estate falls on an unfortunate workingman or on a girl who has been working in the house or on a small country shopkeeper who has given credit to a neighbour.  I had a case recently where a woman had due to her something like £120 but it transpired that the Minister for Social Welfare had a claim against the estate for over £200. Under the existing law I do not think the Minister has any discretion.  He must get that money back but if he does get it back that person will get no wages and any other debts the deceased person owes will be unpaid.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable for the Minister to rank with other creditors and get his share but it is a hardship that the Minister should claim for himself the very onerous rights which are claimed by the Revenue Commissioners who have a pre-emptive claim on all the assets before any other creditor has any claim at all.  I do not underestimate the difficulties here. I fully appreciate that if there is a small estate and there is a claim against it by the Minister, it is not impossible in the conditions of rural Ireland that <Col N="1171" /> a number of fictitious claims against the estate would be raised to save the estate from the Minister's claim.</P>
    <P>I would be ready and willing to discuss with the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary the means of providing against that contingency, but I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that where there is a genuine claim for service or for goods supplied by a country shop, some regard ought to be had to that claim even where we know that the deceased person had improperly collected a pension.  I do not think that many cases of this kind would arise because if a deceased person had been improperly collecting a pension that suggests that he had substantial assets which came to light after his death.  Therefore, to act upon the lines I suggest would not involve the Exchequer in any substantial loss.  It would be only in an exceptional case where the Minister's claim would exhaust the available assets and it is only in such circumstances that the remedy is urgently necessary.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill which I welcome.  I think I am entitled to claim some credit for the reform and that is the one incorporated in Section 6.  Glad as I am to see this reform I think there is a flaw in it.  Section 6 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Where a person who is in receipt of a pension takes up residence, after the commencement of this Act, in Northern Ireland, payment of the pension may, notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph (a) of Section 5 of the Act of 1911 be made until....</P>
    <P>Then it provides for two contingencies which on the whole are reasonable, but what are we going to do with the old people who have already been forced by circumstances to go to Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>There is an old constituent of mine who lived with her daughter in county Monaghan until she was 80 and was in regular receipt of a pension.  Then the daughter which whom she lived at home died and the old lady tried to struggle on herself, but it became manifest <Col N="1172" /> that she could not live alone.  She went to live with her married daughter in county Armagh.</P>
    <P>Let me say at once that the attitude of the Department of Social Welfare was sympathetic and helpful in so far as the law would allow.  They pointed out that if the old lady was going on a protracted holiday to Northern Ireland there was no difficulty about that provided she maintained her place of permanent residence in Ireland. However, if she changed her permanent place of residence the law required that her pension should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the existing law was applied in any unsympathetic way but ultimately the circumstances were such that I certainly could not go on representing to the Department of Social Welfare that she was maintaining residence here.  Despite their best endeavours they could not deem her to have a place of residence here because she was not able to live here, and she had to go permanently to live with her daughter.</P>
    <P>What will her position be under this Bill?  It will be a great hardship if we say to her that because her circumstances forced her to go to Northern Ireland six months ago she can never draw her pension again, while her next door neighbour who comes from Monaghan and goes up to live beside her in Armagh will continue to draw her pension.  I do not see any difficulty here.  Do any of us feel there would be anything wrong in saying to old people who have already gone to Northern Ireland, if they are over 70 years of age, that we are prepared now to give them their pensions?  I cannot see that would involve the Minister in any dangerous liability.  If you confine this relief to people who go north after the passing of this Bill you will create a series of anomalies which will cause a great deal of misunderstanding and difficulty.  However, I do not want to press the Parliamentary Secretary at this stage because it is a matter that can be looked into and which can be discussed in greater detail on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point I wish to make.  I believe it is right to speak <Col N="1173" /> the truth as far as one can even in regard to much maligned Departments of State and I must say that in my own experience of the Department of Social Welfare their approach to most problems relating to old age pensions is sympathetic, kindly and well-informed. Nevertheless there is a flaw in our existing administration and I wish I were in a position to make a clear and certain recommendation to the Minister as to how it could be remedied.  I am not sure that I can. My experience of country people, and it is very extensive&mdash;and the same goes for the people of the city of Dublin amongst whom I was born and reared &mdash;is that they are reasonable on the whole if they feel that justice is being done.  Every pensioner who does not get the full pension will make loud hullabaloo but when they get what they believe they are honestly entitled to, and what they think is fair and just according to the law, they feel no real, enduring grievance.</P>
    <P>Here is a problem, however, to which I find it hard to get the right answer.  I am sure every Deputy has had this experience.  You meet a widow; she has perhaps 28 acres of land; she says she has the land set to a relative who is living with her and that all the stock belongs not to her but to him; she has to have somebody in the house with her; she is a lone woman and she must have a man about the house.  She has a nephew, or a cousin, living with her and part of the consideration is that she will set the land to that nephew, or whoever it is, and the stock on the place is his. He does all the business and she has literally nothing except the right of residence, and whatever preferential rent is paid by the relative.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare officer comes upon the scene.  He sees the farm; there are cattle and pigs and livestock on it; there is an elderly woman in the house; the place is registered in her name; she has a hardy chap living with her, who is running the place.  There is an atmosphere of reasonable prosperity all about it.  He cannot accept the premise that she has no income, and she either gets no pension at all or a very much reduced <Col N="1174" /> pension.  You then go down the road and not fifty yards away you come upon another farm, where the valuation is much higher, and yet, through some mysterious working of bureaucracy, you find that the person, whom all the neighbours believe to be much better off than the widow, and whom the widow looks upon as a well-to-do neighbour, is getting the full pension.</P>
    <P>That is the great cause of grievance in rural Ireland.  Mark you, some cynical people may say: &ldquo;Oh, that is rooted only in jealousy&rdquo;.  But who amongst us is so exalted in spirit that he accepts less than he hopes to get and feels no resentment when his nextdoor neighbour gets substantially more than that to which we believe he is entitled under the law?  The Department of Social Welfare would, I suppose, be legitimately entitled to say to someone who makes that complaint: &ldquo;Very well.  If you believe so-and-so down the road is getting more than he is entitled to, give us the information, and we shall soon take it off him.  We do not want anyone getting more than that to which he is entitled under the law.  We examine every case scrupulously. If the woman has a neighbour who is getting more than he is entitled to and if she is getting only half of that to which she is entitled under the law, tell us about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like Deputies to give me their experience and opinion on this: if a neighbour of mine in rural Ireland battles her way through the pensions committee, through the pensions officer and, finally, turns up, after the passage of this Bill, with 28/6 per week, does it behove any of us to go to the Department of Social Welfare and say: &ldquo;I think my neighbour &lsquo;X. Y.&rsquo; is getting too much&rdquo;?  I do not think I would do it.  I think I would decide that my duty as a public representative, and my duty as a Deputy to the people of Monaghan, imposes upon me an obligation to approach the Department of Social Welfare wherever it appears to me that a constituent of mine is getting less than that to which he or she is entitled under the law.  But where a constituent of mine has made his case to a Department of State and <Col N="1175" /> has undergone all the correct procedures for investigation of his means and circumstances, and has emerged with a full old age pension, even though I suspect, but have no certain knowledge, that he is getting more than his due, it is no part of my public duty to go to the Department of Social Welfare and say: &ldquo;Take another look at that fellow.  He is getting too much.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Maybe I am wrong but, if I am wrong, I should like to be told it, and told it by some of my experienced colleagues in this House who would suggest to me that my public duty extends to that.  I do not think it does. But there is a real difficulty and it is that difficulty which, I think, comprises 99 per cent. of the complaints about the administration of the old age pension code.  It is not the suggestion that habitually people are denied what they are entitled to under the law; it is that there is no full equity in the treatment of one case and another.  So long as that continues there will continue to be a sense of grievance amongst people in rural Ireland.  I think that is why many of us lean strongly in favour of the abolition of the means test, if that were financially and economically possible, because it would remove a notion of resentment and jealousy and a genuine sense of grievance that one person is getting the pension and another, whose circumstances would suggest he is better entitled to it, is not getting the full pension, or possibly no pension at all.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if, when the Minister comes to conclude, he would give us the benefit of his experience in that particular matter.  I should be grateful, too, if the specific matters to which I referred under Section 6 and Sections 17, 18 and 19 would also be considered between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that this Government, like the Governments which preceded it, are approaching this problem of old age pensions in a wrong light.  We are arguing here today as to whether or not 1/- per week is adequate compensation for the <Col N="1176" /> increase in the cost of living, an increase inflicted on us because of the actions of past Governments and of the present Government.  And that 1/- per week is the compensation offered to the aged, the infirm, and the poor.</P>
      <P>The reason I say this problem is approached in the wrong light is because successive Governments have been so niggardly where the aged, the infirm, and the poor are concerned. Certain speakers here assert that 1/- per week is not adequate compensation for these categories.  The Government maintain that it is ample compensation. All down the years we have neglected the aged, the sick, and the infirm and it is that continued neglect which has us here this morning disputing as to whether or not 1/- per week is sufficient.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary in this year, 1960, offering to these necessitous classes less than 2d. per day.  The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary are fully aware that there are seven days in the week.  I wonder would the Minister, when he comes to reply, give us some details as to what that amount of money will buy for these people.</P>
      <P>We are told what this increase of 1/- per week will cost the taxpayers of the country.  The figures are given in millions, half millions and hundreds of thousands of pounds, but very rarely does anyone get up to tell us what other highfalutin schemes will cost the taxpayers.  Schemes providing for jet propelled planes and other such things cost the country far more than the amount involved here.  Many harebrained schemes introduced by various Ministers cost more than is involved in increasing old age pensions but that is not brought before the public, so that whenever a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary tells us that an increase over and above a certain figure will cost the taxpayers and ratepayers a lot of money I am inclined to take that with a grain of salt because it is only put forward to frighten people who are already overburdened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How any Government can offer the poor, the infirm, and the aged an increase <Col N="1177" /> of less than twopence a day is beyond me when I recall that by their own deliberate action the present Government steeply increased the cost of living for poor people.  Some months ago we discussed other increases for other sections of the community and I believed at the time that they were entitled to the increases proposed.  I still do, but when High Court judges are given an increase of £10 a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We may not discuss that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only pointing out the difference between 1/- a week and £10 a week.  It is only a passing reference.  County managers also got an increase of £1 a week to meet the same increase in the cost of living and other workers got increases ranging from 6/- to 12/-.  Considering all that, I cannot understand how we can be told that an increase of 1/- a week, which is less than twopence a day, is sufficient for old age pensioners to meet the increase in the cost of living. The costs of bread, sugar, tea, butter, heating, clothes and other things have all risen, and 1/- a week is a very niggardly increase to offer any group of people to offset that.</P>
      <P>As I stated earlier, we started off on the wrong foot some years ago.  When one Party is in power it gives a niggardly increase to these people and it is succeeded by another Party which follows on with another niggardly increase.  But all Parties have forgotten that when pensions were first introduced they were at a very low level so that, instead of talking of an increase of less than 2d. a day now, we should be talking in terms of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter which I should like to draw to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary. Under the present system if a person is admitted to a mental hospital he cannot qualify for an old age pension.  Anyone who has served on mental hospital visiting committees will know that the hospital authorities treat such persons very well.  A patient who is in receipt of a British or Irish army pension gets a certain amount of it for himself as pocket money, but <Col N="1178" /> a patient over 70 years of age, under our regulations, does not qualify for an old age pension when admitted to a mental hospital.  Patients, however, do qualify for old age pensions in county homes and in ordinary hospitals. They would also qualify if they were admitted to private nursing homes but now, especially that persons can become voluntary inmates of mental hospitals, I believe the Parliamentary Secretary should consider the matter very carefully and see that such people should qualify for old age pensions.</P>
    <P>I have two reasons for saying that. One is that it would be of benefit to the patients themselves in that they would be given a certain amount of their pensions for personal expenses, postage, cigarettes, tobacco and things like that, and the second reason is that it would relieve local authorities of a certain amount of the charges which they have to meet.  In most cases the authorities in charge of hospital institutions retain a certain amount of their patients' old age pensions with the result that the ratepayers at large do not have to foot a heavy bill, but where patients in mental hospitals are debarred from receiving pensions the State throws the full charge on to the local authorities. This is a system which has been in operation for a long number of years and it means that patients must depend on outside sources, on friends or relatives, to provide little personal comforts for them.  The Parliamentary Secretary should examine that situation.  Maybe there are snags in resolving it but I believe it should be examined very closely to bring relief to the people concerned and to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is a matter which I raised here before and about which I should like to say a few words now.  It concerns the grave injustice done to British ex-servicemen and possibly ex-servicemen of other nations, who are residing in this country.  Some six or eight months ago the British Government in their generosity decided that ex-servicemen from the first World War were entitled to an increase in their pensions.  This increase was <Col N="1179" /> about 5/- a week for privates, but the few who reside here and who qualified for it found that the Irish Government stepped in and reduced their old age pensions by a similar amount.  It is very unfair that if one Government makes allowance for maybe the increased cost another Government should take advantage of that to save their Exchequer an equivalent amount.</P>
    <P>Here is a complaint that is going the rounds of the country in respect of social welfare officers.  Within the past 12 or 18 months.  I would not say any longer, it is asserted that certain social welfare inspectors have been going down the country, taking vast powers unto themselves which have never been exercised by officers of that Department before.  The social welfare officer is suspected of some ulterior motive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope to see the day when our aged, our sick and our infirm will be treated as people who have given the State the best years of their life.  When a person spends 60 or 55 years at hard manual labour he gives the State a service from which it will benefit.  When such persons reach 70 years of age it is for the State to return something in respect of the labour they have given.  In the evening of their lives, they are now offered less than 2d. per day increase in pension by an Irish Government.</P>
      <P>Is it any wonder Irishmen and Irishwomen inside and outside this country criticise our Governments, past and present, and criticise the Irish nation of which we are all so justly proud? In the six northern counties, the old age pension and sickness benefits are far superior to ours and in England they are more generous still.  Is it any wonder that we Irish people are starting to say things we should not say? Until we adjust the position in relation to our aged, our sick and our infirm, we have a very poor chance of ever achieving the unity of our country.  If we advance the welfare of our sick, our aged and our infirm, we shall go a long way towards achieving the unity of our country in which we all believe.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the Parliamentary Secretary's reference to old age pensions committees.  They are set up by the local council.  I agree with him as to the importance of the function they perform.  These committees are purposely selected on a representative basis.  The local knowledge the representatives possess gives them an opportunity to help the applicants who come before them.  Quite a number of applicants, owing to their age and perhaps infirmities, are likely <Col N="1181" /> to be unable to state their cases properly. If they did not get an opportunity of appearing before these local committees they might possibly lose the pension to which they would be entitled or they might not receive full justice.  It is, therefore, very important that these committees should be constituted in as representative a manner as possible.  My attention was recently drawn to a specific case.

In this Bill the Minister states there will be some relaxation particularly in regard to the means test for old age pensioners.  I wish to bring to the Minister's notice certain activities in which his officials are at present engaged in my district in particular.  Are we endeavouring to drive the old age pensioners into the position where the £1 8s. 6d. is all they are to have to live on?  A social welfare officer from the Minister's Department comes along, chases into the farmers' houses and asks: &ldquo;This fellow was out with you. He milked the cows for you two days last week.  Did you pay him?  How much did you give him?  You gave him timber.  What was the timber worth?  You gave him a quart of milk.  What was the quart of milk worth?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That kind of an inquisition on the part of officials of the Minister's Department is iniquitous to say the least of it.  I think that is something to which we should put an end.

      <P>With regard to the Bill, the man is going to get 28/6d. a week to live on.  I am endeavouring to find out whether he has to pay out of that 28/6d. for a medical officer.  In my capacity as Chairman of a Board of Assistance I have met recently several cases where medical cards were refused to old age pensioners.  If an old age pensioner had £1,000, he would not get the full old age pension.  If he is entitled to the full old age pension, <Col N="1185" /> surely he is not expected to pay for a doctor out of that miserable 28/6d?</P>

      <P>Much could be said about the fact that the unfortunate old age pensioners are not even considered to be worth 2d. a day&mdash;2d. a day to meet the increased cost of living, from bus fares to the bite on their tables. The Minister has hinted or suggested that if he had his way there would be no old age pension committees.  I believe this is one of the last vestiges of democracy we have and that being so the powers of these committees, instead of being cut, should be increased.  Are we going to hand over the whole system to Departments? The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary should clarify the position in regard to that.</P>
      <P>I must refer again to this question of old age pensions.  We have here a system whereby the harder a man works the less he finds himself entitled to at the end of his days.  That is not an incentive to anybody to work hard. We should try to abolish the system whereby a pension officer must investigate the amount of a claimant's hard-earned money.  We should try to evolve a system such as they have in England and which has a lot to recommend it. Officials cost a lot more under the present system than if we were to pay full pensions without subjecting people to a system of interrogation to find out what they have.  I can assure the Minister that a vast number of these people in my constituency have &ldquo;sweet all&rdquo; after working all their lives.  That is all I have to say on this Bill because it does not offer a lot but I should like the Minister to clarify the point about old age pension committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to several speakers during this debate and I must say I found many of them amusing when I took the actual facts into consideration. I listened to Deputy O'Sullivan raising again the question of the food subsidies as if these food subsidies had not been referred to sufficiently over the years to make the people sick when they hear about them now.  I should like to remind Deputy O'Sullivan that before he came into <Col N="1188" /> this House, when the food subsidies were first introduced, the Deputies in Opposition proclaimed that they were niggardly, that they were a disgrace and that the amounts offered were not worth considering.  But the food subsidies became of tremendous value when eventually, because of the previous Government's faults, they had to be abolished.  Of course something which they failed to take into consideration when talking about these subsidies was the fact that the people actually paid them.  Even though they were not aware of it they were paying the subsidies which were taken out of the same pool as the ordinary taxes are taken from.  If the people did not get full benefit for the money saved by the abolition of the food subsidies it was simply because of the legacy of debt left to the Government and the country by the preceding Government.</P>
      <P>I heard some Deputies speak about the niggardly increase given to old age pensioners.  We weep over the old age pensioners constantly in this House. Every Deputy in Opposition seems to think that an appeal to the 160,000 old age pensioners will get him elected here, that he can use the softest words possible about their hardships and so on and that is going to benefit him. Deputy Coogan used the phrase that the harder a man works the less he is entitled to at the end of his days.  That to me is a very strange philosophy because I hold the harder a man works during his lifetime, the more he will have when he reaches the end of his days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Coogan that he does not understand the idea of the old age pension.  Like Deputy Corish on one occasion, he seems to regard it as a means of livelihood.  It was never intended, so far as I know, that it should be regarded as a means of livelihood. The old age pension was granted, in the first instance, as Deputy Coogan knows, as some form of assistance from the State to help old people when they reached a certain age and could no longer work.  It was never, from the <Col N="1189" /> beginning, intended to be a means of livelihood.  I say, and I have said this before, that if members of the Opposition Parties look on it as a means of livelihood, then, when they had the opportunity, they should have increased it to such an extent that it would enable old people to live on it solely.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan also mentioned the cost of the officials administering the scheme and said that a saving on these officials would provide pensions for everyone.  That is the greatest nonsense.</P>

      <P>He should study the matter before he makes a statement of that description.  He knows that the reason we have a means test for old age pensions is the extraordinarily heavy cost that would be involved were we to abolish the means test. People earning £1,000, £9,000, £10,000, or £500 a year would get the old age pension equally with the person who gets it now under the means test.</P>
      <P>I would remind Deputy Coogan that, when we first came into office, the maximum sum which a person could earn and still qualify for an old age pension was £15 per annum for a single man.  It is now £52 odd per annum. That brought in an immense number of people.  I would also remind him that all the efforts of the Fianna Fáil Party and Government over the years have been to try to do better for old age pensioners and others.</P>

      <P>The non-contributory pension is now 28/6.  I do not think the Deputy, taking into consideration the resources of the State, could say we are not dealing with <Col N="1190" /> these people as well as the State can be expected to deal with them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tierney was inclined to be funny about the amount of money the old age pensions cost, that is, £450,000.  He seemed to think that was not worth talking about.  He raised the question of jet planes, and a number of other ridiculous questions, when we were discussing the total cost of these pensions to the State.  I should like to refer to something in connection with the raising of that £450,000 and the £800,000 this Bill will cost.  I remember Deputy Kyne, in a debate about a year ago, advising the Minister to increase the tax on tobacco and cigarettes, beer and spirits, cinemas and other luxuries, in order that he might be able to do better for the old age pensioners and others.  Strange to say, when the Minister took part of his advice and put 1d. on cigarettes in order to bring in this £800,000, Deputy Kyne walked into the Lobby and voted against what he had actually recommended to the Minister.  Whenever we try to get money to grant concessions, the people on the other side of the House condemn us, and when we do not try to give concessions, we are condemned also.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it would be in order to deal with the question Deputy Tierney raised with regard to the pension increase which the British gave and which resulted in a reduction, in some cases, in the old age pension. It seems to me that, under the law as it stands, it is possible to reduce an old age pension by reason of an increase in a pension from the British authorities.  I think that is a hardship. I know a man who received an increase which amounted to 3d. per week, and because of that 3d. his scale went up and his pension was reduced by 5/-. That was undoubtedly unfair, but we must realise that if there is a ceiling in the statutes, the officials cannot go beyond that ceiling.  I had very great sympathy for that man and I hope the Minister will sometime be able&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The medical cards are based, as I understand the position, on the family income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene to say a word or two in relation to what has been said in this debate.  The last speaker referred to the benefits given to old age pensioners by this measure, and suggested that when the Fianna Fáil Government first dealt with old age pensions, the means test was based on an income of £15, and he referred to how much better off people were today when they could have £1 a week and not be disqualified.  That, I respectfully submit, is typical of the complacent and rather stupid attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party with regard to these measures.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows&mdash;certainly anyone who has to fend for himself on limited means knows well&mdash;that from 1939 to now, a period of 21 years, the value of money has dropped three times.  The £1 today is worth 6/8 compared with the 1939 £1.  Were we to do even elementary justice to the old age pensioners, we should increase their pensions to at least three times what it was in 1939.  If we were merely to ensure that the real benefits drawn from the old age pensions were to be the same as they were pre-war, the pension should now be 30/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the truth is that the Fianna Fáil Government have, in fact, reduced the old age pension.  It was <Col N="1192" /> 10/- in 1939, and at that time that money bought what it takes 30/- to buy today.  But here in this measure, which has been introduced with a fanfare of trumpets by the Fianna Fáil Party, expecting everybody to applaud, they are not even giving the old age pensioner what he enjoyed before an assault was made on his living costs by successive Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>This is a miserable measure&mdash;one shilling a week to compensate the poorest in this land for the fact that butter is dearer, bread is dearer, flour is dearer, through no fault of these people, through no circumstance of an increase in the costs of production or anything like that, but because of the deliberate decision of the Government. It is difficult for Deputies on this side of the House to regard this measure with any degree of patience.  It has been pointed out that in relation to more powerful elements in this State, this Government, having abolished the food subsidies and having increased the cost of living, then proceeded to compensate these powerful sections.  It is not necessary to mention them. Everybody knows what has been done in the past few years to cushion certain sections in this State against the pinch of rising prices.  But the old age pensioners who have no organisation, no effective political weapon available to them, are thrown a shilling at the end of the queue and are expected to doff their caps, touch their forelocks to the Minister for Social Welfare and say &ldquo;Thank you very much, sir.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said, this is a miserable measure.  Certainly it is most disheartening if it is indicative of the manner in which the Fianna Fáil Government shape up to their social responsibilities.  We can appreciate and understand what the cost to the State would be in relation to any increase in the old age pension.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us all about it today.  He painted a terrible picture of how the State would crack and bend and practically disrupt if we gave anything more than the shilling increase.  I do not know whom that was intended to impress.  So far as I can see, for any measure the Government <Col N="1193" /> desire to embark upon, irrespective of what the financial stringency may be, money is found for it.  In the past three years, the Government have increased enormously the cost of running the State because of their decision to embark upon measures which they regard as politically attractive; but when it comes to merely ensuring that the old age pensioner will not be worse off, that cannot be done.</P>
    <P>This measure is, in effect, a measure in this House to reduce the old age pension.  That is what it is.  Let no Deputy be under any illusion in relation to that.  When the food subsidies were abolished and when later that year, there was a further increase in the price of the necessaries of life, quite naturally every old age pensioner in the State felt that the Government must come to his assistance.  The Government recognised that, and this is the Government's measure to deal with that situation.  It solidifies and makes final the old age pension in this year and for whatever time exists before the next election.  This final measure by the Fianna Fáil Government is a measure reducing the old age pension.  In effect, it is giving the old age pensioner, in real benefits, less than he had before these increases in prices of food and other necessaries were imposed.</P>
    <P>I do not think this measure will achieve anything.  It will make more sullen and deep the sense of social injustice which must be felt by these people throughout the country.  They can do nothing about it.  They have to accept what is doled out to them. They have to accept the Government's view on what they should get.  I am sure they will accept it, as they have to, but certainly it does not reflect any credit on the Government or on this House.  I always feel in relation to measures of this kind for the worst off section of the community that speeches are frequently made, that Deputies come in here, weep crocodile tears and all the rest of it, but in effect very little is ever done for such people.</P>
    <P>Certainly this measure is not a great one.  It has to be accepted by us because, literally, the half loaf is better than no bread.  It is in that spirit that <Col N="1194" /> we accept it, but certainly our endorsing of this measure is not to be taken as any indication by us that we regard it as a proper measure of social justice. It is not, but the Government will not go any further or do any better, and at least this shilling must be accepted in order to minimise in some degree the effect of the disastrous decisions by the Government in relation to the necessaries of life.  As the Leader of the Opposition said this morning, I think it can be recognised by all, even the most enthusiastic Fianna Fáil Deputy, that this Government's decision three and a half years ago to abolish the food subsidies was a mistaken one.  It has not achieved what it was aimed to achieve: to effect a substantial saving to the Exchequer. There was hoped to be a saving of £9,000,000.</P>

It is not right that it should appear that only Deputies on this side of the House should be referred to in that way by the Chair, while Deputy Loughman can speak without any interruption or intervention by the Chair.  However, I have said all I want to say about it.  The whole thing has been quite a discreditable episode in our public life.  The Government departed from their speeches and undertakings and embarked upon a policy which has now proved to be mistaken.  They are desperately trying to make amends, but they are not going half far enough.</P>

      <P>It seems as if the Parliamentary Secretary in his statement this morning and in his approach to this Bill wanted to appear as a benevolent Santa Claus.  At the same time, since he became responsible for the Department of Social Welfare, he has declared to this House that he is going to be tough and that he is going to make it tougher for people applying for social welfare benefits.  I have asked him on several occasions if he has sent a circular letter to his officers all over the country and he has denied that he has done so.

      <P>These unfortunate people, when they apply for a pension, are being driven around the country by the Minister's officers.  There must have been a secret order or some circular letter sent out to these officers. From what I have gathered from my colleagues and from speeches made in the House, it would seem that it is something that has spread all over the country.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned old age pension committees here today and on another occasion he sneered at them in this House.  Why does he not dissolve them?  Fianna Fáil have been great in dissolving committees of elected representatives of the people all over the country.  I belong to a pension committee and I am going to their next meeting to ask them to get into communication with the Parliamentary Secretary to ask him what are his views and if he is in favour of their carrying on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did intend to say a word about British ex-service men and to say that I welcome what is in the Bill about them.  I can say it with safety now that Deputy Loughman has mentioned it.  If I had mentioned it earlier, I would have had Battle of Britain speeches thrown at me by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I want to say here that when we come in here representing the people of this country, it does <Col N="1197" /> not matter whether they wore a green coat in 1916, or pretend they wore one, or whether they wore a khaki coat and went to France.  Whatever service they may have rendered to this country or to Great Britain, they should not be belittled in this House by members of the Government or by a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that that clause has been included in this Bill because when these men got a small increase in their pensions recently, any of them who had old age pensions actually lost money because of the operation of the means test.  It is a good thing that we should do these things and bring legislation into this House to that effect. Too often we hear Ministers say that what Deputies suggest would require legislation.  Such remarks are constantly thrown across the floor of this House.  It is the duty of the Minister for Social Welfare and other Ministers, when any of the laws in this country operate to squeeze some small section of the people, to bring in legislation to relieve them.  I give them no credit for that.  It is their duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my duty to say that we are here to legislate.  That is what I thought we were sent here for. I heard the usual Fianna Fáil hypocrisy here today that it is they who have given everything.  It is not the Government of Ireland or the people of Ireland but Fianna Fáil who give everything.  We have a great number of people drawing old age pensions today who would not be drawing them, were it not for the legislation introduced by the inter-Party Government who raised the means test ceiling from £39 to £52 for full pension and to £104 for part pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before that Government came in, it was stated by the Fianna Fáil Government that the penultimate stage had been reached as far as old age pensions were concerned and that they could not give any more.  They forget that following the coming into office of the inter-Party Government, in a matter of weeks, a very substantial increase was given to old age pensioners and <Col N="1198" /> the ceiling was raised to £52 for full pension and to £104 for part pension.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Fianna Fáil Government have any reason to be smug about this miserable measure which gives these unfortunate people another 1/- a week.  We are not allowed to talk about the expenses these people have but we can say that they try to eat the same things as other people in the country, some of whom have received great benefits in the past few years from this Government.  We even looked after ourselves but now we have left these people with less than 1/- a week increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ask his officials to be a little more lenient or, at least, to be as lenient as they were before the present Parliamentary Secretary took office.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated today that there was a man in his constituency who could plough and mow, reap and sow, and still was in receipt of a blind pension.  I thought that an extraordinary statement to make.  He also said there was a man&mdash; may be it was the same man&mdash;who was employed in a polling station either as presiding officer or polling clerk.  To me that seems to be great generosity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather suspicious when he said the man went to work in a polling station, and I would ask did the man know him?  That might be the reason the pension officer was so lenient in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe our whole system of social welfare for widows will have to be overhauled by the Department.  There are other benefits which widows should get but, if I mention them, I should probably have to say that they would require legislation.  However, I direct the Minister's attention to the fact that widows often have children to rear on the miserable pittances they get and have other expenses to face that old age pensioners do not have to meet, even though old age pensioners are also tried hard to keep body and soul together on the small amounts they get, <Col N="1199" /> be they single or married.  I believe there should be special treatment accorded to widows, more concessions granted to them in the matter of education for their children and such concessions.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to influence his Parliamentary Secretary to take some of the Gestapo methods out of his Department that seem to have been introduced during his term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is indeed to be welcomed.  In my opinion, it is the Magna Carta of the insured workers and I have no doubt that the 50,000 insured workers who will benefit directly, and their families, totalling approximately 200,000 people, will sing the praises of the Minister for Social Welfare for many days to come. This is the realisation of the dream of many of us who have been interested in social welfare for years, and I feel proud that it is a Fianna Fáil Government and a Fianna Fáil Minister who introduced it, in keeping with their past record of service to the insured workers and workers of the country as a whole, to the old age pensioners, to the widows and the orphans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now come to a new phase in social welfare and there is no doubt that this is the forerunner of a more comprehensive scheme of social insurance. The Minister is to be highly commended and the best wishes of the House and of the people of the country as a whole should be extended to him for the fearless step he has taken in catering in a more magnificent way for the insured workers in the winter of their days.  Every day of the week, we meet people who are in exceptionally good health at the age of 70 years and, with modern medical services available, 70 is not now regarded as an old age.  It is quite on the cards that a man of 70 may be capable of giving further service to the nation, even in manual labour.  Napoleon went down not because he was too old but because he was too tired.  At the age of 46 years, he handed in his gun, but I feel very proud that we today have people of even 80 years of age who are quite capable of taking their places <Col N="1200" /> amongst people still working and doing their share of manual labour.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have asked why the appointed date was fixed as 1st August but people who talk like that know very little about social services. On a previous occasion, a break was made in a middle of a period of national health insurance service.  The price of stamps was changed in, I think, the month of September and I do not know if there ever was more confusion created for the officials of the Department than at that time.  It took years to clear up the terrible mess that was created by the change in the price of stamps in what could be called the middle of the insurance period.</P>
    <P>I can readily understand that there are great difficulties in bringing a Bill of this kind into operation.  It is a far greater measure of social insurance than what most people could appreciate at first, second and even third reading.  It is a difficult Bill to interpret, though the Minister, no doubt, has explained in no small way what every section means and is intended to convey. It is always difficult to interpret intricate Bills of this kind but the intricacies of this Bill are compensated for by the benefits it confers on insured workers.</P>
    <P>There may be attempts at fraud arising out of the Bill.  I would ask the Minister to see that that does not happen.  Prior to the amalgamation of national health insurance, there was an era of fraud unsurpassed in any country.  The amalgamation helped to eradicate abuse.  Insurance societies paid whom they liked to pay and people in full health claimed benefit. There was an attempt made to make insurance retrospective.  I would ask the Minister to guard against that type of fraud because fraud leads to curtailment of services.  I do not believe that retrospective insurance should be tolerated.  There must be the fullest consideration for the man who insured himself, who did not deny that he had entered into a contract of service, who aided the State and, incidentally, himself, by having his card stamped.</P>
    <P>At one time people who had never been insured made it their business to contact local agents, as was then possible, <Col N="1201" /> and have cards stamped.  When the required number of stamps was affixed to qualify them for benefit, they were the first to claim benefit.  Many of them were in receipt of national health insurance benefit from the days of the old societies up to the period when the Department of Social Welfare conducted what is known as the blitz. They blitzed those who were frauds out of benefit and they are to be highly commended for doing so.  Subsequent to the amalgamation, the Department did great work in eliminating fraud. Some cases were brought to court and I was sorry that they were not dealt with more severely.</P>
    <P>I mention this matter because there could be a repetition of that sort of thing.  People who have not a <i>bona fide</i> contract of service might endeavour to draw benefit.  That would be disastrous and I would ask the Minister to guard against it because the more fraud there is, the less the State can afford to give the <i>bona fide</i> insured worker.</P>
    <P>In the old days, agents were depending on subsidies from the State.  Many people obtained benefit because they were able to fool the doctor into giving them a certificate.  It is not always possible for a doctor to be certain as to whether a man has a pain in his toe or not.  He may have a doubt but the benefit of the doubt must be given to the insured person.  I mention that in order to ensure that there will not be a recurrence of that type of fraud.</P>
    <P>Twenty-odd years have shown many advances on the road leading to full comprehensive social insurance.  The 1952 Act laid the foundation of the Bill we are now discussing.  I hope to live to see the Minister in a position to say that the nation can afford to give the most deserving section of the community a further assurance that their old age will be covered by insurance of this type.  This is an excellent example to the people as to how they should save.  I am afraid that we in this country have not learned the art of saving as other peoples have.  In other countries, savings are very much higher than they are in this country, having regard to our size and financial position.  This is an example of how <Col N="1202" /> the people should save for the rainy day.  This is one way of saving and ensuring that the moneys so saved will be put to credit so as to qualify for future benefits.</P>
    <P>I am the most optimistic member of this House but I never visualised three years ago, when the finances of the nation were at such a low ebb, that we would be able in such a short time to produce a Bill of this kind. We must be very grateful to the Minister and to the Minister for Finance that they are in a position to say in the year 1960 that the country can afford, without any danger whatever, to give these excellent benefits to the older section of the community.</P>
    <P>A most important feature of the Bill is that there is no means test involved. We would like to see the means test abolished completely in regard to old age pensions.  We hope that with the progress now being made by the State that may be possible in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

Does he not further accept the fact that, if we need a helicopter here, we have to apply to some other country to provide this facility?  In view of that, surely it is not too much to expect this nation to buy a helicopter for itself, if only for the sake of the prestige of the Army and the life saving services generally.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will read the reply given in April, 1959, he will find all the arguments dealt with there.  An inter-departmental committee was established in November, 1957, to examine the position with regard to the use of helicopters in the saving of life and that committee reported that, since 1946, there have been no occasions on which the availability of a helicopter to our life saving services would have saved lives.</P>

Employment permits are issued for a maximum period of 12 months and are subject to renewal.  The question of a time limit on the period of residence is one for the Minister for Justice but I understand that the practice is to equate the period of residence with the period covered by the employment permit.</P>

There are many people who did not have their health insurance stamps properly contributed and who may lose benefit as a result, and where a genuine case is pleaded the Minister and the Department should at least give the benefit of the doubt to the insured person. I would ask that this matter be publicised to a far greater extent, either <Col N="1215" /> by Ministerial speeches or by advertisements. It behoves every member of the House to try to explain what are the great benefits that accrue from this Act and how necessary it is for insured workers to make certain that the proper number of stamps are affixed to their cards so that, by no fault of their own, they would deprive themselves of benefit.  Unfortunately, in the past, many insured workers did not keep records and I would urge them strongly to keep their own records in future so that there will be no danger of their losing benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a most interesting debate and in some respects has been very revealing.  For the past nine months Fine Gael headquarters have been giving notice of a coming interesting event, the mighty deliverance of a new Fine Gael political programme.  We have been told that the deliverance is at hand and, therefore, this debate will be of great interest to those who are wondering what is being hatched.  It will be interesting also to those who are speculating as to whose brain child the new programme will be, whether it is going to be Deputy Dillon's, with a squint to the right, or Deputy Declan Costello's, looking rather pink.  We have had an inkling this morning of what the programme is likely to be, from speeches made by the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues on the Front Bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard some rather startling hints as to what is in the offing, that is to say startling from the point of view of those who hitherto have habitually supported Fine Gael.  We have had statements which show that Fine Gael is so greedy for office that it intends to secure it almost at any price, and the taxpayers have had a clear warning to look out.  If ever <Col N="1216" /> again Fine Gael brings in a Budget, if the speeches this morning are any indication of sincerity of purpose, the people will be called upon to face a spectacular increase in taxes.  We have had strong hints that the food subsidies are to be restored at a cost, in present circumstances and at present prices, of about £20,000,000, and that old age pensions are to be given out to recipients irrespective of the needs of these persons, irrespective of their means, and at a cost of many more millions of pounds.  Yet, during the Budget debate, Deputies who now appear to be preparing the way for a programme which would cost at the minimum about £25,000,000 to give effect to in respect of a few things mentioned here this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not say £50,000,000 or £100,000,000 while you are at it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;grumble because a penny was imposed on the packet of cigarettes in order to provide the major part of the cost of the benefits in this Bill, and in order to meet the expense which will fall on the Exchequer in relation to the other Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>It would be very interesting to know who is responsible for this conversion, particularly in respect of the food subsidies. Has it been Deputy Dr. Browne of the National Progressive Democrats or has it been Deputy D. Costello who is supposed to have hankerings after the National Progressive Democrats? Deputy T. F. O'Higgins who was very vocal about the food subsidies said not a word in the Budget debate of 1952.  I must relate that to what has been said today.</P>
      <P>It has been argued that the primary reason we are bringing in this Bill is to compensate for the cost of living. Deputy Dillon said this morning that it is because the price of butter has gone up by 3d.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  One thing one can always bank on is that when Deputy Dillon says that a member of the Government or a member of the <Col N="1217" /> Government Party says something he has to put his own gloss upon it and, in fact, the words he ascribes to his opponents are not to be found there at all.  I took the opportunity of leaving the House while Deputy Dillon was speaking just to find out precisely what the Minister for Finance did say when introducing the Budget.  He did not say a thing about 3d. per lb. on the price of butter.  What he did say was this, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 18, No. 2, column 168 of 27th April, 1960:</P>
      <P>While the effect may be to add only one point to the consumer price index&mdash;not a very serious matter for those whose wages, salaries or profits have increased&mdash;I am concerned about the position of families on rather low, fixed incomes, especially those dependent on Social Assistance.</P>
      <P>&mdash;not what Deputy Dillon has been saying, not one point to the consumer price index, that is, 0.66 per cent. of the present value of the index&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us hark back to Deputy Dillon and I shall come back to Deputy O'Sullivan in due course, if I am permitted.  This morning, Deputy Dillon's opening gambit was this: He said that, under the Social Welfare Bill which the House had passed and under this Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is now before it, we were doing everything for practically every section in the community, for the townsman and the others, but doing nothing for the farmers.  That was Deputy Dillon's opening gambit this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and points out that it will produce an immediate reaction in every household in the country, when the Minister for Finance doing something for the farmer also as I have said points out that the inevitable consequence will be that there will be additional charges on family budgets, Deputy Dillon first complains we are doing nothing for the farmer.  Then, when we come in with a Bill which more than compensates certain sections of the community for the consequences of what we have done for the farmer, he immediately begins to grumble also.  It is time there was some consistency and some sort of rational thought on the part of those leading the Opposition.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred sneeringly to the relaxations and concessions in this Social Welfare Bill.  He said this was all we were prepared to do for the social assistance classes.  It is all we are prepared to do in present circumstances but it is a great deal more than any Coalition Government did.</P>
      <P>Many of the provisions in this Bill are the fruit of some search and of some concern for the conditions of those in receipt of social assistance. The Deputy supported two Coalitions. Some of the provisions I am repealing in this Bill at a cost to the taxpayer of over £200,000 were in the social assistance and old age pensions code for over 50 years.  The hearts of those people are bleeding now for the old age pensioners.  They come here and talk glibly about only one shilling.  Deputy Dillon snaps his fingers at a shilling. All during the period he was in office, the haemorrhage from his heart stopped, and he turned a blind eye to all these imperfections in the social welfare code.  I am not saying we are doing anything very great in giving these relaxations and concessions but, at any rate, they indicate an amount of concern and regard for the position of these people which was strikingly lacking during the period the Coalition were in office.</P>

      <P>Let us get back to the argument which was advanced this morning by Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.  Deputy O'Sullivan said we were only compensating the recipients of social assistance benefits for the increase in the cost of living. Let us consider the position of the country when the second Coalition Government were in office in February, 1957.  It happens that the consumer price index figure is published in mid-February so we have some measure of what the cost of living was to the ordinary consumer in this country. In mid-February, 1957, that figure was 135.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference in that figure as it stood at mid-February, 1957, and as it is now represents an increase in the cost of living of 6.6 per cent.  What is the position in relation to the old age pensions?  It happens that the Fianna Fáil Government which took office in mid-summer, 1951, increased the old age pension by 2/6, from 17/6 to 20/-, and increased it by a further 1/6 in the following year, making it 21/6.  The second Coalition Government came into office in mid-June of 1954, and, as I have said, were thrown out by the country in mid-February, 1957.  During that period of almost three years, they increased the old age pension only once, by 2/6.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when the coalition Parties, as I say, fled from office because they were afraid to face the country with the Budget which they would have to present in the following April or May.  So the figure in relation to pensions on which we must base our calculations is the rate of the old age pension as it stood in mid-February, 1957 and it was then 24/-.  Under this Bill, following the two increases already granted to the old age pensioner, the rate of pension, as from the 1st August, will be 28/6d&mdash;that is 4/6d. more than it was when we took office and 4/6d. more than it was under the second Coalition Government.  That 4/6d. represents an increase on the pension which Deputy Dillon and his colleagues were prepared to pay of 18.75 per cent.  The two figures that have got to be contrasted are these&mdash;a rise in the consumer price index of 6.6 per cent. over the three and a quarter years <Col N="1224" /> that we have now been in office and over the same period a rise in the rate of old age pension of 18.75 per cent., so that far from merely compensating the old age pensioners for any increase that may have taken place in the cost of living we have compensated them threefold.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish thought the Bill was good in parts and not so good in other parts.  He did not wholly condemn any of it.  But he did try to do something which is a mistake. He said that we were providing so much, in his opinion not enough, for social assistance recipients, and he then went on to say we were giving so much more to people engaged in the tourist industry; so much more to people engaged in trying to build up our industrial economy here.  He suggested that there was something wrong in doing that.  He wants, in short, to equate social assistance payments with the inducement given to industrial and other enterprises to expand their activities, to increase production, to earn more for the community as a whole and give greater employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic difference between the two types of State expenditure is this.  After all, the social assistance recipients live on the community.  They do live on the productive elements in the community. If we cannot induce the producers in the community to expand their efforts to earn more for the community as a whole, we will not be able to increase the benefits given to social assistance recipients.  It is quite wrong to stir up what amounts to class prejudice as between one section of the community and another, particularly to stir up class prejudice among those who merely by reason of the fact that they are in receipt of social assistance <Col N="1226" /> are a non-productive element in the community and in a vast majority of cases are non-productive, not due to any fault of theirs, but due merely to the vicissitudes of life or the effluxion of time but to whom the community has a duty and an obligation, a duty and an obligation which can only be discharged provided that the discharging of it does not impose such an intolerable burden on the productive elements that they will cease to produce or find some other field for their enterprise and some other country in which to live.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious matter that any Leader of a Party in this State should try to stir up the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; against the &ldquo;haves&rdquo;, particularly those &ldquo;haves&rdquo; who are engaged in trying to build up our economy and trying to expand industry and production so that we shall be able to carry more people and provide a better standard of living for those who are in receipt of social assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points to which I should like to refer on this Estimate.  One of the things which I welcomed in the Minister's statement was the fact that in the near future he intends to issue a booklet on the health services.  I think this is necessary because in spite of the fact that the services have now been in operation for some years there is still considerable confusion not only amongst the general public but amongst public representatives in regard to what people are entitled to under these Acts.  I find that generally people do not appreciate the fact that even if their income does not qualify them for a medical card, nevertheless, in certain circumstances, they can get that card for a specific purpose and thereby derive the benefits which were envisaged when the Act was brought in.</P>
      <P>There are other matters which also give trouble such as the fact that people find it confusing that an old age pensioner who has undergone a severe means test before he can qualify for his old age pension is not automatically entitled to a medical card. It would need to be explained that the medical card is governed by the income of the house rather than the income of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another knotty problem, to my mind, is the awarding of a disability allowance.  It seems to lie entirely at the discretion of the manager and on the recommendation of his investigating officer and seemingly there is a very wide difference as to the type of person who is eligible for disability allowance.  I should like to make a plea for the person who is completely unable to work.  I have such a person in mind, a person who is crippled with arthritis.  He would cost the State a considerable amount of money if he were committed to a home.  He is living at home and even with the disability allowance his maximum weekly income is 30/-.  The local authorities inform me that they have no power to give him more.  I find that difficult to believe because 30/- bears no relation <Col N="1229" /> to the cost to the taxpayer and the ratepayer if such a person had to be kept in a home.</P>
    <P>There are many benefits to be derived under the Health Act but people find it confusing that ophthalmic or aural services are not included.  While I know it would cost the Exchequer money, it is something which the Minister should keep before him because until such time as all the different services can be taken in in some way, the Health Act will not achieve its full purpose.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see that the Minister paid considerable attention to mental illness.  There is of course a new awareness amongst the public in relation to this illness and a great change in their attitude to mental hospitals and mental diseases generally. I know that in Cork, which I suppose is not very much different from other centres, an increasing number of people are going voluntarily to the R.M.S. of the hospital and the numbers attending the out-patients' clinics have increased lately on account of the number of voluntary patients going there.  This is a very good trend and the more publicity directed to informing the public of the facilities which are available, and of the necessity for early attention to mental illness, the better, because it will serve a very useful purpose.</P>
    <P>After 25 years of agitation, a new addition is being erected to the Cork hospital and it certainly will fulfil a great need.  I would stress again the need for more publicity to inform people of the facilities in hospital clinics both for intern and extern patients.  Such publicity would have very beneficial effects.</P>
    <P>The White Paper issued a short time ago about the mentally handicapped shows that the Department is very much concerned about something which up to recently has been hidden away and forgotten and is now rapidly assuming a very great importance, and rightly so, in our midst.  We have two organisations in Cork&mdash;one of which very rightly received mention in the White Paper&mdash;which are doing a tremendous amount of good work.  One started as a post-polio committee but <Col N="1230" /> has now turned to mentally handicapped children of both sexes.  It has a day school and a residential school for such children and it is expanding its activities all the time and deserves great credit.  Another activity there is the cerebral palsy clinic.  The committee for that was started in 1955.  It was a small committee and opened a clinic in two small rooms in a back street.  As far as I can recall, it then had 14 patients.  Through voluntary efforts, it was able to open a clinic in the centre of the city in 1958 and at that time it included a small school. There were 39 patients and 11 students in the school.  They were mainly drawn from Cork city and the immediate suburbs.</P>
    <P>Now we find that the clinic is much too small.  Instead of 11 pupils, there are now 39.  The children are attending pediatricians and medical officers are sending them there not alone from all parts of Cork city and county but Tipperary town, Limerick and even Kilkenny.  There are 70 children attending the day clinic.  The position is now embarrassing and a new school is an immediate necessity.  The room that has been used was turned over for daily attention to these children.  It is a well-known fact that success in the treatment of cerebral palsy, as in other diseases, depends on regular treatment at a very early age.  I would say that there is only one residential clinic in this part of Ireland and that is the one situated at Bray and for which there is a waiting list.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the time has come when residential clinics will have to be envisaged for Munster, certainly for South Munster.  Our experience in Cork shows that there is a great need for a residential clinic.  Pediatricians are convinced that a child no matter how badly handicapped he may be by cerebral palsy or any such affliction should not be removed remotely from his parents.  No matter how badly afflicted they are, they should not be too far removed from contact with their parents. Even if the Bray clinic were able to take all the patients seeking admission, it would be too far away for many parents to keep in contact <Col N="1231" /> with their children.  There is a great need for a residential clinic in the Cork area to serve at least South Munster, if not the whole of the province.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the people who have given such tremendous voluntary service in connection with the cerebral palsy clinic and the other clinic I mentioned.  With the exception of a small State grant for school furniture, the cerebral palsy clinic was built entirely through voluntary effort.  At a time when so much is expected, or even demanded from the State, it is right that tribute should be paid to voluntary workers and subscribers. I believe that no matter how far we progress, there will always be a place here for the voluntary worker and subscriber.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and his Department know very well that the school dental service at present is merely touching the fringe of the problem.  In his opening statement, the Minister said there was a scarcity of dentists.  There are only two dental schools in this part of the country, one in Dublin and the other in Cork.  I was very glad to learn that a new school is to be built in Dublin because the old one is entirely inadequate. However, it certainly is no more inadequate than the school in Cork. About 20 years ago, the average number of dentistry students in Cork was from four to six.  Today, the University authorities are embarrassed because it is impossible to cater for all those wishing to do dentistry.  Because there is not sufficient space at the North Infirmary Hospital, the intake of dentistry students must be confined to 12.  The course takes three years and that means that 36 students must complete that course under the handicap of insufficient accommodation.</P>
    <P>Five years ago, both the teaching staff and teaching methods of the dentistry school at the North Charitable Infirmary were reorganised, and that reorganisation has had really remarkable results.  Each year, as I have said, there were 12 students, and of the 36 students over those three years, 35 succeeded in their final examination. I do not know if that record can be <Col N="1232" /> equalled, not alone surpassed, in any other institution, and that has been achieved when they were working, as I very well know, under tremendous difficulties.  As I said, University College Cork are experiencing considerable embarrassment because they have to select those students who will be allowed to do dentistry from the very large number wishing to do it. The system there is something like this: The first 12 students in the pre-Med examination are given the choice of going for dentistry or continuing with medicine, and if they choose to go on for medicine, their place in the dental School is given to the next in order of merit.</P>
    <P>At present when so many of our professional people are emigrating, we should consider that there is no more lucrative profession for a young boy or girl than dentistry.  Without any doubt in Great Britain dentistry is at present a most attractive profession. According to the most reliable sources, the dentistry needs of that country will not be met for the next 20 years.  I suggest that that is one of the reasons why the Minister is finding it difficult to get dentists for the public health services in this country.  Apart altogether from the Department of Health, I believe the Government should make available to young people the means to enable them qualify in this profession.</P>
    <P>I completely agree with the Department's attitude that the dental services should aim particularly at the preservation of the teeth of our young people. However, one has to recognise that there are people whose health or chances of employment sometimes depend on their having teeth and who have not the means of providing them for themselves.  Therefore, it is only right that a percentage of the money available should be set aside for dental work.  But that cannot be done until we have a 100 per cent. school dental service, and I would say that it is about 7½ per cent. at present.</P>
    <P>In my opinion prevention is better than cure; and that brings me to another matter.  This may seem strange coming from a Corkman speaking in Dublin, but I <Col N="1233" /> believe there is a great necessity for indoor baths in Dublin.  Few exercises can do as much for the fitness and health of any young boy or girl as swimming.  Some people will say that Dublin is near the sea and there are outdoor baths, but we must remember that in a climate such as ours there are only three months of the year in which such facilities can be availed of.  I would ask the Minister to use his influence with the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance to see that indoor swimming pools are provided particularly in the city of Dublin but also in other centres, such as Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  Compared with other places, I am glad to say we are not too badly served in Cork.  The reason I mention Dublin is that I can say, without fear of contradiction, that no city in Europe of its size and population is as badly off in this matter.</P>
    <P>In spite of certain criticisms which have been coming in and which will come in, I can assure the Minister that most of us are looking very confidently to the future and to a great improvement under the unified health services. I think that was a step in the right direction and I have every confidence that when we meet here next year to pass the Minister's Estimate, we shall recall with satisfaction the improvement that will have been made under the unified health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a great measure of personal sadness that I make my contribution to this debate on the health services which is being carried on in the shadow of the death of the greatest health legislator in history, Aneurin Bevan.  We must all regret the passing of this great parliamentarian, this loyal democrat and this great social legislator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to join in the tribute which Deputy O'Higgins paid to the past secretary of the Department of Health with whom I had much fruitful and valuable association during my period of office in the Department.  It is a particular tribute to him that people so diverse in our political views as Deputy O'Higgins and myself can quite genuinely pay a tribute to this man for his great loyalty to us and to the policies we believed in.  I should like <Col N="1234" /> to wish his successor every good luck in his post and hope that he will be able to equal the high standard of public service of his predecessor.</P>
    <P>This has been one of the most heartening debates to listen to and to read for the reason that it seems to me that, for the first time, there is some sort of breach in what at one time looked to be an impregnable wall of indifference or complacency in the approach to health matters.  I think there is still a tremendous amount of confused and woolly thinking in the matter but there have been these first stirrings of new thinking on the whole question of health in the country.</P>
    <P>To my mind, that has been due to a considerable extent to the defects of the 1953 Health Act as much as to anything else.  Whether the Minister is aware of it or not, the health services come in for a tremendous amount of criticism from all sections of the community and particularly from people who have to depend on the dispensary service and that is a depressingly high number of people.  It seems to me to be a sad commentary on the social structure of our society that there are something like 800,000 people who can qualify for the health services.  That is a very high percentage.</P>
    <P>There are a number of minor points which I would like to deal with before dealing in greater detail with the contribution made by Deputy O'Higgins and the points raised by the Minister. The first one concerns the question of cancer, of cigarette smoking and so on.  I was surprised that Deputy Dr. Esmonde threw some doubt on the suggestion that cigarette smoking is a possible source of cancer of the lung. I think it has been established, and the Minister has given us to understand that it is accepted, that there is now no doubt at all that cigarette smoking is a causative factor in the establishment of cancer of the lung.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be confusing the issue when people like Deputy Dillon and Dr. Esmonde and Deputy de Valera brought in the question of whether diesel oil fumes are a causative factor.  Whether it is or is not, it does not alter the fact that cigarette smoking is.  I hope the Minister will clear up any confusion that might remain <Col N="1235" /> on that point.  Whether diesel oil is or is not a cause, there is no doubt about the fact that cigarette smoking is a cause of cancer of the ling and people should be reminded of this fact.  I am quite aware that a lot of money comes into the Exchequer from tobacco duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that it has nothing to do with it.  It must be a source of considerable worry to the Minister for Finance if the Minister for Health were to publicise the connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer with anything like the same intensity as that with which the cigarette companies publicise the attractiveness of cigarette smoking.  An occasional speech by the Minister will in no way offset the very extensive, costly, clever and ingenious campaigns carried out by all the tobacco companies.</P>
      <P>No matter what Minister is there, if he does not carry out a really intensive campaign, he will be completely overwhelmed and is not likely to be understood by the public.  The Minister knows that when people are advertising anything, whether it be an item of produce or goods of any sort, it is not good enough for the managing director of a company to make an annual speech praising the article and then to sit down and say nothing about it for the rest of the year.  He would insist that if his competitors were advertising, his product should be advertised also.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Minister has the right to insist on the publication of this fact.  If he has the right to insist on publication of the fact that a certain drug contains poison I think he should insist on publicising the fact that cigarettes contain certain constituents which have been proved to be a cause of cancer of the lung which is certainly one of the most painful diseases I know of from which to die.  Very much more could be done by the Minister in this respect and although the matter has serious financial implications I think the social implications should override them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> I find the figures for the poliomyelitis death rate and its incidence so early in the year very disturbing.  Medical people who know much more about it than I do have also expressed concern. I think the Minister has not publicised sufficiently the facilities that are available. They are not as freely available as I should like them to be but they are there for what they are worth and certain of them are free and they are not availed of by those who could avail of them.  That cannot be said to be due to the fact that parents do not care whether the children get this disease or not; they do care.  In my experience, and long before I went into the Department of Health any intensive health educational programme carried out for, say, smallpox or diphtheria or the publicising of the tuberculosis services was effective.  It is possible without frightening or worrying people to give them the essential information and to exercise ignorance in regard to these diseases.  That was achieved in relation to tuberculosis, diphtheria and smallpox.  I believe it will be possible for the Minister to get a much better response from parents if he intensifies the propaganda very much more than he is doing at present.</P>
    <P>I notice in the advertisements in the country papers and in the national papers that the Minister for Agriculture, in trying to sell his bovine tuberculosis scheme to the farmers, does not leave it to the agricultural authorities to issue a few leaflets and hope for the best.  Properly, he takes every opportunity of publicising the facilities available and of urging farmers to eradicate tuberculosis from their cattle. In that way his programme has a fair amount of success.  There is no doubt that if there is a danger of a serious epidemic&mdash;and I am sure the Minister is as much disturbed about it as I am, possibly even more&mdash;the Minister would be justified in initiating a publicity campaign in regard to the facilities available, limited though they may be, against this disease and the protection that vaccination gives.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give parents an opportunity of knowing that they are exposing their children to this horrible <Col N="1237" /> disease of poliomyelitis and make sure that they know about it.  Secondly, I urge him to get rid of the silly, residual charge for the few who cannot get the service free.  It is hardly worth the few shillings he collects when one takes into account the trouble it is for local authorities to assess means and make all the usual enquiries that must be made to establish that a person is not above a certain income if he is to get free service. I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter in the light of the figures and see if he cannot increase the tempo of the propaganda and, get rid of the charge and have a free service as in the case of diphtheria, tuberculosis and smallpox which used to be a free service. I do not know why polio should be the exception among these other conditions.  I can see no justification for it if the Minister is really anxious that children should be protected from this disease as far as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will treat with considerable contempt the suggestion by Deputy Booth that money should be taken from the T.B. patients, people with infectious diseases, to provide money to look after people suffering from cancer or coronary thrombosis.  That seems to be one of the most despicable suggestions I have yet heard; it gives one a rather disturbing insight into Deputy Booth's mind that he should consider robbing the consumptive to pay for the cancer patients when surely there must be other ways in which the Minister can find the money should he decide to do so.  I am sure the Minister will not waste much time on that suggestion.</P>
    <P>The question of the Health Council was raised here.  I should like to say very briefly that it is regrettable that the conflict is there but I am not going to deal with that.  I want to explain my personal attitude.  I appreciate very much the Minister's decision to appoint me to the Health Council.  He could have followed the example of his predecessor and not have me on the Council for one reason or another, but my reason for not accepting the appointment is simply that I do not think that the Council can function efficiently without the representatives <Col N="1238" /> of the Medical Association which has been the representative body of the medical profession of the country whatever one may think of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister will know from the records or minutes of the Council that for probably 80 per cent. of the time I was in conflict with the views of the members of the Association on the Health Council.  But I do not think that is sufficiently good reason for not having the benefit&mdash;it may be a doubtful benefit at times&mdash;of their advice on the Council.  I hope that the difference between the Minister and the Medical Association can be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have been impressed by the unanimity of the complaints about the present health services but, at the same time, I think we must be a little more precise.  I have read speeches by outsiders as spokesmen for the Medical Association&mdash;I think Mr. O'Connell was one&mdash;and speeches made here by various Deputies stating that the Health Acts had been a failure.  That is a sweeping generalisation that is not wholly true.  It is very important that we should recognise that fact: some of the Health Acts have been failures no doubt, but others have not.</P>
    <P>One of the things which I can never understand is that the most progressive Health Act of all is the product of the Minister's activities in the Department of Health, when he has now, it seems to me, turned his back on all these progressive actions of that time. I refer to the 1947 Act.  Within that Health Act, it would be wrong to dismiss all our health services as being inefficient, ineffective or bad, when we know quite well that the infectious diseases and the tuberculosis health legislation has been a singular success, due to the activities of various Ministers in the Department of Health over the past 10 or 15 years.</P>
    <P>The only reason I mention this section of this legislation is that I want to use it to establish a point in relation to the future pattern which I think our health services should take. If I can establish the point, then I think it must be a guiding line to us in our decisions in relation to future health legislation.</P>
    <P>Tributes have been paid by various <Col N="1239" /> Deputies to the reduction in the death rate from tuberculosis and in the morbidity rate of tuberculosis and the practical disappearance of infectious fever.  It would be wrong to say that it is due to the sanatoria, drugs, doctors and nurses, administration and so on. These things by themselves are completely useless, unless they can be brought into contact with the patient and that seems to me to be the operative consideration in the legislation which was used to get rid of these diseases in Ireland and the legislation which we are trying to use to get rid of, say, the high rate of maternity and infant mortality or the death rate from diseases of one kind of another, for instance, pneumonia and such conditions.</P>
    <P>That is the most important consideration and I find it a little surprising that most Deputies do not seem to want to face or to recognise that fact. In some countries there are the finest medical and nursing personnel, institutions and all the great drugs that one has now but because they have not a free, no means test tuberculosis service or fever hospital service, they have the same high incidence of tuberculosis and fevers as they ever had.  The important thing in relation to these physical requirements of a health service is not only that they be there&mdash;they must be there, of course&mdash;but that they must be made available to the patient and must be made available on certain conditions. It is my contention that that is the most important factor in the dramatic reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases in this country since the passing of the 1947 Health Act and the implementation of its provisions over the ensuing 10 or 12 years.</P>
    <P>So it is important to clear up that point and if there is any logic in our actions in future, then it should point to this fact in helping us to decide if we are sincere in wanting to get rid of disease and to prevent disease, if we want to prevent deformity and unnecessary diseases and help people as much as possible, we must face it that the patient must be brought into contact with the service at the earliest possible opportunity and the surest way of doing that is to see that <Col N="1240" /> the service is made available free and and that there is no means test.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in Deputy O'Higgins' contribution to this debate.  It was a most well-informed, well-briefed and thoughtful speech, giving very many useful and illuminating facts.  Deputy O'Higgins was Minister for Health at one time, responsible for legislation.  It is conceivable that by what he says he might influence the present Minister for Health in his actions in the future.</P>
    <P>There are a number of considerations which arose which I should like to deal with.  The first one concerns what I consider a woolly reflection on the position of politics in health.  He suggested that the Minister had the possibility to take permanently out of the political arena the problem of health and health policies.  I should like to put another point of view in regard to that point.  I am fairly proud of being a politician.  I do not see why we politicians should accept this interpretation of the word &ldquo;politics&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>To me, politics is inseparable from every action which man takes in life in any civilised society. Deputy O'Higgins, in coming into this political arena and making his very excellent speech in that way, was putting forward a political point of view, a political point of view which he had every right to record, a point of view from most of which I differ.  He even referred to the fact that the debate was held after the by-election in Carlow-Kilkenny where it might have become a political issue.  Over the years, politics has been inseparable from health legislation.  Politics is accepted in agriculture, in external affairs, defence, local government, education.  Why not accept it in health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of the Fine Gael Party in 1946 was quite right when they threw out the rather totalitarian Bill of that time.  They were right to do that. They took a political stand at that time and they had every right to take that stand.  In fact, on that occasion, they were right to take that particular stand. In 1947, they opposed the 1947 Health Act.  They took a political stand. <Col N="1241" /> I am not quarrelling.  They took a stand and they opposed the free, no means test principle of the mother and child scheme in 1951.  Then they opposed the 1953 Health Act, another political stand.  I do not understand how an intelligent man can rationalise this suggestion of taking politics out of health.</P>
    <P>We have in this House Deputy O'Higgins, with his particular attitude to health which differs from the Minister's attitude which I consider is now a very conservative attitude on health matters.  Both of those differ from the attitude held by the Labour Party who believe in the insurance scheme in health matters.  The three differ from my attitude, which is that the State must accept responsibility for health without contribution from the beneficiary of the health service.  Even in this House we have four different political attitudes and they are all perfectly sound.  We all have a right to hold them and to try to persuade other people we are right.</P>
    <P>It is absurd that we should now take politics out of health legislation.  It is completely unnecessary and most undesirable. When we consider Aneurin Bevan's proposals in his great Health Act, we remember that there was great conflict of opinion and great opposition to that legislation.  Because they were socialist proposals, because they were revolutionary proposals, and because they were socialist ideas, they were opposed by the Tories.  I believe politics will continue to enter into the discussion of health matters.</P>
    <P>I was interested also in the views of Deputy O'Higgins on the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  I would have been very interested to hear the views of the Minister for Health on this scheme.  I am glad Deputy O'Higgins has broken away from the older idea that Fine Gael appear to have had on these matters and that he made a plea for some change in the dispensary service.  I shall deal with that later but his adherence to this belief in the insurance principle is another question I should like to take up.</P>
    <P>I was particularly amused at the attitude of both Deputy O'Higgins and <Col N="1242" /> the Minister for Health on this question of insurance.  Whether in relation to health legislation or social legislation, these are people who, from what I have heard them saying over the years, would appear to be very strongly opposed to all socialist thinking because they feel it brings about an undesirable interference by the State in the life of the individual.  Yet we had Deputy O'Higgins saying that voluntary health insurance was intended to help a person stand on his own two feet, not to have his hand out seeking State assistance, to teach him to join with others to help himself.</P>
    <P>As a socialist I do not accept that it is any function of the State to teach a man to be a man, to have a stiff upper lip or to stand on his own two feet.  I do not think it is any part of the function of a Department of State to take this patronising attitude or to educate people by this kind of legislation. That is the function of our educational system.  This independence of thought and this sense of responsibility is something we should have absorbed from living in our society, from our environment, and I do not think any Minister should design legislation in order to inculcate these qualities.  I do not think it would serve that purpose but even if it did, it is not desirable.  The curious thing is that I as a socialist do not believe the State has this right and the non-socialists seem to want it in order to strengthen the moral fibre of the people.  That service should be made available to everybody from State funds and there should be no need for people to make any direct contribution to voluntary health insurance.</P>
    <P>I have never understood this business of making contributions.  Apparently we accept that it does not do a parent any harm to have his child given what we call a free primary education, that it does not do the parent any harm to be given children's allowances. There are grants given to people for house building; there are a tremendous number of people such as farmers, industrialists, hoteliers and others getting grants and nobody seems to worry about their moral fibre at all or insist that they should make a weekly or monthly contribution so that they <Col N="1243" /> would benefit.  I do not understand the Labour Party's insistence on the necessity for an insurance scheme on that basis for reasons I shall give later in greater detail.  I do not think it is necessary.</P>
    <P>In this insistence on the individual contributing which has become very popular here, whether in relation to the social legislation passed yesterday or the voluntary health insurance scheme, we seem to forget the composition of modern democratic society. When I used to talk about free, no means test health services, my opponents were very quick to tell me there was no such thing as a free health service. Of course they were right.  What they meant was that the health service was paid for by the beneficiaries in the form of rates or in the form of direct taxation or indirect taxation in various ways, on beer, tobacco, cigarettes, bread, butter, tea and so on.</P>
    <P>I cannot see therefore why people are so concerned to collect not only the individual's contribution in the form of rates or income tax or in the form of indirect taxation but also a fourth contribution for insurance paid weekly or monthly or whatever way it may be.  You must set up a separate bureaucracy for the computations of the amounts involved and the amounts that must be paid by different families.  In that way, you duplicate a service which is already efficiently carried out by the Minister for Finance in his Budgetary policy.  I should like the Minister to consider that point.  I should like Deputy O'Higgins to consider it also but in his enthusiasm for these insurance schemes I should dislike him to get an over-enthusiastic affection for this idea of a voluntary health insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that it is a relatively tiny scheme involving 80,000 people out of a population of 2,800,000 or thereabouts.  Because it has got to be, by law, financially sound and because it has got to pay its way, it simply cannot give the services the people want.  That disability has nothing whatsoever to do with inefficiency in administration.  It can only give a limited cover to a limited <Col N="1244" /> number of people.  It does not cover the person who has a chronic illness, as Deputy Dillon pointed out.  Such a person cannot get cover for the illness from which he is actually suffering. The period is limited.  The drugs are limited, and so on.  The scheme must have its limitations.  While there are 80,000 members, if, tomorrow, a no means test free health service were put at the disposal of the people, we would have an opportunity of seeing how many would remain in the voluntary health insurance scheme.  Not one of them would remain.  When the free, no means test, tuberculosis scheme came into operation, it put an end to private practice in tuberculosis, and a very good thing, too.</P>
    <P>While the voluntary health insurance scheme serves its purpose by providing a very inadequate health service, it is certainly not the pattern we should accept for the future.  It is not a desirable pattern for the future. There is a wide disparity as between the voluntary health insurance scheme and compulsory insurance.  Compulsory insurance is acceptable, though I do not understand why; but compulsory insurance is quite a different thing from voluntary health insurance.  The compulsory scheme could, of course, be more encompassing. It could give more facilities.  It would create the necessity for making this individual contribution, and that is something in which I cannot see the sense.  But compulsory insurance is a very different principle from voluntary health insurance and it could not provide anything like the same quality service that could be given under a comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>Dispensary services were discussed here.  It was debated as to whether these services could be improved in some way to make them more acceptable and more efficient.  My attitude was that I wanted to see the dispensary service go altogether.  That is why I was so pleased with the mother and child provisions in the 1947 Health Act because I think they would have finished the dispensary system.  Indeed, it was for that reason I made no attempt to replace dispensaries at that time because I hoped to see an end to the whole dispensary system.  I think <Col N="1245" /> it is a very bad system.  I do not agree with Deputy O'Higgins that the system could be amended, or improved, or perfected in any way so as to make it a modern health service which would give to our people the level of service they expect and which, I think, they will insist on having within the next 10 or 15 years.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins on one point, namely, the lack of free choice.  It is outrageous that there should not be a free choice of doctor.  The whole system, as he pointed out, stems from the 1853 Act. It was designed for a segregated society.  You had the wealthy, on the one hand, and the paupers on the other.  The service was designed for the &ldquo;paupers&rdquo; at the lowest level at which it could be designed.  I disagree with the Minister when he says the Act has been in operation for only four years and we must give it more time.  I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that the Act has been in operation for the past 100 years.  It is grossly inadequate. It has failed completely to provide our people with a proper health service.  The figures quoted by Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;£1 per head with 16/- going in salaries and 4/- in drugs&mdash;seems to me to be a short answer to Deputy Dillon who asked what is the cause of the extraordinary difference between the figures for maternal mortality here and the figures in Great Britain.  That is the answer.</P>

      <P>It is quite shocking that that figure of 4/- here compares with 22/- in the North and 25/- in Great Britain.  It is quite clear that the vast majority of our people who are compelled to avail of the dispensary service have been denied the benefit of the great scientific advances made in <Col N="1246" /> modern chemico-therapeutic drugs and medicines, drugs which have revolutionised medical practice in other countries, such as Great Britain, Sweden, Denmark and so on.  In these countries, the people have free access to these drugs.  Here, the majority of our people are denied them.  As far as they are concerned, we are living in the pre-war age.  Whatever the dispensary service may have been intended to do, it is simply not doing its job.</P>
      <P>I was interested in a speech of the Minister's a little while ago in which he seemed to be genuinely puzzled because he was spending a tremendous amount of money on the dispensary services and yet there seemed to be grave dissatisfaction with those services. I would ask the Minister to throw his mind back to his own decision in 1947 to scrap the dispensary services.  He must have had a very good reason for that decision at that time.  I know one of the reasons most present to my mind are the figures which were taken in, I think, 1946, showing the difference in the death rate at different economic levels.  At the highest level, the death rate was 16 per 1,000; at the lowest level, the manual worker, the death rate was 133 per 1,000.</P>
      <P>That is just one figure and I do not intend to try to adduce too much from it, but it strikes me as fairly substantial evidence of the great disparity that must exist as between the standard and quality of service which the people with money can pay for, and get, and the standard and quality of the dispensary service on which those who cannot afford to pay have to depend. Obviously there has been a failure on the part of that service to provide adequately for those people.</P>
