    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether any final decision has been taken by the Government that the name of what was formerly known as the Six Counties must or shall be officially described as Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether the Government have given any consideration to or arrived at any decision on the question of giving formal or official recognition to the Government in Northern Ireland, with its consequent implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, to take Questions No. 1 and No. 2 together.</P>
      <P>The answer to both questions is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view, however, of recent Press speculations as to the attitude of the <Col N="2" /> Government in this connection, I think it is desirable to make a fuller statement.</P>
    <P>We do not recognise the partitioning of the country as a just or durable arrangement.  Our purpose is to bring about a situation in which the essential unity of the Irish people will be restored and expressed in the country's political institutions.</P>
    <P>Proposals put forward by the Government of the Republic in 1921 dealt with these matters.  These proposals were to the effect that, in the event of the then existing Legislature in Northern Ireland accepting its position under an Irish National Parliament, that Legislature would be confirmed in its existing powers&mdash;in other words, that the Parliament and Government there should continue to function and to exercise the powers they already possessed, while the powers exercised in relation to that area by the British Parliament would <Col N="3" /> be transferred to an all-Ireland Parliament.</P>
    <P>On many occasions since then the possibility of a settlement of the Partition issue on these lines, subject to safeguards for the nationalist minority there, has been re-stated, and I have done so again in recent months.</P>
    <P>In so far as such an arrangement would involve the continuance of a separate Parliament with its existing powers and functions in the North-East&mdash;which area would also, of course, be represented in an all-Ireland Parliament&mdash;the title &ldquo;The Parliament of Northern Ireland&rdquo;, notwithstanding its geographical inaccuracy, would not, in my opinion, if there was a desire to retain it, raise any insuperable difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach must be aware that it has been the consistent policy for some 40 years of his predecessor to describe the present Government in Northern Ireland as the Government of the six North Eastern Counties.  Recently Government spokesmen have adopted the formula &ldquo;Northern Ireland Government&rdquo;. Does he propose to continue the description &ldquo;Government of the Six North Eastern Counties&rdquo; or &ldquo;Northern Ireland Government&rdquo; in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the same question as is on the Order Paper, which I have answered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the weekend the Taoiseach gave a third description, that is, &ldquo;the North-Eastern part of Ireland.&rdquo;  Is that to be a third form of description for the present position in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A very accurate geographical description.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  We are dealing with the description of what calls itself a State.  Would the Taoiseach say what is to be the official designation of this part of Ireland in future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne  Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Dr. Browne</b> asked the Taoiseach whether his suggested scheme or plan for the establishment of a free trade area for all Ireland was discussed with the British Government either during the talks leading up to the recent trade agreement or at any other time; what the attitude of the British Government was to these proposals; and, if such discussions have not taken place, whether he proposes to take steps to initiate such discussions in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Question is in the negative.</P>
      <P>The idea, which I have indicated the Government's readiness to consider, of an arrangement that could for convenience or for want of a better term be described as an Irish Free Trade Area, has not been discussed with anyone.  The question of when it might be appropriate or desirable to initiate any discussion of the idea is a matter for consideration in the light of circumstances as they may develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that in the course of his speech here on the Trade Agreement, the Taoiseach stated that the impression was given to him in London that his attitude in regard to free trade between the Six County area and the Twenty-Six Counties was a good idea and that, according to him, it was welcomed by the British Government, would he state whether the impression that was created in his mind was as a result of discussing this matter with representatives of the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a most inaccurate description of what I said here on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it this way to the Taoiseach?  In view of the fact that he has on a number of occasions recently&mdash;and rightly so&mdash; suggested the idea of a free trade area <Col N="5" /> in the Thirty-two Counties and in view of the fact that the Premier of the Six Counties has stated that matters of trade are matters solely for the British Government and not for the Six County Government, would the Taoiseach put this proposition first to the British Government rather than talk in the air as far as the Six County Government is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the question as to when or in what manner discussion of ideas of that kind can best be initiated is one to be decided in the light of circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is his intention to seek membership of either of the trade groups in Europe; and, if so, if he will give prior notice of such intention to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have not, so far, taken any decision on the subject of the relationship between this country and the European Economic Community or the European Free Trade Association.</P>
      <P>I shall naturally ensure that the Dáil will be kept informed, as heretofore, of all major developments in the field of trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government come to any decision to seek membership of either of the trade groups while the Dáil is in recess, I take it the Dáil will be convened to give Deputies an opportunity of discussing the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No agreement of that kind could be made without the concurrence of the Dáil.  I doubt if this is a matter which it is possible to deal with adequately by way of reply to Supplementary Questions here.  The Rome Treaty and Stockholm Convention both provided for association as well as for full membership of other countries and if any question of participating in either of these agreements should arise at any time I should think association rather than membership would be of interest to us.  As Deputies are no doubt aware, discussions are proceeding now as to the possibility of some arrangement between these two groups of nations and it would be a matter for us to <Col N="7" /> consider the extent to which we would want to participate in or be associated with any such arrangement if it was in fact agreed.  That is the aspect of this question which is receiving attention at the present time and in connection with which a meeting was held in Paris within the last ten days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from what the Taoiseach has said now and from what he said previously that before any irrevocable decision is taken by the Government, either in relation to membership or association, he will provide an opportunity for a discussion in this House as to the best course for the country as a whole to take?  Everybody wants to be helpful and the Government would be well advised to get the benefit of the views of the House so that the subsequent decision will not be regarded as a Party decision but as a national decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been at pains since this matter started to keep the House and the public informed of developments and I think it true to say that, by and large, Irish public opinion is better informed in these affairs than is the case in many West European countries.  No agreement could be made without the concurrence of the House and, in any event, it is extremely improbable that any situation requiring early decision by the Government will arise during the recess or perhaps even this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it then the Taoiseach will take the House into his confidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree it might be more appropriate if he would consider making statements on Government policy in relation to this matter in Dáil Éireann rather than at Shannon Airport, as when authoritative statements on Government policy are made outside the House it sometimes creates the impression that possibly the Taoiseach wishes to bypass the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is <Col N="8" /> not unaware, I am sure, that I made a full statement on this matter only a short while ago and apart from referring to recent events I said nothing as regards Government policy at Shannon Airport I have not already said here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the statement of the Minister for Transport and Power at the Annual Meeting in Athlone of the National Library Association of Ireland that emigration would be a permanent feature of Irish life, that there was an Irish empire abroad and that the free world was the boundary of Ireland represents Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that in the speech to which the Deputy refers the Minister for Transport and Power did not purport to state policy on any subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Taoiseach has read the speech of this Minister.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if a road worker employed by a local authority who is entitled to superannuation on retirement will also be entitled to receive the old age pension under the terms of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1960; and if both pensions may be drawn in full.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that until the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1960, becomes law and the necessary regulations are made thereunder, it is not possible to say whether any person or class of persons will be entitled to an old age (contributory) pension.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, however, that the new pension will be paid without a means test and accordingly a person entitled to the pension will receive it in full even if he is receiving pension or superannuation arising from his employment.</P>
      <P>Difficulties may arise for those employers and workers obliged to contribute to the new pension scheme who may be parties to existing pension schemes.  To help in resolving these difficulties, the Bill includes a provision to permit the existing schemes to be adjusted in connection with the introduction of old age (contributory) pensions.  The adjustment may be effected by way of agreement between the parties concerned or by regulations made by the appropriate Minister after consideration of representations by those affected.  The appropriate Minister in relation to local authority road workers will be the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>Appointments to the grade of usher on the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas are made from the messenger grades in the Civil Service.  Applicants must be within the age limits of 30 to 50 years and have had not less than ten years' service in one or other of the grades mentioned. Appointments are made on the basis of <Col N="13" /> the report of an Inter-Departmental Interview Board which assesses the standard of education, experience and general suitability of the applicants.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1938 appointments to this grade were dealt with under Section 6 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924.  From 1938-1955 appointments were made by means of limited competitions conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners to meet the requirements of the Civil Service Regulation Acts governing established appointments.</P>
      <P>Since 1955 as the competition was confined to established personnel the normal Inter-Departmental promotion competition system has been followed.</P>

    <P>23.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether his attention has been drawn to the losses sustained by farmers as a result of livestock being killed by lightning; and whether he will consider drafting a scheme to provide an insurance fund to cover all farmers against this catastrophe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="20" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently seen reports of cases in which some livestock were killed by lightning.  The question of an insurance scheme to cover the various diseases and other risks of livestock has been the subject of much consideration for many years, but, so far, the difficulties involved in devising a satisfactory scheme have not been solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider it a perfectly simple and practicable scheme to ask the county committees of agriculture to raise a rate of one halfpenny for one year to allow a fund to be administered, either by himself or by the central body of the county committees, in the confident anticipation that the proceeds of that very small rate would provide a sum which, if invested, would meet all the charges which would come in course of payment and protect individual farmers from crippling losses against which there is no other means of protection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible to suggest all forms and types of schemes here by way of Supplementary Question, but I would imagine that in the 50 or almost 60 odd years, during which this whole subject has been discussed by many bodies, something would have emerged if this matter were as simple as the Deputy's Supplementary Question would appear to suggest.  It is all very well to say in relation to losses from lightning that we should have a scheme administered through the county committees of agriculture, but that would mean, as the Deputy has suggested, an additional rate.  The loss to stock owners from lightning is not considerable when compared to other losses and, if one were to think in terms of an insurance scheme, in my view it should be a scheme that should be all embracive.  The quotations which it is possible to get to cover risk from fire and lightning I believe would not prove attractive to herd owners, if they were to be asked to participate in any insurance scheme of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is a classic example of the best being the enemy of the good?  Of course, it would be <Col N="21" /> desirable to insure against all forms of animal mortality but, as the Minister knows, that is quite impracticable, but here is one form of catastrophe that can cripple one small farmer if his stock should be struck.  The fund requisite to protect that individual, from the national point of view, would be microscopic.  One levy of a halfpenny would, perhaps, meet the whole thing.  Perhaps, the Minister would consider that restrictive matter with a view to reform now, pending gradual reform hereafter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well for the Minister and the Department to consider this but there are many rural organisations that are naturally and genuinely interested in this problem. If consideration is to be given to a problem of this nature then one would think and expect that that consideration should first come from those who have, as I indicated, been discussing this problem for a long time.  I admit that in some isolated cases losses from lightning can be heavy for a limited number of individuals but, looking back on the records I have, the total losses are not great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But for the individual they are disastrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, as I say, we have many rural organisations now and I suppose that sometimes they do not have such a terrible lot of work to do.  If consideration is to be given to such a subject as that, I would expect they should initially run over the course and see what sort of machinery or scheme they could devise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister even consider submitting the problem I have now put to him to these rural organisations, if he feels himself incompetent to act without their prior sanction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>No allowances in respect of private cars or other private motor transport are paid to any employees in my Department in respect of travel between Shannon Airport and Ennis.  The question of loss to C.I.E. arising from the payment of travel <Col N="24" /> allowances between Shannon Airport and Ennis does not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>The times of the buses between Ennis and the Airport are designed to cater for the various shift-times worked by staff at the Airport.  The single fare for the journey by Córas Iompair Éireann transport between the Airport and Ennis is 3s. 10d.</P>

The Justices give an order for £5 and that is the cause of the discontent among a lot of the tenants.  I shall raise this in more detail in the debate on the Vote for the Minister's Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether in view of the possible danger to citizens caused by trailers becoming detached from motor vehicles to which they are coupled he will take steps to ensure that such trailers are also equipped with connecting chains as a precaution against their becoming detached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant statutory regulations provide that every trailer and all its parts and accessories must at all times be in such condition that, so far as can reasonably be foreseen, no danger is caused or is likely to be <Col N="28" /> caused, to persons or property.  It is for each operator to ensure that any trailer used by him fully complies with this provision; otherwise he is liable to prosecution by the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>I may add that, concurrently with the review of Road Traffic legislation, the various statutory regulations on road traffic will be reviewed also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether the present statutory requirements include the necessity for attaching chains in case a trailer becomes uncoupled so as to enable the chain to hold the trailer until the emergency has been surmounted, or is it possible for a person to operate a trailer behind a motor vehicle by a coupling only, no chains being used as an extra precaution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether he is aware that a large State undertaking recently put a very large motor vehicle on the road with a very heavy trailer, in which, I was assured, there were 50 tons of metal, with a single coupling on it?  The coupling broke away and the trailer careered down a hill in a village and, within my own sight, two children had a marvellous escape from instantaneous death.  Would the Minister not consider now, in the interest of human life, to require all those who use such vehicles to take the same precautions as the English do to compel the fitting of chains as an emergency measure in such cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as that aspect is concerned, as I have indicated to the Deputy, that and any other matters of this nature are under consideration for inclusion in any new regulations or, possibly, inclusion in some way in the road traffic legislation.  In the meantime, let it be the fixing of chains or any other additional attachment the Deputy or anyone else may feel is necessary in the interests of safety, all those things imply that proper care is not being taken.  The law at the moment is such that the <Col N="29" /> operator of such a vehicle is liable and may be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister does he see much consolation for bereaved parents to know that the Guards will have the privilege of prosecuting the operator of such a vehicle when two children may have been sheared to death because of the unsatisfactory manner in which the trailer was attached to the vehicle? Would the Minister cause some inquiries to be made from the E.S.B. to ascertain what protective measures they employ in such circumstances?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that the Returning Officer in the County Borough of Dublin issued in connection with the forthcoming elections a list of polling stations showing that three thousand one hundred and fifty-one people in Ballyfermot should vote in polling stations in a building which has not yet been erected; if he will say how the mistake arose; and if he will take special steps to ensure that the voters affected are individually notified that they should vote in the De la Salle National Schools, Ballyfermot Road, and not in the place originally and incorrectly announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the returning officer for Dublin county borough agreed to facilitate certain organisations and prospective candidates who had requested advance information concerning probable polling places by giving them details from the list of polling places which he was preparing.  The fact that the list was provisional was made clear to the persons so facilitated.  The list included the name of St. Michael's National School, Bóthar Drum Finn, Ballyfermot, which has not yet been completed. The list was not published generally or issued to the public by the returning officer.  When it became known that the school would not be available, the returning officer immediately notified the organisations and persons to whom the provisional list had been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> I understand that in addition to the newspaper publicity, of which the Deputy is doubtless aware, and to the notification served on each candidate, the returning officer has arranged for the wide display of the statutory notice indicating the situation of polling stations and the electors who are entitled to vote at each station. This notice indicates that electors who had been provisionally listed under St. Michael's National School shall vote, as in previous elections, at the De la Salle National Schools, Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the conduct of local elections are, under statute, a matter for the returning officer and I am satisfied that my intervention is not called for in the present case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that as late as last Saturday many of the voters in the area affected were informed by written notice from one of the candidates that they should vote at the non-existent schools in Bothar Drum Finn?  Is the Minister further aware that far from the building being completed it is scarcely started, and would the Minister kindly indicate to the House who or what organisation was responsible for the misleading information which caused and is still causing people to be informed that they are to vote in a school which does not exist?</P>

Can the Minister say if he has any responsibility for the manner in which a candidate makes a mess of his election campaign?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is probably aware that I am quite aware of what is going on.  Every tenant of the scheme has been made aware by these notices all over the scheme.  As a matter of fact, the Returning Officer has made it alphabetical to make it easier for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And may I ask the Minister would he kindly consider giving an answer to the supplementary question I have asked him?

If there has been a mistake made as to the polling place by anybody as a result of a mistake originally made in a preliminary publication by the Returning Officer, would the Minister consider asking the appropriate authority to have a notice displayed on this site directing anyone who may have been misled to proceed to where the poll is, in fact, taking place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

Does he deny that his Department promised this man a supply of water as far back as 1955; does he remember that anybody in the area could have told him that there was no suitable supply of water in the area where the Land Commission were looking for it; that at one stage the Land Commission accepted this fact and tried to get water for him from the Poulaphouca Lakes or from Russborough?  Is the Minister aware of the fact that there is water on this very holding which would supply the three allottees but, because of the monumental stupidity with which the Land Commission handled the matter, the position now is that two people have more water than they want and that the third cannot get water?  Is the Minister aware that approximately £1,000 of the taxpayers' money has been spent and that there is still no water for this man?</P>

      <P>Some changes have been made in motor vehicles duties, some very small changes, and it was to obviate the necessity for bringing in a special Bill that I undertook to bring them in in the Finance Bill on behalf of the Minister for Local Government. I think I might say a few words on each subsection.  Subsection I refers to tricycles, some of which are now being made in this country with two wheels close together.  There is some definition under the Acts but fortunately this type of vehicle is not properly <Col N="41" /> covered and, for road traffic purposes, it is proposed that these tricycles can be classed as tricycles and not as four-wheeled vehicles.</P>
      <P>The second subsection proposes to change the ending of the first quarter from the 25th March to the last day of March.  That will make the four quarters of equal length.  At present, I think there are ten days' difference between the first quarter and the second quarter.  The change was made many years ago and was regarded at the time as being temporary because Easter occurred between the 25th and 31st March that year, and evidently it was intended to give people an opportunity of bringing their cars out taxed for the second quarter for Easter. Although at the time it was regarded as temporary, it has remained there ever since.</P>
      <P>Subsection 3 deals with the point that has been raised, I believe, in some cases that a vehicle standing on the road is not in use and, therefore, a charge that the vehicle is unlicensed or any other charge could not be sustained. Up to this it has been interpreted that the vehicle is in use when standing on the road, but evidently some doubts now arise in that connection. This is intended to make sure that vehicles standing on the public highway are in fact regarded as in use.</P>

      <P>Subsection 4 deals with invalid-propelled vehicles which, up to this, were always under 5 cwt., but there is some new type or make recently introduced which is between 5 cwt. and 6 cwt. and the regulation is being altered to allow these new vehicles to come under the very low taxation level applicable to these vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> Subsection 5 deals with vehicles which are used as machines such as bulldozers or contrivances of that kind which are not detachable.  They have a low tax rate and this is intended to strengthen the law in respect of them, so that the low-level taxation cannot be claimed where a machine is put on to a lorry where the lorry was not constructed purposely for that job. These are the main points.  They are all very minor ones.</P>

      <P>I am always very suspicious when the Department of Local Government asks the Department of Finance to do something. Then, <i>prima facie</i>, there must be some catch in it.  The Minister started off by saying that subsection (1) meant that a tricycle was a vehicle with three wheels and that it had not got four wheels.  That is an epoch-making discovery. But may I infer, from the procedure point of view, that when this Resolution is reported, if it is ever reported, there will be an amendment to the Finance Bill moved by the Minister based on these Financial Resolutions, or will that be taken separately?  Will we be recommitted <Col N="43" /> for that or what is the procedure for the discussion of the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not always easy to explain technical matters, but I have a constitutional horror of consenting to legislation which I am obliged to confess I do not understand.  I do not understand paragraph 5.  I do not even understand what kind of thing we are legislating about.  I have never seen a workshop put on a lorry and I do not know what the meaning of that operation is.  I can understand putting a machine on a lorry.  I can understand putting a contrivance or an implement on a lorry, but it is more astonishing when I am told that the workshop must be permanently attached to the lorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there a Deputy in the House who has any clear vision of what a workshop, permanently attached, can be doing on a lorry?  I imagine the Minister must have some more copious information on the subject somewhere <Col N="44" /> in his files.  Perhaps he could tell us if there are any notorious instances of workshops permanently attached to lorries which could bring to our mind a true picture of paragraph 5 of this Financial Resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

This amendment is brought in to prevent its becoming possible for a person to put such a thing as a crane into an ordinary lorry and claim, for that reason, that the lorry should be allowed the lower rate of duty.  It was intended that this lower rate of duty was to cover the vehicle which was capable of carrying goods in the ordinary way but could never be used for the purpose of taking a workshop or a repair tower or the crane, permanently attached to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present session to charge and impose certain duties of customs and inland revenue (including excise), to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provisions in connection with finance, it is expedient to authorise as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (a)  to redeem borrowings, and interest thereon, in respect of capital services, there shall be charged annually on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof a sum of £991,095 in the twenty-nine successive financial years and a sum of £951,035 in the thirty successive financial <Col N="45" /> years commencing in each case with the financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, and</P>
    <P>(b)  relief may, where necessary, be given by way of repayment in relation to any section of the said Act which provides for considering, for the purposes of any duties, a person to be the child of a married couple born to them in lawful wedlock and not to be the child of any other person. </P>
    <P>This Resolution will not give so much trouble.  There are two points which must be borne in mind in relation to it.  First of all, paragraph (a) is necessary because of the charge on public funds under Section 7, and paragraph (b) is necessary under Section 38 of the Bill which provides for repayment of duty where duty has already been paid.  This, as it were, is the adoption clause which, if agreed to by the Oireachtas, will mean in some cases that application can be made for the refund of succession, legacy, or stamp duty and, in some cases, even of customs duty.  A person who is left a legacy outside the country, which includes goods that have been brought in from outside, is liable to a different rate of duty because of the relationship he has to the deceased person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to raise any point in relation to the Resolution itself, but this is a general Resolution for the whole Bill so it is relevant to discuss the size of the bill which we will be asked to consider. The effect is to raise taxation for the purpose of meeting a bill, excluding the Road Fund payments, of £130 million.  If one takes in the Road Fund payments as well, the total bill is over £136 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seem to remember Deputies on the other side of the House saying not so very long ago that under no circumstances whatever must the amount that must be expended from public moneys be allowed to increase.  Look at the figures.  At that time the amount that was being paid out, and which can now be compared with £130 million, was £114½ million.  This Bill represents £15½ million more of broken <Col N="46" /> promises that we are now facing. When one considers the size of the bill that the Minister for Finance is introducing here now, it is not surprising that he adverted purely to the last two particular instances of the Money Resolutions rather than to the General Resolution and its purposes.  It seems to me that the hope is that if one slides quickly over the amount that is involved people will not understand and will not appreciate how much is being extracted from them.</P>
    <P>It does not require very great calculation to work out what £130,000,000 is per head for 3,000,000 people.  To put it another way, in 1956-57, the amount that was expended on Central Fund Services was £17,351,000 and on non-capital supply services £97,220,000, which makes a total of £114,571,000.  In the current year the Minister after deducting Road Fund payments and the allowance that he has made for arrears of estimation is looking for £130,633,000.  That is £16,000,000&mdash;I said £15,500,000 but it is actually £16,000,000&mdash;more that he is looking for in this year to meet the cost of the various services.  The costs of those services have gone up by £16,000,00.</P>
    <P>Let me say at once in case the Minister might think that I was playing on any factor about levies and capital purposes that I deliberately did not take receipts; I took expenditure.  An expenditure of £16,000,000 more this year for 3,000,000 people is something over £5 a head, man, woman and child, more that the people are having collected out of their pockets for the privilege of having a Fianna Fáil Government in these three years.  That is bad enough but when one considers it against the background of the speeches that were made in 1956 and the early part of 1957 and remembers that we have had nothing from any Minister since apologising for the manner in which they misled the people at that time, it makes it far worse.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister today whether the taxpayers can expect any possibility of the total bill doing anything other than rise year after year.  It has risen steadily and it has now got to the point where it is <Col N="47" /> at £130,000,00 for a small country of 3,000,000 people.  Where is it going to end?  When are we going to reach the situation that we will be able to look hopefully?  Everybody knows it is not merely the general taxpayer's burden that is increasing year after year here but that local authorities are finding exactly the same thing, that local authority rates are going up. When one is considering the burden of taxation it is appropriate to consider not merely the burden of Central Government taxation but the burden of local government taxation.  Local government taxation has gone up by almost £1 per head in the last three years.  It means that there is an increase in total taxation of £6 a head in three years.  I do not think that is something with which any Minister should be satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I would be in order in answering the Deputy because this Resolution is a Money Resolution.  It is dealing only with money taken from the Exchequer, authorising me to pay from the Exchequer under the two items referred to here which I have already mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interfere with the ruling of the Chair. Financial Resolutions deal with what the Deputy has been speaking about, that is, raising of taxation.  I am quite sure that I have never expressed the opinion that we could carry on on the same level of income that we have always had.  We have in the past, I know, expressed the opinion very, very emphatically that the country cannot bear a further level of taxation and, taking it by and large, in the last three or four years, while we have reduced some taxes and increased others, taxes have remained more or less as they were.  It is obvious that we have to meet increasing costs for debt and in the way of remuneration and as long as our national income can give us <Col N="48" /> more income from the present taxation there is no Minister for Finance who can afford to say that he can do without that as time goes on.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment very briefly on this section.  This year it is, as usual, re-enacting the legislation at present in force for yet a further year.  Our tax code, which we are now re-enacting, goes back almost 150 years and, as far as I can recall, we are reintroducing these provisions for the 108th or 109th year.  One could speak on it at length but I do not propose to do so.  I wish primarily to avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister what consideration has been given to the Second Report of the Commission on Income Taxation which was furnished to him a year ago and published last October.</P>
      <P>One of the peculiar provisions which we are re-enacting here is the archaic and obsolete Schedule A taxation.  The Second Report of the Commission recommended the virtual abolition of Schedule A taxation and recommended the abolition of Schedule A taxation as applied to owner-occupiers of their own dwellings where the valuation did not exceed £30.  That was a unanimous recommendation of the Commission. We are entitled to ask the Minister whether the Government have considered that report and whether or not they have accepted it.  Many people are very disappointed that this Bill makes no concession to the independent occupiers of their own homes. Our whole tax code is unsuited to this country.  It is based on obsolete economics and there is no part of it more absurd than Schedule A taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All pre-Victorian economists had a theory that we derive a notional income from anything we own even though there is no cash income.  That is crackpot economics.  Schedule A taxation weighs very heavily on a section <Col N="49" /> of the community who are very sorely pressed and for whom it is desirable for social reasons to provide every possible concession and incentive.  The more independent home owners there are the more stable will be our economy. It is desirable from every point of view to encourage people to own their own homes.  The position now is that a young couple may marry and suffer considerable disadvantages in order to acquire and own their own home by making heavy mortgage payments and paying a heavy rate of interest.  The State then tells them they have a cash income from their ownership of that home and assesses them to taxation accordingly.  That is extremely unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The yield of Schedule A tax is something like £1,500,000 on paper.  That is a purely fictitious figure because many Schedule A taxpayers are given relief under Schedule D in respect of their annual valuation and what is gained on the swings is lost on the roundabouts.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question by Deputy Sweetman some time ago the Minister said that owner-occupiers were paying £150,000 taxation under Schedule A.  The time has come for the Government seriously to consider abolishing this penal tax.</P>
    <P>Again we are re-enacting all the legislation in force relating to the taxation of salary earners and wage earners.  In a few months' time the scheme of P.A.Y.E. will come into operation.  We on this side have considerable misgiving about that scheme.  Personally, I am convinced that when the new scheme comes into force there will be a great outcry from many people not previously assessed to tax.</P>
    <P>Our tax code is extremely inequitable. It is an old maxim of British law that equity is a stranger to income tax.  I do not think we should accept that position.  There is a very strong obligation on us to make our tax code equitable.  I am not satisfied that the Minister is fulfilling that obligation.  Three or four years ago, when the Minister made certain concessions to industry, he announced that in spite of the fact that a Commission was sitting he was prepared <Col N="50" /> to consider proposals for tax reform. To give credit where it is due, he has brought in some, but I wish to emphasise that there is no section of the community more sorely pressed than salary earners and wage earners. There is no section more inequitably treated in regard to income tax.  They are assessed to 20/- in the £.  They have no way of avoiding income tax and their employers are forced to act as collectors.</P>
    <P>Amendment 2 which Deputy Sweetman has tabled is an effort to insert more equitable provisions into the legislation relating to the taxation of wage and salary earners, but I shall have more to say on the matter when that amendment comes before us.</P>
    <P>According to the latest report of the Revenue Commissioners, Schedule E taxpayers are contributing far more than they should to our tax revenue and the amount of money being raised from salary and wage earners is yearly increasing.  In the latest report of the Revenue Commissioners, that for the year ended 31st March, 1959, it was disclosed that the actual income assessed to tax under Schedule E amounted to £105,000,000.  That is the actual income, not the yield of the tax.  The income assessed to tax for that year, 1959, increased by five per cent over the previous year.  That is a position which did not apply to any of the other tax schedules.  The income assessed under Schedule D declined and so did that of Schedule C; of course Schedule B income declined and Schedule A income increased slightly.</P>
    <P>The Minister in introducing P.A.Y.E. told us that by reason of the fact that Schedule E tax would be in the future related to the current year rather than the previous year as under the old system, he expected in a normal year an increased yield of £1,000,000.  I am convinced that when P.A.Y.E. comes into force the Minister will gain much more than he has told us he will gain.  More people would be drawn into the tax net than is generally expected.  Many people welcome P.A.Y.E. on that account.  They say that heretofore certain types of workers have been getting away with too much. <Col N="51" /> I do not accept that view.  It is extremely unfair to turn the screw tighter on the wage earner when others are being left out of the tax framework.</P>
    <P>The solution of the problem is, of course, an appreciation of the fact that the old concept of income tax is not properly suited to this country.  In addition to asking the Minister whether or not the Government are accepting the second report of the Income Tax Commission, I should like him to tell us at this stage, if he can, a little more about the more recent report which has not yet been published.  I refer to the report dealing with the question of the suitability of income tax to this country.  It is a matter upon which the public at large and this House in particular should be very well informed.</P>

      <P>With regard to the second report of the Commission, I mentioned here recently that they recommended, first of all, that there should be exemption from income tax in the case of all owner occupied dwellings under £30 valuation.  I have made no recommendation on that to the Government so far.  I am very doubtful as to what recommendation I will make.  There are many arguments for and against.  I am not by any means convinced that it is a recommendation which should be accepted.  At the same time, I am not saying that I have objected to the proposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a very big figure.  I think that would be about right.  The second recommendation was that surtax should be dealt with by the same officer of the Revenue Commissioners who deals with income tax.  I am very attracted to that proposition and I think we shall be able to implement the recommendation within a reasonable time.  Deputies are aware that the Revenue Commissioners have been very busy working on P.A.Y.E. and have not had very much lime to devote to this proposal.  I <Col N="52" /> think that reform will come in some form or other, though perhaps not exactly in the form recommended by the Commission.</P>
      <P>I do not think I can usefully give any information with regard to the third report.  I have authorised its printing.  As soon as it is printed it will be circulated to Deputies.  It would be well that Deputies should study it &mdash;it is a fairly comprehensive report&mdash; before we have any discussion here on the merits or demerits of the recommendations made.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot make any promise to the Deputy that there will be a very big relief under Schedule E, as things stand at the moment.  I am quite prepared to agree that income tax under Schedule E is too high.  The question is when can we deal with the problem.  Any Minister for Finance would be glad to deal with the problem if he were in a position to do so.</P>

I said on the Second Stage that it was an Act passed in the reign of Richard II.  I was wrong.  It was passed in the reign of William and Mary.  I trust something will be done to ensure that any member of this House who happens to be an employer and who will have to collect under the P.A.Y.E. system for the Revenue Commissioners will not be disqualified on that account.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other enactment, American social security payments to persons permanently resident in this country shall not be taken into account in assessing the liability to income tax of such persons.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to this amendment. I happen to have come across a number of cases in my constituency of Irish people coming back from America to spend the autumn and winter of their days in Ireland.  Some of these people are in receipt of social welfare benefits and old age pensions as a result of their work in America and many of them have been subjected <Col N="54" /> to income tax on their American social security benefits and retirement pay. That is very unjust.  I know that in a number of cases, where the matter was tested in the income tax court, it was decided that they would have to pay income tax but the general feeling all around was one of sympathy towards them.  However, the statement was made that it would appear, according to the law at any rate, they must be assessed and must be subject to income tax.  Whether that was originally intended or not is another day's work, but I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider the matter sympathetically because these people are a benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>We are very anxious to get as many dollars as possible in Ireland and the fact that these people are anxious to live in the country and spend their pensions here is one that should be taken into consideration.  We have the benefit of the dollars and the spending power of these people who come back to Ireland and that should be sufficient without taking a second cut from them by subjecting their pensions to income tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the social welfare payments received from America by such persons living here would be classed as pensions and it would be a very serious step to abolish income tax on pensions coming into the country. There are a number of people living here who have pensions from foreign sources, foreign Governments, and so on, and there is no reason in the world why they should not pay income tax. Therefore, it would require a great deal of consideration and preparation before anything could be done to deal with a particular class amongst pensioners in this country.</P>
      <P>We must also remember that we could not, I fear, deal with those by mentioning a certain figure for exemption, to set a certain income under a certain amount.  These payments are sometimes very high, much higher indeed than our social welfare payments here, and to exempt pensions of this kind under a certain limit would not meet the bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My third reason, however, is the most important.  At the moment we <Col N="55" /> are negotiating an amendment of our income tax agreement with the American Government.  I am not sure whether this question will come up for discussion; it may or may not, but I think it would be advisable not to do anything in this direction at the moment.  I should like to see that agreement concluded with the American Government before we would approach the case of these people but I may assure the Deputy that the signing of that agreement will not make it more difficult because I am quite sure that the American Government would be very pleased if we did what he asks.  As I say, I think the signing of the agreement will not make it more difficult to deal with the case of these people and for that reason particularly I would ask of the Deputy not to press the amendment until we are in a position to deal with the matter more objectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

However, in view of the fact that the Minister's statement that this matter can be discussed again throws out some dim hope to those people I shall accept his assurance and withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> Before section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Rule 9 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E contained in the Income Tax Act, 1918 is hereby amended by the substitution of &lsquo;reasonably to incur expenditure for the appropriate performance&rsquo; for &lsquo;to expend money wholly, exclusively, and necessarily in the performance&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This question of the expenses that can be deducted in relation to Schedule E income tax is one that has been tackled for the first time and I must confess that it was only recently, in another connection, that I was brought slap up against the full implications of Rule 9.  Rule 9 of the income tax Act of 1918 states:</P>
    <P>If the holder of an office or employment of profit is necessarily obliged to incur and defray out of the emoluments thereof the expenses of travelling in the performance of the duties of the office or employment, or of keeping and maintaining a horse to enable him to perform the same, or otherwise to expend money wholly, exclusively, and necessarily in the performance of the said duties, there may be deducted from the emoluments to be assessed the expenses so necessarily incurred and defrayed.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment that I suggest is to substitute the words &ldquo;reasonably to incur expenditure&rdquo; for the words at the end &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily.&rdquo;  The wording I have chosen is, of course, the wording that was adopted by the majority in the Cohen Report that was produced in 1955 in Britain.</P>
    <P>The whole basis of the complaint in relation to Schedule E, and in relation to the prohibition on deducting expenses from salaries chargeable to Schedule E, has been that people do not see why it is desirable to have one law for Schedule D and another law for Schedule E.  The provisions of the Income Tax Acts which permit people who own businesses to make certain deductions for income tax purposes are not affected at all by this amendment. Rather, on the contrary, I am <Col N="57" /> trying to bring the position of salary holders on to a par with persons who own businesses themselves.  As I say, it was only recently I came up against this in its stark reality, and I was frankly rather shocked to discover some of the expenses which a person could incur in relation to his job and which he would not be allowed to deduct from the salary he was getting.</P>
    <P>For example, I quote the expenses of a person in a professional position who, if I may use the term, is trying to better himself.  If he wants to better himself, he has to keep abreast of modem tendencies.  Whether it is law, architecture or engineering, he has to buy the books appertaining to those things.  If it is law and if he is not able to go down to read in the Law Library, he has to buy the <i>Law Times.</i>  If he is an employed person he is not allowed against his taxation the cost of buying those journals because it is not absolutely necessary for him to do so, although all of us would agree that it is wise, desirable and reasonable that he should try and better himself in his position.  On the other hand, if the owner of the firm considers that for his purposes it is desirable that he should keep abreast of modem developments, he is entitled to deduct the cost of the provisions of the sort I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It seems to me wholly illogical that there should be one law for, say, a solicitor who is self-employed and a different law for the solicitor that I employ, that there should be one law for the architect who is self-employed and a different law in relation to these expenses for the young architect in his office employed by him.  One of the troubles with which we have been faced in the past has been that there has been too little endeavour by people in any type of employment to educate themselves so as to improve their chances, and not merely improve themselves but improve the general standard in the community.  We have done far too little in the matter of research.  One of the ways in which architects and engineers would be able <Col N="58" /> to keep abreast and to take advantage of research in other countries would be to subscribe to journals of the sort I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Cohen Report dealt with the matter fairly clearly and at some considerable length.  It seems to me that the arguments adduced from paragraph 129 to paragraph 143, while summarising the arguments both for and against the rule, make the case that the existing Rule 9 in the 1918 Act is far too narrow in England.  If it is too narrow in England I want to suggest to the Minister that our circumstances here, where the white-collar worker who wants to improve himself will have a far tougher time, make it even more certain that it is desirable that the rule should be widened here.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has read the Cohen Report.  If he has, he must have been struck by the quotations that were given of the descriptions that had been applied to this rule in the past.  I notice particularly that at one stage it was described as &ldquo;jealously restricted&rdquo;; &ldquo;strictly limited&rdquo;; &ldquo;a very narrow and strict rule&rdquo;; &ldquo;the words are notoriously narrow in their application and notoriously rigid, narrow and restrictive in their operation... stringent and exacting.&rdquo; Those were all very strong words. They were used at one time or other in relation to this.  That report suggests that the use of the word &ldquo;obliged&rdquo; in Rule 9 is defended on the grounds that the subject of tax is income from an office or employment.  That may have been a good answer in 1918, but I do not honestly think in 1960 that it is at all apposite or at all relevant. I think that &ldquo;musty terminology&rdquo; is a much more apt description of that definition.</P>
    <P>I do not see why&mdash;and I fail completely to see any valid reason in any of the reports&mdash;Schedule E should have a narrower rule for expenses than Schedule D.  I would be very glad if the Minister would particularly apply himself when replying to that aspect.  Why does he consider that the person who is employed should not be allowed as much credit for expenses as the person who is employing?  It <Col N="59" /> seems to me that in both cases the person is paying for these books.  He must pay himself for whatever is necessary, desirable or reasonable.  In the case of the employer, it is treated as a charge on the profits of the firm; in the case of the employee who wants to better himself, it is not allowed.</P>
    <P>I would agree at once that it would not be right or proper to give the taxpayers <i>carte blanche</i>, that all expenses should be allowed.  That, of course, would leave a hole open for evasion of the law, even, as a result, for avoidance.  But it does seem to me that the words that are included in the amendment and that were included in the Cohen Report &ldquo;reasonable to incur expenditure for the appropriate performance of the work in question&rdquo; are words with which no one can quarrel.</P>
    <P>I know the British Revenue authorities, and, I imagine, our Revenue authorities also, will say: &ldquo;This is going to set up a new line of country. We have had a great many decisions already under Rule 9.  We know what is allowable under Rule 9 and what must be disallowed.  This is going to set up a new set of regulations and means there will be new principles adumbrated.&rdquo;  That is exactly what I want.  If we were not to accept the fact that there were to be new principles adumbrated, we would never amend any statute at any time.</P>
    <P>While it may cause a little more trouble at the beginning while the first year of a new practice is being worked out, by and large when that is done and when the situation has been standardised there will be very considerable relief for the go-ahead employee.  Whatever the Minister and I may differ on, we both will agree without question that we would rather see legislation so framed that the go-ahead person gets the benefit rather than the person who is not prepared to use his initiative and to push on. Unless we are prepared to legislate in such a way that those who are endeavouring to move ahead will have the urge to do so and will be urged to do so, we shall not get the increase in productivity that we must get if we are to improve our standard of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> I do not propose to weary the House by reading out all the arguments set out at great length in the report to which I have referred.  I plead guilty to not having read it myself until quite recently when this matter was brought to my attention, but it seems to me that the arguments contained in it are coercive.  Having read them, it does not seem to me that there is any answer to them.  It appears to me that the operation of this rule does bear unjustly and unfairly on employees and that it should be amended for that reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Sweetman has stated, this amendment was recommended by the Royal Commission.  I want to emphasise that if there is a case for the amendment of this rule in Britain, there is a much stronger case for its amendment in this country where we are relying on the salary earner and the wage earner to a far greater extent proportionately than is the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  It cannot be too strongly reiterated that salary and wage earners in this country are being fleeced.  They are fair game for the Revenue Commissioners and have no way out of the income tax net.  As long as that position applies there is a strong obligation in equity to see that they are fairly dealt with.</P>
      <P>There is no part of the income tax code which has been more frequently the subject of unfavourable comment by judicial authorities and those who know what they are talking about than this rule.  The extreme rigour of the rule has been frequently condemned by the Courts who have no option but to implement it because it is the law.  It is completely undesirable because of the anomalous position of the professional person in employment <i>vis-á-vis</i> his professional colleague who is not in employment and who may be self-employed.  The same items of expense are allowable in the case of the one but are not allowed in the case of the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman has mentioned the case of the professional man who wishes to keep up to date in his profession and is obliged to expend money <Col N="61" /> on the purchase of books and such like. There is a much more obvious example.  Take the case of a professional man, an engineer or an architect, who is in the employment of the Board of Works.  He will no longer be an architect if he does not pay his professional subscriptions to the Institute of Architects but he is not entitled to set off his professional subscriptions against his taxable income under Schedule E.  Some inspectors, by concession, do allow such subscriptions but not all of them.  They should not be in the position of having to give a concession in this matter.  It should be quite clear that professional subscriptions to professional bodies should be allowed.  However, in that connection I do not suppose the Minister will accept the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the amendments to that law brought into the British Finance Act in 1958 whereby the British allowed professional subscriptions should be adopted here.  We are constantly adopting British tax legislation.  That is undesirable in one sense but in another sense it is unavoidable because the whole basis of our tax code is the British system and the principle around which it is built is still the British Act of 1918.  It is significant that whenever the British tighten the screws on the taxpayers we follow suit but when the British give some technical concessions, as in this case, we do not follow suit.  We have an example of that in this Bill in Section 9 which is a complete copy, with the exception of one sub-section, of the British provisions of 1956.  The sub-section which we have left out is the British one which gives a certain concession which we do not give.  It is remarkably significant and undesirable that we should so consistently copy the British when they turn the screw tighter but not when they make concessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contrast with the Schedule D rule is very unfortunate.  To clarify the minds of Deputies in this matter I mention an example which I came <Col N="62" /> across recently of a medical doctor employed in a hospital who also had his private practice.  Part of his income comes from his private earnings and part of it comes from his earnings as an employee.  He is taxed under Schedule D on both of his incomes and he can claim many expenses which he would not be entitled to claim if his income were derived solely from his activity as an employee.  Any of his colleagues who would not have a sideline of professional practice to qualify them to come in under Schedule D are treated differently.  The expenses which he can claim are not only professional expenses but also include travelling expenses and entertainment allowances under Schedule D.</P>
    <P>The Schedule E Rule 9 is so restrictive because we add the words &ldquo;necessary to the provision of&rdquo; and the restrictive view of the Revenue Authorities and of the Courts is that the engineer, architect, accountant or doctor who has paid subscriptions to his professional body is not allowed for them because they are not necessary to the discharge of his duties. That is an extraordinarily rigid interpretation of this rule.  I believe that the rule was defective from the start and that it has been all along interpreted far more rigidly than was in the minds of those who framed it in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I said a moment ago that because of the disproportionate extent to which we are relying on salary and wage earners for our income tax revenue there is a greater obligation on us to rectify this rule.  It is quite obvious from the records of the Revenue Commissioners that salary and wage earners are being imposed upon more and more.  They are very patient people, of course, but even the worm will turn and I feel there is bound to be an outcry shortly after the onset of P.A.Y.E.  Acceptance of this amendment, of course, would not alter this position but it would make it clear that we were about to set out on a process of reform and that these people would be less drastically dealt with in the future.</P>
    <P>The Royal Commission did not set out any order of priorities.  In their <Col N="63" /> terms of reference I think they were asked to indicate the priority in which the various recommendations should be implemented but they failed to do that and I am aware that, because of that, some time afterwards the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked the Institute of the Chartered Accountants in England to indicate the order of priorities which they, as tax practitioners, would feel justified in recommending. To my mind, it is remarkably significant that that institute which, if anything, would be biassed on the side of big business and industrial taxpayers, recommended as top priority the reform of this rule.  It recommended the amendment we are now asking the Minister to accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman spoke of what he described as the kernel of this matter and he asked me, in replying, to bring my mind to bear on it. Why, he asked, make a distinction between Schedule E and Schedule D taxpayers?  Essentially, Schedule D taxpayers are different from Schedule E taxpayers.  The Schedule D taxpayers must go out and get their business. They must look for business, as it were, in order to make the profits on which income tax is payable.  If they are professional people they must look for business to earn incomes on which income tax is payable.  We must, therefore, be more liberal because if a person who is a Schedule D taxpayer decides to spend a certain amount of money in order to increase his business or bring in more business, we must look on that as a legitimate expenditure and one that is therefore allowable for income tax if it is agreed that it is legitimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Schedule E taxpayer is in a different position.  He is working for another person.  His area of activity is fairly well defined and necessarily his expenditure is fairly well defined also. His remuneration will be paid as long as he performs his duties satisfactorily and, looking at the Schedule E taxpayer in that way, the law as it stands up to this appeared to be justified, that is, that a Schedule E taxpayer could not claim exemption unless <Col N="64" /> obliged by his employer to spend money in a certain direction.  Take the case mentioned, and suppose there is an architect working for a public body which prescribes that he must buy certain periodicals and study them. He would be allowed that expense because it is necessary to hold his job.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman in his amendment has covered more or less the recommendation of the Royal Commission which sat in Britain.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer has not adopted that recommendation except in a very small way.  He allows certain fees and subscriptions, but they are so circumscribed that I do not think I should like to bring in clauses here in the same form.  I think I would be very highly criticised if I did so and I would certainly be pressed to make the concessions more explicit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman also said that a person he had come across who was spending money to better himself in his position was not allowed the expense as an exemption for income tax purposes.  That case would not be covered, as a matter of fact, by Deputy Sweetman's amendment because the amendment speaks of what is necessary to the appropriate performance of his duties and, of course, it is not necessary for the appropriate performance of one's duties that one should better oneself.  Therefore, the amendment proposed by the Deputy would not cover the case he cites.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is right for Deputy Byrne to accuse the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners of always following the British when they tighten up regulations and never following them when they give concessions.  We should take pride, if you like, in any case where we are better than the British in income tax law, and there are many cases where we are more liberal than the British in our income tax code. We have many benefits that they do not give at all and we should be proud of that rather than attack ourselves, as it were, for slavishly following the British penal code and never following them in giving concessions.</P>
      <P>There is one thing we have to remember in this country and that is that when the law is tightened up in Great Britain we are in the unfortunate position that we have to a certain extent to follow the British in many cases because the same circumstances arise here and we have to tighten up our regulations accordingly.  I am afraid it will become necessary for me to give notice that I want to bring in another amendment, at Report Stage, which I am afraid will be regarded by Deputy P. Byrne as slavishly following the British, to tighten up the income tax regulations.  It cannot be helped.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, however, that there is a very big difference between Schedule E and Schedule D.  Under Schedule E a man is remunerated for carrying out a certain job.  If he cannot carry it out he is, all right.  But under Schedule D a man must look for his work and, if he wants to expand his business or develop it, he must spend a certain amount of money in so doing. He must go out and seek the work and, I think, must get more consideration than the individual who is taxed under Schedule E.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in replying to the arguments of Deputy Sweetman and Deputy P. Byrne, would seem to me to have brought out even more forcibly the injustice that exists between Schedules E <Col N="66" /> and D.  I took his argument to be that no allowances for expenses are possible to a professional man under Schedule E, unless they actually are indicated to him by his employers as being necessary to improve his professional capability. I think the Minister suggested that if it were indicated to a man working for, say, some Department or another that if he bought a certain type of journal it would improve his professional ability he would be entitled to an allowance.  But I do not think he definitely committed himself.</P>
      <P>I took it from what he said that if such man wished to subscribe to a particular association he would not be entitled to an allowance, whereas under Schedule D a man is entitled to it.  Deputy P. Byrne made it clear that in some instances inspectors of taxes do allow such a deduction.  That seems to draw out the parallel that there is an injustice as between the two Schedules.  The truth is that the individual under Schedule E is easy game for the tax collectors.  The Schedule E individual is on a fixed salary.  Everybody knows what he is getting and it is accordingly quite possible to come along and take the last shilling out of it.</P>
      <P>From that point of view I should like to reverse the Minister's argument. It is much easier to get the tax out of an individual under Schedule E and for that reason I think there should be a relaxation rather than a tightening up.  That is not to say that I think everybody in the professional end of Schedule D is too well treated.  But I do think that individuals under Schedule E above all should be entitled to the same professional privileges as his counterpart under Schedule D.</P>

    <P>Supposing an engineer working under the Board of Works finds that it would be to his professional advantage to take a course elsewhere&mdash; perhaps to study conditions in other countries&mdash;if he is put to a particular expense for that purpose and makes a claim for a relief of taxation, according to the Minister he is not entitled to it unless it is considered necessary by those who employ him because, they say, he needs it for professional <Col N="67" /> improvement&mdash;a refresher course of some kind.</P>
    <P>I can speak only for one profession &mdash;the medical profession.  It is a known fact that if a man in that profession does not do a refresher course from time to time he goes to seed.  The Minister himself, a medical man, must know that well.  The same applies to every other profession and I think it is carrying the thing too far when a man who is permanently employed in a job is not allowed tax relief for even joining a society.  After all, if a man wants to keep himself up to date&mdash;an electrician, or even a professional man such as a doctor, an engineer or a lawyer&mdash;he must keep himself in touch by joining a society which relates to the employment in which he is engaged.</P>
    <P>It may be only a small point; there may be only a small amount of money involved, but it is a principle and the principle appears to be, in relation to the income tax code, that there is one law for one and another for another.  Frankly, I do not think the Minister justified his case in resisting Deputy Sweetman's amendment. Deputy P. Byrne was probably right in his forecast that the Minister will not accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I took it from his reply that he was going to utilise some of the devices in the British tax code to tighten things up and that he will not give any relaxation in relation to Schedule E.  I think the Minister should think a lot on this point and give the matter his earnest consideration because a particular mass of people in this country provide the greater part of the tax and they are entitled to this consideration. I do not believe they should be considered for all time as fair game for the tax collectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I was rather horrified by the line the Minister took because it seems to me he was excluding all consideration from his mind that there could be anything wrong with the 1918 rule.  Even the most ardent advocate of that rule before the Cohen Committee did not close his mind to its unfortunate <Col N="68" /> repercussions.  I must repeat that it has had unfortunate repercussions in England.  It is bound to have far more unfortunate repercussions here, because of our different class structure, because of our different industrial structure and different professional structure.</P>
      <P>I do not think that anybody would quarrel with the statement that the people who have found it most difficult in recent years have been the white collar workers.  This amendment is designed primarily to assist the white collar worker and I do think that in those circumstances it is one that should be considered and not thrown aside.  A change of the rule even suited the British.  I should like to quote one paragraph from the Cohen Report, No. 143:</P>
      <P>In the course of our study of this very difficult problem we formed the impression that some part of the complaints about the unfairness of the Schedule E rule in relation to that of Schedule D was due to nothing more than a lack of liaison between those responsible for dealing with the respective sets of claims.  Indeed the evidence more than once suggested that there was considerable variation in the treatment of comparable claims under the same Schedule, according to the parts of the country in which they originated.</P>
      <P>I am led to believe that even though this is a very much smaller country there is something of the same sort here.  I should like a categoric answer from the Minister to the question: is there any liaison kept by the Revenue Commissioners at the top to ensure that the inspector of taxes, shall we say, in Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, deals with the matter in the same way as, shall we say, the inspector of taxes for Public Departments, in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that here it is at all necessary to go to the extent that the Cohen Committee went in recommending a liaison unit.  That is not necessary for our purposes here.  But, it would be desirable&mdash;in fact, I would go further and say it would be virtually essential&mdash;that there would <Col N="69" /> be complete uniformity here as to the manner in which this rule was to be interpreted.  It cannot be a question of judicial decision because, if it were a question of judicial decision alone, there would not be differences between different places in England.  It is a question purely of administrative interpretation.</P>
    <P>I have not got the same practical knowledge of administrative interpretation as Deputy Byrne would have from his professional experience as an accountant.  He has already told the House, with that knowledge that he has as a professional accountant, that there are differences between one tax inspector here and another.  That is highly undesirable.  It would certainly be desirable that some method should be adopted to ensure that in future there would be the uniformity in relation to a tax matter such as this that is so obviously and so eminently desirable.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear whether I made this point before or not, but I want to make it now.  One of the reasons why I have adduced this form of wording in the amendment is to try to get the Schedule E rule nearer to the Schedule D rule.  I do not understand at all the Minister's argument that a person who is being employed by somebody is in a safer position than an employer.  I accept, of course, that the employer has, if you like to use the word, to find the business but, at the same time, the employer is his own boss; he is taking his own decisions.</P>
    <P>There is an element of responsibility of a different sort on the employee. It is up to him to try to ensure that he adequately fits himself to carry out his employer's work for which he is being remunerated and it would be quite farcical to expect anyone when he was employing somebody to say: &ldquo;In order that you may keep up to date as an engineer in the Board of Works you shall buy, read, annotate and keep every week the Civil Engineering Journal,&rdquo; or whatever it is, or &ldquo;In order that you may be a good engineer in the employment of the Commissioners of Public Works, <Col N="70" /> you shall pay regularly and punctually on every 1st January your subscription to Cumann na nInnealtóirí&rdquo; or whatever Engineers' Association it may be.  It would reduce employment to a farce if, when one was employing somebody, one had to sit down and think and list out all the various things that had to be done.</P>
    <P>May I put it another way?  When I am employing an assistant solicitor in my office I expect that solicitor will keep abreast of the law in respect of whatever branch of the solicitors' work in my office I am calling him to do. If he is to be the person dealing with probate practice and land registry practice, then I expect him to keep abreast of probate practice and land registry practice and he knows that perfectly well.  I have not listed it.  I do not expect him to keep abreast of bankruptcy law because he has nothing to do with bankruptcy law.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument is that it cannot be allowed because I have not listed in my initial contract of employment that he shall buy the <i>Irish Law Times</i>, that he shall read the <i>Irish Law Times</i>, that he shall put it aside and keep it, that he shall be a member of the Incorporated Law Society, shall we say.  In fact, the question of the Incorporated Law Society does not really arise because I think most offices pay the subscriptions to the Incorporated Law Society and to the Solicitors' Bar Association for their assistant solicitors.  The assistant solicitors have not to pay it themselves.</P>
    <P>However, if they had, these are things that you cannot list out and a much more satisfactory method is to determine that what is reasonable shall be allowed.  It is not what is reasonable in the opinion of the employee; it is what is reasonable, first, in the opinion of the inspector of taxes; secondly, if the taxpayer is dissatisfied with his view, what is reasonable in the opinion of the Special Commissioner of Income Tax and again, if either the inspector of taxes or the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the view of the Special Commissioner, what is reasonable in the opinion of the circuit court judge.  I <Col N="71" /> do not honestly see what could be more reasonable than to suggest that reasonableness should be the test so long as the person concerned is not going to be the judge of that.</P>
    <P>In the accepted cases of what I might call high law, a circuit court judge is the determining person in relation to tax affairs.  It would be far simpler, would remove considerable dissatisfaction and would certainly remove an existing cause of complaint if the Minister were to allow the circuit court judge to decide what was or was not reasonable in respect of a taxpayer who is an employee in that individual case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no apology for having suggested that our approach to tax legislation is reactionary and unimaginative.  In this context I am referring to the technical and mechanical changes of our tax structure rather than to those Budgetary amendments made from time to time in respect of statutory reliefs and allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has not adverted to the point I made, namely, that in this context regard must be had to the fact that the Minister for Finance relies on salary earners and wage earners to a far greater extent relatively than does the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Admittedly, the British Chancellor has not as yet entirely implemented the recommendations of the Cohen Report but he has done so in part at least in respect of professional subscriptions.  I am glad the Minister has indicated that he considered that matter and thought that provisions such as were introduced in Britain in 1958 would be unwieldy and cumbersome for this country.  They were, as the Minister said, hedged round with many peculiar restrictions. However, as far as the matter of professional subscriptions is concerned, I would urge on the Minister at least to make recommendations to the Revenue Commissioners impressing on them that uniform concessions should be granted throughout the country allowing subscriptions to professional bodies payable by any person, say, engaged in professional employment. <Col N="72" /> That would seem to be a way round that aspect of the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman asked me about co-ordination among inspectors. It appears that the Revenue Commissioners issue specific instructions to their staff throughout the country which are frequently amended; therefore every inspector is working on the same instruction.  Also, representatives of the chief inspector pay frequent visits to the various inspectors.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman seemed to take it from what I said that my mind was closed on this question.  By no means is that so; Deputy Sweetman knows that no Minister for Finance could close his mind on any income tax subject. I have had suggestions made in regard to this matter of allowing certain expenses to Schedule E taxpayers and particularly professional people.  I have never had an attractive proposal. I certainly would not like to have provisions on the same lines as the British provisions because they are very complex.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the section. If something attractive and tangible could be suggested I should certainly be prepared to consider it.  I do not like the idea of a flat allowance all round.  We should like to give flat allowances at every opportunity if the money were available but this is a different question we are dealing with here.  A flat allowance all round in order to lighten the burden on Schedule E taxpayers would be welcome at any time and will be made whenever the Minister for Finance can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I have some sympathy with the Minister in disliking the flat allowance in this case.  In another case I discussed with him the flat allowance was adopted but there were special circumstances, the realisation that it was undesirable to have individual taxpayers arguing with the Revenue Commissioners. However, in relation to the general body of taxpayers if a flat allowance all round is made it makes no concession <Col N="73" /> to initiative.  On that basis I would not like it.  I am not quite clear whether the Minister intended to imply by the fact that he had received this very full, voluminous Report from the Income Tax Commission that they had finished their labours.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That is all I want to know.  If they have not finished their work I would ask the Minister to send them a special request to examine the incidence of this rule in Ireland.  If the Minister does not feel disposed at this stage to accept the amendment I have suggested and to accept the views that have been put on this side, I think it would be worth while to get the Report of the Commission&mdash;I am assuming their third report does not cut across this in any way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have not seen it and I am not asking the Minister to comment on it.  If the third report does not include anything in the nature of a reference or a recommendation on the lines of this amendment I would ask the Minister to request them to consider the application of the expenses rule in relation to Schedule E taxpayers and to see if they thought it desirable either to recommend the adoption of a new wording such as there is in the Cohen Report or that the existing wording is satisfactory in our circumstances in Ireland.  In that case I would have to reconsider my own opinions.  I have no doubt they would not say the present situation was satisfactory without having good reason for it and they would no doubt adduce their reasons.  In the absence of the Minister's being prepared to accept my amendment, I would ask him to suggest to the Commission that they should consider this problem and consider it in the light of our circumstances as apart from the circumstances in Britain which were considered by the Cohen Committee.  Is the Minister prepared to do that?</P>

      <P>The Minister's Department has certainly made considerable progress in forestry in recent years, and the trend seems likely to continue.  Forestry does not readily pay for itself and for that reason many people are slow to embark on private plantations.  May I place on record, before I go any further, that the forests we see around the country now reflect great credit on the technical staff of the Forestry Division?  Nothing adds more to the attractiveness of the countryside than beautiful woods. Our forests are well cared for by the Forestry Division.  There are some magnificent forests in Wicklow.  There are some beautiful forests in Offaly on the slopes of the Slieve Bloom mountains. They are well worth a visit. The progress made in the areas around Bawnree, Kinnitty, Clonaslee and Mountrath reflects great credit on those responsible for the plantations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often wondered if the Minister and his Department have ever given any thought to schemes for the encouragement of private planting.  Has he ever sought the support of the county committees of agriculture and organisations like the N.F.A. and Macra na Feirme?  Has the Minister ever considered giving special tax relief to <Col N="76" /> landowners who embark on large-scale private planting?  In France, as the Minister must be aware, new plantations are exempt from local rates for a period of 30 years.  We have a good deal of land which can be described as woodland.  The owners of this land pay the same rates as if it were arable land.  There seems to be something radically wrong with that system.</P>
    <P>A farmer may have land which is unsuitable for either grazing or tillage but which would be ideal for planting. The Government and the Minister would be very wise to consider the suggestion I make with regard to exemption from rates for a period of 30 years, as in France; trees take 25 to 30 years to mature and therefore a period of 25 to 30 years must elapse before the owner can reap any financial benefit.  So far as I know, there is a similar scheme in Denmark.  In British Columbia, one can obtain what is known as a tree farm classification. This classification exempts the owner from rates.  In addition, he gets substantial relief in income tax.  The Government would be well advised to embark on some scheme of rate exemption or tax relief to encourage private planting.</P>
    <P>With regard to the numbers employed, there is scope for much greater employment than at present. This time twelve months I suggested more co-operation between the Forestry Division and Bord na Móna in the reclamation of cutaway bogland. We know that not every type of plant is suitable for cutaway bog but experiments could be carried out to find out the most suitable type.  Such planting would beautify the present eyesores. There is nothing so bleak as cutaway bog.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Division are often subjected to very serious criticism.  It is an easy matter to accuse the Forestry Division of not going ahead quickly enough with afforestation.  It is very easy to grow trees on paper. Those who criticise should appreciate that it takes a long, long time for a tree to reach maturity.  Whilst other State Departments may be able to give quick results, the Forestry Division <Col N="77" /> cannot do so.  The land has to be prepared.  It has to be drained.  It has to have a suitable moisture content.  Plants suitable to the soil must be set.</P>
    <P>We have also the various schemes of thinnings and in addition to them we have the various stages of pruning and so on.  It all takes a considerable time, and when we now see that most building contractors throughout the country are using our own native timber that reflects great credit on the Forestry Section.  We have reached the stage when in the estimation of building contractors Irish timber compares as equal to imported timber. That is a cause for rejoicing and for appreciation of the hard work involved in bringing about that state of affairs. I am sure the Minister for Lands will agree that it is a very pleasant state of affairs, and we who differ politically from him are pleased with it.  It is something which any Irish Government might well be proud to see&mdash; that our commercial timber ranks amongst the best compared with timber imported for any building and constructional purposes, and I hope that trend will continue.  The Minister, I am sure, will also agree that that state of affairs would not have materialised were it not for the foresight of those who were responsible for planting trees 25 and 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>Forestry is a national asset, it gives employment, it beautifies the countryside, and it pays big dividends when timber has matured and is ready for cutting.  That is why I say that any money this House invests in forestry is money well spent and any money we spend on training our foresters, and on sending them to Denmark and other places in order that they may keep themselves up to date with modern methods, is well spent.  As far as this House is concerned, I am sure that any money which the Minister asks for in that respect it will not be denied to him.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the question of employment, I feel that the Minister ought to call his forestry advisers together and make arrangements to try and provide a substantial increase in the moneys sought for forestry in <Col N="78" /> next year's Estimate.  We do know that in recent years the law has been simplified in regard to the taking over of land for forestry purposes.  In practically every county in Ireland there are some lands suitable for planting and I think the Minister's Department, now that a certain measure of progress has been achieved, ought to formulate a new scheme for a survey to be carried out in every county in Ireland, first seeking those who may be prepared to give their lands voluntarily for forestry purposes. In that regard the advice of county committees of agriculture should be obtained, and the assistance of the N.F.A. and other kindred organisations. A scheme should then be formulated and sponsored, either by the Forestry Branch or by groups of private individuals with the assistance of the Forestry Branch, to ensure that more activity will be engaged in and that a greater number of men will be employed in forestry.</P>
    <P>There is a time of the year when Bord na Móna has to lay off workers and I have often wondered if it would be possible to have some kind of scheme by which we could dovetail the ending of these men's employment with the starting of work connected with forestry.  When the time comes for Bord na Móna to lay these men off the Forestry Section should be prepared to take them over immediately and put them to work preparing lands for afforestation or send them to local forests where they may be employed on road making.</P>
    <P>A great deal of good work has been done in regard to road making in forests.  The Minister said some time ago that forest roads should be narrow so that as little land as possible would be taken up by them, but I have always thought the very opposite.  At least I feel that roads through forests ought to be sufficiently wide enough in parts to carry traffic.  One does not expect that roads through forests should be tarred and steam-rolled like main roads but they should be reasonably good.  If groups of interested people come to this country to inspect our forests it should be possible for the heads of the Forestry Section to conduct <Col N="79" /> them on tours through our forests and for that alone I think it would be wise to have good roads through forests.  I agree it will cost money but again I feel it would be money well spent.  Such roads in time will be required for the removal of the trees and that should be remembered.</P>
    <P>Convenient to forests in many parts of the country there is often to be found land which we might term as too good for forestry but not good enough for tillage purposes.  In the constituency which I represent there is an area convenient to the Mountrath Forest known as Cartown Lawns and I have often wondered why the Forestry Branch does not propose to plant that area, or why it has not been possible for them to consult with the Land Commission and ask the Land Commission to take over those lands and divide them out amongst local people who have to pay very substantial sums both for the grazing of livestock and for the taking of conacre. The Forestry Section should take greater care that no land is planted that could be suitably grazed for livestock, on the one hand, or that could be converted into tillage land through the Land Rehabilitation Scheme, the Fertiliser Scheme and other schemes that could add to the quality of the soil.</P>
    <P>I know the Forestry Branch has taken this matter rather seriously but the evidence shows that in many areas lands have been taken over that in the opinion of local people are considered of too good a quality for forestry purposes while in the vicinity people were obliged to pay up to £20 and £25 per year per acre for land under the conacre system.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter seriously because I feel that in my constituency, at any rate, there are a number of problems of that kind which are presenting difficulties.  While the difficulties are not of a very major character there is certain hardship when decisions are not arrived at within a reasonable time.  There are a number of matters which have been left lying in the Forestry Branch for a considerable <Col N="80" /> time, like Mahomet's coffin, without definite decisions taken on them, and I would ask the Minister to ask the Director of Forestry, or whoever is responsible for coming to decisions, to make the decisions necessary.  I say that in relation to the question of the exchange of holdings in which the Forestry Division are in touch with the Land Commission and one is waiting for the other to make a move.  We have a number of such cases in Laois, particularly in the Killenure district, and I would be glad not to have these matters dragging on for years.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention is the question of providing a pension scheme for forestry workers.  Now that local authority employees can avail of a contributory pension scheme, I feel the time has come to have such a pension scheme for forestry workers.  I believe that if the Minister introduced a proposal for such a scheme it would meet with a measure of support in the House.  In view of the fact that industrial workers and others have the benefit of contributory pension schemes and seeing that forestry has become a major part of our economy and employs so many people, the time has come when we should consider increasing our staff and providing properly for them.  I am sure that this matter will have the sympathetic consideration of the Minister.  A contented staff with security and pension rights will feel they have a stake in their work and will take great pride in it.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered whether we could not have for forestry workers, as is available for post office workers not qualified for pension, a fund known as the Minister's special fund.  Under this scheme a gratuity could be paid on retirement to a forestry worker who had given good and faithful service or when he is told by the forester: &ldquo;You are no longer of any use to us; we shall have to get a younger man who will be more lively.&rdquo;  It is regrettable that such men have to go because they love their work and take a keen interest in it.  Most foresters listen attentively to the instructions of the forester and look upon themselves <Col N="81" /> as skilled in their own particular sphere.  In my own area&mdash;I do not know if there are any great forests in the Minister's constituency&mdash;the forestry workers can be heard discussing technical points of forestry among themselves.  This shows they are learning from the forester and, when we have an interested staff such as that, I think they deserve some pension scheme or gratuity on their retirement.</P>
    <P>This side of the House has no criticism to offer of the work of the Forestry Division.  We feel, however, that there is room for expansion in forestry, that more money should be spend on it, more men employed and more lands acquired for forestry purposes. Of course, we realise that it is difficult to acquire certain lands because of title difficulties and so on. Nevertheless, I should like to hear from the Minister what amount of land is voluntarily offered to his Department for forestry purposes.  I know the Minister is anxious in cases where land is offered voluntarily to fit it in with the existing forestry scheme.  Land may be offered in isolated areas where it would not be economically possible for the Department to open up a small unit unless they could be sure of acquiring land in the adjacent districts. While that may be wise from the financial point of view, I feel that from the economic point of view, and particularly from the point of view of utilising waste land, the services of a forester should be available, not permanently but for one or two days a week, in such areas and a number of men should be employed so that these small areas could, in time, be developed.  I would ask the Minister to look into the question of land offered in the Ballinahemmy district of Clonaslee because there is room for a very great expansion of forestry in that area.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience that the Forestry Division has been reasonable in the matter of the price offered for land.  I do not know of any instance in my constituency where the forestry section could be accused of being unreasonable in the price paid for land offered voluntarily.  Naturally the owner of the land will try to get <Col N="82" /> as much as he possibly can and those furthering his interests will endeavour to make the land as rich as possible for that purpose.  But I have found in my constituency that a satisfactory solution could always be found, and a little bit of common sense on both sides was able to solve many difficulties. Rather than asking land owners to enter into correspondence, it would be far better if the officials could call personally to try to make some arrangement on the spot.  That has been done with most satisfactory results in Laois and it is easier and simpler for everybody.</P>
    <P>In representations to the Department I have caused as much difficulty as any Deputy but I have always been met with great courtesy and satisfaction so far as the officers were concerned. Forestry has made great headway in this country, and the evidence is there in the opinions of our builders of our timber.  Let us hope that that progress will continue in the years ahead.  I know it is difficult for any Minister for Lands to get his colleagues in the Government to give him everything he wants for forestry, but I feel Governments ought to be more liberal with the amount they spend on forestry.  If we are anxious to extend the employment forestry can give and double the work, I feel the amount of money expended on forestry should be increased.  This side of the House wish the Minister for Lands and the forestry section every success and good luck in the undertakings they have on hands.  I can give them an assurance of the co-operation of this side of the House so that they can carry on the good work which is proceeding with such a measure of success.</P>
    <P>I do not want to finish by taking the good out of what I have said but when complaints are made to the Department I am not happy about the manner of the investigations that take place.  I do not know what the machinery is but I do know that an unpleasant and unsatisfactory thing happened in the Geashill State forest. It does not reflect credit on the Minister or on the officers of his Department. It may take five years, or it may take <Col N="83" /> 10 years but the wrongs that were done there will eventually be righted.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister is not as familiar with what took place as I am and I am sorry that an impartial inquiry was not conducted into the whole affair.  Naturally the Minister will take the word of the officers of his Department but I have every confidence and belief in the word of the ordinary labouring man and what convinces me that the inquiry was a sham was that the man who was honest enough to put the matter in writing to the police and to his local representatives was dismissed from his employment. He was victimised and would not be taken back and he was told, when he applied to be re-engaged, that he would not be re-employed because he was a mischief-maker.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the area knows the respectability of the man.  They know his honour and his honesty.  Everybody knows that everything was not honest and above board so far as those in authority were concerned.  It may take a considerable time before justice can be done but I want to tell the Minister that if ever there is a change of Government one of the wrongs done in Tullamore State forest will be put right and that without any great delay.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised that the Minister himself did not take a more impartial view of the situation.  He was far more inclined to view the matter as being not of a very serious nature. If the Minister were in serious contact with the Gardaí, with the authorities and with the respectable people in the district he would know from first hand information that this unfortunate man was victimised, for what reason is best left to the consciences and minds of those in the Forestry Division who are responsible for the state of affairs there to-day.</P>
    <P>I had no intention of concluding on such a note but I feel that the Minister cannot say but that my speech has been reasonable.  I should like to see every person concerned with the forestry effort treated reasonably.  No man wants a concession more than another but the least one expects to <Col N="84" /> see is fair play and justice.  I am making this speech only in the interests of honour and justice and in the interest of a good old forestry worker whose politics are not mine.  I honestly feel that there has been a case of injustice and that the people who came out best came out best on their own reports.</P>
    <P>Naturally enough it is the duty of every Minister to defend his own officers but I do not think it is the duty of a Minister to defend his officers if they are wrong.  When reports come before a Minister they are usually reports well spliced and with plenty of sauce so that they will go down well.  I am satisfied that this was an instance in which the Forestry Division could have been more reasonable and more generous.  The position in State forests has not been improved because of what we believe to be a cloaking up of the whole situation by an officer or officers of the Department.  I should be long sorry to make allegations on this Vote and I do not propose to do so for certain good reasons but I ask the Minister to discuss the matter further with the head of the section who will be impartial and who, I am sure, will be anxious to see that justice is done.  I still think that this man should be re-employed even though he will not get a good recommendation from those in charge of the forests.</P>
    <P>He did what his conscience told him to do and the least the Minister can do is to have sufficient confidence in the good old forestry worker who carried out his work conscientiously and well, who found that wrongs were being done and who was prepared to place his information in the hands of the police.  A man should not be deprived of work because he felt that the ratepayers' money was not being wisely spent.</P>
    <P>When a man comes along to a forestry worker and says: &ldquo;Here is 10/- I should have given you in your wages the other night,&rdquo; anyone would know that there was something fishy about it.  As far as the measurments of the men's work were concerned there is no doubt that the proper returns were not going into the Department. <Col N="85" /> The returns were investigated in the office in the absence of the foreman in charge.  The correct returns were not being sent to the Department.  One of the men concerned is probably a greater expert in the taking of measurements than the man actually making the returns.</P>
    <P>I hope that is the only State forest in the country where there has been such an unpleasant experience.  It could not happen in the Emo State forest because the supervision there is second to none.  The supervision in every forest in my constituency, with this exception, is carried out in a thoroughly efficient manner, and I cannot see why, when there was uneasiness and when there was information placed before the Minister, he should use it in the way he did.  I cannot understand why something was not done to relieve the position and the necessary steps taken to see there was no recurrence, and further, no individual should have been victimised because he was man enough to make his complaints honourably.  That is why I think the Minister should look into this matter again and see if there is anything that can possibly be done.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success and good luck in the Forestry Division and I hope that next year we shall have more money provided because, of all Departments that ask this House for money, none should get it as readily as the Forestry Division from the point of view of the employment they provide as well as the great work of afforestation itself.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House was very pleased to learn from the Minister the progress made in afforestation in the past 12 months.  Deputies in the west and in the midlands are also very pleased that forestry operations are beginning in these areas.  This is very commendable, but I regret that in my area the Department found it necessary to dispense with the services of so many employees in one plantation on the grounds that there was <Col N="86" /> no extra land available.  In dispensing with men, I think, the Minister and his Department should consider&mdash;they are all organised in various trade unions&mdash;that those who are longest in should not be first out, provided everything else is equal.</P>
      <P>I shall not refer to the case as I understand the Minister has it under consideration but in all cases where men are involved who have given long and loyal service over ten or 15 years they should know that this rule will apply no matter what influence may be used so as to give them a sense of security and an interest in their work. I understand the difficulties of the officials who must rely on certain people.  I do not know if it is true but I am informed that employment could have been found for a number of the men who have been dismissed in cleaning up the forests, removing scrub, briars and so on.  That, I am told, would have kept them employed until the following October.  We should use every means to avoid discharging the men especially in this area where there are only small farms and practically no road work or other forms of employment are available and where the workers depend on forestry. The Department should consider very carefully the position of the men concerned before discharging them.</P>
      <P>Wicklow Agricultural Committee have sent a resolution to the Minister drawing attention to the fact that quite recently men were engaged on Sunday morning and throughout the day preventing a fire which broke out from spreading to one of the most valuable forests we have.  While the men worked all day at that task they never received any acknowledgment from the Department and were refused compensation for clothes that were destroyed.  I feel the Department must not have been notified of it.  At a meeting representative of all Parties, we were shocked to find that men&mdash; even those whose clothes had not been injured in any way&mdash;had come out on a Sunday morning to prevent a plantation being destroyed and no notice was taken of it.  That action required some recognition and appreciation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister's <Col N="87" /> reply to the resolution will be and I only hope that what happened in that case will not affect the behaviour of workers in similar circumstances in the future because it is the duty of every citizen to help as much as possible where he sees danger to our plantations.  It is also a duty to warn people who may be careless.  That is specially true of our area where we have many tourists.  We have men there who are not getting any benefits from forests and yet are warning the tourists against the dangers of fires near plantations.  It is not too late yet to give some little reward to the workers I mentioned and to compensate those whose clothes were destroyed on that Sunday when they saved a valuable plantation.  I am certain that if it comes to the Minister's attention he will deal with it sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I can congratulate the Minister on the wonderful work of the Forestry Division.  A long time before a native Government was established we in our county in the Sinn Féin and Labour movement allocated money for grants for farms for shelter belts and for private individuals so as to encourage forestry.  Some farmers now have over 1,000 acres with 20 or 30 men employed in their own private plantations. I am delighted to see that operations are being extended to the west of Ireland.  I can appreciate the difficulties of the Minister and his Department there where land is scarce and difficult to acquire.  They are making a trial and I wish them every success.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to deal sympathetically with the resolution of the Wicklow Agricultural Committee so that we can encourage other men to act as good citizens without looking for a reward in dealing with any danger that may threaten our forests. Finally, I hope the Department will be able to provide employment for the men discharged in the Aughrim area because many of them are still unemployed and are drawing unemployment assistance which is a bad proposition from their point of view.  I hope some work will be found for <Col N="88" /> them so as to avoid the necessity of their joining the emigrant ship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Department of State against which very little criticism can be levelled especially in recent years.  We are all very glad to know that the target of 25,000 acres aimed at some years ago has been reached at last.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will endeavour even to improve on that target because, even with a planting programme of 25,000 acres a year, it would be 40 years before we reached 1,000,000 acres.</P>
      <P>Forestry is one of our most important national developments and we are all edified by the results achieved in recent years.  It gives cause for jubilation on all sides.  Forests especially in barren parts of our island are pleasing to the eye and a source of satisfaction because of the beauty they provide and the other good effects they have on our climate. Theorists tell us at all times that trees help to dry the climate apart altogether from the carbon dioxide they absorb from the air and the shelter they give.</P>
      <P>I think that if a fair price is paid for land the people will be only too ready to give it voluntarily.  I do not know through what source the Minister and his Department get their information with regard to available land, but I think some of the rural organisations should be asked to assist with information as to where pockets of plantable land are available.  When all the level land is planted, I suppose the Department will extend their activities to the more difficult parts and that some of the hill land and mountain ranges will be planted.  Meanwhile, of course, I hope all our level areas will be utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was good to hear that afforestation gives such very steady employment. The Minister told us that he hopes that 4,700 workers on an average will be employed in the coming year. That is a figure that gives room for optimism.  I wonder how long it will be before the Department become self-supporting, until our sales of timber will more than cover the cost of plantation and development?  We were edified to hear from the Minister <Col N="89" /> that the E.S.B. buy poles at the rate of 13,000 a year and that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are also very good customers&mdash;that they will buy 14,000 poles in the coming year. Were these two Departments to purchase the poles in other countries, how would the prices compare?  In other words, is there a saving to these Departments on the purchase of home produced poles?  If there is, I think the Department should claim credit for it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the chipboard factory in Clare, I wonder if the Department have made any research into the production of wood pulp?  There are possibilities for extended activities in that direction.  I was glad to hear the Minister refer to the incentive bonus system.  He said it had given good results so far.  I think it was a worthwhile experiment and that, perhaps, other Departments might try it out.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us whether we are still confined to the conventional type of forests or have we made any experiments into other types of plantation that could be carried out in a climate like ours? Can he tell us if we can produce timber of a more valuable kind?  I was not aware that native timber was so extensively used in this country in the building industry until I heard Deputy Flanagan say so.  I hope his statement is correct.</P>
    <P>With regard to forest fires, reference was made by Deputy Everett to watchmen. I wonder if watchmen are kept in all our forests, during the tourist season particularly?  If so, it would be very desirable if they were supplied with motor cycles so that they could make tours of the areas for which they are responsible during daylight hours.  It is quite easy to detect forest fires during the night, but these fires usually break out in the early afternoon.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to trainees and said there were 93 or 95 trainees at the moment under instruction.  I do not know what the facilities for these people are, whether they can get their instruction through actual <Col N="90" /> practice or whether there is a sort of apprenticeship.  I was recently in the Valley of Desmond, in West Cork. It is associated with the patron Saint of the county.  I am speaking of Gougane Barra and was edified to see the forest planted there in recent years. I should like the Minister to inform us if it was an experiment.  It was wonderful to see trees growing apparently from the rocks&mdash;really luxurious growths&mdash;with roads through the forests to accommodate sightseers. That is really an illustration of a fact which we have often heard, that trees can grow on rocky hill sides.  I agree that this is a very sheltered valley and that may account for the success of the plantation.  One would think the trees there might be brought down in a storm.  I sincerely hope that will not be the case because it is nice to see a forestry development of this kind.  Was it an experiment?</P>
    <P>There are vast areas in this country that cannot be utilised for any purpose other than forestry and I hope the Minister and his Department will not be lax in going after these lands and securing them so that there will be always the greatest margin of plantable acreage available to the Department and so that the Minister will always have success guaranteed in reaching the target set by the Department. I shall conclude by saying that the Department deserve every credit for the wonderful results they have achieved and I hope these results will continue in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow on what Deputy Manley has said on the reference the Minister made to plantable reserves and to point out that, if we are to continue to organise our plantation programmes at the individual forest centres, we need a more steady intake of land.  In that respect I would point out that the prices offered for land I have known have been very small.  In my constituency I know of instances where something like £5 per acre has been paid and I know of a case where an individual offered 150 acres.  No matter how poor the land might be, the small prices offered act as an encouragement <Col N="91" /> to an owner to hold on to the land and use it for rough grazing rather than dispose of it for afforestation. If the price were made more attractive there would be no such hindrance to the intake of land.</P>
      <P>It is true that in some forests where there is a slackness of employment, the excuse given is the difficulty of obtaining suitable areas near the forests in question.  In one of these in West Limerick in the very recent past I inquired the reasons why labour was laid off and found the position was that even the men who were being kept on were being employed on the expectation of a further intake of land in the area in the near future. The idea has often occurred to me that men who receive unemployment benefit of £3 per week in rural areas could be usefully employed on forestry schemes, even on a minor scale.  The cost to the State would be offset to some extent by the saving secured.</P>
      <P>Deputy Everett made the point that the rate of unemployment benefit is totally inadequate for a man with a family.  If, instead of being paid £3 a week in unemployment benefit, a man could be employed at £6 or £7 a week on forestry work the cost to the State would be only £3 or £4 a week.  It may be suggested that there would be difficulty in bringing such men to the forests.  During the emergency when there was urgent need to cut turf a scheme was readily devised to get men to the bogs.  I cannot see that it would present enormous difficulies to bring men to the forests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forests are slow to develop.  It may take anything from 20 to 50 years to produce commercial timber. The Minister referred to the fact that the British market will be readily available for our timber when our forests come to maturity.  Bearing that in mind and considering the time that it will take to reach that stage, there should not be strict adherence to rigid ideas with regard to the acreage planted.  From the social and the economic point of view forestry should be developed more speedily.  Is <Col N="92" /> forestry to be regarded from the economic point of view more than from the social point of view? Taking the Estimates as framed year after year, it would seem that there is a certain amount of money allocated for forestry and that the policy is to keep within that sum.  The Minister referred to the existing labour force and suggested that we shall have an opportunity of keeping that number of men employed for the next few years but that it will be some years before we can expect increased employment on larger programmes.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a link between the use of mechanical devices in the preparation of land for planting and the market available for manpower. Deputy Corish referred to this development. It is noticeable in all forms of rural employment.  Machines are displacing men and that development is creating social problems in rural areas.  It may result in more work but that is achieved at great cost in human values.  Nobody wishes to hinder the type of progress which can be made as a result of this development but it is far more important to keep our people at home.  Even if those people had to accept a lower standard than is available across the water, they would live in a safer environment and the country would gain by keeping them here instead of importing expensive machinery which deprives them of a livelihood and ultimately has the effect of driving them from our shores.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley referred to the use that can be made of native timber.  He mentioned the chipboard factory at Scariff, County Clare.  There is room for further development in regard to that aspect of forestry development. The native paper industry uses waste paper.  A type of timber should be produced which would be suitable for the production of a rough type of paper and wrapping paper and eventually we would move to the stage where we would have a wood pulp factory which would produce the softer types of paper at least.  That would provide a ready outlet for the products of the forests.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan also referred to <Col N="93" /> private planting.  That is encouraged locally by county committees of agriculture. There again, the State would not lose by planting areas, particularly where there is a tourist potential, and handing the plantation over to be cared for by the local authority or by private persons, retaining, of course, the right of inspection at all stages.</P>
    <P>A case has come to my notice, which I have referred to the Department, where damage was done to neighbouring lands by the drainage of forest land.  Where drainage is being done by them the Forestry Division should ensure that any water which comes off the land will not cause damage to adjoining land.  If the neighbouring farmer could show the forester in charge that damage was being caused to his land as a result of drainage done by the Forestry Division, the Department should remedy the matter as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The forest trainee scheme is a very useful development.  I saw the terms of the test on which trainees were brought in on the last occasion. A case in point is that of a student who had done vocational training for three years.  He had a certificate in Irish and English and then proceeded to the attainment of the group certificate in the manual subjects; yet because he had not done these together he was not eligible for admission.  The initial training is carried out in Offaly and I understand the final year is done at Shelton Abbey.  These trainees will provide us with the foresters who will look after our forests in future with that technical skill and ability which will repay their training.</P>
    <P>I should like to inquire from the Minister if it will be possible to absorb these trainees, who have spent a number of years in training at the expense of the State into employment at home, or will we lose their services through emigration?  It is an asset to anybody leaving this county to have training as a forester but I should like all these young men when they have completed their training to find employment as foresters at home.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say if the roads which are now being constructed in <Col N="94" /> the forests are of the accommodation type for the removal of wood from the forest or does this development visualise these roads being used as an amenity for tourists going to places which have been planted with the scenic point of view in mind?  On the Continent roads are constructed through the forests to facilitate tourist traffic which is a source of revenue to the country and a source of pleasure to the people who pass through these areas to admire the beauty of the trees.  Undoubtedly there is great beauty in trees as well as great advantage to the community economically and socially.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to the survey of land that might be available. Perhaps voluntary organisations who would have a knowledge of the existence of such lands could bring them to the notice of the Forestry Division.  Organisations such as Muintir na Tíre which has branches scattered throughout the country should know of such patches of land in various places.  However, in some of these cases the amount of land available might be small and that would cause administrative difficulty for the Forestry Division.  I know they do not take too readily to the acceptance of small patches of land and it is understandable that such would present them with great difficulty where they would be widely scattered, but where there might be a small number of holdings which could be grouped together for planting purposes it would be worthwhile to consider them.</P>
    <P>I must confess that at times I cannot understand how the employment of foresters operates.  The procedure is to apply to the local exchange and a list of men is forwarded.  There is a priority in which these men are selected but then you come across a very intangible quality: &ldquo;Suitability of the applicant for employment.&rdquo;  Evidently this is a quality that is reckoned by the local forester in charge.  I do not know how it is reckoned but perhaps we shall hear what exactly it covers. Does it involve the purely personal opinion of the local forester or is it the opinion of the forester having regard to standards laid down as to suitability? <Col N="95" /> If there are standards laid down in regard to suitability, perhaps the Minister will tell us what they are.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley referred to fire watching.  I understand that in each forest some employee has the duty of being a fire watcher which I take it is the detection of an outbreak of fire.  I presume there are certain fire precautions and fire drill which are put into operation on the occurrence of fire.  I do not think fires occur very often on forests themselves.  The main danger lies in a fire which is lighted at some distance from the forests, a fire which is caused by the careless action of somebody who does not even take time to think what his careless action may cost in terms of money to the State.</P>
    <P>At this time of the year when people take to the roads picnicking and so on it would pay the State and the Forestry Division, in particular, to ensure that the fire watcher would patrol the area for which he is responsible.  In some cases the area is large and would necessitate his moving about to a great extent.  Everybody should be made to realise the danger of fires which at this time of the year spread very rapidly. This applies particularly to fire for the destruction of whins or furze and to bog fires.  If people were made more conscious of the danger to forestry it should be possible to prevent such damage as occurred in previous years.</P>
    <P>Our forests are a very valuable asset.  They have been planted at considerable cost.  They hold for the country great promise.  They ensure the employment of many people.  In the years to come, we expect they will repay the time and expense involved. It behoves everybody who is in a position to do so, and particularly those living in close proximity to our forests, to bring to the notice of the public at large the danger there is in lighting fires in or near forests. If, after warnings have been given, fires are lighted, then action should be taken to bring home, to those who transgress, the lesson that such conduct will not be tolerated in the future.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is one which we <Col N="96" /> welcome.  Indeed, it is one we would hope to see increased.  We wish the Minister and his officials well in their work.  There should be no clash between the social aspect and the economic aspect of forestry.  Both should move together.  Both should move quickly.  The nation will have no cause to regret as an enlightened policy for the nation will reap the benefits in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that both sides of the House are agreed on a policy of afforestation. Great strides have been made in the last few years, but there is still room for even greater strides.  Today in the west of Ireland there are trees growing on bogland, bogland over which a snipe could hardly walk not so many years ago.  These trees, I think it would be admitted by the Forestry Division, have shown a greater rate of growth than similar trees planted in more fertile soil.  That is certainly a magnificent achievement.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us, when replying, the acreage taken over for planting every year.  I notice that in the last twelve months people in my constituency who have offered land to the Forestry Division are becoming a little discouraged.  They have received an acknowledgment, but that is all.  If that position continues, the day may come when people will stop offering land for afforestation.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us also how workers are recruited?  Are they taken because of suitability? Are they taken from the local employment exchange?  The present gangs of seven men could, I think, be increased.  Such an increase would help to stem the tide of emigration.</P>
      <P>With regard to the acquisition of land for forestry purposes, the Minister and his officials would want to ensure that people are left with sufficient bog to &ldquo;keep the home fires burning&rdquo; during the winter months. I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the work they are doing. I sincerely hope they will continue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in congratulating the Minister <Col N="97" /> and his officials on achieving a target of 25,000 acres planted during the year 1959-60.  If we intend to maintain that, it will be necessary to ensure that the land will be on offer and come to hand.  That may prove to be one of the greatest difficulties confronting the Minister in the future.  I have a few suggestions to make which may help where the intake of land is concerned.</P>
      <P>I notice that in my own county the intake was down considerably last year.  That may be due to the fact that the large tracts have already come into the hands of the Forestry Division and only smaller parcels are now on offer.  The Minister may find it necessary to increase the price for land for afforestation.  I think the maximum is £10 per acre.  I can understand the position of a small farmer with 50 or 60 acres, most of it mountainy with perhaps a few acres at the foot; he offers the land to the Forestry Division and the price quoted is in the region of £5, £6 or £7 per acre.  Even if he were to get the maximum of £10 per acre that would only bring him in £800 or £1,000.  Now he would have considerable difficulty in establishing himself on another farm in Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to consider this matter very seriously.  He will have to increase the present price. Agricultural land has gone up in value and, had land for forestry been in competition with agricultural land, there would be no question of a maximum of £10 per acre.  In Wicklow agricultural land is very highly valued. It was only within the last couple of weeks that the county council was asked to pay £85 for half an acre of land on which to build a cottage so the Minister need have no fear, if he increases his ceiling price, that he will be coming into competition with what we refer to as arable land.  That is one suggestion I make to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see if an arrangement could be arrived at between the Forestry Division and the Land Commission whereby a farmer who would offer his land to the Forestry Division could get an exchange of land, whether it be through the Land Commission <Col N="98" /> or the Forestry Division itself.  There are people who are prepared to give land in exchange for a holding of more arable land, but they are not prepared to take the chance of selling their land to the Forestry Division if it is unlikely that they would qualify for a holding from the Land Commission. Quite an amount of land has been taken over by the Land Commission in Wicklow in recent years and I know of a number of small farmers who would accept an exchange, were such an exchange arranged.  Unfortunately, however, these two offices seem to work independently of one another and if they could be brought into closer association I believe it would bring about better results from the point of view of the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>It is also my belief that if forestry centres were smaller it would bring home more forcibly to the people in the areas in which they would be located the great work that is being done by the Forestry Division.  I have in mind a couple of forestry centres that extend for miles and miles and miles, from one end of county Wicklow to another adjoining the Carlow-Wexford border, and I believe that if a centre were established in between, more land would be forthcoming and greater activity in promoting forestry work would take place as a result.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Forestry Division will only accept an offer of land from a land owner.  I myself have been in telephonic communication with some of the officials in that Division concerning the possibility of taking over certain lands and the reply always was: &ldquo;Get the owner to make an application to us&mdash;to offer the land for sale to us.&rdquo;  I think there should be an arrangement made whereby a local forester could approach people in a district and ask them if they would be prepared to sell their land to the Forestry Division for afforestation purposes.  That would help because there are a number of people who do not know what approaches to make, or what methods are adopted, in offering their land to the Forestry Division and because of that their land does not come on the market. <Col N="99" /> That is all very important, and it is particularly important so far as we are concerned in Wicklow because we fully realise that if land is not forthcoming there will be no employment.</P>
    <P>During the course of his speech this evening Deputy Everett referred to the question of employment.  I, too, should like to ask the Minister seriously to consider doing something about the recent lay-off of men in the Aughrim forestry centre.  It is a pity that men with 15 years' and more experience of forestry work should have their services terminated, particularly when the Forestry Division must have a use for that experience. These men must have picked up a terrific knowledge of forestry work and I suggest that the Minister should seriously consider establishing a nursery in that district.  I appreciate the fact that his Department has already taken over some lands in an adjoining area for nursery purposes but, nevertheless, I think there is room for another nursery in County Wicklow and it is my belief that Aughrim would be an ideal centre for it.  The men are there.  They are experienced in nursery work, and a nursery there would be as economic to operate as nurseries in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>On that point I noticed that Deputy Everett did not repeat the accusation he made here during the debate on the Supplementary Estimate when he suggested that men had been laid off in that area because of their political affiliations. I personally know that supporters of all political Parties happened to be in the group laid off and probably I, more than anybody else, made a nuisance of myself, as far as the Minister was concerned, in making representations on their behalf in an effort to have them re-employed in the Forestry Division.  Maybe the Minister has had this matter investigated and probably has satisfied Deputy Everett because he made no further accusation of that sort.  Personally, I am satisfied it was not the case.</P>
    <P>Another matter referred to by Deputies was the question of fire precautions. There was a place in my constituency <Col N="100" /> where a large plantation was in great danger of being involved in a fire last year.  There is no doubt that millions of pounds worth of trees would have been destroyed had the necessary precautions not been taken over one week-end, and I sincerely hope that it has been a lesson to the Forestry Division.  I was led to believe at the time that everything that might have been done was not done up to then to protect plantations and I sincerely hope that, having had that experience, the people concerned will take all the precautions necessary to protect our forests from the hazards of fire.  I know that tourists and other travellers go through our forests and fires may be caused by pure accident but every precaution should be taken to prevent them.  I shall conclude by again asking the Minister to consider increasing the price offered for land and to consider the establishment of another nursery in County Wicklow at the Augrim centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not take up longer than five minutes.  I was directing the Minister's attention to lands suitable for afforestation on high hills or mountains overlooking the estuaries of rivers such as the Suir.  Lands overlooking the Black-water in County Waterford have been covered with plantations and the view there is comparable to the Rhine.  By planting such lands we would have the double advantage of having good forests and magnificent scenery.  I would commend that aspect to the Minister as a matter he should specially look into.  In his own constituency I have seen wonderful bays <Col N="101" /> and estuaries overlooked by bleak heights of land which, I am sure, could be bought at around the forestry price.  I trust the Minister will give attention to that matter.</P>
      <P>I should also like to deal with the question of mechanisation.  I think we have gone in for too much mechanisation on our roads and we have spent millions on road-making machinery.  I do not think that is desirable when it means an increase in the number of men going to the labour exchanges. It would be better to give these men work rather than have them standing on the roadside looking at these very expensive machines doing the work they should be doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening speech, Sir, the Minister said he hoped to go in for mechanisation both in respect of forestry and of the making of roads through the forests.  That is the matter to which I wanted to draw his attention.  It would be better in country districts where land is available to bring in a big labour force and pay them the decent wages usually paid rather than bring in these enormous machines at great expense. That is all I have to add, Sir, and I am very grateful to you for allowing me say these few words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention once more to an aspect of land acquisition by his Department which should not be allowed continue.  I believe that much of the land acquired for planting in recent years should not have been acquired for forestry purposes.  It is what I would call arable land, not marginal land&mdash;a term I cannot very well understand.  I would make a suggestion to the Minister which, perhaps, might help him get over that problem and ensure that in future there will be less abuse of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Forestry Division see a plot of land, be it 40 or 400 acres, which in their opinion is suitable for planting and see adjacent to it a substantial acreage which would be <Col N="102" /> termed arable by the adjoining farmers and used by them for productive purposes, I suggest the Minister should immediately inform the land acquisition section of the Department of Lands and say to them: &ldquo;We are in the position that we have 300 acres of land that we think is fit for forestry but there is a doubt about some of it which might be termed arable and used for productive purposes.&rdquo;  In those circumstances I think it could be arranged that the Forestry Division would acquire that part of that parcel of land fit for forestry and that the Land Commission could acquire the rest for division amongst the people who had used it for years and who could very well do with it in the future.</P>
    <P>It is true&mdash;and I pointed this out previously in the House&mdash;that many people remark that while we have the Department of Agriculture spending vast sums of money on the reclamation of poorish bog land&mdash;and in some cases it is doubtful if the land will ever be arable&mdash;on the other hand, we have the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands acquiring land that has been usefully tilled by people over a number of years.  With modern methods of farming, machinery, manures and all the rest, that land could be more usefully employed for agricultural purposes in the years ahead.  I think the Minister for Lands would be well advised to have a chat with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, in this regard.  If the Minister will take note of what I say about the work of the two sections in his Department, Forestry and the Land Commission, it might be possible to avoid problems such as that which I raised in the House in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>There is another question to which I wish to refer, and unfortunately I had to raise this matter in the House in recent weeks also.  The Minister admitted that the Forestry Division trapped hares in a certain plantation in County Cork.  He admitted the number of hares that were trapped, although it was not as great at all as the number which I know were trapped.  However, I accept the Minister's information as being what he got.  He also admitted that some <Col N="103" /> pheasants were accidentally caught in those traps.  I think that is a sorry state of affairs and there is no need for such things to happen.  Both hares and pheasants are useful sources of game in the country.  If the Forestry Division wired these lands properly, there should be no hares in them.  I do not see any good reason why the plantation at Ballyheen in county Cork where the Minister admitted those hares were trapped should not have been properly wired.  The Minister gave no reason in his reply and I hope when he is replying to this Estimate he will give the reason the plantation was not properly wired.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Lynch that too much machinery is being used in forestry work today and that it is unfortunate to have the men standing on the roads looking at the work going on while we are paying thousands of pounds importing large machines to do them out of work.  In the early years one of the greatest claims made for forestry was that it would provide much-needed employment.  It has provided a good deal of employment but if we continue with this mechanisation &mdash;in his opening statement the Minister apparently indicated we would and went so far as to say we would have even more mechanisation&mdash;I think we are defeating our own ends completely. Work on forestry is a very useful source of employment, and unfortunately many men are leaving the country.  The Minister should change his policy in that regard.</P>
    <P>In regard to the work on those plantations and on the making of roads he should have an eye on the local labour exchanges and on the labour potentials.  I do not know if the Minister is as conversant as local Deputies are with the unemployment situation but I asked him a question recently as to whether there was an offer of 400 acres of land at a place called Ballyhooley, county Cork.  The Minister said there was no such tract of land on offer to his Department.  I have confirmed, since he made that reply, that there was and still is such an offer but there is a hold-up over which the Minister and his Department <Col N="104" /> have no control.  However, there should be some way of getting around that situation if more common sense were used.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out already quite a few people have lost their employment in forestry in that area in recent weeks and months.  If the Minister could put himself in the place of those people who have become unemployed, or in the place of the public representatives to whom they come when they lose their employment, there would be more sense brought to bear in dealing with people who are awkward with regard to the acquisition of their land.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Brennan of Wicklow who asked the Minister to be more liberal with regard to the price of land.  I join with Deputy Brennan in that request.  If there was a ceiling fixed on the price of land to be acquired for forestry five or ten years ago, it must strike the Minister that land is more valuable now than it was then and that he should be more liberal in the prices offered.  If people having land suitable for forestry thought that they would be meet reasonably, I do not think that the Minister and his Department would meet the opposition that they are now meeting in dealing with such people.  If an individual has only a few sheep on a mountain, with the present price of wool the offer of a few pounds per acre is not enough to entice that individual to sell.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with a Department of State setting up as &ldquo;tanglers&rdquo; where the price of land is concerned but that is just what the Department of Forestry is doing.  First they offer £4 an acre and then they offer £4.10.0.  Then, as a result of representations, they increase the offer to £5.0.0. and eventually the purchase price is settled at £5.5.0.  That is not the kind of business in which a State Department should engage.  They should offer what they believe is the proper value, first and foremost.  I think the Minister admits&mdash;he has said it to me in private conversation&mdash;that that is what they are doing.  I think that such &ldquo;tangling&rdquo; should be cut out as far as State Departments are concerned.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make is that where the Department bought land on which there was a lot of timber useful <Col N="105" /> for firewood and where local people were looking for that timber very often they did not get it.  I know of cases where it was cut down, thrown in a heap and burned in front of them.  That has happened more than once in my experience.  Poor people could have done with that firewood but they did not get it and it was done away with under their eyes.  I am asking the Minister now to make sure that in future he will have a check with the foresters to see that where firewood is available it will be given at a nominal price to local people who need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly shall.  One other point I have to make is that, now that many of the forests are coming to maturity, timber from them should be made available to local mills.  I know of a place and I shall give the Minister the name&mdash;Bally-hooley, the same place I mentioned before in West Cork&mdash;where men have been recently laid off at a local saw mill.  Over a number of years past quite a few people were employed there but recently some of them had to be let go because the proprietor did not have the raw material to keep them working.  That saw mill is surrounded by a State forest and I am asking that some of the timber in that forest should be made available to keep the men working in the saw mill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who know anything about forestry know that much of the timber growing in those forests could be utilised with advantage in such local saw mills.  In many of these places where formerly four or five people were employed there is now only one.  I understand that the owner of this particular saw mill made application to the Forestry Division to have some of this timber made available to him and he was told that it could not be got.  Many of the forests now coming into production should be used to keep such saw mills going. There may have been some good reason why that man did not get the timber but I am making a plea to the <Col N="106" /> Minister that where there are saw mills and where the native timber is available, these saw mills should be given the use of it.</P>
    <P>I believe that the bonus incentive scheme for forestry workers has been very satisfactory.  I must admit that I thought at the start that it was a bad scheme.  I understand that there are quite a few forests where it is not yet in operation.  I wonder if the Minister could indicate how soon he will be able to bring it into operation in every forest in the country.  There is no doubt that it has been a satisfactory scheme and I have to eat my own words in regard to it.  I am now asking the Minister to expedite the introduction of that scheme in forests where it has not already been introduced.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that the Minister should, before acquiring land for forestry, have a chat with the officials of the Land Commission section of his Department and, if it is suitable as arable land and for division purposes, it should be acquired by them and not planted so that people would not be annoyed by looking at good land being utilised for forestry while an attempt is being made to make bad land arable.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to the various points I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We have in County Kildare a particular situation on which I would like the Minister to give me his views.  The Wicklow County Committee of Agriculture is the only one that operates forestry. If I am wrong in thinking that we are unique in Wicklow in that regard I am quite sure that the Minister will correct me very quickly and tell me that other authorities are in the same position.  I want to know from the Minister whether he thinks it desirable that other county committees should follow Wicklow's example or whether he wishes to offer a reason as to why there is no other local forestry authority in the country.  The position arises naturally enough in relation to Kildare when a forest owned by the county committee is cut out.  I <Col N="107" /> think members of the county committee would welcome a declaration as to what is the official Departmental policy in relation to the segregation of forestry publicly planted as between the Department, on the one hand, and the county committee on the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister and I have both had an opportunity since of looking at Section 3.  I said it was a question of looking to the future; the Minister said it was a question of looking to the past.  I think a more accurate description would be that when we get into the future, then it is a question of looking to the past.  What it means is that any allowance which, under the law heretofore enforced, was operative on the 5th April this year can be carried forward hereafter and that when we arrive in the future we can look back.  An allowance that was operative on the 5th April this year can, when we get a long way ahead in the future, be still carried forward if necessary.  As far as I understand, that is what it means.</P>

      <Col N="108" /> SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great difficulty in understanding the section. Part of my difficulty arises from the construction of subsection 9 which defines capital allowances.  As I understand it, capital allowances mean allowances that are not income allowances, allowances that are not normally allowed against profits for the assessment of tax.  For example, a depreciation allowance is not a capital allowance but an allowance such as was included in 1950 Act for building, and the one that is amended to cover a hotel in this Bill&mdash;the subsection that says that the building allowance will be 10 per cent. for a hotel&mdash; would be.</P>
      <P>As I understand the situation, that building allowance is a capital allowance but a depreciation allowance is not a capital allowance.  If I am in wrong in that, I have misunderstood the section and if I am right in that I do not understand subsection 3.  It means that the terminal loss includes the loss in the trade&mdash;and that is what I might call the income loss, perhaps.</P>
      <P>Then it goes on in paragraph (b) to mention &ldquo;the relevant capital allowances for that year of assessment.&rdquo; What I am not clear on there is whether that loss is the annual figure or the proportionate figure for the portion of the year in which the trade ends.  Then I am completely foxed by the relevance of paragraph 3 of subsection (3).  Why do we take in the preceding year when we have already taken in the year of assessment itself in paragraph (a)?  I should have thought that the question that would arise would be in relation to (a) and (b) on the one hand or, alternately, (c) and (d) because I thought one could be charged only in relation to the terminal year for the proportion of it that had passed until the end of the year in which the business was carried on until termination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that by bringing in the 12 months before the date of discontinuance, something new is being brought in and if it is brought in from <Col N="109" /> the point of view of carrying back loss, is it not also being brought in from the point of view of additional assessment?</P>
    <P>There is also a provision that I do not quite follow.  This arises if the business was permanently discontinued in the current year of assessment, that is in 1960/61, as provided in subsection (12).  I do not understand that because I thought the situation was that if the business was discontinued in 1960/61, in any event without this section at all, the loss, if it were incurred in 1960/61, could be carried back into 1959/60.  I thought that this part of the Bill was to ensure that you could carry back for more than a year.  I understood the situation was that if you had a loss in the last year you could carry it back for one year only.  Perhaps I have misread it; it is a complicated section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>Does that make sense to the Minister?

Life insurance in an individual case is assessable.  The profit is assessed; tax having being charged on that, a deduction is then taken off <Col N="110" /> the tax so paid.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there is some reason for drafting this section as it is drafted, because subsection (1), which is amended, says that it has effect as from the commencement of Section 7 of the Finance Act of 1932. By and large, that means from 1932 up to the present date in respect of certain securities.  Then it goes on to say in subsection (2): &ldquo;Where a certificate is given by virtue of this section...&rdquo; Yet, notwithstanding that, we have gone back, through subsection (1).  There must be some reason why it is drafted in this way. The normal method would be that the whole section would become operative as from the date of a certificate given after the passing of this Act, but in fact it says that the 1932 Act is to have been deemed always to have included that provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) brings in all securities before or after, but subsection (2) includes certificates already issued in certain cases and is just to provide that there will not be a duplication of some shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if a certificate has already been issued it must have been in respect of a security that was issued since the passing of the 1932 Act and what we are putting in now is what has happened after the passing of the Finance Act of 1932? If it is only a matter of drafting, I am satisfied, but it seems to be an odd method.</P>

      <P>I understand that. I do not understand the passage which says that the subsection is amended with effect as from the commencement of Section 7 of the Finance Act of 1932.  Why should it be amended with effect as from the commencement of Section 7 of the 1932 Act when, in the next subsection, you say the <Col N="112" /> amendment cannot have any effect until after the issue of a certificate? The two seem to be contradictory.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) says that though relief can be given in respect of securities issued before or after 1932, they cannot begin before the certificate is issued.  In other words, I think, relief is given only after the passing of this Act.</P>

      <P>Of course, there are certain benefits given to people who invest their money in company securities within the State but this was recently brought in as an incentive to small savings, particularly aimed at the Savings Banks and Post Office bank.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of this section is, of course, that the harbour authority is a non-profit-making authority and, as the Minister has included the harbour authority, there are certain other non-profit-making authorities that I think should also have been included.  The one that comes to my mind particularly is the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  That is a non-profit-making body, a body that was set up specifically by the State to carry out a certain type of insurance to arrange for a certain type of very necessary saving for the purpose of providing that people should make their own provision against illness and misfortune.  As the Minister has in this section included one non-profit-making authority&mdash;and I think it is fair to describe a harbour authority as a non-profit-making body&mdash;he should have gone a bit wider and included also the Voluntary Health Insurance Board because that is a body of the same sort. On its power to expand and on its power, by its expansion, to attract new business will depend its success and, of course, let us be quite frank about it, its success will save the Exchequer considerable money on the Health Vote and will save the local authorities as well, quite apart from its being an excellent principle of our social code that people should look after themselves in so far as they are able to do so.</P>
      <P>This matter was on the stocks prior to the time that I left office and as the Minister has now included one non-profit-making authority I would urge him to include others and certainly the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the harbours were regarded as profit-making.  Otherwise we would not have to deal with them.  The Deputy is perhaps using that expression in another sense, that they are non-profit-making in the sense that they are not paying dividends or anything like that.  They were regarded as profit-making and therefore had to be exempt from income tax if we wanted to allow them to build up, and so on. Voluntary health insurance is a thing that has been considered.  It must be remembered that very big concessions <Col N="115" /> were given to the people concerned there.  Every person paying a premium&mdash;I think the Deputy himself brought that in&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every person paying a premium is exempt from income tax on that part of his income.  Having been given a very substantial help, they are not the most urgently in need of relief of this kind.  Again, of course, as the Deputy is very well aware, when considering a case of that kind one always has to consider those who are practically in the same category and may claim relief in the same way. However, it has not been overlooked. I may say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely because I felt it was in the same category as the harbour board that I mentioned it now.  I think the Minister is right in correcting me when I said a non-profit-making body.  It was because they were technically profit-making that they are assessable.  A more correct description would be bodies which plough back their profits and do not pay dividends.  It would seem to me that the door has been opened here and I would press the Minister to open it more in relation to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. It would be a highly desirable thing from the State's point of view because it would ultimately mean the extension of a very sound social principle that those who can afford to look after themselves in misfortune should themselves make provision against that misfortune rather than rely on the State.  Perhaps the Minister would prefer that I would put down an amendment on Report Stage so that we could discuss it then?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the law stands here an Irish resident who has investments in a private company here&mdash;I do not know whether it would apply to a public company or not; it is not likely to apply to a public company&mdash;if he gets a dividend out of capital profits he is not liable to income tax on it. If an English resident has money invested in a private company in England, he is in exactly the same position; he does not pay income tax on the dividend from the company.  As the law stands, however, if an English person comes to live here and is interested in a private company outside and if there is a capital profit dividend, he has to pay income tax.  It is a very peculiar situation.</P>
      <P>I was asked about this by letter from a certain person whom I do not know personally.  I passed it to the Revenue Commissioners.  They thought they would deal with it for one year.  They regard it as fraught with danger of exploitation.  So the Deputy will notice it is done only for one year.  It can be continued from year to year as long as we see no danger in it.  The Revenue Commissioners think there is danger of exploitation if it were continued. Therefore, we are doing it, as it were, experimentally.</P>

      <P>This section is one of the kernels to which we on this side of the House take violent exception in this Bill.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read subsection (1), once a person carries on a trade or business then the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="118" /> are taking power to demand from that person particulars of all the payments he makes outside his trade or business.  Once you carry on a trade or business in any one thing, regardless of the fact that your trade or business may be concerned, shall we say, with harness-making, if the Revenue Commissioners want to get information about any other aspect of your private life that has no relation whatever to harness-making they still can ask for it.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my first amendment, No. 3, is to restrict the information for which they can ask to something that is connected with the particular trade or business which they are examining.  A person can, of course, have other businesses and it seems to me that this restriction in relation to the particular trade that is under inquiry is one that does not need any further commendation.  It seems to me the proper way of dealing with it.  So much for subsection (1) which deals with a person carrying on a trade or business.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2), however, goes far and away beyond that.  It is not a question of a person carrying on a trade or business but carrying on any activity.  When we get to that we are going miles away. &ldquo;Activity&rdquo; is not defined; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I cannot say where &ldquo;activity&rdquo; is defined and therefore, as far as I can see, it means everything. I do not really understand the purpose of this subsection at all.  It infringes, and infringes violently, the ordinary rights and privacy of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the interpretation of this section and the objections taken to this section are not objections which are being taken by me alone, or objections taken by anybody for a political purpose.  The Incorporated Law Society are extremely perturbed about this section, and rightly so.  I have not the slightest objection to giving any particulars about anybody who is paid in my business, whether I pay him salary or commission or anything else, but I object violently to being made break the seal of privacy, the seal of privilege <Col N="119" /> I have in relation to the affairs of my clients.</P>
    <P>As I read the section now I am bound, if the Revenue Commissioners ask me, to disclose under penalty where I have paid anything in excess of £15 to anybody in relation to any activity.  If a payment is made by me as a solicitor it is undoubtedly made in the course of my business.  It may be made on behalf of a client, and it should be clear beyond question that the privilege that must exist between the professional person and his client is protected.</P>
    <P>I want to put another case to the Minister in relation to subsection (1) as it is, if not amended, and also subsection (2).  Can the Revenue Commissioners ask me to make a return to them of all the fees I have paid counsel during the year on behalf of my clients?  I am not paying those.  I am paying them as agent for a client but under this provision I can be asked to go back <i>ad infinitum.</i>  When I say &ldquo;go back <i>ad infinitum&rdquo;</i> I am speaking of something that will happen in the future going back to the past.  The position must be that in so far as payments are concerned it is only a payment I made on or after 6th April, 1960, but in 1970, for example, under this section the Revenue Commissioners can say to me: &ldquo;Give us a list of the payments you made to &lsquo;X&rsquo; or that you made in connection with any client in the year 1960&rdquo;&mdash;10 years afterwards.  That is fantastic.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister saying to me that the Revenue Commissioners will exercise this power reasonably and well.  That is not the point.  The point is that the law should provide that only reasonable information may be extracted, such information as will not cut across privilege and, secondly, such information as is absolutely necessary and can be shown to be necessary for the purpose of preventing evasion.</P>
    <P>There is no use in taking a sledge hammer to crack a nut.  On the Second Reading, the Minister indicated that what he wanted to do&mdash;as far as I understand him, at any rate&mdash;was to catch the case in which a person was genuinely employed but was paid <Col N="120" /> something other than salary.  I thought that person was caught by the Finance Act of 1958, which was discussed <i>ad infinitum</i> here.  I am amazed to discover that that case is not covered.  If that is all the Minister is at, presumably the Revenue Commissioners can ask for a return in regard to such a person in the same way as they ask now for returns in relation to those who are paid salaries.  I do not know whether the Minister is suggesting that there is no power vested in the Revenue Commissioners to ask for a return of salaries.  Certainly the Revenue Commissioners issue enough forms in that regard and I think there is a statutory obligation on every employer to make a return of all the moneys paid to employees.  That is not the same as this.  This goes far, far wider.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne, when speaking earlier, referred to the manner in which the Revenue Commissioners do not always copy sections in British Bills which are in easement, though they invariably copy the sections that catch one.  I shall leave him to deal with the reason why paragraph (c) of Section 20 of the British Bill has been omitted from subsection (5) here.  The result is that this Bill is far more onerous, far more stringent, far more difficult than is the British Bill from the point of view of people carrying on business.  Who will pay for all the returns that will be required here?  The employer?  There will be more and more requests for employers to do the work of the Revenue Commissioners.  This is a request to provide lists of people carrying on widespread activities irrespective of whether or not those activities are taxable. There is no suggestion in subsection (2) that the reference is to taxable activities.  It is &ldquo;any activity&rdquo;.  I do not see why there is any necessity for this wide net of this type in our circumstances here.  So far as solicitors discussing the business of clients are concerned, that is something that could not be supported and should not be permitted.</P>
    <P>There is another point I think I should mention.  If by any possibility the section covers it I hope that it will be amended.  It is difficult to discuss these amendments apart from the section <Col N="121" /> but I shall try to avoid repetition as far as I can.  There is a provision in Section 40 of the Finance Act, 1924 &mdash;I think the provision appears in the 1928 Act also&mdash;by virtue of which the Revenue Commissioners are exempted from their seal of secrecy in relation to the taxation authorities of Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Does this mean now that, under this section, payments made to people outside the jurisdiction can be disclosed?  In my view that would be an unthinkable situation.  Under the earlier section to which I referred the obligation as to secrecy imposed by any enactment &ldquo;shall not prevent and shall be deemed never to have prevented the disclosure to any authorised officer of the Government of Northern Ireland any such facts as may be necessary&rdquo; etc.  I think that is in the 1928 Act, but I have not been able to trace it successfully so far.  That would be after the double taxation agreement was brought in.</P>
    <P>As this section is drafted, it would be permissible to transmit payments that arise on a list here to the other Governments concerned.  That is something that should not be lightly put through this House.  I want to make it clear that, so far as I am concerned, (1)  I do not understand the necessity for this section at all; (2) in relation to a trade or business, I think it must be clear that the list in question must be restricted to the trade or business that is under inquiry; (3) I see no reason whatever for the inclusion of the widespread, rambling net to cover any activity.  It is not even restricted to any taxable activity and, in effect, it means therefore that it covers everything that one does over and above the minimum lump sum provision.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has had transmitted to him the representations made by the Council of the Incorporated Law Society and their anxiety in relation to this matter, an anxiety which, I might add, was expressed by the Council before I had any discussion with any member of the Council or any of the officials of the Law Society.  If this is to cover any payment made by a solicitor on behalf of a client there is, first of all, the question of privilege and, secondly, the <Col N="122" /> cost of providing these returns will be quite substantial.  I do not know who will pay for it; I am quite certain the Minister will not.  Probably the poor solicitor will have to carry the baby.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at quite a loss to understand what is the necessity for this section.  I should have thought that the Revenue Commissioners already possessed adequate powers to obtain information from taxpayers and I think that this is really an unwarranted extension of their powers which is being given effect to in a very cumbersome manner.  As Deputy Sweetman said, it is all very well for the Minister to say, as I think he said on Second Stage, that the Commissioners will be reasonable in their approach to this matter and in using these powers but that undertaking by the Minister is not necessarily binding on individual inspectors.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage Deputy Sweetman spoke of the officious official who can sometimes avail of his powers in a rigorous and harsh manner.  While we are all aware that the vast majority&mdash;99 per cent.&mdash;of the staff of the Revenue Commissioners are most considerate persons, there is always the exception to the rule and we should bear that in mind when dealing with legislation of this nature.  This section is, of course, almost a complete copy of Section 20 of the British Finance Act of 1956 with subsection (5), paragraph (c) of that Act omitted.  This afternoon the Minister took me to task when I suggested that we too frequently emulate the British authorities when we turn the screw tighter on those in the tax net, and too rarely do we emulate them when they loosen their grip.  The subsection of the equivalent British provision to which I have referred, subsection (5), paragraph (c) of the British Finance Act of 1956, placed a curb or restraint on these powers which we have not copied, and I would urge upon the Minister that he should think twice about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision enables the individual inspector to serve a notice on any person carrying on trade or business to provide details of payments <Col N="123" /> made for services rendered for any valuable consideration and the position is that in ten years' time, as Deputy Sweetman said, not having availed of the powers under this section in the interval, the individual inspector can serve notice on a taxpayer requiring him to extract information from his records relating to certain types of payments made to certain individuals.  I could envisage a situation in which the Revenue Commissioners might be carrying out a special investigation into a taxpayer and they might serve a notice on those with whom they would have expected him to do business, those who might have been paying funds to him, to provide them with information, and it would be terribly difficult for any taxpayer to delve back into his records for ten years.</P>
    <P>These records may even have been destroyed and yet, if the person who is served with notice does not supply the information sought, he is subject to all sorts of dreadful penalties which may be imposed upon him in quite an arbitrary manner, certain minimum penalties, without appeal.  I would urge, first of all, that the Minister should drop this whole section and, secondly, if he will not do that, I would urge upon him that he should restrain inspectors from going back beyond a certain period.  I would suggest two or three years which is the case in Britain.  The inspectors there are restrained from serving demands which would require the taxpayer to delve back into the past beyond three years.</P>
    <P>On the question of the definition of &ldquo;services rendered&rdquo; in subsection (1) I wonder could the Minister elaborate for us as to what we are to understand by that term &ldquo;services&rdquo;?  Are they confined to personal services rendered by, say, a professional person or some type of commission agent rather than to services rendered as commercial transactions, say, by a carrier?  It is difficult to envisage the examples.  I should think that it would be very desirable that the type of payments about which information can be exacted should be restricted to <Col N="124" /> payments in the nature of remuneration for personally performed services.</P>
    <P>I have other points to make on this section but I think they would be more appropriate to the section as a whole rather than to the individual amendments.  It is difficult to consider subsection (1) apart from subsection (10) which does elaborate somewhat on the question of services but again it does not define them.  It merely says what they &ldquo;include,&rdquo; and it is noteworthy that they include payments made by way of expenses incurred and also include any payments which could be said to constitute valuable consideration.  I have a certain set of circumstances in mind. At one time payments in kind were not subject to tax but they are now and under this section a taxpayer may be compelled to provide details of such payments in kind, or of payments which could be said to constitute valuable consideration in the nature of gifts.</P>
    <P>Supposing one professional man does a favour for another without charge and supposing as an ordinary act of courtesy the second man sends him some little gift as an act of gratitude-supposing he even sends flowers to his wife&mdash;does that constitute valuable consideration?  Under this section will he be compelled to provide details of such transactions?  It appears to me that on the face of it it may.  I am quite sure the Minister himself has not got such transactions in mind when he is bringing in these proposals, but if the power is there we can only presume at some stage somebody or other is going to avail of it, and I think that is very desirable.</P>

      <P>The object of a clause of this kind, which comes into the Finance Acts very frequently, is to make sure as far as we possibly can that everybody pays his fair share of income tax.  Nobody likes paying income tax in this country, or in any other country either.  But one thing that would make it a little more tolerable for the taxpayer would be the belief that everybody is made pay.  What creates great discontent among taxpayers <Col N="125" /> is that certain people are getting away with it and are not being made to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why any Deputy would object to provision being made to make as sure as we can that everybody is paying his fair share of income tax.  As the law stands, there is no power to require a person to give information about remuneration paid otherwise than to employees.  This clause is brought in now to cover the cases of persons not regarded as employees.  I do not think there would be a very big number brought in under this clause. The Deputy will learn from reading the section that no action is required of an employer unless a notice is served upon him by an inspector.  No employer need have any of these terrors hanging over him at all if no notice is served on him because no penalty can be inflicted until the notice is first served and, secondly, until he disobeys it.</P>
      <P>I do not see how Deputy Sweetman can read certain things into this clause.  Take, for instance, the case of a solicitor.  What he pays to a client is not for services rendered and, therefore, does not come under it.  I presume what the Deputy has in mind is a case where he has funds to distribute to his clients as a result of a successful civil action or he might have funds to distribute as a result of a settlement of a will or something else.  The client does not get that money from the solicitor for services rendered and therefore this does not apply.  If a solicitor pays counsel, counsel has not rendered any service to the solicitor.  He may have rendered it to the client, but not to the solicitor.  Counsel is engaged on behalf of his client and therefore there is no reason why he should disclose, although indeed I do not see why there should be any great objection to disclosing in that particular case.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman raised this question of the Revenue Commissioners being absolved from secrecy.  We should be careful about that point because we do not want the people to think generally that the Revenue Commissioners can publish or make known their financial circumstances from the returns made to them.  That is not the case.  When the Income Tax Agreement was made with Great Britain and Northern Ireland, it was obvious that the Revenue Commissioners and the Revenue Commissioners on the other side could not possibly carry out that Agreement if they were bound to secrecy.  There was an exception made in that case, that if the Revenue Commissioners here passed on information to the Revenue Commissioners in England about a certain person who had, let us say, a residence in both countries, they were not in that case departing from their obligation of secrecy.  But in no other case are the Revenue Commissioners absolved from secrecy.</P>
      <P>I am not sufficiently versed in the interpretation of law to say, but I do not think that information gathered under this section will ever come under the notice of the Commissioners from the point of view of double taxation because it says that it is for services rendered by persons ordinarily resident in the State.  If they are ordinarily resident in this State I do not think this question of double income tax applies.</P>

      <P>We certainly could put that in.  Coming to the two amendments we are now discussing, the first amendment proposed by the Deputy here is that he wants to have &ldquo;the trade&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;that trade&rdquo;.  I do not know exactly what the Deputy has in mind there.  If the Deputy is not anxious to push that amendment and withdraws it, I shall certainly ask the draftsman whether in his opinion it would strengthen the Bill in any way if we were to meet the wishes of the Deputy.  However, I do not know exactly what the Deputy has in mind.</P>
      <P>In the second amendment the Deputy wants to delete subsection 2. Subsection 2 deals with a body of persons carrying on activity which does not constitute a trade or business. When I first saw this draft I was rather curious myself to know what was particularly covered by it.  I got a few notes at the time.  Take a professional organisation, let us say a professional institute or organisation.  It does not carry on a trade or business.  A learned foundation&mdash;An Foras Talúntais, for instance&mdash;does not carry on a trade or business.  An industrial federation, such as the Employers' Federation, would be another example, or any local authority.  There would be just as much reason to require information from these bodies I have mentioned as there would be from an ordinary trade or business.</P>
      <P>From that point of view, I do not see why the Deputy should be anxious to have it deleted.  I think the Deputy was afraid that a person like a solicitor would have his confidential business intruded upon.  I do not think there is any danger of that whatever.  I do not see for what information the Revenue Commissioners could ask a solicitor apart from that in regard to his employees except in a particular case where he is paying a fee to somebody or other in connection with his own business.  For instance, let us say he employed an architect to give him an opinion on his business house.  The Revenue Commissioners in that case might be curious to know something about the architect and might ask for the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the type of case that I can imagine would arise in the case <Col N="128" /> of a solicitor.  It does not definitely apply to his staff because they are his employees; it does not definitely apply to his clients because there is no service rendered and it does not definitely apply to counsel because a solicitor employs counsel on behalf of his client and in that connection counsel is not rendering services to the solicitor.  I do not know, therefore, what anxiety the Deputy has with regard to this section.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies said that we had left out clause (c) in Subsection 5, the clause that no information could be required further back than three years. That is their objection to it and I have no objection to that.  I must say that the Revenue Commissioners mentioned that to me when they were doing this section and I said to them: &ldquo;Surely you have no intention of going back three years&rdquo; and they replied that they had not.  I have no objection to that part of the Deputy's argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall be glad to take the Minister at his word in respect of the last portion of his remarks and include an amendment on the Report Stage.  I do not like quarrelling with the Minister when I am sure that he has taken advice before making a statement such as the one he just made but I think that he is wrong. The section says that every person in trade or business is to make a return of payments made in the course of the trade or business for services rendered by persons ordinarily resident in the State and not employees in the trade or business.  It is not for services rendered to the person who is asked to make the returns.  It is for services rendered to anybody about which the person who is required to make the return has knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is right in saying that if I am acting on behalf of a client, the architect or counsel concerned is employed by the client and I am merely the agent.  That is correct but under clause (a) I am bound to make all those returns because I am the person making the return and I am required to make returns of all payments <Col N="129" /> made to persons ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The clause says payments made to a person in a trade or business for services rendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Once I am a solicitor I make payments to a person in a trade or business, to an architect or counsel or anybody like that because that is a necessary part of the business of a solicitor.  He has to do those things for his clients.  Once it is part of his business to do those things for his clients, these are payments made in the course of his business.  When I get an architect to look at my own house it is not my business but as this is phrased at the moment every person that comes into my solicitor's office becomes part of my business and any payments made on that client's behalf becomes my business because my business is to take a client's money in for certain purposes and pay it out for other purposes.  That is my business and the disbursements I make are in the course of my business.</P>
      <P>Let me say this to the Minister, that this is not solely my own interpretation of the Section.  It is an interpretation put on it by other people who are reasonably good at construction.  Every payment a solicitor has to make is made in the course of his business. Every payment that passes through a solicitor's office can be included in these notices.  I am not going to inquire as to what will be acted on or what will not be acted on.  I know what the Revenue Commissioners will do.  They will make out a form as they have made out a form for employees at the present moment, as they have a form for the return of interest on which tax is not deductible at the source.  They will issue these forms broadcast and have everybody rushing around trying to put together the information required here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Section is intended to cover payments that I make on my own behalf alone then it is not properly drafted.  If it is intended to cover payments which I make on my own behalf <Col N="130" /> alone, which is the case the Minister has made, where I employ an architect for my own office premises, then that is not only what is covered in the Section.</P>
    <P>The reason that I want to press Amendment 3 is that I want to be quite clear that when a person happens to carry on two businesses the notices must be segregated.  I do not like this section at all.  I doubt very much that clause (a) provides that the notices should be segregated and that a person carrying on two businesses cannot have them caught in the one notice.  I am not prepared to say that my reading of the section in that respect is unchallengable. I am not quite happy about it myself but I want it to be quite clear that a notice can refer only to one business and that if a person carries on more than one business it must be dealt with in a second notice.</P>
    <P>As far as amendment 4 is concerned the subsection is not restricted to the type of case which the Minister mentions.  If it were it is a matter that could be considered in an entirely different light.  The subsection as it is, in cases where two people go out to do anything at all, two people, for example, who engage in the business of broadcasting, two people who engage in the business of advertising carnivals or boxing matches, is not restricted to the local authorities, as the Minister mentions, or to the Institute of Chartered Secretaries or the Institute of Chartered Accountants.</P>
    <P>I can see nothing anywhere which restricts the operation of this section to the type of body, to the type of activity that the Minister suggests. The type of body that the Minister suggests is akin, I agree, to the firm or company carrying on business.  I take it there is no doubt that the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in Section 9 means person in the legal sense, that is, an individual, a firm or company, but the way it is framed does not restrict this section to the persons or the bodies that the Minister has mentioned.  It throws the net completely open.  If three people go to the races and decide to pool their bets they are a body of <Col N="131" /> persons carrying on an activity for that day and they could be asked to make the return under this section.  That is an extreme case, of course, but the analogy that the Minister has suggested is one part of the subsection only. It covers cases a great deal wider than that.  Surely the Minister will come this far with the House, that when one places a burden&mdash;and it is going to be a burden and a trouble&mdash; on an individual or body of individuals &mdash;the legislation must restrict that burden to the narrowest point where it is necessary to impose it for the common good.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it would be far better if everybody paid the income tax to which they are legally liable.  I have no sympathy at all with the person who trousers the fees that are paid to him and does not disclose them for tax purposes but I want to be quite sure that when you are catching that person you are not going to catch the innocent person as well and impose on him undue hardship, an undue amount of trouble and expense.  It certainly seems to me that this subsection as drafted at present will do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it unreasonable to ask the Minister to indicate the extent to which these powers are likely to be used.  It is all very well for us to reproduce here provisions such as this from the British Finance Acts but there is one most important circumstance that operates here which does not apply in Britain&mdash;the question of hardship which Deputy Sweetman has mentioned. If these powers are widely used, they will cause a lot of trouble and expense for those who have to dig out this information.  As a professional accountant I fear that the brunt of this section will fall on the professional accountants and auditors who are acting as tax consultants to the various taxpayers concerned.  I suggest to the Minister that, while in Britain wealthy concerns can well afford to provide all the information exacted from them, that position does not apply here and it cannot be too <Col N="132" /> strongly emphasised that these powers which create hardship should be used very sparingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Minister desires to achieve two things.  The first is to ensure that every person carrying on a trade or business i.e., an employer&mdash;I think he described him&mdash;shall, if directed to do so give to the Revenue Commissioners information with regard to payments described in the marginal note here as &ldquo;fees, commissions, etc.&rdquo;  Secondly, that persons who cannot be described as traders or persons carrying on business would be required to give similar information.  In the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Finance Bill I think the Minister's intent is set out very clearly where it says that Section 9 empowers the Revenue Commissioners to obtain information about payments made by traders and others in respect of services rendered by persons not employed by them.  I think that marginal note of the Bill itself does correspond generally with what the Minister deems to be the purpose of this section but I must agree with Deputies Sweetman and Byrne and the section as written here certainly appears to me to go far deeper and further than the Minister's explanation would infer. It seems to me that in order to bring it only within the ambit of the Minister's wishes some amendment of the section would be required and Deputy Sweetman has put down an amendment to delete the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; and insert the word &ldquo;that&rdquo;.  I do not know whether that would altogether cover his purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Such trade,&rdquo; or &ldquo;his trade,&rdquo; might be better.  I think Deputy Sweetman's idea is to ensure that particulars of fees, commissions or payments for services will be confined to payments made to persons who have rendered services to the person so concerned and not payments generally that he may know about, say, between a second and third party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> I do not know whether it would be possible to insert it there in Section 9, subsection (1) (a) &ldquo;payments made in the course of his trade...&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;the trade or business&rdquo;.  That to my mind would make it more specific than putting in &ldquo;the trade or business&rdquo; as the section reads at present.  In subsection (2) I must agree that the wording, &ldquo;Every body of persons carrying on any activity...&rdquo; to my mind, appears limitless.  It could cover any activity by any two persons in the State.  I do not think the &ldquo;Minister intended that should be so.  As I understand it, I think his intention is to bring within the net of the general body of taxpayers those who, for one reason or another, can now evade tax, an aim with which those of us who have to pay tax, completely agree.</P>
    <P>I think he is going rather too far in that and I suggest that, perhaps, on the Report Stage the Minister might redraft subsection (2) to bring it into line generally with the purposes which he expressed in the House.  I understand the Minister wants to ensure that people not employed, traders, business people, professional people or other bodies of persons, who get fees or commissions or some other form of reward for services rendered, will pay tax on those services.  If that is the Minister's intention I think the section could have been drafted more specifically to mean that and that only.  It seems to me to go further afield and to include almost any business and any activity carried on by two persons. It is ridiculous if two persons were to employ an undertaker to bury a member of their family that they would have to return that under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this section with a very considerable amount of suspicion because it appears to be a taxation provision which is very curiously worded.  I agree with Deputy Russell that the Minister did make his intention very clear and that his explanatory memorandum is very useful in giving an idea of the intention. I agree also that the marginal note gives an even clearer vision of what is meant, but the section does not say precisely what is intended at <Col N="134" /> all.  It does not even give &ldquo;fees or commissions&rdquo; which are referred to in the marginal note.</P>
      <P>I can see the reason the Minister wants to make taxable a certain income which, at the moment, is very considerable, and I think anybody in business knows that it is considerable. I am talking of middlemen.  There are considerable sums being paid in respect of introduction in business by business men to people not in their employment and I can see that the Revenue Commissioners feel that should be got after.  However, I do not believe for a moment that this section will have the desired effect.</P>
      <P>Deputy P. Byrne made the fanciful suggestion that the bouquet of flowers to the wife might be made returnable. It was a fanciful suggestion because there are many easier ways than that.  You need not even go near the wife.  You can make a gift in kind to somebody or other and leave the wife quite out of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>There are those people who act as middlemen, introducing two parties together who do not already know each other.  A tremendous amount of income is received by these middlemen, but if you cannot pay the man for making those introductions by way of commission you will be able to reward him in some other way which will defeat the Revenue Commissioners. The drafting of this appals me because it is far too wide.  I can see exactly what is intended, but I do not think the drafting has carried that out at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is this matter in respect of payments made for services rendered. The most obvious service that occurs to me is that rendered by the Post Office where a person in business pays the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for services rendered by him.  He is not an employee, but he is rendering a service to the business man in connection with his business.  I can quite <Col N="135" /> see that the Minister might say that is an even more stupid and more fanciful suggestion than that of Deputy Byrne. But it is quite possible and if the power is given to an inspector of taxes to ask for such a rendering, a business man or a professional man would have to consider all those points.</P>
    <P>I feel that once you give the Revenue Commissioners power to do these things it is no use saying you can rely on them to be reasonable.  That may be all right at the present time.  But we do not know what the situation may be in a few years.  I must say again that I fear the drafting of this section is too wide and too vague and appals me.  I hope the Minister will agree to going back to this period of three years.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Russell that the whole drafting of this section needs careful review.  If I were given half a chance by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I should like to develop the point of how hopeless it is to try and track down these payments at all and how futile it is to chase income rather than expenditure.</P>
    <P>Immediately this goes through, there will not only be solicitors, and accountants but business men who will be finding the quickest and easiest way around it and it will not take them more than five seconds to do so.  It seems to me to be a waste of time bringing it in and a dangerous way of bringing it in as well.  The inspector of taxes, with the punitive powers given to him, will be able to force a person to make a return which, in good faith, he may try to make but which may be incomplete and land him in severe penalities.  I am not at all happy with this section as it stands.</P>
    <P>However, I cannot see how it could be redrafted to say precisely what the Minister means.  I think it is worth commenting that the marginal note refers to fees and commissions.  The section refers to neither.  As I have already said, there is unlimited scope as the section is drafted but I cannot even suggest an amendment.  All I can do is ask the Minister, with his advisers, to look into the whole section <Col N="136" /> again very closely to see whether there is a point at all whether bringing in this would not lead to evasion on an even larger scale or whether bringing it in in its present form would give a power to inspectors of taxes which may greatly embarrass individuals and bodies in a way they should not be embarrassed by asking them to answer absolutely impossible questions.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Sweetman's reference to his amendment, I should like to assure him that when I read paragraph (a) of subsection (1) I take it to mean that service is rendered to the particular trade or business.  I am sure that what my Department asked for was that it be made quite clear the services were rendered to the trade or business and that this was given as covering that particular point and no other. However, I shall ask the Attorney General again about that point to make sure whether there is any doubt about it and I undertake to bring in an amendment if there is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman spoke of a person carrying on two businesses.  He wanted them to be kept separate as far as this is concerned.  I believe &ldquo;the trade&rdquo; has that meaning.  I do not think that Deputies mean it but they do give the impression that they are afraid the Revenue Commissioners will get too much information.  I do not see what harm it would be if the Revenue Commissioners got more information.  If they simply come across some information that will make a man pay income tax who is not paying already, that is all to the good.</P>

      <P>That is a different matter. There are two points.  If the Revenue Commissioners get too much information, I do not see any harm in that. If the Revenue Commissioners have power to ask for information that is unreasonable and do ask for it, I admit Deputies have a right to be careful that those carrying on the trade or business are not put to unnecessary trouble in looking up <Col N="137" /> information for them.  I do not think it could be claimed that there is anything very onerous on a business or profession or trade in the section.  The inspector has to ask for the particular information and if he does not get it there is a penalty.  We know that in all these matters a penalty is necessary to ensure that certain people obey the law.  The great majority will give the information when asked for it but to get certain people to give information the penalty is required.</P>
      <P>With regard to subsection (2), Deputy Sweetman and other Deputies made the point that any two persons might come under this.  Possibly any two persons might but if it is necessary to get after two persons who are paying some person for services rendered, it is all right.  Why not get after them if they must be got after in that way?  It is not likely, however, that it will apply to any two persons because it says &ldquo;Every body of persons carrying on an activity which does not constitute a trade or business.&rdquo;  That is more likely to point to the type of organisation that I already mentioned here.  I do not think it is likely to apply to any two persons but, if it does, there is no harm in looking for information from them also.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister change the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; activity to &ldquo;an&rdquo; activity.  Actually when he was reading it the Minister read it that way: &ldquo;Every body of persons carrying on an activity&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;any activity&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Before I sit down I would give this further undertaking to Deputy Sweetman, that although I am assured that the clause as drafted has the meaning that he is looking for in subsection (1), I shall make further inquiries directly from the Attorney-General and if there is any doubt about it I shall certainly bring in some wording which will be more specific on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Do I understand the Minister correctly when I say that he is prepared to agree to restrict the return provided by this section to payments made for services rendered to the person who makes the return in his own right and not to services rendered to someone else but for whom the person concerned has to pay?  I want to be quite clear beyond question that even though I am making payments in the course of my business on behalf of client X I am not under any obligation to disclose any of the business of client X.  If I pay an architect to provide plans for redesigning my office and if I pay the same architect on behalf of my client Patrick Murphy for designing a house for him, I want to be clear beyond question that this section restricts the Revenue Commissioners to asking me for the fee that I have paid in respect of my own office and that the section does not enable the Revenue Commissioners to ask me for the fee that I have paid on behalf of Patrick Murphy to the person concerned.  From what the Minister says now, that is what the Minister wants to get also.</P>

      <P>Then we can wait. I thought so myself in the first instance but I am assured by others more competent than I who have examined the section that that is not what the section means and the section will have to be clarified by putting some words in paragraph (a) which could be followed on in the others&mdash; restricting the services rendered to services rendered to that person.  If I had moved to insert the words &ldquo;to that person&rdquo; there it would have been a better method of getting what I wanted rather than trying to change &ldquo;the&rdquo; to &ldquo;that&rdquo;.  I want to put that on record so that when the Minister is consulting the legal people he will see the anxiety that is in my mind.  I am not a bit happy about the &ldquo;body of persons&rdquo; but I will wait until I see what the Minister has to say.</P>

      <P>Is amendment No. 5 not moved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  It is an entirely different point.  Amendment No. 5 is a principle upon which I could not possibly give way.  I move Amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection (6) to delete lines 34 and 35 and substitute &ldquo;liable to such fine, if any, not exceeding £20 as the Court may determine together with, in the case of a continuing noncompliance, such fine, if any, as the Court may determine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the Revenue Commissioners will be the sole arbiters of whether it is reasonable to provide the return or not.  I can quite see that circumstances would arise in which it would be quite impossible for a person to make such a return.  The situation under subsection (6) is such that, no matter how impossible the circumstances, the fixed penalty of £20 must be incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the Section, in order to get the penalty imposed the Revenue Commissioners must go to court.  That is right and proper.  Therefore, there is no case to be made here akin, shall we say, to the Customs case where the Revenue Commissioners are the sole determinants of the penalty.  There is no case to be made in those circumstances that the Revenue Commissioners should be the sole deciding body.  By all means, if a person, in the opinion of the court, wilfully refuses to furnish information which he is bound under statute to furnish let us have him fined but it should be within the power of the justice before whom the case comes to determine the penalty.  As the situation is, all the Revenue Commissioners have to do is to put in a certificate saying: &ldquo;We asked for a return and we did not get it.&rdquo;  It does not matter whether the person's office was burned in the period in question.  It does not matter whether the cashier in the person's office defaulted and, in defaulting, messed the records up, as happens in many cases. No matter what <i>bona fides</i> the person concerned has the district justice has no option but to impose a £20 penalty and £20 for every day it goes on.  The <Col N="140" /> person concerned has to go cap in hand to the Revenue and say: &ldquo;Please, will you mitigate?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not the right way to deal with that type of case.  The better way to deal with it is to give the judge who hears the case power to provide adequate penalties.  I shall not quarrel, if £20 is not considered an adequate penalty, that it should not be made more.  However, the judge should be given power to provide an adequate penalty and it should be left to his discretion, having heard the evidence, to decide what that penalty would be.  Any other view in relation to a matter such as this is one that involves a reflection on the court.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners in every country do not like the courts. They prefer to have everything in their own hands.  If they are able to get away with that I do not blame them, though there is a lot to be said for the responsibility being placed elsewhere, even from the Revenue Commissioners' own point of view.  This is a new type of code altogether and it is not a question of precedent as it would be if we were driving a wedge in the Customs code.  This is a new type of case and in this type of case I am all in favour of giving the court full and adequate powers to deal with the matter, leaving it to the court to decide, after hearing the evidence, what is the penalty appropriate to the case, and I would urge the Minister very strongly to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say that wherever the Revenue Commissioners look for information under any Finance Act and where the information is refused, on conviction there is a minimum fine prescribed.  That is just keeping in line with general legislation. I may perhaps appear to be trying to escape a little too much this evening under the umbrella of the Commission but the question of penalties is one that the Commission is considering, and I would prefer to wait and see what they would recommend.  I am therefore disposed to leave this section as it is with the minimum penalty of £20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (6) says that the return must be a true and correct return.  Subsection (9) refers to a certificate by an officer of the Revenue Commissioners that during a stated period the stated return was not received.  There is certainly a case to be made for prosecution of someone who simply fails to produce any return but sub-section (6) refers to a true and correct return.  Anyone who in good faith produces a return which is subsequently found to be incomplete has, it appears, failed to comply with the notice served on him by the Inspector of Taxes.  For that reason I believe Deputy Sweetman has a singularly strong point that some discretion must be given to somebody to say whether the person upon whom the notice was served has made a genuine effort to carry out the demand made on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (6) definitely states that, the first time, it must be a true and correct return.  That is going much too far.  It is a matter with which the court should be able to deal.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman also that anyone who deliberately and criminally refuses to disclose information which he should properly give should be heavily fined but, like him, I believe the Revenue Commissioners should not be judge and jury in their <Col N="142" /> own case.  It is essential, as a guarantee of the liberty and freedom of the individual, that the question of penalty should be adjudged first of all by the court which has all information before it.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter very seriously to make sure that there is no possibility of injustice.  At the moment there is at least a possibility and even if it is only a slight possibility it is something we must avoid at all costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to reconsider this subsection. There is no minimum time limit here stated for compliance.  There is noththing to stop an inspector of taxes serving a demand under the section on a person requiring him to furnish this information within three days, even within two days.  There should be a certain minimum period for compliance stated so that the burden of this subsection will press less severely on the person concerned.  Again, there is no right of appeal for further time and I do not think there is set out here any provision whereby the Revenue Commissioners or the inspectors may extend the time stated in his initial demand.</P>

      <P>Again, I am looking at this in the background of the section.  As far as I know, this is the only case in which a district justice is being brought in, in the determination of a matter of income tax.  The normal procedure is that one goes to the Special Commissioners and, following the Special Commissioners, to the circuit court judge.  If it was the circuit court judge who decided, I would be quite happy.  It is a new principle to bring in the district justice into the administration of income tax. That is what is happening here.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 6, I gather the Minister has said that he agrees the section is not intended to cover the matter about which I am worried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And, if it does cover it, the Minister will amend it in order to ensure that it is not covered.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (6) there is no reference to any minimum period of compliance with the inspector's demand.  As the section stands, the inspector can serve a <Col N="144" /> demand requiring compliance within a very brief period&mdash;three days, four days.  I think there should be a minimum period set out of at least 21 days for compliance.  There is no provision either for an extension of the period set out in the demand should the circumstances warrant it.</P>
      <P>On the question of the reliability of the statement furnished, I should like the Minister to tell us if it is envisaged that the statement should be certified by a professional accountant or auditor.  If that is so, is there any possibility that the Revenue Commissioners may require a form of certificate which could not properly be given in all circumstances?  I have in mind a certain precedent some years ago in connection with quota orders. The Department of Industry and Commerce required certain details from persons applying for quota orders for the importation of goods. On the foot of the form on which the details were set out of the applicant's consumption of these goods on the basis of a certain period there was a form of certificate for signature by a professional auditor.  In many cases accountants found they were unable to sign without qualification or reservation.</P>
      <P>When one has to delve into such detail as will be required under this section it may be difficult to provide a form of certificate acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners.  I hope that the professional accountants will not be expected to bear the brunt of this section to the extent of asking them to certify details, details which they would not be justified in certifying without delving very deeply into the affairs of the individual, or individuals, concerned.  The Minister also told us he would introduce an amendment restricting the period on the lines of the corresponding section in the British enactment.  That is very wise and I welcome that assurance from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify some points in relation to subsection (5) (b).  This deals with particulars of payments made to any one person where the total of the payments which would otherwise fall <Col N="145" /> to be included in the return does not exceed £5.  The total within what period?  Is it within a period of a year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is meant there is the ordinary accounting period, but it does not actually say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If it refers to the period specified in the notice nobody will know whether the period will be a month, or whatever it will be.  If a person knew at the beginning of a year&mdash;I do not necessarily mean the income tax year, but whatever his accounting year is&mdash;that £15 was the limit, he could quite conceivably deal with his books in a different way, if he thought it might mean something else.  I take it the £15 limit is meant to exclude trifles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But it will not exclude trifles unless the period is known.  Suppose, for example, I was given notice in 1963 to furnish particulars of every service within the period of the previous three years, that would be the equivalent of £5 per year.  Tips to the office boy, or something like that, might come into it whereas, if it were specifically limited to £15 per annum, everybody would know where he stood, and it would not hurt the revenue at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the period specified might not be an annual year or an accounting year, and I should say that if it is a shorter period then it is in the person's favour.  We shall have a look at that, anyway, and see what we could do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder could the Minister also give his attention to some clearer definition of &ldquo;services&rdquo;? I know what is intended but I do not trust my belief in intention.  The services rendered by a person to a business man or a business, to a professional man or a professional partnership, could cover a very wide <Col N="146" /> variety of things.  Is there any way of linking that up, as I think it is intended to be linked up, with fees, commissions and suchlike payments?  Many services are performed for business and for professional organisations by people who are not employed by those businesses or organisations.  In that connection I would mention the Post Office, the Electricity Supply Board, the Gas Company, Corporation water supplies and many other like services.</P>
      <P>There might be some way of making a reference to services rendered specifically to one person rather than a public service which is supplied to everybody, including a business, but as matters stand I could not make out a return of everyone who had supplied and rendered a service to me in my own business over the past year with any certainty that I would cover everything, whereas if there were this reference to fees, commissions, and similar payments it would be quite easy.  I am sure that is what the Minister wants but, if it is, he should say so.  &ldquo;Services rendered to a person in the course of his trade or business&rdquo; is far too wide a term in view of the fact that this is a tax provision and one which provides fairly heavy penalties in the event of an incorrect return.  I think the Minister should reconsider this matter with his advisers and see if there could be a more restricted and definite definition of what services are actually covered by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it would be extremely difficult to define the word, at least too narrowly.  That could worsen it.  Broadly it means anything that is done for a reward.  After all, if there is a money reward I am quite sure a businessman would have a note of it over the past year.  Therefore, it should not be too difficult to make out a return, especially if it is going to be more than £15.  It is almost certain that a businessman would have a note of moneys paid out by way of reward. For instance, if a lorry driver took some trouble to deliver a parcel, the man getting it might give him a 5/-tip, and small tips like that would not come into this.  I do not think there would be any great difficulty for any businessman to say, apart from his <Col N="147" /> employees, to whom he did pay moneys during a given year.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister elucidate one point for me in relation to subsection (6)?  If an inspector of taxes serves a notice demanding a return on or before the 31st July, and the taxpayer does not make that return and the matter then comes before the court, shall we say on the 1st October, then there is default of 61 days in August and September.  Is the continuing non-compliance referred to in that subsection related back to the date when the notice expired <Col N="148" /> or does it mean continuing non-compliance after the date on which the matter was brought to court?</P>

      <P>With all due respect to the Minister the subsection does not say that.  The subsection says quite clearly &ldquo;together with, in a case of continuing non-compliance, a penalty of the like amount for every day on which the non-compliance is continued.&rdquo; I think in the case I have cited the court would be bound to impose a penalty, first of £20 for non-compliance, and secondly a penalty of £1,220 for non-compliance for 61 days after the notice had expired before the matter came to court.  That is not what the Minister intended and he ought to change the subsection.</P>

      <P>You might give a man anything from a bag of potatoes up to a motor car.  Before leaving the question of income tax I should like to make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that last year we entered into an Income Tax agreement with the British Government to <Col N="149" /> deal with the tax avoidance device known as &ldquo;dividend stripping.&rdquo;  It was agreed that specified anti-avoidance legislation in the two countries, by virtue of which exemption from tax was barred in certain circumstances, would apply to an exemption founded on the Income Tax &ldquo;Residence&rdquo; Agreement of 1926 between Ireland and Britain.  Subject to this, the Residence Agreement was reaffirmed.  To prevent fresh measures of tax avoidance being used, a further Agreement is now being negotiated which will restate, in general terms, the Agreement of last year.  I hope to circulate copies of this proposed new Agreement as early as possible and to move an appropriate confirming section on the Report Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It was only since the Bill was circulated that it became apparent this matter was urgent and the British Chancellor is getting his Bill through Parliament, as we are here, and it was agreed that we should ask our respective Parliaments to ratify this Agreement by having an amendment inserted in the Finance Bill.  I hope to circulate the draft of the amendment to Deputies within a day or two and for the reason that I am circulating this I shall not ask for the Report Stage until this day week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is in order to make comment.  The Minister is bringing in a pretty substantial amendment on the Report Stage. Shall I put it this way?  Until we see it we cannot offer anything like comment on it, but I think we are entitled to ask the Minister for an undertaking that in respect of the new section the Bill will be recommitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I did go to the trouble of looking it up in the Oxford Dictionary.  There is not very much difference between them except that I think a ball is a more ambitious function than a dance.  Any one of us might give a dance but it requires a fairly substantial organisation to give a ball.  I can see no other difference between them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to the reply he gave me on the 14th of this month in relation to the trend in tobacco consumption.  I found it very difficult to understand that trend in the light of the revenue figures.  If I understood it correctly there was a drop of some three per cent. in 1959&mdash;I am speaking now of financial years&mdash; as compared with 1958.  It came back five per cent. this past year.  If that is so, why is there this change in tobacco dealers' licences?  It does not seem to me to be consequential in any way on the consumption trend.  Has the Minister any explanation to offer for the very substantial fluctuations we have had in tobacco consumption over the past six years?  Consumption definitely jumped from 95 per cent. of 1953-54 to 98 per cent. and then there was a drop down and a rise again.  Does the Minister think it was for health reasons? Does he think the new rise last year was due to any particular cause or was it entirely fortuitous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very speculative business and various explanations have been given for the increase in the consumption of tobacco last year. Strange to say, one of them was the fine year&mdash;that so many people enjoyed themselves during the week-end <Col N="151" /> that they smoked more than usual. That seems to be a good explanation because the traders always appear to get big orders on Monday mornings as stocks of cigarettes are run out over the week-end, especially at seaside resorts.</P>
      <P>It was not really any increase or decrease in consumption that influenced me in regard to the tobacco licence; it was the value of money. It is only 5/- and there were 36,000 of them there.  Nine thousand pounds may have been worth while collecting 35 years ago, but it is not worth while now, and we considered we were losing on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we could deal with the changes in the consumption of beer in the same way.  Why was the consumption of beer in 1960 down on 1957 and why was the consumption of whiskey in 1960 down on 1957?  The Minister led us to believe that 1957 was a dreadful year.  There must be some explanation, if that is so, as to why the consumption of whiskey and beer was down last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I have not compared that figure with 1957.  I have examined it only in comparison with the previous year.  There was some slight increase last year over the year before.  I do not know what the explanation would be in regard to 1957.</P>
