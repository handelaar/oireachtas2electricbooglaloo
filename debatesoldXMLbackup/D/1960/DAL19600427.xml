    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if with regard to his statement of the 20th instant at Shanaghy, Ballina, of the Government's belief that the economic rehabilitation of the west of Ireland was a task of major national significance and that the exceptional measures which had been adopted to achieve it were fully justified, he will state specifically the exceptional measures referred to and their dates of commencement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal measure adopted to promote the economic welfare of the west of Ireland was the enactment of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, which came into effect in January of that year.  Under that Act as amended by the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Act, 1957, An Foras Tionscail was empowered to give grants for industrial projects in the Undeveloped Areas</P>
      <P>(a)  not exceeding the full cost of factory sites and site development, factory buildings, services and facilities, and (b) not exceeding half the cost of machinery and equipment, and (c) towards the cost of training workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these Acts An Foras Tionscail has incurred financial commitments of over £3 million and up to 31st ultimo had paid out £1,835,310 of that amount.  The projects approved <Col N="124" /> represent a total capital investment of £7¼ million and are expected to give employment to 5,350.  Fifty-two projects aided by these Acts are now in production.</P>
    <P>Other measures of a more localised nature include:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Gaeltacht Glasshouse Scheme for Connemara and Donegal, introduced in 1947 to assist small-holders in these areas to add to their incomes, and now being extended to the Tourmakeady district in Co. Mayo,</P>
    <P>(b)  Scéim na Muc introduced in 1958 to encourage pig production in the Gaelteacht areas,</P>
    <P>(c)  the erection, in accordance with a Government decision of February 1953, of four hand-won sod-peat electricity generating stations in Counties Donegal, Galway, Clare and Kerry to provide a market for surplus sodpeat produced in those areas.</P>
    <P>(d)  the erection, in accordance with a Government decision of October 1957, of a milled-peat electricitity generating station at Bellacorick, Co. Mayo, which is now under construction and is due for commissioning in 1962/3,</P>
    <P>(e)  the setting-up in November, 1957, of the Shannon Free Airport Development Authority, and in January, 1959, of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd., one of the main functions of which is the attraction of industries to Shannon Airport,</P>
    <P>(f)the grant, approved in August, 1954, to St. Brendan's Co-operative Onion Growers' Society, Castlegregory, to assist in the development of storage and marketing facilities,</P>
    <P>(g)  the Gaeltacht Boat Scheme introduced in 1954 for the provision of fishing boats to Irish-speaking fishermen resident in the Gaeltacht, and</P>
    <P>(h)  the promotion of legislation in 1959 to revive the Grass Meal Manufacturing Project in Bangor Erris through the establishment <Col N="125" /> of Min Fhéir (1959) Teoranta which is now in the process of formation.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Department of the Gaeltacht in 1956 was directed to promote the economic welfare as well as the cultural and social welfare of the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>In many spheres where the State has intervened to promote economic development directly or indirectly, exceptional provision has been made for western or Gaeltacht areas, for example, under the Land Project Scheme special facilities for small-holders in Connemara were introduced in 1950 and a pilot scheme for the improvement of rush-infested land in North Leitrim was introduced in 1954; and in the case of technical education special additional Government assistance for Vocational Education Committees in Longford and six of the western counties commenced in April, 1955.  Similar exceptional measures occur in the case of housing, employment schemes and road grants.</P>
    <P>The statement referred to by the Deputy was made by me at the commencement, this month, of the River Moy Arterial Drainage Scheme.  The high priority given to the Arterial Drainage Schemes for the Moy and the Corrib-Clare catchment, commenced in 1954, was in no small part due to the consideration that they would improve large areas of agricultural land in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that litany, would the Taoiseach mind telling the House generally what that has meant in terms of increased employment and reduced emigration in the West of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not put a precise figure on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, when schemes like these are on the way, there is an estimate available to the Taoiseach of the employment content and the effect these employment schemes have on the registers of unemployment? Surely, the Taoiseach can give an estimate of the numbers of unemployed who have succeeded, <Col N="126" /> as a result of all these measures, in getting employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of dispensaries and dispensary depots requiring replacement in the country at the beginning of 1960, and the number listed to be built during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information, which is not readily available in my Department, is being sought from local authorities.  If the Deputy will repeat his Question in a fortnight, I hope to be in a position to furnish the required particulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that the question of whether particular dispensaries or dispensary depots should be replaced or improved is often one of opinion and that it may not, therefore, be possible to indicate precise replacement requirements for the whole country by reference to a particular date.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the campaign for the replacement of unsuitable dispensaries and depots was intensified about eight years ago with the offer from my Department of grants from the Hospitals' Trust Fund over a period towards the expenditure involved. Considerable progress in new dispensary building was made during the period of five years when the grant provision operated and most of the urgent cases of replacement have been disposed of.  Under existing arrangements, when approval in principle is accorded for the replacement of a dispensary or depot, the local authority concerned may proceed with the scheme without reference of <Col N="127" /> planning documents to my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of medical card holders in the country on the 31st March in each of the years 1953 to 1960, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, under which medical cards are issued by health authorities, did not come into operation until 1st August, 1954, and the first issue of medical cards was not completed in all areas for some time after that date.  Comprehensive statistics of the numbers entitled to services under this section of the Act were not collected prior to 1956 and the form of the statistics for that year and the early part of 1957 does not enable me to provide precisely the information sought by the Deputy in respect of those years.  I have however embodied the available information in a table which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Priory House, Dungarvan, was purchased by the Waterford County Council in 1955 for use as a Health Clinic and Dispensary. Plans for adaptation of the property for this purpose were submitted by the local authority to my Department for approval in May, 1957, but they were informed in the following month that on account of the existing difficult financial position a decision as to whether the project should proceed would have to be deferred.</P>
      <P>In July, 1959, I decided that the necessary moneys could now be made available to finance the cost of the Priory House project and the local authority were informed that planning might proceed.  The plans were finally approved by my Department early in the present month and it is now a matter for the local authority to have the structural works involved undertaken as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>At the end of last week the number of Income Tax repayment claims not yet taken up for examination was approximately 1,000.  The number of course varies from day to day.  It will be appreciated that the influx and turnover of claims is particularly heavy at this time as the Income Tax year has just ended and the full income of the year is now ascertainable so that abnormally large numbers of claims are being lodged. The claims are dealt with as speedily as possible and virtually all claims received up to 13th April have been taken up by the examining staff.  If the Deputy will let me know of any particular case that he may have in mind I shall be glad to have enquiry made into it.</P>

      <P>The grant of special leave with pay and allowances to men about to be discharged or transferred to the Reserve is a practice of very long standing.  In 1957 I arranged for the maximum period of such leave to be increased from 21 days to 91 days. Payment is made weekly in arrears.</P>

Further, is the Minister aware that under an existing provision these men are prevented from taking up any form of Government employment because they are still on the active list for 91 days after their service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the suggestion that some of these men are being singled out for harsh treatment is concerned, the present position is a considerable improvement on that which obtained prior to 1957.  The 91 days' special leave with pay and allowances was provided for the purpose of enabling ex-soldiers to have a reasonable period in which to obtain employment without suffering a reduction in their standard of living.  I consider <Col N="138" /> that that objective is most effectively attained by paying them weekly, in the same way as when they were in the Army.  They are not prevented from taking up any form of employment, Government or otherwise, prior to their final discharge, but it is provided that a man cannot be paid twice by the State.  If, however, an ex-soldier on pre-discharge leave does succeed in obtaining Government employment, he can opt to forfeit the remainder of his pre-discharge leave.</P>

    <P>I.  CURRENT BUDGET, 1959-60.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The year 1959-60 ended with a surplus of £1.2 million.  It was not spectacular, considering the size of the Current Budget, but it was the largest in over 20 years.  Following immediately on <Col N="149" /> the surplus for 1958-59, it is a welcome confirmation of the soundness of our budgetary policy.  It reduced the borrowing that had to be incurred last year and it leaves us better able to meet the heavy capital expenditure facing us in the year ahead.</P>
      <P>The surplus would have been doubled if we had not deliberately added to the revenue reserve.  We did this because we knew the revenue would suffer this year from two exceptional and non-recurring incidents. One of these is a large repayment of income tax which shortly has to be made; the other is the loss to the Exchequer of a month's income tax revenue from the Pay As You Earn scheme.  This occurs in the first year of the scheme because the amounts deducted by employers are to be paid monthly in arrear and we shall receive only five months' deductions in 1960-61, the March, 1961, deduction not being paid until April, 1961.  By carrying over sufficient revenue from 1959-60 to cover these two losses we dispose of a non-recurring difficulty in a rational way.</P>
      <P>The main heads under which tax revenue increased last year as compared with 1958-59 were tobacco, oils, stamp duties, beer and motor cars. Tobacco merits special mention as it yielded an extra £2.1 million.</P>
      <P>Though the Exchequer took in less from direct taxation as a whole, the figure was satisfactory considering the reliefs costing over £1 million which were given last year in income tax and sur-tax and the increasing effect of the reliefs of earlier years.  In the current year we have to face the full cost of the 1959 reliefs and yet a further increase in the cost of the reliefs of earlier years.  The total impact on the revenue this year of the various reliefs given in the last four years is about £3½ million, not counting those given in connection with the introduction of the Pay As You Earn scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before leaving 1959-60, I might point to the fact that the allowance of £2½ million for errors of estimation was more than justified.  Revenue receipts paid into the Exchequer exceeded the estimate by £2¼ million.  Expenditure <Col N="150" /> fell short of the estimate by over £1¼ million, mainly because of savings on agricultural price supports and social insurance.  The total saving would have been greater but for additional expenditure on such items as remuneration and payments to retired teachers. One cannot, however, conclude from this that a bigger allowance for errors of estimation should be made in future, particularly as the principal factor in the buoyancy of revenue last year was the remarkable jump in receipts from tobacco.  It would be over-optimistic to expect a repetition of this phenomenon but the revenue estimates for the year ahead have been based on the expectation that the general buoyancy displayed last year will continue to quite a large degree.</P>
    <P Just="Center">II.  CURRENT BUDGET, 1960-61&mdash; INTRODUCTION.</P>
    <P>The Economic Statistics prepared in connection with the Budget are already in the hands of Deputies.  I do not propose to analyse these figures in detail but merely to make some general comments on recent experience and on the prospects for the coming year.</P>
    <P>The year 1959 was one of progress and development, despite difficulties in the agricultural sector.  Its principal feature was the rise of 3½% in real national output&mdash;a rise which will accelerate the realisation of the Government's Economic Programme.</P>
    <P>Both exports and imports of agricultural produce were affected by abnormal factors.  The long summer drought was the main reason for the fall in British purchases of Irish store cattle.  Exports of store cattle were £10 million lower than in 1958.  The balance of trade was adversely affected, too, by the need to import large quantities of wheat and other foodstuffs to make up for the deficiencies of the wet harvest of 1958; imports of wheat alone were £3.7 million higher than in 1958.  Exports of manufactures, on the other hand, showed a notable increase while invisible items, particularly receipts from tourism, also rose.  The result was that we ended 1959 with a deficit in <Col N="151" /> our balance of payments which was a good deal less than might once have been feared.  The amount of the deficit is estimated at £8.7 million.  It will be recalled that we had a surplus in the balance of payments in 1957 of £9 million, followed by virtual equilibrium in 1958.  In effect, therefore, our external payments have been in balance over the three-year period 1957 to 1959.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased, indeed, to draw attention to the marked increase in industrial production during 1959.  In this respect Ireland has kept up well with the general European trend.  A record output was achieved in manufacturing industry as well as in turf production, mining and quarrying.  The estimated volume of output in 1959 for all industries and services covered by the Census of Industrial Production was 8% in excess of the preceding year.  Much of this increased production went to foreign markets.  The value of our exports of products other than live animals, food, drink and tobacco went up by more than £10 million.</P>
    <P>The increased activity in industry is, naturally, having a beneficial effect on both employment and unemployment. In transportable goods industries, which account for three-fourths of industrial employment, there were 4,900 more persons at work at the end of 1959 than at the end of 1958 and, as indicated in the Economic Statistics, there was a net increase of some 11,500 in the number of persons in insurable employment in the last quarter of 1959 as compared with the last quarter of 1958.  The numbers on the live register of unemployed in mid-April were 7,600 lower than on the corresponding day in 1959 and were indeed the lowest&mdash;at this season &mdash;for many years.  While this improvement is welcome we can by no means claim to be satisfied.  Moreover, we cannot view unemployment and employment apart from the problem of emigration.</P>
    <P>Emigration&mdash;so far as it is due to economic causes&mdash;is influenced at least as much by conditions abroad&mdash;<Col N="152" /> particularly in Britain&mdash;as by those at home.  It tends to be greatest when rising prosperity in Britain coincides with a set-back here.  It tends to be least when conditions are improving here while industrial production remains static or nearly so in Britain. This was roughly the situation in 1958. An intermediate position is reached when conditions are improving in both countries, as they have been more recently, but the rate of economic advance and the demand for labour are for the moment stronger across the water.  The present situation is one of greater employment opportunities both at home and abroad and the good effects are seen in the much reduced numbers on the register of unemployed.</P>
    <P>The stability of the price level in recent years has been most welcome. The Consumer Price Index stood in February, 1960, at exactly the same level as in February, 1958&mdash;two years earlier.  Coupled with the virtual stability in external payments, this has meant that income increases over the period have had a sound basis and have yielded real benefit.</P>
    <P>If we go back to 1953, as in the Economic Statistics paper, we find that earnings in transportable goods industries at the end of 1959 were 16% higher in real terms than in October, 1953, while the current minimum rate of agricultural wages is 14% in real terms above the July, 1953, level.  Not all sections of the community have gained so marked an improvement in their living standards because national production has not risen to this extent.</P>
    <P>The recent wage and salary increases will tend to raise costs of production. Stability, both of prices and external payments, is, however, of such importance that every effort must be made to counter higher costs by better management and increased efficiency.  In manufacturing industry generally in recent times there has been a remarkable increase in productivity, which, I hope, will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Price stability, indeed, may not be an adequate objective.  It has been pointed out many times that, over a <Col N="153" /> wide field, our prices are not competitive in export markets and we are thus handicapped in attaining the expansion of sales on which national progress and increased employment depend.  It is, therefore, most desirable that as much as possible of the benefit of improved productivity should be expressed in the form of a reduction in our prices relative to those of our competitors.</P>
    <P>There was an appreciable rise in the volume of savings during 1959. Total savings for the year, both personal and corporate, amounted to £63 million as against £50 million in 1958.  The improvement in savings is most welcome since it is only on the basis of increased savings that an adequate rate of formation of national capital can be achieved.  For the year 1959 gross domestic physical capital formation is estimated at £100 million as against £77 million in 1958 and £69 million in 1957, while over the period as a whole there was no decline in external assets.  In regard to industrial production, savings and national capital formation, we are certainly moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Experience in the agricultural sector has not been satisfactory in the last two years though there are many indications that basically the position is sound.  Amongst these indications are the increased numbers of younger cattle, especially heifers in calf, revealed by the January livestock census, the increased attention to soil fertility indicated by greater purchases of fertiliser, the better management of grasslands indicated by the increased use of silage, the improvements in breeding, the continued purchase of additional equipment and machinery, and the increased use of credit for productive purposes of which evidence is provided by the unprecedented rise in advances by the commercial banks to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>The failure of agricultural income to rise as much as national income generally must be attributed largely to the abnormal weather conditions of the past two years.  National income rose from £480 million in 1958 to <Col N="154" /> £503 million last year.  Income from agriculture, forestry and fishing, excluding wages and salaries, is estimated to have risen from £98 million to £102 million.  The Taoiseach expressed in this House on the 10th March last the Government's concern because farmers had not shared to the same extent as other sectors in the increase in incomes in recent years. The Government's proposals for alleviating this situation have already been announced.  They are expected to provide an additional income of over £2 million for the farming community. I shall deal later with the effect of these proposals on the Budget for the year ahead.</P>
    <P>As regards the external prospects for 1960, the recent trade figures suggest that we can look forward to a substantial increase in exports.  Total exports in the first quarter of the year were almost £5½ million greater than in the first quarter of 1959.  Cattle exports can be expected to maintain the upward trend shown in recent months, while industrial exports as a whole should also keep on rising. Imports are likely to be higher also as incomes and production continue to expand.  We ought, however, to be able to keep the balance of payments in order in 1960 although we shall have to watch carefully the trend, both of exports and imports, over the year.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has recently made a general statement of Government policy in regard to external trade there is no need for me to deal with the matter at any length.  It is evident that we must keep closely under review the trading and economic arrangements which are evolving in Europe and elsewhere.  Whatever form our relations with the new European groups and alignments may take, it is beyond doubt that we must concentrate on two things.  First, we must seek to lower our production costs so that we can economically produce goods to sell at competitive prices against all comers and, second, we must do everything possible to get access on favourable terms to markets in Europe and elsewhere for our agricultural and industrial produce.</P>
    <P>Like the Taoiseach I would emphasise <Col N="155" /> the considerable opportunities for export expansion afforded by our Trade Agreements with Britain and reiterate his view that, by making effective use of the opportunities we have in the British market to expand sales, reduce production costs and become more competitive in price and quality, we can attain the greater economic strength and efficiency needed to enable us to break into other markets as well.</P>
    <P>The general conclusion to be drawn from a study of the current economic position and the immediate prospects is that this Budget should not be restrictive in character.  It is vital that the economic advancement which this country so badly needs and which is manifesting itself in many sectors should not be retarded by budgetary action.  On the other hand, the greatest care is necessary to avoid any risk of the deflection to current uses of capital required for productive purposes.  I conceive it my duty, therefore, to make sure that the Current Budget is kept in balance, so that resources will be husbanded for the increased capital programme of 1960.</P>
    <P>III.  CURRENT BUDGET, 1960-61.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The White Paper of Receipts and Expenditure.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The White Paper issued last weekend gave particulars of revenue and expenditure for 1960-61.  These figures indicate that revenue is sufficiently buoyant at existing tax rates to cope with the rise of nearly £8 million in expenditure as compared with last year. Tax revenue is expected to be up £5.6 million, an increase to which customs and excise contribute £2.6 million and inland revenue £3 million.  Non-tax revenue shows an increase of £1.4 million, mainly from interest on Exchequer advances and the Post Office.  I shall, however, be adjusting these figures in some respects.  Before I indicate what the adjustments are, I should like to make a few general comments.</P>
    <P>But for the increased expenditure on pay and pensions, the extra amount required for debt service, the higher social assistance charge following last <Col N="156" /> year's increase in old age pensions, and the income tax and other reliefs given last year, the outlook for this year's Budget would have been quite attractive. As it is, however, we start with a surplus of only £325,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current Expenditure in relation to National Production.</i>
    </P>
    <P>That there is a surplus at all is attributable to two causes, one, the buoyancy of the revenue, reflecting increased economic activity, and the other, the efforts of successive administrations to keep the growth of public expenditure within bounds.  Contrary to popular opinion, an increasing percentage of the national product is not being applied to current public services.  The proportion which total current expenditure on Central Fund and Supply Services bears to gross national product fell from 22.5% in 1956-57 to 22.2% in 1957-58, 21.3% in 1958-59 and 20.7% in 1959-60. Measured in constant prices, total current expenditure showed a slight decrease over those years.  It has recently been shown that the expenditure of public authorities as a whole &mdash;and total taxation&mdash;are lower percentages of the gross national product here than in Britain, Sweden, France and the Netherlands and only a little higher than in Belgium and Italy.</P>
    <P>These comparisons give no ground for complacency about the levels of current expenditure and taxation, but they indicate that our position compares reasonably well with that of other Western European countries.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Pay Element in Current Expenditure.</i>
    </P>
    <P>In considering possibilities of economy, attention is often directed to the wages and salaries bill which the Government has to meet.  In current Government outlay the pay of the Civil Service, the Defence Forces, Garda Síochána and teachers is of necessity a considerable element. In fact, it represents over one-quarter of the total, and it is obviously incumbent on any Minister for Finance to see that it is no greater than it ought to be.  Since rates of pay are fixed under conciliation and arbitration <Col N="157" /> procedures, economy can be secured only by seeing that no more than the requisite numbers are employed and that the best use is made of the services of those who draw their remuneration from public funds.  In both these directions, economies are sought by Departments, supported and guided by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to say that I am satisfied that further economies cannot be achieved.  It would be equally wrong for me to give any credence to the popular myth that vast savings can be made in personnel costs in Government Departments.  It is not generally realised that the Post Office, providing what in essence are commercial services, accounts for roughly one-half the total personnel of the Civil Service.  I do not believe that by and large the Civil Service is over-staffed or under-worked.  This may be the case here and there but I certainly know of places where the contrary is true&mdash;where there is shortage of staff and prolonged pressure of work.  Problems of Civil Service staffing and organisation can be tackled only by the unspectacular, common-sense methods employed in progressive businesses.  These methods are being employed in the public service, are yielding worth-while results, and will be further extended and intensified.  The intake of recruits is carefully limited and there will be no relaxation of the drive for economy and better organisation.  At the same time, there are no grounds for promising substantial and early relief to the taxpayer in administrative costs.  These, broadly speaking, are determined by the extent and nature of the public services which the community expects.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Civil Service Reorganisation.</i>
    </P>
    <P>In my Budget Statement last year I announced that proposals for reorganising the structure of the Civil Service were being considered by the various staff associations.  It is obvious that in dealing with a body as large as the Civil Service&mdash;with a variety of grades each having its own salaries and conditions determined for the most <Col N="158" /> part under the conciliation and arbitration machinery&mdash;material changes can be made only gradually.  I considered it best, therefore, to concentrate at the outset on the sector of the general service containing the greatest numbers.  The relevant proposals have been fully considered under the conciliation machinery and I am happy to say that agreement has now been reached with the full cooperation of the staff, notwithstanding the conflicting interests involved.  The effect on output and efficiency of the changes I am introducing will be kept under continuous observation and the whole position will be reviewed at the end of four years from 1 July next.</P>
    <P>The major change is the transfer of certain duties from Clerical Officers to lower grades and the amalgamation of these lower grades into one new grade. This re-arrangement is designed to secure less dispersal of effort and more effective use of personnel and it should in due course produce a reduction in overall numbers.  Simultaneously, provision has been made for suppressing three of the Staff Officer grades and absorbing the personnel in Executive grades.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recruitment Changes.</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a result of these changes, the open competitive examination for Clerical Officers in the general service will be suspended after the present year.</P>
    <P>Recruitment arrangements are also being changed in other ways.  It has been a cause of some concern to me that, for higher posts in the Civil Service for which special qualifications and abilities are necessary, not enough suitable candidates have been offering themselves in recent years.  To help in remedying this situation, which would have serious consequences if it persisted, it has been decided that a number of the top candidates at the next Executive Officer competition will be given an opportunity of attending a University at State expense to pursue a nominated course with a view to appointment later to grades such as Statistician, Economist or Administrative Officer.  In this way we will be <Col N="159" /> undertaking to some extent the fulltime training of young persons entering the Civil Service immediately after leaving secondary school.  It is expected that the availability of these attractive scholarships will make even keener the competition for posts as Executive Officer.  Moreover, to enhance the attractiveness of the Administrative grade, both for University graduates and for Civil Service candidates, the minimum salary for Administrative Officers is being raised and more definite prospects of promotion are being offered.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agricultural Prices and Subsidies.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Returning to the White Paper figures, the first adjustment I have to make is for the estimated cost to the Exchequer this year of the recently announced changes in agricultural prices and subsidies.  The Estimate for Agriculture includes a provision of £250,000 for subsidies on dairy produce. In view of the increase in the price of milk, I am adding £550,000 to this provision to cover the possible Exchequer liability in respect of exports of creamery butter and also a liability&mdash;assumed provisionally pending the establishment of the Dairy Produce Board&mdash;in respect of exports of certain other dairy products. The provision for subsidy on bacon exports has to be increased by £30,000 consequent on the introduction of a higher minimum price for Grade A Special.  I have also to provide £220,000 for the new subsidy on potash fertiliser.  I have decided to make this a current rather than a capital charge.  In the Programme for Economic Expansion special emphasis was laid on phosphorus deficiency as the outstanding grassland problem and it was indicated that the heavy subsidy granted to encourage the greater application of this key nutrient would, for the five years of the Programme, be met from borrowing.  It was not intended that this exceptional method of financing should apply to the State aid which&mdash;as indicated in the Programme&mdash;would later be granted to encourage the increased application of potash.  It is more appropriate, having regard to the duration of the benefits <Col N="160" /> derived from fertilisers, that at least this element in the total cost of the fertiliser subsidies should be met at once from revenue.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I regard the recently announced subsidy on fat cattle exports as an integral part of the scheme for eradication of bovine tuberculosis and, as such, proper to be financed from borrowing.  The cost has been provisionally estimated at about £¼ million this year but I have not included anything in the Capital Budget for this item until the position with regard to expenditure generally on the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme becomes clearer.  I shall refer to this point again in dealing with the Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pay Awards.</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a result of pay revisions recommended under conciliation and arbitration machinery, additional provisions amounting to £580,000 have to be made for pay and pensions of the Garda Síochána and salaries of Secondary Teachers.  A claim from Vocational Teachers is at present at arbitration.  I cannot anticipate the outcome of the arbitration proceedings beyond indicating the likelihood that a Supplementary Estimate may be necessary in this case also.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Broadcasting and Television.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Authority Act passed earlier this month provided for the setting up of a new Authority to operate a national television and sound broadcasting service.  The amount included for Wireless Broadcasting in the Book of Estimates is for four months' requirements on the existing basis.  Before the expiration of this period, it is expected that the Authority will have been constituted and at that stage a new Vote will be required to provide the amounts to be paid to the Authority under the Act. I expect that this will involve a net addition to the expenditure side of the Budget of £350,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Members' Allowances, etc.</i>
    </P>
    <P>A recent Act increased the allowances of Members of the Oireachtas and provided for payment of a <Col N="161" /> member's allowance to a Minister or other office-holder in addition to salary.  The allowance for the expenses of Opposition Parties in Dáil Éireann was also increased.  The Act will come into operation on 1st May, 1960, and the cost this year will be roughly £75,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Insurance.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1960, circulated to Deputies on Saturday last, makes provision for a scheme of contributory old age pensions, payable at the age of 70, for persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  The basic weekly rate of pension proposed is 40/- with a further 27/6d. a week in the case of a married couple.  Persons already over the age of 70 may benefit if their insurance records satisfy certain conditions.  The Bill also provides for improvements in social insurance benefits, including an increase of 2/6d. a week in basic rates and 5/- a week in the rate for adult dependants of persons in receipt of unemployment or disability benefit. The basic rate for widows with qualified children will be increased by 5/- a week.  The allowances for children are also being increased and extended.</P>
    <P>Assuming the proposals in the Bill are approved and come into operation on 1 January next, the net cost to the Exchequer this year has to be provided for.  So also has the increased cost of treatment benefits.  The extra amount required is estimated at £155,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Total Increase in Expenditure.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The tot of the additional items of expenditure I have specified is £1,960,000.  To make some allowance for other contingencies, I am rounding this to £2 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Revenue Adjustments.</i>
    </P>
    <P>On the revenue side, an upward adjustment has first to be made.  I referred at the outset to revenue carried forward from last year to meet two exceptional contingencies.  The first of these&mdash;a large repayment of income tax&mdash;will not in consequence affect this year's revenue.  The second contingency is the deficiency in revenue <Col N="162" /> which arises exceptionally because this is the first year of the Pay As You Earn scheme.  Because of the carry-forward from last year I can pay into the Exchequer £650,000 which will amply cover this deficiency and still leave the revenue balances at their normal level.</P>
    <P>As a result of these adjustments, revenue becomes £137.5 million and expenditure £138.5 million.  The revenue cannot, however, stand at this figure.  Some further adjustments are necessary for economic, social and other reasons, including the future safeguarding of the revenue itself.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cinemas and Dancehalls.</i>
    </P>
    <P>I consider it necessary to give further reliefs this year to proprietors of cinemas and dancehalls.  I am satisfied that these forms of entertainment, from which practically all the entertainments duty is derived, are no longer in a position to contribute as much to the Exchequer as they have done in recent years.  In fact there is a real danger that failure to give substantial relief now would ultimately compel the proprietors of some cinemas and dancehalls to go out of business.  Such a development would benefit nobody; on the contrary, not only would it deprive some people of their livelihood and others of their entertainment, but it would also deprive the Exchequer of revenue.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me that the need for relief is particularly acute in the small towns and, as a first step, therefore, I propose to extend complete exemption from entertainments duty to towns where the population does not exceed 2,000.  At present, these entertainments are completely exempt from duty only if the population does not exceed 1,000; they bear approximately half the ordinary rate of duty if the population lies between 1,000 and 2,000.  This change, which will operate from 1 May, will extend complete exemption from duty to those areas where the half-rate operates at present.  It will also serve the cause of administrative economy by obviating the necessity for revenue control of entertainments in those <Col N="163" /> areas where the potential revenue is, in any event, small.</P>
    <P>In the case of cinemas outside the exempt areas, the form of relief I propose is to repay each week to each cinema proprietor 20% of the net amount of entertainments duty paid that week and, in addition, the balance of the duty paid or £10, whichever is the smaller amount.  I hope this combination of a flat percentage repayment with a lump sum repayment will be welcomed generally, since the percentage repayment clearly favours the larger cinemas, while the smaller cinemas will find the lump sum repayment more valuable.  As to the latter, a cinema proprietor whose liability to entertainments duty in any week does not exceed £12 10s. 0d. will be completely relieved of duty for that week.  This concession will operate from Sunday next, 1 May.</P>
    <P>I consider that the most suitable form of relief for dances is a further reduction in the scale of entertainments duty.  I propose, therefore, to introduce a revised scale of duty for dances with effect from 1 July next. Under the new scale, admission charges up to 3/- will be tax-free compared with the present limit of 2s. 6d.; there will be a reduction of 4d. in the duty element in inclusive prices up to 4/- and of 6d. in the case of higher prices.</P>
    <P>The concessions for cinemas will cost £300,000 this year and those for dances £50,000, making a total of £350,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Entertainments Duty Proposals.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, a body established to preserve and promote traditional Irish music, has made representations for relief from entertainments duty in respect of certain entertainments held in aid of its funds.  I propose to include in the coming Finance Bill a provision exempting from duty entertainments promoted by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann where the net proceeds are devoted wholly to the objects of that body.  The effect on the revenue will be trifling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> Before I leave the subject of entertainments duty I have one other matter to mention.  Deputies will recollect that in 1958, to prevent evasions, I introduced the restrictive measures contained in Section 17 of that year's Finance Act in relation to the 50% repayment of entertainments duty enjoyed on educational grounds, by cinema shows in which there are films having sound tracks in languages other than English.  While these measures were successful in eliminating what I might call bogus shows, they have created difficulties for exhibitors presenting genuine entertainments of the kind contemplated by the rebate provisions.  I cannot, without undermining the 1958 safeguards, completely remove these difficulties but I propose to introduce with immediate effect certain easements which I now find possible.  The alterations are technical in character and will have no effect on the revenue.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Table Waters.</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have received representations, which I am satisfied are well-founded, that the increased rate of excise duty of 1/- per gallon imposed some years ago on table waters bears too heavily on many concerns, especially those producing the cheaper varieties and whose output is small.  Without some relief, local production and employment would be endangered.  The form of relief I propose is a graded rebate of duty related to the annual output by each manufacturer.  The rebate, which will operate from 1 May, will be at the rate of 8d. per gallon on the first 20,000 gallons and 4d. per gallon on the next 80,000 gallons. As a result, the effective duty on the total production of about 80 out of some 130 licensed manufacturers will revert to the former level of 4d. per gallon.  The cost of the concession this year will be about £70,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Import Levies.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Special Import Levies have now been four years in operation but they have been relaxed step by step over the past three years.  There remain only some thirty classes of goods on which levy is charged at present; the total <Col N="165" /> yield last year was £1.6 million.  It will be recalled that the levies were originally designed to restrict the import of less essential goods and they continue to fulfil this function to a reduced extent.  For the last couple of years they have also been a source of current revenue to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I continued to receive representations during the year from trade associations and firms and traders who brought to my notice the desirability of removing or reducing this or that particular levy.  Representations were also made by various foreign Governments. Unfortunately, in view both of balance of payments and revenue considerations, I could not see my way to do as much as I would have wished this year.  I did, however, consider very carefully all the representations made and the Government have agreed to certain relaxations.  An Order has been made under the Imposition of Duties Act which, from tomorrow, will abolish the levies on clothing, furniture, toys, sports goods and fresh fruit and a number of other items.  The duty on bananas which was formerly a levy is also being abolished.  The result is that the extra duties imposed on fresh fruit in 1956 have now been completely removed.  The levies on refrigerators, light fittings and some other items are being replaced by protective duties.  The levy on tinned salmon is being reduced by one-third to 25% (full), 16?% (preferential) and the levies on fancy articles and perfumery by one-quarter so that no levy will now exceed 45%.  Some minor adjustments in the content of levy headings are also being made.</P>
    <P>Advantage is being taken of the Order to modify the 5% duty on newsprint, so as to enable imports to be exempted from this duty where supplies cannot be obtained from home manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Copies of the Order will be circulated as soon as I conclude.  The total cost of the relaxations is £555,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Hydrocarbon Heavy Oils.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Hydrocarbon heavy oils, that is, oils other than petrol, have always been charged with full duty when used <Col N="166" /> as fuel in road vehicles.  When used otherwise, however, they were, before the 1956 Budget, relieved of all duty by means of a rebate.  In 1956, by an adjustment of the rebate, these free oils, with the exception of tractor vaporising oil, were made liable to an effective duty of 1d. per gallon.  The main classes of oils affected were fuel oil used in industrial furnaces and central heating plants, diesel oil used in railway locomotives, agricultural tractors and stationary engines, domestic paraffin and lubricating oils.</P>
    <P>It could never be claimed that this charge of 1d. per gallon is a good tax, since it represents, as to the bulk of its yield, a direct addition to the costs of industrial and agricultural production. Ever since its inception it has been the subject of vigorous representations from many quarters but all that has been done so far is to waive the charge in respect of oils entering into the production of goods for export.  I consider that the case for total abolition is sound and that the pre-1956 position should be restored by an adjustment of the rebate.  The cost this year will be about £500,000.</P>
    <P>Taken together with the reduction in import levies, this concession represents a substantial contribution by the Exchequer towards keeping costs and prices down.</P>
    <P>I should mention here that I hope to include in the forthcoming Finance Bill provisions designed to counter the irregular use of the rebated oils as road fuel.  These will be administrative in character and will not involve any alteration in taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Harbours&mdash;Exemption from Income Tax.</i>
    </P>
    <P>I consider it desirable to exempt the profits of harbour authorities from income tax under Schedule D on lines which will be set out in the Finance Bill.  The estimated cost this year will be £70,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tobacco Dealers' Licences.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Wholesale and retail dealers in tobacco, of whom there are about 36,000, are required, under early nineteenth century statutes, to take out excise licences costing 5s. 3d. a year <Col N="167" /> There are also part-year licences from 1s. 3d. upwards and occasional licences at 4d. a day.  These licences, originally intended to protect the revenue, have outlived their usefulness and I propose to abolish them with immediate effect.  The disappearance of the dealer's licence will relieve revenue officers of a burden entirely disproportionate to the annual yield of about £9,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Retail Liquor Licences.</i>
    </P>
    <P>My next proposal, although primarily a reform long overdue on grounds of equity, also serves to eliminate cumbersome administrative procedures. I propose to change the basis of the excise duty on retail liquor licences, which for fifty years has been related to rateable valuation.</P>
    <P>The licensed trade have over the years voiced cogent and valid objections to the anomalies and inequities of this system.  In their 1957 Report the Intoxicating Liquor Commission described it as &ldquo;unwieldy and entailing quite a lot of time, work and trouble for the relatively small amount of duty involved&rdquo;.  One suggestion made by the Commission was the payment of a nominal licence fee combined with a levy on releases from brewery or bond sufficient to make up the revenue deficiency but, on close examination, I found this would not be practicable.  The alternative suggestion by the Commission was to fix standard duty rates for all licences. To avoid loss to the Exchequer it would be necessary to fix the standard rates at levels which would mean substantial increases for many small traders now paying minimum rates. Rather than abandon the idea of reform, I propose to introduce low standard rates of duty under which, for example, publichouse and hotel licences will cost £4 so that even the smallest publican will enjoy some slight reduction.  The maximum duty payable by a registered club will also be put at £4.  The cost of these measures this year will be £106,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Effect of Foregoing Revisions.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The total effect of these changes is <Col N="168" /> to reduce the revenue by £1,660,000, making it £135,848,000 as against an expenditure figure of £138,533,000.  At this point, therefore, I am faced with a deficiency of £2,685,000.  Even the justifiable deduction of £2,500,000 which I am making for errors of estimation still leaves a deficiency of £185,000.  There are, however, two additional items of expenditure which I feel bound, in equity, to undertake.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Assistance.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The increases in food prices resulting from the Government's agricultural policy will mean additional charges on family budgets.  While the effect may be to add only one point to the consumer price index&mdash;not a very serious matter for those whose wages, salaries or profits have increased&mdash;I am concerned about the position of families on rather low, fixed incomes, especially those dependent on Social Assistance.  It is proposed, therefore, to increase Social Assistance payments as from 1 August next by 1/- a week all round.  Old Age Pensions, Blind Pensions and non-contributory Widows' Pensions will be increased by this amount. Rates of Unemployment Assistance will also be increased by 1/- a week for recipients and 1/- a week for adult dependants.  The extra 1/- a week will be paid in respect of every dependent child, both of Unemployment Assistance recipients and of widows, and not only in respect of the first two qualified children to whom payments are confined at present. These increased payments will more than cover the additional weekly cost of the price increases to which I have referred.  They will mean a charge on the Exchequer this year of £450,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Certain Pension Increases.</i>
    </P>
    <P>In last year's Budget, I made provision for increases in the pensions of retired Civil Servants, Teachers, Gardaí, Army personnel and officials of local authorities and also in Military Service Pensions.  These increases were 6% for Civil Servants who retired before 1 November, 1948, and 4% for those who retired between that date and 1 November, <Col N="169" /> 1952.  The corresponding dates for certain other classes of pensioners were slightly different.  During the debates on the relevant Acts I was criticised for the smallness of the increases and for the overall limitation that was imposed.  This limitation was to the effect that no pension could be increased beyond the amount which would be payable to a colleague of identical rank and service who retired on 1 November, 1952, and whose pension is based on the higher salary introduced on that date.  The consumer price index has increased since then and, of course, pensioners will be affected by the increased food prices.  Serving officers have got a number of pay increases since 1952 but pensioners have lagged behind.  I have, therefore, decided to give further increases to pensioners.  Those who retired in the period between I November, 1948, and 1 November, 1955, including those who benefited from last year's increases, will get an extra 5%.  Pensioners who retired before 1 November, 1948, will receive a higher increase, namely 7½%.  The increase in Military Service Pensions will be 5% but a further sum of £30,000, approximately, will be allocated to increasing the special allowances payable to Military Service pensioners and holders of service medals.  The details of the increases in special allowances remain to be settled with the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>The various pension increases will take effect as from 1 August next and the cost, including the increases in special allowances, is estimated to be £150,000 in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tobacco.</i>
    </P>
    <P>These two items of increased expenditure, for which I am sure I will have the approval of the House, widen the gap between revenue and expenditure to £785,000.  Some increase in taxation is necessary to avoid a deficit. The remarkable buoyancy of the revenue from tobacco in the past year leads me to look to this source for the additional money needed to balance the Budget.</P>
    <P>I propose to increase the main rate <Col N="170" /> of customs duty on leaf tobacco by 1s. 9d. a lb.; the other rates of tobacco duty will be correspondingly increased. The effect will be to increase by 1d. the duty element in a packet of 20 standard-size cigarettes.  The increase in the duty element in an ounce of pipe tobacco will be slightly over 1d. except in the case of hard-pressed varieties where an adjustment in the rebate will limit the rise in duty to 1d. an ounce.</P>
    <P>Deducting £20,000 as the cost of the increased rebate on hard-pressed tobacco, I expect the increased tobacco duties to yield an additional £980,000 this year.</P>
    <P>This is a little more than is necessary for an exact budgetary balance. In fact, I have £195,000 on hands which, I think, can best be applied in the ways I shall now indicate.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child Allowance&mdash;Income Tax and Sur-tax.</i>
    </P>
    <P>In large measure our future economic and general development depends upon the provision of a high standard of education for the young in our schools and universities.  The sacrifices which this entails for parents must not be forgotten and I propose to do something to help them.  I am inserting in the Finance Bill a provision to raise the income tax and sur-tax deduction allowable in respect of a child from £100 to £120.  The cost to the Exchequer this year will be £110,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Death Duties Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>To encourage saving and investment I propose to grant some relief from death duties.</P>
    <P>The rates of estate duty at present in force were fixed by the Finance Act, 1951.  Estates of a net value not exceeding £2,000 are free from duty. From £2,000 to £3,000 the estate duty is 1%; from £3,000 to £5,000 it is 2%; from £5,000 to £7,500 it is 3%; from £7,500 to £10,000, 4%; and the rates then increase by stages up to a maximum of 53% for estates exceeding £250,000 in net value.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> I propose to raise the exemption limit from £2,000 to £5,000 but, for estates in excess of the latter figure, to leave the rates undisturbed.</P>
    <P>This easement will carry with it a corresponding adjustment in legacy and succession duties.  Under the law as it stands legacy and succession duties are, broadly speaking, not payable where the net value of the property passing on the death of the deceased is not more than £2,000.  I propose to lift this figure to £5,000.</P>
    <P>These reliefs will cost the Exchequer £50,000 this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Tax Reliefs.</i>
    </P>
    <P>My two remaining proposals are also intended to encourage saving.</P>
    <P>Income tax and sur-tax exemption was provided by the Finance Act, 1956, in respect of the first £25 interest accruing to an individual from deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank, a Trustee Savings Bank or a commercial bank.  In the case of a married couple, however, exemption could apply only to £25 of the interest from their total deposits.  It has been represented to me by the Savings Committee and others that it would be an added attraction to saving if exemption were to apply to the interest accruing to each spouse and the Finance Bill will embody a section accordingly.  The cost this year will be about £20,000.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, as amended by subsequent enactments, including the Finance Act, 1957, provides 20% income tax and sur-tax relief on dividends or interest from certain securities issued after 4 August, 1932.  I have decided to eliminate the distinction between securities issued by manufacturing companies after that date and securities issued on or before it.  This will improve the marketability of securities issued by such companies and will stimulate further investment.  The cost to the Exchequer of this change&mdash; which, of course, carries with it relief from estate duty&mdash;will be £15,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>The net effect of my proposals on the revenue side is to reduce taxation <Col N="172" /> by £875,000.  Revenue and expenditure are now equal at £136,633,000, and the proposals affecting the Current Budget for 1960-61 have all been outlined.  There remain, however, a number of matters to which I would like to refer before passing on to the Capital Budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pay As You Earn.</i>
    </P>
    <P>A notable simplification of the income tax code introduced by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1959, takes effect as from the year 1960-61.  I refer to the replacement of the reduced rates relief by increases of equivalent value in the personal allowances.  Another provision which comes into force this year is the flat rate of one-fourth earned income relief on earnings up to £1,800 per annum.  The combined effect of these two measures is that, with a standard rate of 7/- in the £, a taxpayer, if his total earnings do not exceed £1,800 per annum, pays 5s. 3d. in the £ on earnings over his tax-free limit.  On earnings over £1,800 per annum and on all other taxable income he bears income tax at 7/- in the £.</P>
    <P>These modifications were made to pave the way for a simplified form of Pay As You Earn.  The Act also empowered the Revenue Commissioners to make detailed regulations.  The regulations were made last February and the necessary steps have now been taken for introduction of the scheme as from 6 October, 1960.  There has been, I am happy to say, evidence of very ready cooperation from organisations catering for employers and employees. The Association of Chambers of Commerce have, for example, provided valuable assistance in bringing to the attention of the business community their position under the new scheme, by arranging with the Revenue Commissioners for a series of talks and discussions on Pay As You Earn at various centres throughout the country. The success of Pay As You Earn will depend mainly on the wholehearted cooperation of both employers and employees with the Revenue; and the cooperation already given in helping to launch the scheme augurs well for its <Col N="173" /> success when it comes into operation next October.</P>
    <P>Employees will benefit most from the new scheme.  If it is to get off to a good start, it is essential that every employee concerned should immediately, if he has not already done so, complete a form of claim for income tax allowances and send it to his local Inspector of Taxes.</P>
    <P>Inspectors of Taxes and their staffs are most willing to help both employers and employees in every possible way and, if an employer or an employee has any difficulty, he should not hesitate to consult them.  A pamphlet on Pay As You Earn for the guidance of employees has been published and will be found to answer most of the problems which would be met in straightforward cases.  A booklet of instructions for employers has also been prepared and is now being issued by the Revenue Commissioners to all registered employers.</P>
    <P>I shall include in the Finance Bill a provision to exempt from stamp duty the special forms of bank draft which will be issued to employers for the purpose of making remittances to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of income tax deducted under P.A.Y.E.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exports Relief.</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been reviewing the structure of the tax relief granted to manufacturing companies in respect of goods manufactured and exported by them. As a result, the Finance Bill will contain provisions for two major changes which I think it advisable to make.</P>
    <P>The first concerns the question of who may claim the exemption.  At present exemption does not normally extend to companies which export goods manufactured within the State unless the exporting company is also the manufacturer.  The exporting company is the one faced with the problem of finding markets abroad and it seems to me that there is a good case for allowing the relief to such concerns.  I propose, therefore, that, in future, exports relief may be claimed by companies exporting goods manufactured in the State.  Companies which export their own manufactured <Col N="174" /> goods will, of course, continue to qualify.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to extend the terminal date.  Under existing law, the year 1969-70 is the last year for which income tax relief on exports may be given so that, for companies entering the export market after the current year, 1960-61, a full period of ten years would not be available. I propose to make 1974-75 the terminal year so that companies entering the export market up to 1965-66 will be assured of the full ten years' relief. Furthermore, to avoid a sudden transition from 100% relief to full tax liability, I propose to bring in a &ldquo;tapering-off&rdquo; provision under which a reduced measure of relief will be allowed in the five years following the tax exemption period.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Hotels Relief.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Special provisions to encourage expansion of the hotel industry have already been enacted chiefly by the granting, in respect of capital expenditure incurred on or after 30 September, 1956, on the construction of hotels, of an initial 10% industrial buildings allowance and, as from the current year, of a 2% annual allowance. As already announced, it is proposed to increase the 2% annual allowance to 10% in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction or extension of hotels on or after 1 January, 1960.  I propose also an extension to holiday camps of the tax allowances available for hotels.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mining Reliefs.</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a concession to mines producing non-bedded minerals, such as copper, lead and barytes, I propose to arrange that the eight-year tax relief given in 1956 will run either from the date of commencement of production or from 6 April, 1954, whichever is the later. Under the 1956 Act no relief was allowable for any year before 1956-57.</P>
    <P>I also propose to extend the 1956 tax relief for increased coal-mining to the mining of gypsum.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business Losses Relief.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will introduce <Col N="175" /> certain alterations with respect to the treatment of business losses for tax purposes.  At present such losses as have not otherwise been relieved may be carried forward and set off against profits of the same trade, etc., for the six following years of assessment.  I propose to remove this time limit and to allow the losses to be carried forward indefinitely.  I also propose to allow losses incurred in the closing year of a business to be carried back and set off against profits of the same business for the preceding three years.</P>
    <P Just="Center">IV. CAPITAL BUDGET, 1959-60 AND 1960-61.</P>
    <P>I now come to the capital side of the Budget.  Details both of the outcome of 1959-60 and of the programme for 1960-61 are given in the expanded tables circulated to Deputies and I need draw attention only to the broader features.</P>
    <P>Public capital outlay has tended for some years to fall short of budgetary expectations but last year was an exception.  Expenditure at £44 million just exceeded the original estimate of £43¾ million, which itself, as I pointed out last year, was several millions higher than the figure contemplated in the Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>There were, of course, variations from the Budget estimate under several headings.  In particular, voted capital services showed an increase of £3.7 million, mainly because the bovine tuberculosis eradication campaign required £3¼ million more than we had originally allotted.  I expect that this year's provision may itself need to be supplemented, not only because of the fat cattle subsidy but also because of more rapid progress generally. The eradication programme is a work of national importance which it is essential to complete as quickly as possible, despite enormous cost.</P>
    <P>The purchase of shares in Irish Steel Holdings, Limited, as a first contribution to their programme of expansion and development and a higher rate of industrial grant issues by An Foras Tionscal accounted for <Col N="176" /> further increases in voted capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Air Companies exceeded the Budget provision.  On the other hand, the Industrial Credit Company required £1.4 million less than the estimate because their commitments did not mature as rapidly as had been expected.  The Company's expenditure is, however, expected to reach the £3½ million mark this year.</P>
    <P>Local authorities' requirements for building and construction fell £1¾ million short of the estimate, mainly in respect of housing and sanitary services.  The reduction was partly offset by greater expenditure in the private building sector, stimulated by the more liberal grant and loan facilities provided under the 1958 Housing Act.  The general improvement in the economic situation probably helped also to stimulate building activity.  In the confidence that this improvement will continue, a provision greater than last year's expenditure is being made for housing as well as for sanitary services.</P>
    <P>The reduced level of expenditure on housing in recent years has been the subject of groundless criticism.  It is due to the satisfaction of housing needs and not to any restriction on the issue of money to finance building.  Fortunately, there is no longer any need to sustain the peak building levels reached in earlier years when slum clearance and other major housing schemes were in full swing throughout the whole country.  The fulfilment of needs in many areas must naturally be followed by a decline in the rate of building since it would be quite pointless to build houses which are not required for occupation.  Instead of the reduction in housing expenditure being a source of criticism, it should be a cause of satisfaction to all of us that we have progressed so far towards meeting our social obligations in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The decline in housing activities had, of course, an adverse effect on employment in the building industry.  Even if there should be a <Col N="177" /> spurt from time to time in house building or reconstruction, it would be most unwise to expect that a satisfactory recovery in employment in the building industry can come from housing alone, and particularly local authority housing.  We must look to other types of building activity to help. There are definite signs of a quickening tempo in other sectors, in some cases due in great part to tax and grant incentives.  Factories are being built or extended.  Improved office buildings are being erected.  New hotels are in prospect and there is a growing volume of work on the extension and improvement of existing hotels.</P>
      <P>The decline in public capital outlay on building was, of course, foreseen, and it was largely to meet it and to avail of the opportunity it gave to redirect investment to more productive activities that the Programme for Economic Expansion was initiated. The periodic progress report on the Programme has been circulated to Deputies within the past few days and it is hardly necessary for me to make any comment at this stage on the detailed information it contains.  I would, however, like to refer in a general way to the manner in which we are already turning to good account the opportunity for redirection of investment which I have just mentioned.</P>
      <P>The estimates of public capital expenditure in 1960-61 show an increase of more than £10 million over 1959-60. Indeed, at £54 million, outlay is expected to be higher than ever before. The provision for most purposes is greater, the biggest increase being in the capital required by the Air Companies which, excluding moneys required to repay borrowing, is £6.37 million, as compared with £2.55 million last year. This year instalments amounting to £4¾ million will be payable to complete the purchase of jet aircraft for the transatlantic service, and £655,000 to acquire shares in Aer Lingus from British European Airways in accordance with an agreement made in 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to the increased expenditure proposed this year by local authorities and by the <Col N="178" /> Industrial Credit Company.  Other services on which more is to be spent include: the steel works at Haulbowline, turf development, television, telephones, electricity and internal transport.</P>
    <P>Table VI will enable Deputies to see both the trend in the total of public capital outlay in recent years and the change in allocation as between different objects of expenditure. The total for the current year is £9 million above that for 1956-57, even though public outlay on building and construction (other than industrial and hotel building) has fallen from £18 million in 1956-57 to £12½ million for 1960-61.  In the five years, the capital provision for agriculture, agricultural credit, forestry and fisheries has doubled, having risen from £6 million to £12 million.  Capital for industry, in the form of grants and credit, has increased from less than £1/2 million to over £6 million.  Capital for public transport undertakings and for port, harbour and airport facilities has increased from £7¼ million to £11½ million.</P>
    <P>The upward trend in agricultural credit requirements is worthy of note. It is expected that new loans by the Agricultural Credit Corporation this year will amount to £1 million.  The amount of credit provided by the banks for farmers has risen progressively from £17 million in January, 1958, to £22 million in January, 1959, and to £29 million in January, 1960. A sizeable proportion of this increase represents additional productive investment in agriculture.  Both farmers and banks are to be congratulated on this trend which, I hope, will be maintained and strengthened.</P>
    <P>Another notable feature of the table is the upturn in capital needs for fuel and power.  The tendency in recent years was for investment under this heading to decline because of a slackening in the rate of increase in demand for electricity.  Recently, however, under the impulse of rising living standards and increased industrial activity, the demand for electricity has grown stronger and this welcome change has necessitated the acceleration of the Electricity Supply <Col N="179" /> Board's generating and other programmes and a corresponding revision of the development programme of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Even the most critical analyst must concede that altogether there has been a remarkable shift of public investment towards agriculture and industry. Furthermore, we are spending more on capital development than ever before in spite of the decline in building expenditure.  Had the necessary plans not been made for this expansion, the drop in building and construction would have involved serious economic and social risks.  Not alone have these been countered but we are effectively using the opportunity afforded to us to apply more of our resources to productive purposes.</P>
    <P Just="Center">V. FINANCING OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURE.</P>
    <P>The resources which were availed of by the Exchequer to meet capital requirements in 1959-60 are set out in Table III.  Table V shows the resources expected to be available towards the capital requirements of the Exchequer this year.</P>
    <P>As regards last year, it will be seen that the largest single contribution towards capital requirements came from the National Loan in November. Public subscriptions to the Loan fell £1.4 million short of the £12 million offered but this was not surprising in view of the support which was given to the other forms of public saving during the year.</P>
    <P>Prize Bonds continued to be a popular investment and, allowing for encashments, brought in £4 million net last year as compared with £2¼ million in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Net receipts from the traditional forms of small savings, namely, the Savings Banks and Savings Certificates, amounted to £4½ million, or nearly £2 million more than in 1958-59.  Taken together, Prize Bonds, Savings Banks and Savings Certificates, brought in £8½ million of new savings.</P>
    <P>During the year, there continued <Col N="180" /> to be good support for the public issues of Exchequer Bills, and it was possible to increase the amount borrowed by this means from £6 million to £9¼ million.  As foreshadowed in my Budget Statement last year, the public issues of bills have been converted from a quarterly to a monthly basis and this has helped to increase the attractions of the bills as a short-term investment.  The average discount rates on our bills during the year continued closely in line with those on British Treasury Bills.</P>
    <P>Interest rates generally have been increasing for some months past and have added to the cost of State borrowing.  I referred last year to the burden of debt service charges and to the need for devoting a higher proportion of public investment to productive purposes.  Progress is being made in this direction, and the increase in the cost of borrowing makes it all the more important to maintain it.</P>
    <P>It is no less important, if our plans for economic development are to be carried through successfully, that there should be no relaxation of the efforts to secure a higher level of saving.  The Savings Committee have been most active in promoting savings, especially among wage-earners, and the increase in small savings last year reflects the Committee's efforts.  I should like to take this opportunity of expressing the Government's thanks to the members of the Committee who are voluntarily devoting so much of their time to this valuable public service.</P>
    <P>I met the members of the Savings Committee recently to discuss the savings campaign with them and I was most impressed by their optimism with regard to the support which is likely to be forthcoming from the public in future.  The recent increases in wages have improved the saving capacity of a large section of the community. In the estimates of the sources of borrowing for the current year I have felt justified in assuming a higher level of receipts from small savings and Prize Bonds&mdash;£12 million as compared with £8½ million last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> Support of the same order as last year may be expected from Departmental Funds; the figure taken for 1960-61 is £8 million as compared with £7.4 million last year.</P>
    <P>Thanks to the excellent support given by the public and to the surplus on the Current Budget, there was no difficulty in financing the capital programme last year.  In fact, it proved possible to repay the banks £3 million of Exchequer Bills.  This year's programme is heavier but with the support of the community which, I am sure, will be generously given, I expect that we shall be able, no less successfully, to raise, from our own resources, the finance necessary to ensure its completion.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter affecting the finances of the present year which I should mention.  Under the Transport Act, 1958, the State assumed direct liability for the repayment of the outstanding 3% Transport Stock, 1955-60, which amounted to almost £10 million.  On the issue of the 5¼% National Development Loan in November last, holders of this Transport Stock were given an opportunity of exchanging their holdings for stock of the new issue.  Holdings to the nominal value of £6.65 million were exchanged in this way leaving a balance of some £3¼ million outstanding which is due for payment on the 30th June next. For the convenience of the stockholders, I propose to make a further conversion offer, details of which will be issued to each stockholder shortly before that date, together with the form of application for repayment in cash for those who desire this.  As the terms of the offer will be realistic having regard to the then market conditions, I am hopeful that the majority, if not all, of the stockholders will accept it.</P>
    <P Just="Center">VI.  CONCLUSION.</P>
    <P>Listening to the recent debate on the Vote on Account I could not but deplore the readiness of some Deputies to enlarge upon the unsatisfactory features of our economic situation. It looked as if they took a perverse delight in portraying this as a &ldquo;most <Col N="182" /> distressful country&rdquo;.  I deplore this not only because it is false but because it is nationally harmful.  We should be mature enough now to assess our defects in a spirit of realism and to concentrate our time and energy on remedying them, rather than bemoaning them.  We have no problems of an economic or social kind that we cannot solve if we have the will, the wisdom and the application to do so. It should be a source of inspiration and courage that we have already made substantial progress.  Indeed, confidence in our ability to succeed, which is half the battle, is well justified.  A great disservice to national development is done by those who belittle the advances made&mdash; under different Governments&mdash;and who, by spreading pessimism, lessen the determination we should all share to make greater progress in the future.</P>
    <P>By the standards of four-fifths of the world's population, we are very well off.  The great majority of our people are reasonably well fed and well housed.  The conditions of life in Ireland are good.  Our people have the safety and comfort of a peaceful, civilised society.  Our real incomes and living standards are rising and last year's increase in national production was most encouraging.  We are on the road to a solution of our remaining social and economic problems. We have a name, and an influence, in the world which many larger countries do not enjoy.</P>
    <P>It is time there was an end to depressing talk.  We should, instead, work together to ensure more rapid improvement of our position in the years immediately ahead, drawing encouragement from the new spirit of enterprise that we see on all sides.  Our agriculture is basically sound and will be given a forward impetus by the additional aids which the community &mdash;as consumers and taxpayers&mdash;are now contributing.  Industry has already responded to the tax and other incentives offered in recent years: production and employment are rising and a most gratifying increase in manufactured exports is under way.  Progressive industrialists are confident about future prospects and are prepared to <Col N="183" /> face the challenge of greater competition and freer trade.  National savings have risen, enabling a record level of domestic capital formation to be attained.  Capital is coming into the country for new industries and investments and our external reserves have suffered no decline in recent years. The public finances are sound and will be kept sound by this Budget.  Taxation, including taxation of profits, is not high by international standards and there are generous easements to encourage production for export.  For my part, I shall continue to work, during my term of office, for a lowering of direct taxation.</P>
    <P>We possess, indeed, many basic advantages which should enable us to move ahead more quickly.  There is clearly no need and no excuse for pessimism.  Everywhere there is evidence of a new, confident outlook and of greater dynamism.  The Government's economic and financial policy is designed to sustain and encourage these qualities and to provide all the help possible towards achieving the national objective of better standards for all our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the most severe critic of the Minister for Finance cannot fail to admire his impudence.  No one in this country for the last 30 or 35 years has done more than Fianna Fáil to denigrate national advances made by other Governments.  The Minister's lecture at the end of his Budget speech should be directed to his own followers on that side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want just to put first, before turning to the Budget itself, some of the facts published in the Central Statistics Office brochure in relation to our national economy.  I want to put these facts on record, and to put them there in contra-distinction to the wild, exaggerated and irresponsible promises made by every single member of the Fianna Fáil Party, from the Taoiseach down to the most humble member of that Party, in the General Election of 1957.  I remember, particularly the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, Deputy MacEntee, <Col N="184" /> talking about the limit of national taxation having been reached.  They seemed then to count up the total of national taxation, not the rates.  As well as I remember, it was in Graiguenamanagh the Tánaiste pledged his honour that taxation would never be increased so long as he was a member of the Government.  We shall have an opportunity during the general debate of giving the exact quotation from his speech.  That was in 1956.  Since, we have seen the result.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to the national economy. What are the facts?  The facts are that in relation to the year that has just passed the Minister achieved very substantially more revenue than he expected&mdash;principally, if not entirely&mdash; because of something that was criticised severely by his Leader, the Taoiseach.  Everyone knows that the increased revenue of 1959-60 and the buoyant revenue of this year arise primarily because of the injection into the economy of the seventh round of wages, an injection criticised severely in this House by the Taoiseach himself within the last couple of months If, therefore, the Minister has achieved greater revenue, has achieved a surplus, he has done it in spite of his Leader and because of what he described as undesirable.</P>
    <P>It is easy to achieve a surplus on current account if you add to current revenue, revenue that was treated before as capital and if you take from current account expenditure, expenditure that was treated before as income expenditure, and borrow to meet that expenditure.  Last year includes £1.7 million of revenue that should have been treated as capital and it includes £1.534 million of expenditure that heretofore was charged for as income, but that the Minister for Finance decided to borrow to meet.  That is an easy method of doing things but it is a method that has its effect in various places.</P>
    <P>Let s consider what exactly is the present position of the economy as outlined in the Economic Statistics issued last week.  In relation to our balance of payments, we had a deficit last year of £8.7 million.  That must <Col N="185" /> be compared not merely with prices as they were in 1959 but with prices as they were in 1959 and in 1957, not for the purpose of increasing the deficit as such, but for the purpose of showing that in the year 1959 there was an amazing opportunity of improving our external position such as had not existed in earlier years.  If prices in 1957 were the same as world prices had been in 1959 there would have been a very different picture in the last year in which we were in office, and even last year, in 1959, if 1957 prices were current, the deficit on our current account would not have been £8,000,000&mdash;but £37.9 million or £38,000,000.  We must therefore remember that that difference arising as it does, the difference between the deficit of 1959, the deficit of £8.7 million, and the surplus in 1957 of £9.2 million, the improvement in the terms of international trade last year of £6.9 million, as set out on page 5 in the Economic Statistics, and the improvement of £13,000,000 this year, all make it clear that 1959 was a year in which there should have been a great improvement but which unfortunately, as the figures themselves show, there was not.</P>
    <P>Last year we had the highest volume of imports that there ever was in any year.  The tragedy about those imports is that the increase in producers' capital goods that would give real improvement for the future was so very, very small, that the increase in real terms of something that was going to build up the country in that high record volume of imports was entirely trifling.  On the other hand we had, in certain respects, an improvement in certain aspects of our export potential.  The Leader of the Opposition referred to it yesterday and I want to refer to it again today.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear that our people have become more export-minded than they were and, in those circumstances, it is only right that we should remember that the pioneer instrument in making our people export-minded was the legislation that was enacted in the No. 2 Finance Act of 1956, legislation that was enacted by us and improved, let me admit quite frankly, by the <Col N="186" /> present Minister for Finance in the light of experience gained.  It was our pioneering hand in that which started off the export-mindedness of industrialists and which is, to some great extent, responsible for such increase as there has been in export potential last year.  We must remember too, that for the first time last year exports of wool reached £5,000,000 and nobody is going to suggest it was because of anything the present Fianna Fáil Government did that we had such increased exports of wool.</P>
    <P>When we turn to some of the tables in these Economic Statistics we find there a picture to which it would have been more honest for the Minister for Finance to advert.  Let us take Table 6, the volume of agricultural output. What do we find?  We find that the net agricultural output of the State in 1959 was less than in any year since 1954, with the exception of the bad harvest year of 1958 when the weather destroyed any chance of adequately saving our harvest.  Would it not have been more proper for the Minister to have put that side of the picture to us in making his Budget speech today?</P>
    <P>Let us take the next table, Table 7. We can see there that in 1959 the number of people employed in agriculture, in forestry and in fisheries was 25,000 fewer than it was in 1956, 9,000 fewer than it was even in 1958 but is, as I say, so substantially fewer than when the people over there were making their wild promises in the General Election of 1957.  Let us remember that these are the official statistics supplied by the Statistics Office and are not, as the Minister for Finance sometimes suggests, Fine Gael statistics.  Going on to the next table, we see that in industrial production the volume of 1959 is still under the volume of 1955, yet every single member on that side of the House made it appear to the people in 1957 that they had only to get into office and they would change everything. They have had three years and they still have not reached the volume of industrial production of 1955.</P>
    <P>Look at the number of employed <Col N="187" /> in industry about which we have heard so much, and we find in Table 8 that again the position is the same, that they have not been able to reach back even yet to 1955.  We are told that a great improvement arose at the end of the year.  Perhaps it did.  I think there is some improvement at the end of the year; certainly there should have been after the manner in which the economy of the country was depressed by Fianna Fáil in 1958, but in December, 1959, there were still fewer people employed in producing transportable goods and services than in December, 1955.  There are also fewer people employed in manufacturing industry than in December, 1955.</P>
    <P>Table 16 deals with the number of unemployed and in that respect I want to make an emphatic protest to the Taoiseach for the manner in which that table has been prepared, I am sure under Ministerial direction, this year.  Last year when the economic tables were put before the country the numbers of people employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing were given as a subhead of total employment, and one got a total figure at the end of the table.  This year, in order to produce a different result&mdash;as I say, I am sure, under Ministerial direction&mdash; the two tables have been split so that the drop in the total labour force at work does not readily appear.  What is the true position?  The true position is that on these figures, when we amalgamate Table 7 and Table 16, we find that in 1959, there were 9,000 fewer people employed than there were even in 1958 and that there were 24,000 fewer than in April, 1957. Three years of Fianna Fáil and that is all they are able to show&mdash;fewer people at work.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had wished to put to the House an objective survey of our economic position, it would have been better to have referred to Table 12.  Table 12(b) is the one which gives gross national expenditure at constant prices.  It is the nearest one can get in these tables to national income at constant prices.  What do <Col N="188" /> we find?  Far from there being the 2 per cent. per annum increase in real national income which we were told was to be the aim and the object of the Government, we find that between 1957 and 1959, the increase has been one-tenth of one per cent.&mdash; £537 millions as against £539 millions &mdash;not a very creditable record for the Party who said they would be able to change everything overnight.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to these Economic Statistics, may I make a reference to one fact, a strange one &mdash;that there is no record of or remark or reference anywhere to emigration? What is the position in relation to emigration?  Do we not all know that more people have gone out of the country during the past three years?  We have seen, particularly in the midlands, something we never saw before&mdash;whole families packing up and turning the key in the door! We have even the evidence of the Minister for Finance himself, who, when speaking on the Vote on Account on 15th March last, admitted that emigration in 1959 was higher than in 1958.  Would it not have been a more objective presentation of the case, before we received the lecture we did receive at the end of the Budget speech from the Minister for Finance, if he had put before us objectively the facts in relation to those aspects of our economy?</P>
    <P>When he came to frame this Budget, the Minister was in a particularly happy position.  He had before him the Estimates, in the printed volume, made by the Revenue Commissioners. They showed that there was more buoyancy in revenue than there had been for a long time.  The Minister had only to do his job as Minister for Finance and to ensure that the Estimates for the Supply Services had been kept within proper bounds and had not been allowed to increase in the way in which they were allowed, to be able to give substantial reliefs in taxation, even without the imposition of any additional tax on tobacco.  It is the task of any Minister for Finance to make that restriction and he failed to do it and because he failed to do it, certain people will <Col N="189" /> not get the reliefs which they would be entitled to feel it would be possible for them to receive, as a result of the buoyancy in revenue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has increased the tax on tobacco.  He has done it at a time when already, as has been agreed on both sides of the House, the amount of the national revenue that is obtained from tobacco is far too high as a proportion.  It is a very vulnerable position that so much of our tax revenue&mdash;some 25 or 26 per cent&mdash;should be obtained from one item like tobacco.  If the public taste should change in any way, it would create an appallingly difficult problem for whoever may succeed the Minister. For that reason, therefore, quite apart from adding taxation, which the Minister should not have had to do, it is unwise to do it in a way that creates such an imbalance.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the reduction that has been made in the special import levies, it is, at the same time, a continuance to the extent of £1¼ million of a breach of faith by Fianna Fáil. They made it apparent to all the electors of the country in 1957 that they would abolish the levies immediately they got into office and, in particular, I name the Minister for External Affairs as being one of the prime propagandists in that connection. They are repudiating their own promises to the extent of £1¼ million in that item alone.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the provision the Minister has made in relation to the pigs and bacon new grade.  Does £30,000 not seem quite illusory and derisory in that regard, if anything at all is to be done to improve our product and if we are to succeed in getting a better and a larger export market in that connection?  Is it not just a drop in the ocean?  Of course, we know that, so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, even this year, in the 16 weeks that have gone by, there were 80,000 less pigs taken into the bacon factories than there were two years ago.</P>
    <P>I am not clear, in relation to that aspect of the Minister's speech which relates to agricultural subsidies, whether he has provided anything to <Col N="190" /> meet the increase in the cost of chocolate crumb&mdash;an export which is worth some £5 million to us.  The Minister is much too vague in that respect in his Budget statement.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister, by this Budget, has taken certain additional taxation out of the pockets of the people directly, we must also remember that at the same time, by the additional 3d. a lb. on butter, he is taking an extra £1 million out of the pockets of the consumers, and they are to a large extent the same people.</P>
    <P>We might be inclined, perhaps, to think that this was the first Budget of the year, but, in fact, it is the second because postage charges and telegram charges have already been increased by the forerunner of this Budget by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The remission on the entertainments duty on cinemas was one the Minister had to make for the purpose of protecting his own duty.  If it were not remitted, particularly with the advent of television, the duty might have withered away.</P>
    <P>I thought we would get from the Minister, so as to fit it into the picture of the national economy, the total increased cost of the new Social Welfare proposals.  I have heard various estimates of them.  Some estimates have gone as high as a £10 million increase. Others have been in the region of £5 million to £6 million.  We were entitled to be told today what that cost was so that we could judge the total additional money that would be extracted from the economy.  If, as has been suggested in certain quarters, it is £6,000,000&mdash; and I have no way at this stage of making the estimate &mdash; and there is the extra £1,000,000 for butter, then the extra tax bill to be met this year is pretty substantial.  We must add to that the increase every local authority has to meet through the rates.  The last Table of the printed Tables circulated with the Budget shows that in the last two years some £2,000,000 more has been collected from the ratepayers than before, quite apart from the additional <Col N="191" /> subventions there may be from Central Fund sources.</P>
    <P>All these things are creating a picture and I suggest it is a picture somewhat different from the picture the Minister drew for us today.  Many Deputies from rural Ireland, even those on the Government side of the House, know cases where people have turned the key in the lock and left home.  Is it not true that the small towns and villages in rural Ireland are finding it more difficult than ever before to carry on?  Is it not true that many of the shopkeepers in those towns who were prosperous, have fewer customers who have even less to spend because the agricultural community have got such a severe knock.</P>
    <P>There should have been more consideration for rural Ireland and there should have been, above all, a realisation in this Budget that there is no good in fewer people having a greater income.  What the country wants is more people in it, less emigration, and for those that are there&mdash;a growing population not a declining one&mdash;a rising standard of living.  The advent of Fianna Fáil three years ago has meant all the time a declining population. Unless that trend is changed we are going to face insuperable difficulties because of the age grouping. It is the young people of working age who are going away.  We have too many old people in comparison to the number of young working people. Unless that is changed we will see a real disaster in rural Ireland.  I do not think anyone can say this Budget will alter that picture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The portion of the Minister's speech which amused me most was the Conclusion.  I do not mind the Minister expressing his concern about people criticising Governments and Government institutions. It is not a bad state of affairs when the Minister tries to deceive the country because he can do that only for a while but when he attempts to deceive himself it is bad, he being Minister for Finance.  No one wants to criticise a Government or the <Col N="192" /> institutions of Government merely because one is in Opposition or because one wants to do harm.  The Minister should appreciate that the Opposition must be realistic and there is no use in his pretending or our pretending that things are as well as he claims they are in his Budget speech and especially in the Conclusion.</P>
      <P>I wonder did he really mean what he said in the second paragraph, which I quote:</P>
      <P>By the standards of four-fifths of the world's population, we are very well off.</P>
      <P>Compared with Chinese coolies we are well off.  Compared with the Russians we are well off.  Compared with the millions of under-nourished and underfed people in India we are well off. Compared with millions of Africans we are well off.  It is a most unhappy phrase for the Minister to have used. One is led to believe that what he wants to put across to the people is that we never had it so good.  I do not think that could be said in respect of most sections of the people.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>The great majority of our people are reasonably well fed and well housed. The conditions of life in Ireland are good.  Our people have the safety and comfort of a peaceful, civilised society.  Our real incomes and living standards are rising and last year's increase in national production was most encouraging.  We are on the road to a solution of our remaining social and economic problems.  We have a name, and an influence, in the world which many larger countries do not enjoy.</P>
      <P>I do not think that is a true picture as far as this country is concerned, and I believe the Minister knows that as well as anybody else.  He should be realistic and he would be if he examined and gave to this House, as Deputy Sweetman did, the analysis of the figures or the results that were displayed in the booklet he himself produced, <i>Economic Statistics.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil described 1958 as the year of recovery and I think they <Col N="193" /> described the year 1959 as the year of progress.  There is very little evidence that 1958 was a year of recovery and there is less evidence that 1959 was a year of progress.  One has only to have regard to the figures for exports and imports to show that the position deteriorated in 1959 as compared with either 1958 or, as Fianna Fáil call it, the bad year of 1957.  The value of our gross agricultural output decreased by over £8,000,000 from 1957 to 1959. There was a decrease of 6.6 per cent. in gross agricultural output between 1957 and 1959.  Therefore it cannot be claimed that 1958 was a year of recovery or that 1959 was a year of progress.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity for me to repeat the figures contained in this booklet, <i>Economic Statistics,</i> or the figures Deputy Sweetman has given here with regard to the over-all reduction in employment.  I think it is fair comment to say that the figures in respect of agricultural employment, fishery employment and forestry employment were deliberately divorced from the other figures of employment to try to present two pictures which were not in themselves too bad but which presented in one picture would be very gloomy indeed.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach when he spoke here on the Vote on Account; his words were to the effect that the Government were most seriously concerned about the recent wage increases.  He also, like many other people in the country, seemed to have the impression that the workers had done very well so far as wage increases were concerned.  The Taoiseach may not have said it in that speech but he did say on other occasions that workers were justified in obtaining increases if there was increased production as a result.  Therefore it ought to be said that any increases that the industrial workers have got over the last two or three years have been matched by industrial production, again as proven in this booklet, <i>Economic Statistics.</i>  It ought to be known as well that of the increases in the national income the workers do not obtain their full share.  Their income increased by less than 4 per <Col N="194" /> cent, whereas the national income increased by 5 per cent.  I mention that merely to show the Taoiseach and others who would have us believe that the workers have got more than their fair share, that they got a lesser proportion of the increase in the national income and if they got an increase, they certainly matched it with increased production.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government have anything at all to boast about in relation to unemployment and with regard to the alleged reduction in the unemployment figure.  Might I say this Budget did not seem to me to give any indication that employment would be increased?  There is no particular aspect of this Budget which has been designed to stimulate employment, either in agriculture or industry. It has been said, I think, by the Minister in his speech, to-day, that unemployment has been reduced by, I think, about 7,000 compared with last year or the year before.  I do not think that is a proper picture to paint.</P>
    <P>The Employment Period Order was designed specially by the Minister for Social Welfare to keep down the average number of unemployed during the whole year.  I think it is right to say&mdash;and every Deputy knows it, especially many of the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches&mdash;that there has been a purge, and there still is a purge, by the Minister for Social Welfare in an effort to deprive persons of unemployment assistance, with a view to having them discontinue signing so that they will not be recorded as registered unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has used many devices, and is still using them, in order to try to paint a picture of reduced unemployment. Of course, when one considers unemployment figures, one must also link with them the figures for emigration. That has not been done in the Minister's general survey in his speech to-day. We have an admitted figure by the Government of 32,000 unemployed in 1958, and the indications, as expressed by the Minister when he spoke on 15th March in reply to the debate on the Vote on Account, were <Col N="195" /> to the effect that emigration would be higher by a few thousand in the year 1959.  That does not deter Ministers and members of the Fianna Fáil Party from telling us they have stemmed the tide of emigration and reduced unemployment substantially.  They have done neither.  If there has been any apparent or visible reduction in the unemployment figures, it must be matched against the 35,000 or 40,000 people who had to emigrate in 1958 and 1959.</P>
    <P>It would be fair comment on this Budget to say that it is much ado about nothing.  I was particularly disappointed by certain aspects of it. The Minister, as a result of various manipulations, had a sum of money available for distribution to different sections of the community.  To my mind, those who needed it most, did not get relief.  We were told about buoyancy in the revenue, and we were told about expansion and progress and development, and still it came as a severe shock to Deputies to know that the much vaunted social welfare scheme, publicised over the week-end, will cost the Exchequer for three months of the year £155,000.  I do not speak with detailed knowledge of what is in mind of the Minister for Social Welfare or what regulations he proposes to make, but it seems to me it will be a pretty niggardly sort of social welfare scheme.</P>
    <P>If it will cost the Exchequer, even for the first year&mdash;I know it must develop&mdash;a miserable £155,000, it seems to me that a great many people, who are now expecting to receive pensions of 40/- a week, will be sadly disillusioned when the Bill has been finally passed.  Many will find it difficult, indeed, to qualify for this allowance, and for many other thousands, it will mean they will not get the full pension but a greatly reduced one.  I believe also that it is a very niggardly sort of economy on the part of the Government to say that these benefits will operate from January next only.  I appreciate the difficulties in respect of a contributory pension scheme.  I know it has to go through this House and <Col N="196" /> through the Seanad and that different regulations must be made, but I do not think it will take nine months to do that.  It is being done deliberately by the Government to save a few miserable pounds this year.</P>
    <P>Even if they had difficulties for a period of nine months in respect of the introduction of a contributory pension scheme, it should not be too much to ask them to introduce a separate Bill to provide for the proposed increases in sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and widows' and orphans' contributory pensions.  Those increases are small enough.  The increase is 2/6 per week in respect of a single man.  I urge the Government to reconsider their decision to operate the complete Bill from January next and to try to implement, in any case, the increases provided for sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and widows' and orphans' contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>I do not know what particular attraction dance-hall proprietors or cinema owners have for this Government. Everybody appreciates that the cinemas, if not now going through a lean time, probably will, with the advent of Irish television.  I do not believe television is a serious problem for the cinemas all over the country; I do not believe television is a competitor with the cinemas south of a line between Dublin and Galway because television is practically nonexistent there.  I do not know whether this concession by the Minister will do any good for the cinemas, unless it is passed on to the person who pays his money as a spectator.  If this relief which is now being given by the Minister is not passed on to the ordinary cinema-goer, I do not believe it will do the industry any good or do the Minister for Finance any good, either.</P>
    <P>Why the Minister wants to give&mdash; small though it may be&mdash;another £50,000 to the dance-hall proprietors. I cannot imagine.  I know that those who will participate in the benefits of this £50,000 are not all private dance-hall owners but a good number of them are.  Why the Minister should go out of his way to give them a relief which will not be passed on to the public, I cannot imagine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> There are other reliefs.  There is a relief on table waters; and there is a relief in respect of hydrocarbon heavy oils of £500,000; there is a relief of £9,000 to tobacco dealers; and there is a relief of £106,000 on retail liquor licences.  I do not know whether or not those reliefs were necessary in view of the fact that another section of the community needed this money much more.  As I said a moment ago, I do not know the attraction the dance-hall proprietors have for the Government and, again, I cannot understand the addiction to increases such as those which they gave before of 1/- to the old age pensioner.  He would not and should not thank them for it.</P>

      <P>There is a scheme to which I have referred, which says it will provide contributory pensions of 40/- a week for certain people, and the Minister, in a blasé fashion, says that the 1/- will compensate for the recent increases in food prices.  I do not believe it will compensate the old age pensioner or the blind pensioner for the recent increases in bread, milk, butter and meat.  One shilling per week certainly will not compensate these people, but the Minister says it will compensate them for the recent increases, I believe, on the assumption that he thinks the increases given since he became Minister for Finance compensated them for the increases that occurred since March, 1957.  The Minister should have had regard to the fact that the 2-lb. loaf has increased not by a farthing or a halfpenny but by 5½d. since March, 1957.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of all the things I say or will say.  I am commenting on the fact that he did not advert to them. The Minister cannot say that the increases since April, 1957, would compensate old age pensioners and those in receipt of social assistance. Butter has increased in price by 11d <Col N="198" /> or a 1/- per lb. since the advent of this Fianna Fáil Government.  This Budget has done nothing and will do nothing to alleviate unemployment and emigration.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister was trying to create the illusion that there is prosperity and plenty in our country.  We should like to be able to agree with him, but we cannot as we know that such is not the case.  Unemployment has not substantially been reduced, and emigration is going on apace. The Budget is dressed up to give the appearence of progress and prosperity. Unemployment is practically as high as it ever was and, on the Minister's own admission, emigration was higher in 1959 than in 1958.  Unless the Government wake up and take serious steps to try to alleviate the position demonstrated in the booklet, <i>Economic Statistics</i> there will be higher unemployment and emigration and even less prosperity than we have at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech has been remarkable for its complete absence of reference to any assistance or any indication of an advance for the development of our principal industry, agriculture.  As the Minister proceeded with his speech, it struck me as astonishing that he had reliefs for practically every section of the community, some of them deserving and some of them not so deserving, but glossed over agriculture in just one short paragraph of a few dozen words.</P>
      <P>Reference has already been made to the fact that people are flying from the land, that houses are being closed up and whole families are moving out. The pattern of emigration heretofore was that young boys or girls went but that somebody remained at home to hold the fort.  We now have a different spectacle.  The Minister calmly told us that cattle exports last year were down by £10 million.  What else could we expect?  What else can we expect with the youth, particularly, gone from the land and nobody left at home but old people and children?  What else can we expect but that production on the land will go down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> This Budget is hopeless by virtue of the fact that nothing has been done to try to put agriculture on its feet.  It seems that the farmers are a class of the community that has earned the undying enmity and hatred of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Since they first took office, the farmers have been their target. It was open war in the early years. Now it seems that their attitude is one of silent contempt and just to let the industry die.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have had his tongue in his cheek when he asked the Opposition not to be pessimistic and not to portray the gloomy side of the picture.  The Minister and his colleagues, when in Opposition, made the work of the two inter-Party Governments as difficult as they could by creating a pall of gloom and despair all over the country.  They peddled every kind of perssimism and despair as fast as they could.  They sought to strangle every scheme introduced by a Minister of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to give an increase of 1/- a week to old age pensioners. That is nothing short of an insult.  I cannot find words to express my contempt of that offer of 1/- a week.  The Minister should have been able to do better than that.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to forget that the increased price for milk for the creamery milk suppliers is not costing him anything.  The extra cost will be passed on to the consumer.  Butter has gone up in price from 4/4 to 4/7 a lb.  To-day, one can buy a lb. of Irish butter in England for 3/2.  For every lb. of butter we send across the Channel, we pay 1/2 to induce the Englishman to eat it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point that the increase of 1/- per week to the old age pensioners would help to balance any increase that has recently occurred in their cost of living. The increase of 1/- per week to that class will not by any means meet the additional costs of bread and butter, not to speak of other commodities.  The <Col N="200" /> Minister could not allow the occasion to pass without imposing an increase of 1d. on a packet of 20 cigarettes and ld. on 1 ounce of tobacco.  That is another wallop at the working man and the old age pensioner.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wanted to do something beneficial for agriculture he should have taken steps to relieve very considerably rates on agricultural land and farm buildings.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I shall not press the matter now.  All that has emerged from the Minister's Budget speech, which lasted an hour, is that he has given reliefs which in some cases are deserving and in other cases are not so deserving.  I shall not particularise now but I shall do so later.  He completely omitted our principal industry, agriculture.  He has done nothing to increase employment in rural Ireland so as to help to stem emigration.  He has left everything exactly as it is.</P>
      <P>The policy of this Government seems, in particular, to be to let the small landholders die off, be obliterated by death, the passage of time or emigration.  This is a poor Budget. The reliefs have not been given in the right quarter.  The Minister has let down the agricultural industry badly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather involved. First of all, the relief was given for those cinema people who introduce an educational feature in the Irish language or a foreign language.  I think it was a half in the case of Irish and one-third in other cases.  As <Col N="205" /> explained here in 1958, advantage was taken of that.  In some cinemas, where there was only one showing in the evening, they got some old picture in Irish or French and put it one and, therefore, got a relief.  It was to stop that that we introduced the rule in 1958 that there must be a two and a half hour showing.  It must have the content of education to get relief.  That has caused a bit of difficulty for genuine cinema holders because it was so rigid.  This is to give them a little bit of room to manoeuvre.  It is not important from a revenue point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 21, to delete &ldquo;person&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;officer&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which is in anticipation of other amendments that I have at a later stage to Section 8.  The Minister is to appoint &ldquo;such and so many of his officers as he thinks fit to be authorised officers for the purposes of this part of this Act.&rdquo; When you come to the definition section, you find the &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; may be any person appointed to be an authorised officer under Section 8.  I understood on the Second Reading that this Bill was, as far as possible, to be kept inside the ambit of the Department and that, therefore, those who would be appointed for the purposes of the Act, <Col N="222" /> for inspection and everything else, would be people who are already officials and that there would be no recruitment&mdash;no heavy recruitment, anyway.  It is to get clarification of that point that I put down this amendment&mdash;to ascertain whether the authorised officer would be an officer, that is to say, a person already in the Department, or at least in the Civil Service who might be seconded from one Department to another, but not at all people brought in from outside. It all depends on what is the likelihood in the way of enforcement of this measure.  Is it to be done by a horde of people brought in from outside or mainly by people already there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already indicated to Deputy Sweetman on the Money Resolution the intention is, initially at any rate, to utilise the existing personnel of the Department. The Deputy's amendment to delete &ldquo;person&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;officer&rdquo;, I suggest, is not necessary when one reads the definition as it stands relating to an authorised officer meaning a person under Section 8 (1).</P>
      <P>It says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may appoint such and so many of his officers as he thinks fit to be authorised officers for the purposes of this part of this Act.</P>
      <P>I suggest it is quite clear that the persons to be appointed will be authorised officers and that the authorised officers envisaged would be existing officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would certainly carry out what I now understand to be the intention, that the officer is to be a person already existing as an officer.  The Minister will realise that if you say in the definition section that an authorised officer is any person appointed under Section 8, that certainly leaves the field entirely open.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a person appointed to be an authorised officer under Section 8.  When you go to Section 8 the only limiting word is &ldquo;his&rdquo; officers.  I take that to mean already established in the Civil Service. If that is so, it is quite proper to exclude the use of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; and put in &ldquo;officer&rdquo;.  That confines it.  The Minister apparently agrees that will be the position.  Why not make it clear?  It is not evaded at present to any great extent, but I think the Minister appears to be of the view that there are really enough officers without bringing in outside people.  That being the case, you would at least limit the selection under this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason I am resisting the amendment is that I am advised by the Parliamentary draftsman that the elimination of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; and the inclusion of the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is not necessary. However, if the Deputy feels he would be happier with the substitution of the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;, I am quite prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite prepared to go the other way with the Minister if he could assure me that it would be necessary to recruit new people for the purposes of this Bill. But when he says &ldquo;no&rdquo;, I do not think he is limiting himself to any extent.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;No order under <i>Part II</i> of this Act shall come into operation unless and until it has been laid <Col N="224" /> before each House of the Oireachtas, and approved by a resolution of each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it obligatory on the Minister to lay an Order under Part II of the Bill on the Table of the House and have it approved by resolution rather than implement the provision in the form envisaged in Section 4 of the Bill as drafted.</P>
    <P>This amendment must be considered in conjunction with Part II.  In particular, it must be considered in conjunction with Section 6.  Under Section 6 the Minister is taking very wide powers.  The section provides that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may by order provide for the regulation and control of the hire purchase, sale upon credit and letting of goods of any class or description of goods.</P>
    <P>(2)  Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing or to anything in the Principal Act, an order under this section may provide for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the form of agreement for the hire-purchase, sale upon credit or letting of goods,</P>
    <P>(b)  the minimum deposit to be paid by a buyer or hirer,</P>
    <P>(c)  the maximum period of payment, and the amount and frequency of instalments or rentals,</P>
    <P>(d)  the information to be given in any visual advertisement or visual announcement published or made in any form or manner whatsoever relating to goods for sale by way of hire-purchase or credit-sale agreement regarding the terms upon which the goods will be sold.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this section gives the Minister very wide and very far-reaching powers.  I agree it is necessary to regulate certain conditions under which hire purchase arrangements may be made.  In fact, it is desirable that some minimum requirements should be fixed.  As the Bill stands at the moment, however, an Order which embraces these very far-reaching powers must be laid on the <Col N="225" /> Table of the House and it will take effect immediately unless it is annulled within the subsequent 21 sitting days. In the case of annulment, anything that has been done prior to the annulling Order remains in effect.</P>
    <P>This amendment would make it obligatory on the Minister to get the approval of the House for any such Order.  For such an Order as that envisaged in Part II of the Bill it is, I think, desirable that there should be confirmation before the Order takes effect.  This Part of the Bill is, except for one or two later sections, such as Section 19, the principal part.  The very wide powers which it is proposed to take in it, together with the possible consequences of any regulations made on business and on the persons concerned, makes it obvious that wide publicity should be given to an Order of the kind envisaged.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands, any Order made will be laid on the Table of the House.  Whatever publicity is involved in that procedure may come to the notice of the persons concerned.  In many instances a variety of Orders, many of them trivial in character, are laid on the Table of the House and the public generally are unaware of their contents.  If, however, an Order has to be confirmed by resolution there is, first of all, the definite act of formal resolution moved by the Minister concerned with the possibility of a subsequent debate.  Even assuming the resolution to be comparatively unimportant in character, nevertheless, the fact that the resolution is formally proposed will involve some remarks upon it by the Minister and consequently some publicity attendant on the terms of the resolution and the terms of the particular Order the resolution seeks to confirm.</P>
    <P>Considerable powers are being sought by the Minister under Section 6. No one objects to the Minister laying down in statutory form certain specific requirements as to minimum terms in relation to deposits, terms of repayment, instalments, the form of the agreement and so forth.  But if that is to be done, it should be done by means of statutory regulation rather than by merely laying an Order on the Table of <Col N="226" /> the House and waiting for some Deputy, possibly, to raise the matter in order to focus the attention of those affected on the particular Order.</P>
    <P>Judging by the discussion on the Second Stage, it is obvious that hire purchase is on the increase.  The fact that it is increasing means that the interests of a greater number of people will be affected by hire purchase trading.  It is important, therefore, that people should have full knowledge of the terms of any Order made and that they should be aware in advance of the terms and conditions under which they may enter into hire purchase agreements.</P>
    <P>This amendment does not in any way limit the powers of the Minister in prescribing conditions.  In fact, it leaves Part II unaffected.  It does not alter the terms of Section 6 (1) which outlines the various aspects in relation to which Orders may be made.  It does mean, however, that before an Order takes effect it must be approved by formal resolution of the Dáil.  I believe that it is important in a matter of this kind that legislative sanction should be given.  In fact, in most Acts which deal with undertakings of this nature, the sections of the Acts concerned lay down in detail the conditions under which the business may be operated.  If we take either State companies or other bodies authorised by statute to carry on business or enter into undertakings, there is generally a section, or in some cases, a number of sections, dealing with the powers, the duties and the limitations of these powers and duties.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, which amends the earlier Hire Purchase Act of 1946, the power taken in Part II is of a very wide and far-reaching nature.  It deals with a growing volume of business&mdash;a business that has been extended in a variety of ways and which now embraces all types of goods and many forms of trade, to such an extent that a great number of persons who formerly were not used to carrying on business in this way now find themselves caught up in it.  It is, therefore, important in a matter of this sort that legislative authority should have the sanction of the Dáil <Col N="227" /> behind it, as in the case of other large-scale trading carried on by State or semi-State companies.  As the Bill is framed at present, the Minister is obliged only to lay the Order on the Table of the House, and if no Order is made annulling it within 21 subsequent sitting days, the Order takes effect.  That, as I say, might not attract the attention which it ought to attract and it might indeed not come to the notice of the persons affected until after the prescribed time has elapsed particularly, as is often the case during the long recess, when a great many Orders and other documents are on the Table of the House.</P>
    <P>This amendment in no way limits or restricts the power or effectiveness of the Minister's authority under Part II or under Section 6, but it means that the confirmation of the Dáil must first be sought and the attendant publicity, which in a matter of this sort, might well be desirable, would be secured.  I consider that this amendment is an important one and is indeed a desirable one in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment proposed by Deputy Cosgrave.  In the ordinary course, little exception could be taken to a proposal such as that contained in Section 4 of the Bill, if the matters dealt with were limited to matters of a trivial nature.  According to Section 6, however, the whole framework of hire-purchase&mdash;the control of hire purchase, credit sales and the letting of goods&mdash;will be dealt with.  If the large number of Orders envisaged under this Bill are circulated and put into effect, it is possible that proposals in connection with this matter might escape the notice of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be found that the Minister's Order would have taken effect and a very awkward situation could then arise.  I do not know in what way the Minister might get over that difficulty.  I think it would be a better idea if there were some arrangement whereby formal notice of any proposal the Minister might make in this <Col N="228" /> connection could be given to the House.  At the same time, however, I appreciate that certain requirements may have to be met at short notice and in that connection the Minister might possibly be at a disadvantage if he had now to include the amendment in the measure before us.</P>
    <P>I wonder could any middle course be adopted?  Paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of Section 6 deals with the form of agreement for the hire-purchase, sale upon credit or letting of goods.  That would not be very important, but paragraph (b) which deals with the minimum deposit to be paid by a buyer or hirer, would be very important.  That is a matter on which there might be a very big difference of opinion and which might be very suitable for discussion in the House.  There is also the question of the maximum period of repayment. Hire-purchase companies themselves change these terms from time to time, according to their experience.  It could very well happen that an Order might be made by the Minister varying the maximum period of payment which would cause a good deal of incovenience to new hirers coming on the list from then on.</P>
    <P>I have only a very limited experience and knowledge of how Orders may be promulgated, but I listened with much interest to Deputy Cosgrave's suggestion that the Orders might be made with ordinary legislative effect.  However, if that would lead to delay, it would not do any good and I can see why the Minister would be reluctant to accept the proposal; but in view of the comprehensive nature of Section 6, I think the Minister should endeavour to meet to some extent the suggestion contained in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>To accede to this amendment would be to depart in general from the procedure that has been adopted in many other Bills.  The practice is the contrary to what is suggested in this amendment.  There are several precedents of Orders being made under Bills in the circumstances in which it is proposed Orders should be made under this Bill.  I could quote several examples.</P>

      <P>These were Orders made when Deputy McGilligan had responsibility for the Department of Finance and when Deputy Cosgrave had some responsibility in relation to the Department of Industry and Commerce. However, the Orders to be made under this section are, in the main, of two kinds&mdash;Orders that would be required for the ordinary administration of hire-purchase, for example, the advertising of an article in which the hire-purchase terms on which the goods to be sold must be displayed, and then an Order dealing with the main deposit and the maximum period of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first one I have referred to, and which deals with the information to be given in visual advertisements, is to be made a short time after the passage of the Act.  The other Orders will be made, as is indicated in subsection <Col N="230" /> 5 of the section, after consultation with the Minister for Finance. The implication is that the Minister for Finance will have some responsibility, having regard to his own office, in this matter.  That responsbility will arise in circumstances under which serious balance of payments problems would occur in the country, as happened in 1956, and it would be difficult and perhaps, in many instances, embarrassing for the economy of the country if the effect of such Orders had to be postponed pending a meeting of the Dáil and Seanad, especially during periods of recess.</P>
    <P>I suggest the making of an Order, its being laid on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and the provision for its annulment within a specified period, is sufficient safeguard to ensure that no hardship will be encountered.  On the contrary, I think that the balance of hardship that might be expected on the part of the economy, in certain circumstances, is much more serious from the State's point of view.  Therefore I suggest, having regard to precedent, having regard to the fact that the Orders must be placed on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas anyway, and having regard to the provisions for annulment, there is adequate safeguard to ensure that the public will be fully protected.</P>
    <P>As far as publicity is concerned, I do not think there will be any danger when these Orders are made of their effect not coming before the public. The usual practice is not only to insert an appropriate advertisement in the newspapers but also to make an announcement on the Radio&mdash;in fact a series of announcements.  So, I suggest on that score there is no reason to suspect that the making of the Orders will not be given due publicity and will not be brought to the notice of the people immediately concerned, and I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the usual contest between those who want ease in administration and those who want Parliamentary control.  Throughout its history from 1922, the members of <Col N="231" /> this House have decided that they want Parliamentary control and this is not Parliamentary control.  The Minister has spoken about other bits of legislation under which Orders might be made.  There are plenty of them and I thought he would have referred to Road Traffic Orders and Road Transport Orders in which very minute details vary from county to county and it would have been impossible, except by very bulky legislation, to have everything covered in a Bill. We have got accustomed to those things being done by Order, but this is not one of those cases.</P>
      <P>The weakness of the Minister's argument is shown by the fact that he has to fall back on the point that some of these Orders have to be brought before the Minister for Finance because they might conflict with what the Minister for Finance wants to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not be made then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but that is very limited.  In other words, he would be interfering only to protect finance.  As it happens, he, the Minister for Finance, will look after that position if the Minister for Industry and Commerce wants to make regulations and they are liable to interfere with the collection of revenue.</P>
      <P>The Minister has quoted regulations of a minor type made under the E.S.B. Acts but that is a very small matter. Look at the main Act, the Act which established the E.S.B.  It is a very bulky Act and most of the things which it wanted done were put in the sections and paragraphs of it.  The main things arising under that Act were all dealt with in specialised paragraphs and, strangely enough, that Act did not require much amendment in all the years that have passed.  The E.S.B.  Acts have, however, been amended to increase the amount of money put at the disposal of the E.S.B. for its operations, but as far as ordinary control in matters referring to the E.S.B. is concerned, it is contained in the main Act.  There have been minor alterations here and there, but what does the Minister propose to do in this instance by Order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> He proposes to provide for the regulation and control of hire-purchase, sale upon credit and the letting of goods of any class or description and then, as if that were not enough, the rest of the section reads:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing ... an order under this section may provide for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the form of agreement for the hire-purchase, sale upon credit or letting of goods,</P>
    <P>(b)  the minimum deposit to be paid by a buyer or hirer,</P>
    <P>(c)  the maximum period of payment, and the amount and frequency of instalments or rentals,</P>
    <P>(d)  the information to be given in any visual advertisement or visual announcement published or made in any form or manner whatsoever relating to goods for sale by way of hire-purchase or credit-sale agreement regarding the terms upon which the goods will be sold.</P>
    <P>and now the Minister wants to include with that, as set out in his amendment:</P>
    <P>the inclusion in any such advertisement or announcement of a statement of the price at which the goods will be sold for cash.</P>
    <P>Is that not the whole Act?  It is not a mere detail.  That is everything that is to be done by Order and I suggest that is a departure from what we have become accustomed to and is not necessary.  The principal Act is the Act of 1946.  It contained the main matters that were of a hire-purchase type and that Act has lasted without amendment for 13 years up to this date.  The Minister, of course, may answer me that it had to be amended on one occasion when increasing hire-purchase became an important matter in the balance of payments situation developing in the country, but what happened then was that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was able to come into this House with an Order made under the <Col N="233" /> Supplies and Services Act which rectified the matter without any delay. That machinery is still at the disposal of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Moloney's point of view that one can sympathise with the Minister.  In fact, we would be ready to hear him if he makes any point in regard to urgency but he has this machinery, the Supplies and Services legislation, and can make Orders under it.  As I say, it was possible to make Orders under it with regard to the time of payments for hire-purchase transactions.  I do not know if Deputy Moloney wonders whether there is any way out without this way of legislating on an important topic. One way is a Bill which includes everything and I suppose nine-tenths of the legislation we pass does not require anything to be done by regulation or by Order because it itself contains whatever proposals it is intended to give effect to.</P>
    <P>We have got used to two types of regulations and Orders.  One is the type set out in Section 4, namely, that an Order made may be laid before the House and it is open to annulment, but it is open to annulment only if a resolution is passed by either House within a prescribed period, that is, 21 days in which the House has sat.  Of course, if an Order is made on the verge of a summer adjournment, it lies there over that period, having full effect all the time, and can then be brought to a conclusion only within 21 succeeding days of the House resuming its session.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we have the type of Order which Deputy Cosgrave's amendment refers to, the Order which must be affirmatively passed.  The Minister gives notice of his intentions and then comes into the House and, as far as speed is concerned, he has control of the speed with which an affirmative Order may come before the House, but the difficulty is with regard to an Order he may want to make on the verge of a long break, and that is the difficulty we have to meet.</P>
    <P>At the moment&mdash;the Minister will agree, I think&mdash;he has machinery at his disposal&mdash;the Supplies and Services Act <Col N="234" /> machinery.  He may say that that may go one of these days, that it should have gone long ago.  It is still there but it may go.  Very good; let us think of the future.  There is a type of legislation that we know.  I think we had an example quite recently of what is called Imposition of Duties confirmation. Under that, duties may be imposed and they take effect but they must be confirmed inside a certain period, but while that period is running, the order is of validity and has full effect.  I have never seen that particular type of approach brought into an order or regulation but there is no reason why it could not be done. If the Minister thinks there may be some difficulty about an Order which has to wait and if he wants to get something done at once, a way out could be found in this&mdash;imposing on the Minister the necessity of bringing his order before the House and having it confirmed, but putting in it that it is valid over a certain period but must be confirmed within a certain time.  That would certainly meet any difficulty that I have ever experienced in the way of hire-purchase regulations.</P>
    <P>I want to put another view to the Minister.  Hire-purchase has become an element in State finance&mdash;all this matter about expansion and the development of credit and the restriction of credit.  When one blocks up one channel, say, through bank credit or through, say, exactions of a Government type, those who want to get money on easy terms will find some other way out.  A way that was found during the past five or six years was through extension of hire-purchase. There is no doubt that that did have an impact on the country when it was thought necessary to restrict borrowing for hire-purchase&mdash;and hire-purchase is only another form of borrowing&mdash; but it was found easy to restrict that; there was no difficulty whatever.  That had to be done quite urgently and it was done and done effectively and urgently.  I do not see why that should not prevail for the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to have a look at this again.  Again, as Deputy Moloney said, it may be possible to say: Let him have an Order which <Col N="235" /> will take effect immediately and take effect until it is annulled, if it is to deal with certain important points.  But, what does the Minister want to do by Order?&mdash;Everything.  Read again his phrases.  He &ldquo;may by order provide for the regulation and control of the hire-purchase, sale upon credit and letting of goods or of any class or description of goods.&rdquo;  That is everything. Then he pinpoints the details by saying in a later paragraph, including the words &ldquo;Without prejudice&rdquo;, &ldquo;What I want to be able to do by order is the following;&rdquo; and then he sets out the important matter of hire-purchase.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister must give a better explanation.  Was the 1946 Act found to be in any way deficient?  Did it require an amendment oftener than once?  Was the machinery for meeting an emergency found to be effective? Is there any chance that in a critical situation that machinery will cease to be effective or is it likely to be abandoned and, if so, is there no other method of achieving the Minister's object and with which the House would sympathise?  Is there no other way of achieving it except by giving himself full power to do everything by Order and having that Order left as we know the way these Orders always go?  You get them on the back of an Order Paper.  They are supposed to be published and put on the Table of the House.  In the main, nobody bothers about them and the time passes until the time for annulling the Order is gone.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister either weakens the objectives of Section 6 and segregates those that are important and then let us consider whether we would permit him to have those done by an Order which is effective until annulled and then let him segregate another lot and say: &ldquo;These are of great importance. They do impact upon the whole business of hire-purchase and they are not small details that ought to be regulated by Order of a specialised type.  These are the important things.&rdquo; Let us then start off with something in the Bill and say that any amendment that is to be done by Order shall be <Col N="236" /> done by Order that requires the consent of Parliament.</P>
    <P>What is Parliament for if not to deal with that sort of thing?  If a question is raised about Parliament not being in session and about urgency arising, we can meet that point of view.  I would not mind even giving the Minister full control of Orders, say, where it was necessary in order to meet a balance of payments difficulty, if it arose, and where some interference with hire-purchase was sought by those who promulgated the Order in order to restrain so as to better a balance of payments situation.</P>
    <P>I do think that we are getting very definitely into the position so much canvassed in England at the moment which they have stopped over there.  It led to the promulgation of a book by a celebrated judge, called <i>The New Despotism</i>, where he showed the effect, and the deteriorating effect, he thought, of proceeding in a certain way and where he said that control has been taken from the parliamentary representatives and handed over to Departments. Then you got a further book, a much more cogent piece of work, called <i>Law and Orders.</i>  The clear distinction was made as between law, which is what Parliament is supposed to fashion, and Orders which every Department wants because they make for administrative ease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to urge on the Minister the desirability of accepting this amendment, even with some modification such as was suggested by Deputy Moloney.  I can understand the difficulty in the case of a confirmatory Order where the Minister makes an Order either on the eve of a recess or shortly after the House adjourns for the summer or other long recess.  In that case it could be provided that a confirmatory Order must be made within 21 sitting days.  Even in that case, very considerable matters may have been dealt with, but, at any rate, the principle of confirmatory approval by the House, or the affirmative from being adopted, would be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the E.S.B. Bill which was quoted dealt only with <Col N="237" /> certain comparatively limited matters and in any event, the power to terminate a supply of electricity is rarely used except in the case of non-payment of the sum due for a previous supply.  That has been the subject of considerable discussion.  At any rate, the Electricity Supply Board might feel entitled to be paid in respect of a supply.</P>
    <P>In this case, the Order which it is proposed to make deals with a very wide variety of matters, not merely the matters referred to in Section 6. There are subsequent sections which apply to Part II of the Act, under which a fine and imprisonment may be imposed in respect of a breach of these Orders.  It is conceivable that a person might find himself liable on conviction of an offence to a penalty not exceeding £100 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or indeed to both such fine and such imprisonment and he might have been entirely ignorant of the terms of the Order.  While ignorance of the law is not an excuse, in a matter of this sort which affects and touches the lives of a greater number of people and a wider variety of interests and types of business than ever before, there is a very strong case for allowing the Legislature to have authority, in the form of an affirmative Order or a confirmatory Order.</P>
    <P>Section 6, which has been referred to, deals with matters that are fundamental to hire-purchase agreements in future.  Consequently, we feel that the authority of the Oireachtas could be made effective by the means which I propose in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan began by saying that Section 6 was, in effect, the whole of everything that dealt with hire-purchase.  The 1946 Act dealt with the legal rights and the liabilities of parties engaged in hire-purchase transactions.  It regulated the powers of the court and such matters.  There was hire-purchase legislation in active operation for a period without any reference to Orders.  I cannot understand how the Deputy can suggest this is the whole business of hire-purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> Deputy McGilligan went on to refer to other things that were done and then tried to anticipate the arguments I might make against them. He has anticipated most of what I would have said against some of the points he made but I should like to remind him again of the circumstances in which an Order, prescribing minimum deposits and maximum periods of repayment, was made in 1956.  That, as he says, was done under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1946. That legislation has been repealed but even if it were there, I do not think its life would be very much longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period of this Government, 18 months ago. That order was made on 12th March, 1956.  In November, 1955, the Minister for Finance who caused that Order to be made, I presume, because of the balance of payments problem, referred to the difficulty that was likely to arise in connection with hire-purchase. That was in November, 1955; nevertheless, while he would have had time to amend the 1946 Act, to introduce a provision such as is now suggested by Deputies opposite, he did not do so.  He did nothing and a situation developed in which he found he had to take very quick action and he had recourse to the Supplies and Services Act for the purpose.  That is the outstanding case in which such action was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Acts and I think that reference is in support of rather than against the section as it stands.  Such Orders are made from time to time according as they appear to be necessary and they are confirmed by way of legislation within 12 months of their being made.  The only departure is that legislation will not be <Col N="239" /> necessary in this case but at least the Oireachtas has the right to pass a resolution annulling or revoking such Orders.  I do not think action in advance of the Orders being made would make those interested in the operation of the Orders any more aware of them than they would be by way of the ordinary means of advertising resorted to on such occasions. I cannot see that any difficulty will be created.  On the contrary, I can see many difficulties being created by tying the hands of the Minister in the way suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>There is one other instance to which I should refer and it makes it necessary for expedition in the making of these Orders, that is, the case in which there is evasion of an Order when it is made and evasion of the effect of the legislation.  There have been many instances of dealers, through one ruse or another, being able to evade the requirements of the law.  It would be necessary to act swiftly in the case of some of these evasions to ensure that certain requirements will be followed and in order to bring such evasion to a speedy end so as to avoid damage being done either to the community or to the economy.  I regret again I cannot see my way to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A very disquieting note has just been introduced in regard to evasions.  It is now proposed to take power by Order to protect the community against evasions. Does the Minister mean retrospectively or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong with bringing in an Order with the power I have suggested, having the Order valid for a certain period and having to be confirmed inside that period?  How many evasions have there been since 1946?  How many times has this House moved to protect the community against evasions under the original Act?  There was one occasion when there was an Order made under the Supplies and Services Act.  On occasions when actions were taken in the courts, the usual procedure <Col N="240" /> followed was to have a case stated and brought to the superior courts.  The mere fact that these actions were taken stopped certain abuses that certainly at one time were thought to be growing.  However, there was no crisis caused to the community by any supposed evasion.  It was understood there were various people who had ways of getting out of some of the Orders.  They were not such a large section as to cause any great difficulty and in the main, the serious cases were stopped in their tracks because people knew if they were to continue with that procedure, they might have to pay very heavy costs because the State had always the power to state a case from the lower courts to the higher courts.</P>
      <P>The other side of the question is the balance of payments problem.  It is the one thing I can understand as being a possible difficulty in connection with this matter.  I have another piece of legislation in my hand which is to be discussed one of these days, the Rent Restrictions Bill.  That lays down certain provisions in regard to houses which will be decontrolled and in regard to houses which will be kept under control.  There is a permission given to increase the rent that may be charged for certain houses and there is a percentage stipulated here.  The Minister might as well argue in regard to that Bill that one would not be sure whether the 12½ per cent. in certain cases would be insufficient or excessive.  Why would not power be taken to deal with that by Order? Because it is not parliamentary procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, this section has serious consequences. An Order comes in here quietly without any great notice being given to it and after a particular period, it becomes law.  There is no question of debate or newspaper publicity or of questions being asked about it.  The Order simply goes through and after that, the Minister appoints authorised officers.  They may inspect premises and ask certain questions.  It is an offence to refuse to answer those questions. It is an offence to obstruct the officers in carrying out the duty the <Col N="241" /> Minister has prescribed by Order without the leave of this House.  The Order goes through unnoticed with no confirmation in an open way.  As I have said already, Section 6 is, in effect, the whole of this Bill.  With regard to regulations and control of hire-purchase, Section 6 provides&mdash;I do not know if the Minister observed this before but in case he did not, I shall read it again:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order provide for the regulation and control of the hire-purchase, sale upon credit and letting of goods or of any class or description of goods.</P>
    <P>It then details certain points on which it may be necessary to bind by Order. Everything in connection with hire-purchase is given to the Minister to do by Order.  I suggest he should have another look at it to see is there a mid-way course, accept the ideal that the Order has to be confirmed in the main, and meet the exceptional cases by the provision I have suggested to him, borrowed from the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Act, where a thing is made valid for a certain period only but must be confirmed if its validity is to be continued.</P>
    <P>I do not see how that could impede the Minister if he does as Deputy Cosgrave suggested and ensures that the confirmation must be carried out within a certain period.  That will get over the difficulty of a long vacation. I do not see why, when we are breaking new ground in a bad way, it should not be done in a better way, by having the addition of the type of Order I have suggested, borrowed from the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Act.</P>

      <P>I should like to correct a suggestion by the Deputy that these Orders are brought in quietly.  There is no intention of bringing them in quietly.  They will be given full publicity in the Press and radio and they will be laid on the Table of the Oireachtas.  There is no suggestion, I am sure, that there is any attempt in doing that to try to bring them in without the knowledge of the Opposition, or without the knowledge, certainly, of the main Opposition Parties and Government Deputies who, in the ordinary course of their duties, have recourse to these Orders.  I suggest the annulment provision contained in Section 6 is sufficient safeguard to ensure that nothing damaging to the community, or damaging to democracy for that matter, could or would be done.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before Section 6, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Any person who sells or lets goods by way of a hire-purchase agreement or credit-sale agreement shall not be entitled to enforce any agreement for such sale or letting or any right to recover the goods unless a draft of the hire-purchase agreement or credit-sale agreement under which the goods are sold was sent to the intended hirer or <Col N="245" /> purchaser by prepaid registered post at least forty-eight hours before such agreement is signed by the purchaser or hirer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that people will not sign a hire-purchase contract without reading it from beginning to end.  It was my belief, which I have now verified by personal experience, that an opportunity is very seldom afforded to a proposed hirer to read a hire-purchase agreement or, if it is, the opportunity is accompanied by so much ridicule and inconvenience that people very seldom read such agreements.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the main provisions of hire-purchase contracts are understood by the majority of people.  However, many hire-purchase contracts introduce clauses, the contents of which are not read or are not understood by people who put their names to the contract.  As everybody here knows, be he lawyer or layman, no person can be heard to say that he did not understand or read the contents of any document which he has signed.</P>
    <P>There are hire-purchase contracts, particularly in relation to television sets, radios or delicate or perishable equipment, which contain a clause providing that the hirer must insure the television set, the radio or the piece of mechanism in question.  All too frequently, the hirer is not aware of that imposition upon him until, perhaps, some accident takes place which renders the television set or the radio or the piece of equipment in question useless.  By that time it is too late for the person to fulfil the obligation of insuring the set.</P>
    <P>There are many people who believe that under a hire-purchase contract the obligation and the practice of insurance lies on the person who is selling the set.  Frequently also there are special clauses introduced into a hire-purchase agreement in respect of the goods I have mentioned which impose an obligation on the person hiring the set to contribute a certain sum towards the person selling the set as a running charge for repairs.  In many cases the people are not aware <Col N="246" /> of this imposition until they get a bill for the charges.  In other cases they are not aware of the obligation on the person selling the set to carry out repairs.</P>
    <P>There are many other clauses introduced by different firms for their own convenience or because of their own experience where people signing hire-purchase contracts have not an opportunity of reading before they signed the contracts.  I know of my own knowledge of a case in this city where a person went into a reputable business house to hire a television set on a rental agreement.  He was given a long closely printed form of foolscap size with the print as close as it is on the various Bills and documents we get.</P>
    <P>He said he wished to have an opportunity of reading it.  The shop was crowded and the assistant was almost rude to him when he insisted upon reading the form The assistant said: &ldquo;Very well, you will have to wait until the end of the day to be attended to.&rdquo;  Under pressure of that nature the man in question signed the closely printed document and it was not until some days later, after the television aerial had been erected under a hire-purchase agreement and was blown down in a storm, causing damage to the tune of £90, that it was discovered that the agreement which he signed was not a rental agreement at all but a hire-purchase contract.  As a result, the sole property in the television set and aerial remained in the man selling it and damage to the tune of £90 had to be paid on that account.</P>
    <P>I feel certain that there are many Deputies who can quote individual cases which have come to their knowledge of a like kind.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the contents of the hire-purchase agreement will be known to a person before that person signs it.  As things stand at present, there is, of course, an obligation on the person selling any article on a hire-purchase agreement to send a copy of the hire-purchase contract subsequent to the contract in question having been signed but by then it is too late for any person to have second <Col N="247" /> thoughts on the matter or go back on the agreement.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I have put down would impose a new obligation on people who are selling goods under a hire-purchase agreement to transmit by registered post to the address of the proposed hirer not less than 48 hours before the hire-purchase contract is ultimately signed a true draft of the proposed hire-purchase agreement. That would have the advantage that a person would at least have a reasonable opportunity of reading the agreement from beginning to end.  It would also mean that the proposed hirer would have an opportunity of getting advice on the meaning of clauses in the hire-purchase agreement which, in many cases, are phrased in quite intricate, legal phraseology which might not be understood by a layman.  If a person signing an agreement wishes to have an opportunity of getting that advice, I believe that person should be afforded that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister's reply might be that as things are there is no reason why a person would not insist upon getting a hire-purchase agreement in advance; that he could be furnished with a copy and given all due consideration before signing it, but in the practice of the trade that kind of opportunity does arise.  Any worthwhile salesman is able to urge a person to sign on the dotted line before the person leaves the shop.</P>
    <P>That is the way in which so much hire-purchase transactions are carried out in the City of Dublin.  Hire-purchase is conducted in reputable shops and stores but there are some people who are less reputable than many of the business houses.  They go round from door to door and get the signature of housewives in the absence of their husband.  Sometimes they sell next to worthless goods in that particular manner.  Again, if the obligation is laid on such salesmen to transmit by registered post 48 hours before a contract became binding a copy of the agreement, there is a strong probability that the proposal would be considered not only by the proposed hirer but by those people who would be in close <Col N="248" /> association with the hirer&mdash;a husband, wife, or other member of the family.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that the purpose of this legislation and of all hire-purchase legislation is to prevent marginal cases where people make fools of themselves by entering into commitments which they cannot really afford on the one hand and, on the other, to prevent sharp practice on the part of dealers.  I cannot see any more effective way of doing that than by adopting my amendment which would allow people a reasonable opportunity of seeing what they are incurring before they sign the hire-purchase agreement.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister's Department are well aware of the type of canvass and the type of bait which is thrown out to gullible people to enter into hire-purchase transactions which they cannot afford.  I hold in my hand a sample of the type of unsavoury business dealing which is leading people into transactions which involve them in considerable hardship later on.</P>
    <P>This is a little pink document, beautifully bordered, issued by a firm in this city.  It bears on the top a green blob on which the words &ldquo;Privileged customer's cheque&rdquo; are inscribed.  It begins and ends with considerable flattery.  It was issued to a man who purchased a small article under a hire-purchase agreement.  When his wife went in to pay off one of the last instalments, she was handed this to entice her, in her own name and without prior consultation with her husband, to enter into further obligations.  This privileged customer's cheque goes on to read: &ldquo;This is to certify that the holder of this cheque is a privileged customer and is entitled to purchase any goods in our store up to the amount which is stated below.&rdquo;  Then in larger words: &ldquo;No deposit.  No increase in present payments up to the amount of £20.&rdquo;  The person began with the purchase of a necessary household article costing £5 and because she was described as a privileged customer the lady of the house was enticed into buying unnecessary goods to the tune of £20.</P>
    <P>In case that was not sufficient to <Col N="249" /> entice the unfortunate woman, without prior consideration or without second thoughts to enter into commitments which will stretch over a much longer period, on the back of the privileged customer's cheque is another enticement, &ldquo;to celebrate our annual stocktaking sale&rdquo;.  I do not know of any businessmen who celebrate their annual stocktaking sale but apparently this particular store believe it is a way of enticing customers and the manner in which they celebrate that stocktaking sale is to give a splendid gift, a gift which is offered to every customer spending £15 or more.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be referring to the methods employed by business concerns to secure business but the amendment deals with an entirely different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that perhaps I am drifting away from my amendment but I think you will bear with me, Sir, when I explain that the purpose of my amendment is to put a brake on that type of enticement.  The type of salesmanship or business dealing which I am describing is the kind which entices people to enter into hire-purchase obligations without fully considering the consequences.  It is something like inducing a person with the attraction of unlimited credit without giving the person an opportunity of considering whether or not he or she is in a position to repay the credit which is being unnecessarily offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the Minister or his Department may feel that the course which I suggest may be open to fraud, that the proof which it would require in court in order to establish that it was a binding hire-purchase contract might be difficult to furnish, but although these difficulties are real I think they are small compared with the serious difficulties and serious abuses which I believe must be stopped and stopped very soon.  I would ask the Minister to accept that very few people read the hire-purchase transactions which they sign by reason of their length and their terminology and by reason of the practice of the trade. <Col N="250" /> I do not think that is a good thing.  A person should not sign a contract until he has had an opportunity of reading it and understanding it.  That is the purpose of my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the point made by the Deputy.  As he will see, and as he has already seen, this legislation is designed to lean in favour of the hirer and the customer in most cases, while at the same time maintaining a fair balance on behalf of the owner of the goods.  Nevertheless, I think that the provision he now seeks to introduce is hardly likely to be acceptable either to the hirer or the owner of the goods. He knows as well as I do that even where people have legal advice in matters of signing agreements they often claim, and perhaps with some justification, that when they sign agreements they have not any knowledge of what they contain.  Even though they have had an opportunity, or may have had an opportunity, of reading the form, in fact they do not do so.  It is often difficult and sometimes impossible to protect people against their own carelessness.</P>
      <P>I feel the obligation to send a copy of the hire-purchase agreement to be entered into by the parties&mdash;by the owner to the hirer of the goods&mdash;is hardly likely to induce the hirer to read the agreement unless he is a person who normally would be likely to do so.  In any event, it is true that a period of 48 hours would give him an opportunity greater than he or she might have otherwise but I would say a prudent customer always asks for a copy of the agreement to read and take home for consultation before signing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, too, the difficulty, which may be big or small, as to requiring the necessary proof that the draft agreement was in fact sent to the hirer 48 hours in advance of entering into the agreement.  It would, of course, impose a difficulty which it might not be possible to overcome in certain circumstances.  I believe that this obligation would be regarded as an irritant not only by the owner of the goods or the shopkeeper but by the hirer or customer as well.  Even <Col N="251" /> though I have some sympathy with the spirit of the amendment, I do not think it would be practicable to enforce the obligation in all cases.  In any case, it would be impossible to protect the type of person that the Deputy wants to protect by the means he suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will bear in mind, as I believe he will, the tenor of my remarks when making Orders setting out the form of the hire-purchase agreement, I believe that the main object of my amendment will be met.  If a simpler and more easily understood form of agreement could be made available to the general public I believe they would have the necessary information before signing the agreement and we might not hear so many complaints about not having an opportunity of understanding the agreement.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 and amendment No. 7 are consequential and might be debated together.  The Deputy will understand that if No. 4 is negatived No. 7 may not be moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, sir.  I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Before Section 6, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Without prejudice to paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of Section 6, the minimum deposit to be paid by a buyer or hirer shall not be less than ten per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grounds for this amendment are, to a great extent, similar to those in respect of the previous amendment. The purpose again is to ensure that a person will not enter into a hire-purchase contract without being afforded an opportunity to have second thoughts about the obligation which he is undertaking.  I can appreciate <Col N="252" /> that from time to time the Minister or the Government, by reason of the financial position and the necessity for encouraging or discouraging people in regard to the purchase of particular goods, may wish to vary minimum deposits.  But I really believe that no person should be permitted to enter into hire-purchase contracts for anything under the sun unless he or she has sufficient discipline to save 10 per cent. of the cost price.  Take any article, say a television set and an aerial.  They will in future be bought here in even greater numbers than in the northern part of the country in the last couple of years.  They are available at a cost of about £90 to £100.  Ten per cent. of that is only £10 and the majority of these contracts extend over a period of about two years.</P>
    <P>For simple arithmetical purposes we can say that 10 per cent. amounts to a pound per week for 10 weeks, and then the balance is spread over a period of about three years.  If a person has not sufficient self-discipline to save up the deposit represented by 10 per cent. before entering a hire-purchase contract, for his own protection, he should not be allowed to enter into a hire-purchase agreement.  That is the object of my amendment.</P>
    <P>It also has the objectives I already mentioned in relation to the previous amendment.  If a person has to discipline himself to save for ten weeks to put down a deposit, then he is certainly going to consider the meaning and the results of paying out or saving the same amount for the next two years.  At the moment, unfortunately, people frequently enter into hire-purchase obligations without considering any other commitments they have to meet.  The lady of the house who has not got the grocer's bill or the electricity bill or the gas or telephone bills in her hand at the time can quite easily forget about having to meet these various obligations at the end of another week or month, but if she has to save the minimum deposit of ten per cent. before entering into a hire-purchase contract, then I believe she will seriously consider whether or not she can afford to meet the further commitment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> All too many people are not comfortably able to meet their commitments. I can appreciate that the Minister can quote statistics showing that the number of defaulters on hire-purchase contracts is relatively small in proportion to the number of hire-purchase transactions entered into. That is true but again, that must be set off against the fact that many homes go without the necessities of life in order to keep up the hire-purchase payments because they feel that if they do not, the particular article may be taken from them or that they may have to meet extra legal costs and may have the embarrassment of the sheriff and all that kind of thing to follow.  Apart from their knowledge of the consequences of not paying, these people have a certain pride and do not wish to lose the respect of their neighbours and it is frequently the children who suffer either in relation to their food or clothing.</P>
    <P>A minimum deposit of ten per cent. will ensure that only those with sufficient self-discipline would be given an opportunity of entering into hire-purchase contracts.  I do not believe that this would reduce the amount of hire-purchase business by any very great amount but it will undoubtedly ensure that only those who are creditworthy will be allowed to enter into hire-purchase agreements.  At present many unfortunate people, for their own sakes, should not be permitted to enter into hire-purchase agreements.  I quoted already from the &ldquo;privileged customer cheque&rdquo;.  That is an example of the kind of thing that would be prevented or discouraged if the Minister accepts my amendment.  I kept the percentage as low as ten per cent. because I believe that is one which would not be unfair either to the customer or to the businessman. If in relation to the &ldquo;privileged customer cheque&rdquo; where credit is to be given to the tune of £20, if the customer had to get £2 before being given the £20 worth there is less chance of a gullible person being caught by a slick salesman before leaving the shop and less chance of a person on his own doorstep being trapped by a slick salesman if such persons could not enter <Col N="254" /> into commitments without having the necessary cash to put down.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that in relation to any deposit whether written into this Bill itself or whether prescribed by the Minister there are avenues open for fraud.  Various loopholes can be availed of as in the past and I have no doubt the Minister will fill the loopholes before he prescribes any minimum deposit.  It is a good thing to enshrine the principle of a minimum deposit in the Bill itself.  In an earlier section we had a very sound criticism of the tendency to leave all the legislation to the administration instead of to the Legislature.  I think that in relation to something like the minimum deposit the House should take its courage in its hands.  The Minister should take courage and prescribe a minimum deposit below which no hire-purchase transaction would be permissible. If he does that I think he will get the support of the vast majority of the people and I should be only too glad to see him get credit for that. If he does that he will put people on guard against hire-purchase transactions and it will not prevent him from increasing under Section 6 the minimum deposit to 15 or 25 per cent. or as much as the circumstances at any particular time required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said in the concluding part of his speech, acceptance of this amendment would mean a legislative provision providing for a minimum deposit in respect of all goods.  As the Bill stands, Section 6 provides that the Minister may by Order prescribe the minimum deposit in particular cases.  In reply to the debate on an earlier amendment, I stated that there is an obligation that the Minister for Finance be consulted before the Order prescribing the minimum deposit is made and that the circumstances under which it would be made are ones in which the balance of payments problem would arise, or, as well as that, where it might be necessary to try to correct an inflationary trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were the circumstances in which the Order was made in 1956, but even in those serious circumstances, the minimum deposit conditions <Col N="255" /> did not apply to certain types of goods such as agricultural or industrial equipment, commercial motor vehicles, tractors, cookers, fishing boats or fishing gear.  In general, I think it desirable that no minimum deposit would be prescribed in the case of at least some of that category of goods&mdash;agricultural and industrial machinery and perhaps fishing boats and gear.  If there were a minimum deposit, it might be, in relation to the cost of the goods, so high as to make the possibility of entering into hire purchase transactions too remote.  Therefore, I would suggest that the provisions in Section 6 of the Bill are sufficient to ensure that the objective of meeting the balance of payments situation or curbing inflation are sufficient and that in the event of a minimum deposit being required, there should be no standard minimum because of the necessity of facilitating hire-purchase in certain respects.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The prior consideration I have is not the national balance of payments but the household balance of payments.  I can understand the Minister's reluctance to impose a general minimum if, in so doing, he may prevent people from acquiring necessary agricultural industrial or fishing equipment, but such cases if needs be, could be excluded from the Bill and left to Ministerial Order.  The types of articles I have in mind are those which, in the main, are governed by this Bill&mdash;ordinary household necessaries and luxuries, anything from linoleum to a standard lamp, or a piano, articles which people are induced to buy frequently, even though they do not require them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person entering into a hire-purchase contract with a firm which sells household goods never gets out of that firm with only one hire-purchase commitment.  Such a person is invariably inveigled into entering into further and further commitments.  The insidious trend not to allow a person to get out of the grip of these hire-purchase firms would be arrested, were the Minister prepared to impose a minimum deposit, irrespective of <Col N="256" /> whether or not the balance of payments position or the national finances demanded it.  If such a deposit is imposed, so much credit would not be needed to finance hire-purchase business.  I believe that would be a good thing nationally, quite apart from the balance of payments position at all.  Most hire-purchase financing comes from abroad.  It is pumped in here.  It has a continuous inflationary effect upon the economy.  I am not one of those who is frightened by inflation, but I think the type of inflation resulting from unnecessary hire-purchase financing should be restricted in some degree.  That would be the effect if this ten per cent. deposit were imposed.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 3, before &ldquo;The Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;In respect of any hire-purchase agreement or credit-sale agreement&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 can be taken together, and possibly with some others as well: Nos. 8, 10 and 11.  These were intended to be complementary to the amendment which Deputy Cosgrave moved with regard to these Orders.  If the House did not see fit to have Orders generally requiring confirmation, they might give the Minister power to regulate by Order, which becomes effective unless negatived, and that might restrict him to certain things.  The vote must be regarded as unfavourable to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands, the Minister &ldquo;may by Order provide for the regulation and control of the hire-purchase, sale upon credit and letting of goods or of any class of description of goods.&rdquo;  Hire-purchase has been defined in earlier Acts.  I understand credit sale is also defined and in amendment No. 14, in the name of the Minister, I notice the use of the <Col N="257" /> term &ldquo;credit-sale&rdquo;.  He moves there to delete certain words&mdash;&ldquo;letting or selling goods&rdquo;&mdash;and to insert &ldquo;letting goods, whether under hire-purchase agreements or otherwise, or selling goods by credit-sale agreements.&rdquo; Credit-sale is, I think, a term which has its definition, and that definition is narrow.  What the Minister proposes to do is to take power to regulate sale upon credit.  Everybody who does not pay his bill immediately enters into a sale on credit.  Surely the Minister does not want to regulate the sale of ordinary household goods which are obtained on a weekly or monthly basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister uses very wide terms when he speaks of &ldquo;letting or selling goods&rdquo; of any class or description.  If a person takes a furnished house for a holiday, it could be said that the equipment in the rooms is let to him. I am sure that that is not intended under this Bill.  I tried to restrict this and bring it down to what I thought was the real purpose, namely, that in respect of a hire-purchase agreement or a credit-sale agreement, these regulations may flow.</P>
    <P>I am really speaking on the section now because my amendments are governed by the decision taken on amendment No. 3.  I do not understand, when there is this necessity to have everything done by Order, why there is any necessity for developing the point.  Why would the Minister not be content with Section 6 (1): &ldquo;The Minister may by order provide for&rdquo; and then follow certain general matters?  Why set out the details in subsection (2) under (a), (b), (c), (d)? Now the Minister wants to add (e).  If he wants to have it so broad, it seems to me it could easily be left with Section 6 (1) and subsection (4), and possibly (5).  The Minister is aware that on occasion matters come in for argument before courts in which there is a general phrase followed by certain special terms, and the special terms are regarded as limited by what is in the general phrase.  I am very glad that there is some restriction imposed, but I do not see why the Minister wants to put all that in.  During the war, when Emergency Powers <Col N="258" /> Orders were in operation, they were paraphrased in one edition of <i>Dublin Opinion:</i>&ldquo;They really mean the Government may, when it thinks fit, do anything that pleases it.&rdquo;  This is the same.  The Minister wants to do what he likes about hire-purchase. Why specialise then in regard to these extra points?  That is an argument on the section.  &ldquo;Hire-purchase&rdquo; is a recognised term.  I do not know why the Orders should relate to sale upon credit of any class or description of goods, or the letting of goods of any class or description.  That is certainly far beyond the terms of a hire-purchase Bill.  It should, of course, include credit-sales, but credit-sales as defined.</P>

      <P>The use of the phrase &ldquo;letting of goods&rdquo; is for the purpose of preventing any attempt at circumventing the purposes of the legislation.  I am informed that there are occasionally transactions in which goods are let in order to evade regulations or legislative provisions controlling hire-purchase or credit-sales. The Deputy has a valid point in relation to his reference to &ldquo;sale upon credit.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to include as one of the Orders that might be made under Section 6 an Order relating to the information that must be given by traders in advertising goods for sale by way of hire-purchase or credit-sale agreements.  Such Orders may prescribe the cash price for which the goods may be purchased.  I suggest that this is a desirable inclusion in the form of display that a trader will have in connection with advertising hire-purchase goods.  If the customer, having been attracted by a particular Article in the display, is aware of the total hire-purchase price and the price or which the goods can be acquired or cash, as well as the period over which payments will be required of him and the amount of the payments, it will give him, the customer, full information on the amount of the commitments he is likely to enter into. In particular, it will give him the necessary information as to cash prices and total hire-purchase prices and will give him the opportunity of assessing whether or not he is getting a good bargain, whether he might do better by trying to buy the goods outright for cash or whether it would be in his interest to accept the rates of payment and the period in which these payments must be made as displayed by the owners of the goods.</P>

      <P>This amendment has been submitted as a result of suggestions made during the course of the Second Reading debate. The purpose of it is that an authorised officer, on entering premises, will be required to produce immediately on entry to the person in charge of the premises the warrant which carries his authority to inspect such premises.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Except for one thing.  This says he shall produce the warrant &ldquo;to the person in charge of the premises.&rdquo;  I had put it in a different form: the phrase, already in the legislation, &ldquo;if requested by any person affected.&rdquo;  Suppose an officer enters a premises and there is a caretaker there. It is sufficient, apparently, to produce that warrant to the person in charge <Col N="263" /> of the premises.  He may not be a responsible person at all.  I know that, later on, &ldquo;at all reasonable times&rdquo; and all the rest is stated.  But you might have somebody of no special importance in connection with the business and he could be regarded as in charge of the premises.  This now is on first entry.  The authorised officer has to produce his warrant to the person. It is quite proper to have it produced on entry.  This is a much better phrase.  However, I think the person in charge of the premises, if it means the person then in charge of the premises, must be somebody responsible such as an owner or a member of a company.  That would be all right. It depends on the interpretation given to it but this is certainly an improvement on the wording of the section.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26 could be discussed together. Amendment No. 21 is designed to achieve three distinct purposes.  It provides that the powers of an authorised officer to obtain information under Section 9, subsection (1), will be exercisable only in relation to persons engaged in the letting of goods under hire-purchase agreements or otherwise, or the selling of goods on, credit-sale terms.  The subsection, as drafted, applies to the sale of goods and this is considered too wide, and rightly so, for the purposes of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The second purpose is to provide for the deletion of the words &ldquo;any activity in connection with&rdquo; where they appear in line 47.  In other words, if these words were permitted to remain in the section, it could happen that an authorised officer could go to a trader's bank and ask a bank clerk or teller certain questions which might have no relation whatever to the transaction the authorised officer was expected to investigate.  The third purpose is that the submission of this amendment is being availed of by the Parliamentary draftsman to transpose certain words and to secure a better form of drafting.</P>

      <P>The only point I have to make is that the amendment is undoubtedly an improvement because it would cut out the possibility that any activity in connection with all these people could be brought under notice and made the subject of inspection. But, even in the part as amended, there is still this peculiar phrase &ldquo;the business of letting goods under hire-purchase or otherwise.&rdquo;  I know what letting goods under hire-purchase and sale-credit is, but &ldquo;letting goods otherwise&rdquo; is still a little obscure and something to be looked into.  Outside that, I asked the Minister to cut out the phrase &ldquo;any activity&rdquo; wherever it occurs.  The Minister has cut it out here but he has not cut it out of sub-paragraph (b).  It seems to me that everywhere the Minister sees the word &ldquo;activity&rdquo; in the original draft Bill, he should put in the word &ldquo;business&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that no one will have to answer any question or give any evidence tending to incriminate himself, when requested by the Minister to furnish information under Section 7.  That is the section which requires a person to give certain information to the Minister &mdash;books, documents, records, etc., which the Minister may require for the purposes of this Part of the Bill, that is, Part II.

I only want to have it made clear that a person refusing to incriminate himself could surely not be found guilty of obstructing an <Col N="267" /> authorised officer.  I know that an effort was made, though I do not know in what particular piece of legislation, to have it accepted that a person refusing to give information which would tend to incriminate him was alleged to be obstructing and impeding an authorised officer.

      <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that any person who does not comply with a request by the Minister under Section 7&mdash;that is the section to which I referred a few minutes ago&mdash; shall be guilty of an offence.  The powers of obtaining information under Section 7 are essential for the discharge of the Minister's functions and it would be impossible to discharge these functions, unless, in the event of a person refusing to comply with certain requests, there was a corresponding penalty.  This amendment ensures that there will be such a penalty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The section sets out to prohibit the disclosure of information obtained by any authorised officer acting in accordance with the powers given to him under the Act.  It states that this prohibition on the disclosure of information is not to apply to a communication by an authorised officer in the exercise of his duties and that is <Col N="268" /> all right.  Secondly, it is not to apply to the disclosure of information &ldquo;for the purpose of legal proceedings under this Part of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One could contemplate a situation where information otherwise prohibited was disclosed when an action was contemplated but where the legal proceedings were in fact not taken. I want to ensure that the disclosure can only be made if the proceedings are in course.  Clearly, one must then allow information to be given.  Say, somebody is to be penalised for obstructing an officer.  Naturally the officer must be allowed to say what has happened but it ought to be in course of legal proceedings, not merely for the purpose of legal proceedings. Information might be disclosed and the proceedings might not follow.  It would be then a disclosure of a type ordinarily prohibited.  It may not be intended that way but the phrase is rather wide.</P>

      <P>The intention is that the authorised officer would be required to furnish information to the Minister following his investigations to indicate whether or not there are grounds for bringing a prosecution.  I suggest that it would be impossible to bring a prosecution unless certain necessary information were available to the Minister in advance, on which he could make up his mind whether or not a prosecution lay.  If the authorised officer were precluded from giving such information in advance of the actual hearing of the prosecution, there might be many cases in which a judge might say to the person prosecuting the case on behalf of the Minister that the prosecution should never have been brought, that there was no evidence. The Minister must have access to the evidence in advance to ensure that only cases which merit prosecution will be brought.</P>

      <P>I was wrong, then. I misunderstand the section.  I thought the difference between (a) and (b) was that (a) was, so to speak, internal to the Department or the Government and that any communication made by an authorised officer would be made in execution of his duties.  I thought (b) came away from the, so to speak, <Col N="269" /> internal examination in the Department as to whether prosecution ought to be brought or not and that then one went wider and one allowed the disclosure of information for the purpose of legal proceedings.  I wanted to narrow it, that the Minister, the Government or the Attorney General could get all the information they wanted for the purpose of deciding whether or not a prosecution would be brought but that when the prosecution was taken the disclosure was only to be made in the course of the legal proceedings, not for the purpose of it.  I thought &ldquo;for the purpose of legal proceedings&rdquo; was covered by (a)&mdash;a communication made by an authorised officer to the Minister.  I took it to be two sections, one the preliminary examination to see whether proceedings should be brought or not and the second, what is going to be disclosed in court.</P>

      <P>Take No. 35 first.  I move amendment No. 35:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (3) and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 or the Courts of Justice Act, 1936 or in the rules of Court, any action in the Circuit Court or in the District Court which shall have been instituted after the commencement <Col N="271" /> of this Act in the area in which the hire purchase agreement is alleged to have been made, and to which subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section relates may, upon the filing of a statutory declaration by the defendant or one of the defendants that (a) he the said defendant does not reside in the Court circuit or area in which the action has been instituted and (b) he believes he has a bona fide defence to the said action or believes himself entitled to relief under this Act or the Hire Purchase Act, 1946 and (c) applies that the action be remitted for hearing in the area in which he does reside (and which he specifies) with the County Registrar or District Court clerk as the case may be of the circuit or area in which the action shall have been instituted in a manner to be prescribed by the Minister under the powers conferred on him under the first part of this Act and provided notice has been given of the said application to the Plaintiffs and to any other party to the action in a manner likewise to be prescribed by the Minister, be, in such order be calculated to promote justice as between the parties to the action, transferred or remitted by the said Court to the appropriate circuit or area in which the said defendant has been declared to reside and the costs of such application shall be costs in the action. The necessary pleadings and a copy of any other record appertaining to the said action shall be transmitted from the office of said County Registrar or District Court Clerk to the area to which the action is remitted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of Section 19 subsection (3) is to require all actions in regard to hire-purchase agreements to recover possession of the goods or arrears of payments in the circuit or district court jurisdictions&mdash;in the circuit court where the hire-purchase price does not exceed £1,000&mdash;to be brought in the area where the defendant resides.  It is usual in agreements of this sort to have the agreement made wherever it is signed.  These agreements <Col N="272" /> in many cases are made at the head office of the company or the place of business.  In other cases they are made at the agent's place of business and possibly in some cases where an agent visits the hirer's home or premises the agreement is signed there.</P>
    <P>It seems appropriate that the action should be brought wherever the agreement is made but it is conceivable that, under the proposal in the Bill, particularly in a case where there are two defendants, if the action must be taken in the circuit court area in which the defendant resides, very considerable additional expense might be involved, that not only will the owner of the goods have to travel but that witnesses may have to travel and, if there is a guarantor, that he will be obliged to travel.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that the present position would continue except where it is shown that it would be to the disadvantage of the defendant to have the action heard in a place other than his own district court area or circuit court district, as the case may be.  As I understand the procedure at present it is possible for judgment to be secured without taking the action in the circuit court area or district as the case may be.  I suggest that this amendment would enable a reasonable arrangement to be made under which the action would be taken in the defendant's area only if it was shown that he would be under a disadvantage otherwise.</P>
    <P>I think the proposal I make is a reasonable one which would enable the interests of both parties to be safeguarded. There is no provision in the Bill as to what will happen if the defendants, if there are two of them, reside in different areas.  That may have to be clarified at a subsequent stage but the existing procedure is satisfactory and if, in a particular case, it is shown that the defendant's position will be worsened, then under the amendment I have put down the case can be heard in the circuit court district or district court area where the defendant resides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that a great many-hire purchase transactions <Col N="273" /> are actually made or deemed to be made in Dublin.  Most of the hire-purchase companies that operate in this country have their headquarters in Dublin and while the contract may be signed and is usually signed by the hirer in his own place of domicile or at his own residence, the signing by the hire-purchase company is done usually in Dublin and at that stage the contract is made.  The contract is completed, I take it, when it is signed by the second party and it is then that the contract is deemed to have been made in law.</P>
      <P>It is true that in the case of contract generally the plaintiff can sue at his discretion either where the contract is made or in a court area where the defendant ordinarily resides.  The intention of the subsection is to take away from a plaintiff in a hire-purchase transaction the right of suing where the contract is made and the purpose is again to lean in favour of the hirer.  In general, hire-purchase companies are powerful organisations. In many cases they have legal advisers employed by them but they have at least legal advisers available to them in the area of their headquarters and in many other parts of the country where they do business.  Many people who enter into hire-purchase transactions with them are, in the main, people who do not have recourse to solicitors in the ordinary way and who would probably avoid recourse to solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, there are under the 1946 Act, and as extended under this Act, certain reliefs which may be given to a defendant by the Court even without the appearance of that defendant.  There is the system whereby a postponed order might be made in favour of the defendant.  For example, if the hirer fails to live up to his obligations and a case is brought to court, the judge or the justice, as the case may be, may make an order requiring the defendant to pay the sum outstanding to the owner of the goods by way of instalments.  In such a case it is likely, and probably usually will be the case, that the person, strictly in law, cannot say in an affidavit he has a good defence to the plaintiff's claim.  It will be a matter of <Col N="274" /> fact that certain instalments are outstanding, that these instalments have not been met by the defendant.  Therefore, strictly speaking, he has no defence.</P>
    <P>In the affidavit to be filed by the defendant, as suggested by Deputy Cosgrave, the person, before he could ask a judge sitting in Dublin to transfer the hearing of the case to his own court area, would have to say in his affidavit that he had in fact a good defence.  It is likely, in any event, that that person, having been served with a civil Bill or process of some other form, may be unwilling to consult a solicitor.  Certainly if he lives in a place like Skibbereen, and if he is sued to appear in the Circuit Court or the District Court in Dublin, it is very unlikely that he will appear.  Certainly it is unlikely he will defend an action in the event of the sum outstanding being a small sum.</P>
    <P>Many of these people, apart from the fear of travelling to a place like Dublin, to defend a case, may not even appear in their own local court to defend an action.  Notwithstanding that, the court could give relief but the fact is that a person might appear in his own local court and point out to the judge who is hearing the case that he has not got a defence, that he was not able to meet his commitments under the hire-purchase agreement but that if he got an easier repayment system he might be able to meet these new obligations.  The subsection was designed to meet such a case.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested, maybe not by the Deputy but in the course of other representations made to me, that the procedure suggested in this subsection could well add to the legal costs of the case, particularly a case that might go by default, which would have to be heard in a local court, in certain circumstances, that is, where an order for the return of the goods might be required.  Usually these hire-purchase companies have agents in most parts of the country and would therefore have reasonable access to local courts. I do not think it would inflict any hardship upon hire-purchase companies to require their agents to attend these local courts.  These agents can go <Col N="275" /> and give evidence of the making of the agreement as well as anybody sitting in a Dame Street office in Dublin.  In many cases they have solicitors acting in local areas who represent them in certain cases, and even if they have not I do not think it would be much of a hardship on them to ask local solicitors to represent them in court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the natural reluctance of people to come to Dublin to defend cases taken in Dublin against them, having regard to their fear of the cost involved and to the facilities with which hire-purchase companies can procure legal advice and legal representation in all parts of the country, I think the subsection as it reads, being in favour of the defendant, is not a hardship on the hire-purchase companies and ought to be agreed by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am anxious to protect in this matter is the defendant's costs rather than those of the hire-purchase company.  I agree the hire-purchase companies can either get legal advice from their head office or get a solicitor to act for them in a circuit court area locally, but in a matter of this kind, if evidence is to be given by a person other than a lawyer, if they have to bring evidence from head office, the defendant in that case taking the action in his own circuit or district area, as the case may be, if the verdict is given against him, will probably be liable for the expense involved and the added burden of paying for evidence of that sort will fall on him.  Whether that is counterbalanced by the fact that if the action is brought, say, in Dublin, or outside the area, where he will have to pay his own travelling expenses, is another matter.  The purpose of my amendment is to safeguard the position from both angles while, at the same time, ensuring that, if the defendant wanted to do so, he could have the action transferred to his own area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well appreciate the Minister's difficulties in this matter.  He has to consider what might be described as the over-all picture and deal with the situation in the circumstances <Col N="276" /> as he finds them.  I think the main fear in this matter on the part of finance houses&mdash;and I can visualise their fear in this respect&mdash;is the infrequency of sittings of the circuit court and, particularly in a large district, cases may arise which would be appropriate to be heard by that court.</P>
      <P>I saw a document which was circulated making representations to Ministers and Deputies and I imagine from that document that it is the infrequency of circuit court hearings they were concerned with.  The position appears to be that when the hire-purchase people have not got possession of the vehicle, it would deteriorate considerably if any action were pending. That is the experience of people who have any connection with hire-purchase.</P>
      <P>The sittings of the circuit courts in country areas are much less frequent than in the metropolitan area.  If that point could be met to any reasonable extent, it might be a help to the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave and it would, I imagine, give some appreciable measure of relief and assistance to the hirers in the case of the district court.  The frequency of district court sittings in rural areas is reasonably good, but it is not quite as good as it is in the city areas.</P>
      <P>In any event, most of the cases that will come to be heard will naturally be before the circuit court because they are usually for £100.  The cost of small transactions of less than £100 is usually the hiring out of household domestic appliances, I think.  The Minister would have a very good case for local hearings because then the people might not be as well equipped to pursue a defence and to take advantage of any facilities for defence as the type of people who would be involved in transactions such as motor cars and industrial equipment.  I was wondering if I was right in assuming that when cases come to be heard before the circuit court, they could, if needs be, come up for hearing in any part of the circuit area covered by a particular judge.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the fear expressed by the Deputy about the <Col N="277" /> deterioration of motor vehicles is concerned, the Deputy will, no doubt, have seen Section 16, under which the owner of a vehicle having commenced an action has certain powers of seizing that vehicle in certain circumstances, one of which is if:&mdash;</P>
      <P>the vehicle has been abandoned or has been left unattended in circumstances which have resulted or are imminently likely to result in damage to, or more than normal depreciation in the value of, the vehicle,</P>
      <P>I suggest that in the case of motor vehicles, at any rate, there is no danger, by reason of any delay which might be experienced between court sittings, of any likelihood of damage to the owner's property.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second point made by the Deputy, I am advised, and it has been my experience, that the circuit court area even in the case in which Deputy Moloney is particularly interested and of which he has most experience, comprising a number of counties as it does&mdash; the southwestern circuit comprises Kerry, Limerick and Clare&mdash;I am advised an action may be brought in any one of the counties, so long as it is within the circuit court area.  Most circuit courts sit week in and week out, with the exception of the ordinary vacation periods.  I believe the minimum number of sitting days for any circuit court judge exceeds 100 days.  If one excludes the long vacation period the short vacation periods, Saturdays and Sundays and perhaps one other day, one can readily see the number of sitting days remaining.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is much force in the suggestion that delays would be involved if the defendant had the right to have his case heard in his local circuit court area.  Certainly, it has no application to district court areas, the Deputy admitted, because the district courts sit very frequently. and I think the justice has power to adjourn a case from one of his sitting towns to another.  I doubt if any delays are likely to occur, so far as district courts are concerned.  In all the circumstances, the fears expressed by Deputy Moloney as to delays are hardly likely to be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> The bringing of witnesses from Dublin to a country venue surely is likely to be no more costly than the expenses of the defendant himself who will have to come to Dublin to prosecute his case.  I think that at least levels out and, if there is any hardship, it would be on the unfortunate defendant who would have to pay his expenses himself, absent himself from his work, perhaps for a day or a day and a half, in order to travel to Dublin and return home, whereas the person acting for the hire-purchase company and giving evidence for them will be acting in the course of his own ordinary work, and would, therefore, incur no hardship from that point of view.  In all those circumstances, a provision requiring a case to be brought in the area in which the defendant resides is a good one and the fairest to all the parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a matter of self-deception to talk in terms of saving costs.  The costs will be bigger but they will be better shared.  Solicitors in the country will get more arising out of hire-purchase actions than they got when those actions were mainly confined to Dublin.  So far as costs are concerned, take the case of an individual in a remote part of Kerry who enters into a hire-purchase transaction and who is involved in an action.  The hire-purchase company may have four or five witnesses who will have to go to Kerry.  There is no saving there at all.  It is an enlargement of the cost of hire-purchase transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave made the point that the person defaulting on the agreement may suffer.  I do not think he will because most of the people who default have not got very much out of which costs may be levied and, in the end, the expenses will be reflected in the charges made for these transactions. The Minister has spoken about the case that goes by default.  I do not know what the circumstances are now but not very many years ago, very few cases went by default.  The courts are very alert to see that the facts are proved.  The witnesses have to be brought to Court.  Very few cases go <Col N="279" /> by default.  I understand the ones that really go by default are those in which the person involved writes to the hire-purchase company and says he does not want to contest the matter.  Such a communication is not always accepted by the judicial authority.</P>
    <P>One might see an occasion for letting the place where the defendant resides be the venue for the trial.  I think Deputy Cosgrave's amendment puts that quite fairly: &ldquo;... upon the filing of a statutory declaration by the defendant or one of the defendants that (a) he the said defendant does not reside in the Court circuit or area in which the action has been instituted and (b) he believes he has a <i>bona fide</i> defence to the said action or believes himself entitled to relieve ... and (c) applies that the action be remitted for hearing in the area in which he does reside ...&rdquo; Lower in the amendment it says &ldquo;... if such order be calculated to promote justice as between the parties to the action ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister says a man may not have a great defence but may indicate he would like a longer time in which to pay.  That is something which the Courts often consider.  A statutory declaration is not a very expensive transaction.  Surely, before an action is transferred, it would be right to insist on some such thing as Deputy Cosgrave indicated in his amendment?  I think it ought to be modified.  We shall now have an enlarged jurisdiction.  If every action will now be shifted to areas where the prospective defendants reside it will make very serious increases in the cost of hire-purchase transactions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete subsection (1) and insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>( )  The jurisdiction of the High Court to remit or transfer actions under Section 25 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, may, in relation to an action pending in the High Court by the owner of goods let under a hire-purchase agreement&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to enforce a right to recover possession of the goods from the hirer, or</P>
      <P>(b)  to enforce payment of a sum due under the hire-purchase agreement or under any contract of guarantee relating thereto,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>at any time before judgment is given in the action, be exercised by the High Court of its own motion and without application in that behalf <Col N="281" /> having been made to it by any party to the action.</P>
    <P>During the course of the Second Reading, the provisions of this section as to the power of remittal of judges in appropriate cases was discussed. The section is now redrafted in the present form.  Its purpose is to ensure that a High Court judge in an appropriate action will have the power to remit or transfer actions to the appropriate court.</P>
    <P>It may happen from time to time and for the convenience of hire-purchase companies that they bring actions in which the district court or the circuit court may have jurisdiction in the High Court in Dublin.  It may be possible, even though it is not likely, that they will make claims above the circuit court jurisdiction. Evidence will subsequently show that the claims they make are much higher than in fact they could hope to sustain and that the cases should more appropriately have been brought to the circuit court.  The purpose of the section is to ensure that, under these circumstances, a High Court judge on his own motion will have power to remit the action to the appropriate court (1) as to jurisdiction and (2) as to the place of residence of the defendant.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if an action is brought in the High Court for the recovery of payments due under a hire-purchase transaction of sums exceeding £1,000 and if it appears in the High Court, in the course of the hearing, that the payments involved do not in fact exceed £1,000 the judge may remit the action immediately to the appropriate circuit court or, if the amounts involved are low enough, to the appropriate district court.  I understand that some time ago an action was taken on the question of the power of remittal of a High Court judge of an action of his own motion. That action was appealed to the Supreme Court but the decision on appeal had no relation to this particular point and it was not in fact ever decided.  This section is intended to ensure that under the circumstances I have already outlined a High Court judge would have power <Col N="282" /> to remit such an action of his own motion.</P>

      <P>There is an amendment by Deputy McGilligan to amendment No. 36.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Shall I take them all together?  They are all much the same.  I had previously put down amendments but they have had to be changed because of the new subsection proposed by the Minister.  I have amendments Nos. 37 and 38 and then an amendment to amendment No. 36. I shall take them all together.  They are all on the same point.  I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>1.  To delete all words after &ldquo;High Court&rdquo; where it thirdly occurs.</P>
      <P>I wanted to omit this remission of actions of the High Court by its own motion.  First of all, if the High Court were to remit and it would involve extra cost, the defendant would have to go security for such costs.  That would be recognition of the fact that it was going to cost more.  Therefore the defendant would not have to pay costs unless he lost the action but he will have to pay the extra costs incurred by the hire-purchase company in case the action went against the hirer.  I want to put that in to prevent attempts to get cases remitted where there is no defence at all and no substance in the allegation.</P>
      <P>The other point was to take out the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; in subsection (2), line 16. I want to reinstate what is in the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, where part of the power remitted is confined in this way. The person may object to the remission or transfer but he has to satisfy the court that he has something in the way of a good defence.  Apart from a good defence, he must disclose facts which, in the opinion of the court, are sufficient to entitle him to defend the action.  He must have a good defence or show some set of facts upon which the High Court can say that is a good reason why that action should be defended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am personally against this power of remission on the part of the High Court.  That is why I move this amendment to the Minister's new section.  By <Col N="283" /> cutting out all that follows after the words &ldquo;High Court&rdquo;, you would restore the original situation.  That would mean that the High Court could not move on its own motion.  At least, there would have to be an application made.  Therefore, the High Court could not move on its own.  I would still prefer that to be the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I found it difficult to hear what the Deputy said.  As far as security for costs is concerned, I am inclined to quarrel on that point.  The Deputy seemed to suggest that the party to the action whom the remission assisted should be required to give security for costs.  I think in the case where a judge has power of remittal on his own motion, it would be unfair to require any party to give security for costs when the judge would be doing nothing other than carrying out powers which have been given to him by legislation.  In any case, security for costs is sought only in circumstances where it is feared that the party to an action who is seeking certain relief may not have the means of paying the costs, if the action goes against him.</P>
      <P>The usual case is where a party who is not resident in the country brings an action against a person domiciled here in an Irish court.  The person domiciled here is, in these circumstances, empowered to go to the court and ask the court, before he submits his defence, to make an order requiring the person who lives in a foreign country to deposit a certain sum by way of security for costs, in the event of the case being decided against the foreigner.</P>
      <P>The intention, too, is, I think, to discourage what I might describe as &ldquo;chancy&rdquo; actions by asking for certain security.  I do not think it would be fair&mdash;in this case, the defendant will now have a statutory right, in the event of this legislation passing, to have the appropriate action tried in his local court&mdash;to require him to give security for costs when a judge ensures that the statutory right is being observed.  I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister speaks of the hardship imposed on a person exercising a statutory right. We are only giving him that.  We should give it to him on conditions.

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>Before section 26, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in rules of court, in an action in the High Court or the Circuit Court commenced after the commencement of this Act by the owner of goods let under a hire-purchase agreement claiming, whether solely or together with any other claim, the enforcement of a right to recover possession of the goods from the hirer, judgment may be obtained only from a Judge or, where appropriate, from the Master of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to procure something to which I referred a little while ago.  Under the Bill as it stands, it would be necessary in certain cases to go before the court for judgment even in cases where the defendant defaulted in appearance or defence; in other words, in cases where the defendant has not exercised his right to defend the action at all. As the Bill stood, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to go before the judge even where he claimed only a <Col N="285" /> specific sum for arrears of repayments arising out of a hire-purchase transaction.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is accepted, then in so far as payment of arrears and actions brought for such payments without the specific return of the goods are concerned, where there is a default in appearance or defence, the plaintiff can go to the appropriate office in the High Court or circuit court to have judgment marked by default in the office.  He will, of course, in the case of the specific return of goods, be obliged to go before the court for the appropriate order.  It is restoring the <i>status quo</i> as far as arrears of payment are concerned and I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section &ldquo;and that the hirer has discharged his obligations to the owner under the hire-purchase agreement&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum dealing with Section 27 says that where a dealer sells goods which are let to him under hire-purchase agreement, the sale shall be as valid as if he were expressly authorised by the owner, that is, the hire-purchase finance company, to make the sale in good faith.  This is supposed to meet what is called the &ldquo;stocking&rdquo; agreement. I think that this provision should also be in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were put in, the section might be deleted altogether, <Col N="286" /> because the purpose of the section is to protect the hirer of goods who, <i>bona fide</i>, comes to a person holding himself out as being the hirer of a certain type of goods.  As is generally known, people stock goods under what are called &ldquo;stocking&rdquo; arrangements, goods in respect of which they already have, themselves, a hire-purchase agreement in being with a hire-purchase company.  Nevertheless, it is often not possible&mdash;in fact, in general, it is not possible&mdash;for a customer going into such a premises to buy goods on hire-purchase to know whether or not such goods are already the subject of a hire-purchase agreement between the owner of the premises and a hire-purchase company.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, the customer buys goods under a hire-purchase agreement from the shopkeeper or the garage owner, as the case may be.  He pays his full obligations under the hire-purchase agreement and if at a later stage the garage owner or the shopkeeper defaults in his payments to the hire-purchase company, the hire-purchase company can have recourse to this <i>bona fide</i> customer not only for the default in repayments but for the specific return of the goods for which the <i>bona fide</i> customer has already paid in full.</P>
      <P>The section is designed to achieve the purpose whereby if such a <i>bona fide</i> customer believes that the person from whom he buys the car or the radio is in fact the owner, and if he discharges his obligatons to that person, then the hire-purchase company who have certain claims on the shopkeeper or the garage owner will not be able to follow the customer for the return of the goods for which that customer has already paid.  I think it is only fair that such a person should be protected and that the hire-purchase people themselves should follow the shopkeeper with whom they did business and should not be permitted to have recourse to this unfortunate person who has paid in full his obligations to the shopkeeper or the garage owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair that the <i>bona fide</i> customer should be protected in that way and that he should not, having <Col N="287" /> paid in full for the goods, be liable for the return of the goods to the hire-purchase company, if the person with whom they have already done business defaults.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>For many years past numerous and widespread complaints have been made to the Department of Agriculture about the damage done to livestock by marauding dogs, and successive Ministers for Agriculture have been pressed to introduce additional legislation. Among the remedies suggested have been an increased tax on all dogs, a tax on female dogs many times greater than that on male dogs, a provision that all dogs should have to wear a collar with the owner's name and address inscribed on it, the setting up of a State-sponsored insurance fund whereby stock owners could be compensated for loss and damage caused by marauding dogs and an extension of the Malicious Injuries Act enabling stock owners to claim from the local authorities for loss or damage caused by dogs.  These remedies have for one reason or another been considered to be impracticable.</P>
      <P>The chief existing statute in regard to the protection of livestock from dogs is the Dogs Act, 1906.  Under this Act the owner of a dog is liable in damages for injury done to cattle but there is the difficulty here that the owner of the dog must be identified before an action for damages can be brought and, even if he is identified, he may not have the means to pay damages.  It is well known that much of the damage done to livestock by dogs is the work of ownerless or stray dogs, particularly on the outskirts of towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dogs Act, 1906, also provides that where a dog is proved to have injured cattle or chased sheep it can be dealt with as a dangerous dog under <Col N="289" /> the Dogs Act, 1871, i.e., an Order can be made by the District Court directing the owner to have the dog kept under proper control or destroyed. Again, this provision is not of much use for dealing with a stray or ownerless dog which is attacking stock.</P>
    <P>The Dogs Act, 1906, also contains two other not very effective remedies against damage to livestock by dogs. The Orders made under the Act enabled local authorities to make regulations requiring that a dog while in public places must wear a collar with the owner's name and address. Similar Orders empowered local authorities to make regulations to prevent dogs being allowed out between sunset and sunrise, unless they are under control.  No regulations were made as regards collars and the reluctance of local authorities to make such regulations is understandable. Most local authorities have made Orders as regards the straying of dogs between sunset and sunrise but there are obvious difficulties in enforcing these regulations in regard to the type of dog which usually causes damage to livestock.</P>
    <P>The present Bill seeks to remedy the deficiencies in the existing law.  Firstly, it makes it an offence punishable by a fine of £20 for a first offence and a fine of £50 for a second offence in respect of the same dog for the owner or person in charge of a dog if the dog worries livestock.  The section provides that it shall be a good defence to prove that reasonable care was taken to prevent the worrying of the livestock.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Bill enables dogs found worrying livestock on agricultural land to be seized, detained and subsequently destroyed if not claimed.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is what I regard as the most effective section of the Bill and that is the provision that it will be a good defence in an action for damages for the shooting of a dog if it is proved that the dog was shot when worrying livestock lawfully on the land.  The section contains a number of safeguards so as to prevent dogs being shot recklessly or spitefully.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not interfere with the <Col N="290" /> stock owners existing right to sue the dog owner for damages for the loss caused by the marauding dog.  In the past, however, stock owners were prevented from shooting a marauding dog by the fear that if they claimed for damages they would be met by a counter claim for damages for the loss of the dog.</P>
    <P>In framing this legislation the aim has been to afford the maximum protection to the stock owner and at the same time to be fair to the dog owner who looks after his dog.  The proposals have been discussed with representatives of the farming associations and they have been very favourably received, I have no doubt that they will be welcomed generally throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and on behalf of this Party I want to express our general approval of its provisions.  The Minister has rightly indicated that for many years past numerous complaints have been reaching his Department, the Garda and owners of dogs with regard to the most unsatisfactory state of affairs at present prevailing.  Worrying of livestock, particularly sheep and young horses, by dogs is something which has been responsible for grave financial loss especially where there is intensive sheep rearing.  This Bill, therefore, comes as a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>This matter has received much thought from various county committees of agriculture and farming organisations for many years.  It is correct to say that many proposals and suggestions have been made by angry livestock-owners who have had just grounds for serious complaint in this regard.  As we have heard from the Minister, it has been suggested that it might be a wise step to have a substantial increase in dog licence fees; I do not believe that would in any way ease the situation.  I think the Minister is quite right in rejecting that proposal and I am glad no such suggestion enters into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The damage to livestock has been caused mainly by dogs not kept under proper supervision.  It is very difficult to point out the owner of the dog <Col N="291" /> responsible for the damage because usually when owners hear that their dogs have caused the death of livestock they immediately deny ownership. It has been very difficult for farmers to prove anything in that respect.  I hope that this Bill will at least focus public attention on the seriousness of the situation which causes grave financial loss to farmers and that it will particularly focus the attention of all dog-owners on the necessity to maintain proper supervision of their dogs, particularly in areas where livestock is grazing and in sheep-rearing districts.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Bill and the publicity I trust it will receive, I hope dog-owners will realise the position, of livestock owners.  A farmer who has livestock grazing on his lands is entitled to graze that livestock without interference from dogs or other animals.  I am glad, therefore, that this Bill takes a serious view of the culpability of owners whose dogs can be identified and that on the first offence the owners are liable to a £20 fine and liable to a £50 fine for a second offence.  In view of the seriousness of the matter for livestock owners I wonder are those fines sufficiently severe?  We have had many cases in which valuable horses owned by farmers have been chased by dogs not under proper supervision with the result that the farmers lost valuable animals.  I am sure the Minister has details of many such cases.  I recall one case where a valuable horse was chased by dogs into barbed wire and received serious injuries.  That animal had to be destroyed afterwards and the dogs concerned were not identified.</P>
    <P>I am glad steps have been taken to fix the fines.  The primary concern of the Bill is to protect livestock but at the same time it is a very fair and reasonable Bill because it also provides against dogs being recklessly destroyed through spite or otherwise.  Under the Bill, a dog which might be trespassing on a farmer's land may not be shot unless it is actually seen engaged in chasing or worrying livestock.  I do not believe there are many farmers in the country who would go out to shoot <Col N="292" /> another person's dog.  There are no greater lovers of dogs than the farmers. There is an old saying that a man's best friend is his dog, and there is no more faithful friend than a dog.  Farmers appreciate the value of their dogs and they are slow to take any serious action against a dog.  They are particularly slow to take the drastic step of shooting a neighbour's dog without very just cause.  As a rule, people know the dogs in their locality and know the owners of them.  Dogs are wanderers.  They roam from farm to farm.  It is not unusual for a dog to pay frequent visits to a neighbour's holding.  If a farmer sees a dog worrying his animals, his first reaction is to make a complaint to the owner and issue a warning.</P>
    <P>Last year, or the year before, as I am sure the Minister is aware, there were some very typical examples of the manner in which dogs can be responsible for serious damage to livestock. I think the events I have in mind occurred in County Wicklow. Dogs should, of course, be kept under proper supervision and control.  I do not see how local authorities or the Garda can do very much more than they are doing at present.  It would be an unreasonable provision that every local authority should pass a by-law compelling owners to inscribe their names on the collars of dogs.  The local authority can in fact insist on that being done, but I do not think it should be necessary to implement such a provision because, so soon as this Bill becomes law, I take it that the worrying of livestock will considerably decrease.</P>
    <P>The Garda have many duties to perform. One of their duties is to ensure that dogs are licensed.  Indeed, I must pay tribute here to the Garda for the very efficient manner in which they discharge their duties, so far as wandering animals and unlicensed dogs are concerned.  They have always responded instantly to complaints about dogs not being under proper supervision and damaging livestock.  I am sure they will continue to do their duty in that regard in the future. Abandoned dogs are taken up by the Garda and are put away.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> Farmers have many problems, and the farmers deserve primary consideration in a matter of this kind.  I hope we shall see an end to the worrying of livestock by dogs in the not too distant future as a result of the passing of this Bill.  We wholeheartedly support this measure.  It is a cardinal principle that one should respect property; I suppose the most important property in that regard is one's neightbour's.  I do not think the number of stray dogs is as great today as it was ten years ago.</P>
    <P>I hope that, as a result of the passing of this Bill, dogs will in future be kept under proper supervision. The farmer is entitled to all the protection we can give him.  This Bill is designed to give him a measure of protection in a certain direction.  It gives notice to owners of dogs that they must ensure that their animals will not worry livestock.  The Bill asks them to do no more than take care of their dogs and keep them under proper supervision.  I hope that in future there will be no more complaints of losses of livestock because of worrying by dogs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst I thoroughly approve of the Bill and with much of what Deputy O. J. Flanagan has said, I have certain qualifications.  The owner of livestock will still be tied by certain restrictions, restrictions which will prevent him doing what I believe he should do, namely, shoot every dog he finds inside his boundaries during the lambing season.  Whilst a dog may be a very faithful friend to his owner, he has no great loyalty where neighbours' property and their sheep and lambs are concerned.  For years in my constituency we have been faced with the problem of the worrying of sheep and lambs.  Very often, when the farmer goes out to investigate, he finds not one dog but two or three dogs.  The marauder calls two or three of his kind to follow him.  They go into a farmer's holding and they proceed to worry the sheep.  The farmer may frighten them away but he never is able to trace their owners.  That is the important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> I welcome this Bill, but I do not think it is severe enough.  I believe that when a farmer goes out at night and finds dogs worrying his sheep, he should be entitled to shoot them.  If I found a dog inside my lands during the lambing season I would undoubtedly shoot him, and I think I would be within my rights in doing so.  In my own area I see dogs&mdash; whether they are licensed or not I do not know&mdash;which undoubtedly are not fed.  They go out at night, move through the country and God help the lambs and sheep they meet.  Over the years it has been proved that following them is no good.  The dog doing this kind of thing will even clean himself and will be found in his owner's rick of hay on the morning after the night of his escapades.</P>
    <P>There is a case pending in my own area at present.  It was nothing strange to see lambs owned by the man concerned being brought up the street of a certain village in Clare by the dogs.  On the 1st of January this year he put up a poison notice on his walls and he also put up a notice that any dog he would catch inside his holding would be shot.  It seems he shot two.  Now he is brought before the courts for shooting them, even though he caught one of them worrying his sheep.  He followed one of the ewes when he shot the dog.  She lay down and threw two dead lambs, and that means something to a farmer in the month of August.  It will be interesting to see what happens.  My only criticism of the Bill is that it is not strict enough.  If these people are lovers of dogs, as they say they are, surely they should keep their dogs inside at night and not let them roam the country at will.  I thoroughly agree with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke in this House in favour of the itinerant class some years ago and urged that no punitive measures should be taken against them.  I have not changed my mind on that, but I think that an amount of damage is done to livestock by bands of dogs taken around by these itinerants.  It is a rather difficult matter because it puts extra strain on <Col N="295" /> the Guards.  I would urge that any measures that could be taken to combat this difficulty would be kept in mind by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Another general matter concerns the law of the scienter of the dog's disposition. That may not be strictly relevant to this measure.  Perhaps we shall not be talking about dogs again for some time.  I believe the doctrine of the scienter of the dog's disposition should be changed.  I believe it is a privilege that the dog is not entitled to enjoy.  If he does damage, it should not be necessary to prove his disposition by proving that he had already done damage on another occasion.  I would ask the Minister to look into that and, possibly, he might find a way of bringing it into this measure at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy with the stock owners more particularly because, unlike other people who sustain trading losses, they have no form of compensation.  The owners of property normally have insurance policies against disaster of one kind or another. It is not possible for farmers to have an insurance policy.  I note that the suggestion to have an extension of Malicious Injuries Act to enable stockowners to claim against local authorities for losses has been turned down, and very rightly so because it would be quite impracticable in operation. The fact is, then, that the damage done usually has to be borne completely by the farmer himself. Up to now the great difficulty of tracing the owner of a marauding dog has meant that many owners of stock, even though they have had a very shrewd idea of the ownership of the dog involved, have never been able to prove it sufficiently in court to sustain a claim.  There is nothing that the law can do in that respect.  Nothing that we can do here will change that.  We cannot have a detective force to deal with the number of stray dogs in the country.  All we can do is to proceed as far as this measure is going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister, first, to consider if any measure should be <Col N="296" /> taken with regard to the number of dogs taken around by itinerants and, secondly, whether or not the time has come to review the old doctrine of the scienter of the disposition of a dog.</P>

      <P>As a city Deputy I support this Bill to provide protection for the owners of stock.  In the course of his remarks the Minister mentioned the possibility of increasing the licence fees for all dogs and also the question of having the names and addresses of the owners.  It is true that in the city areas livestock are not affected by dogs but I would ask the Minister to consider the question of the damage done from time to time to children by dogs.</P>

      <P>I want to make this point in general terms.  The particular type of dog involved is one reared mainly by members of the farming community, the greyhound.  If we could ensure that they would not be allowed in public parks unless on a leash, it would save children, in the urban areas from suffering and hardship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a very exciting measure but it provides machinery for dealing with what is, as has been said, a very aggravating problem and a very costly one as far as stockowners are concerned.  I have some sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy Murphy that the provisions of the measure are not as sufficiently sweeping as many people would like. There is one provision in Section 4 about which I have myself some doubts but I suppose we can leave it over to a later stage.  In fact, I would ask for the other Stages now if it were not that I should like to have some time to consider this provision and also to hear the views of Deputies upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 is designed to protect the owner of livestock, whether it be cattle or sheep, which are being worried, and it gives him the right to protection in the event of his shooting the dogs responsible.  It sets out what <Col N="297" /> is a good defence to any claim for damages because of his having shot a dog.  In paragraph (d) of Section 4 there is the provision that it may be pleaded as a defence that the owner of the dog, when it was shot, was not known to the defendant or that the owner had at any time previously been warned, by or on behalf of the defendant, that his dog had been found worrying stock.  Personally I would prefer to leave that out.  While I admit that people who own dogs have rights as well as livestock owners, and that we should do all we can to ensure that dogs will not be needlessly destroyed, at the same time my prejudices are strongly in favour of the stockowners. While protecting the interests of dog owners to some extent, I want to prevent rascality and blackguardism and to see that when a farmer or stock-owner uses his gun to get some satisfaction and to ensure that a dog will not do further destruction, he will have a good defence.</P>
    <P>I am glad that, as one would expect, Deputies who understand this problem throughout the country are in general agreement with what is attempted here.  As I said in my opening statement, we have discussed this matter with many interested organisations, including county committees of agriculture and all sorts of bodies who have been agitating for an amendment of the law.  I hope and I think that this Bill, when enacted, will give the maximum freedom, to people whose property might be affected, to deal with the dogs responsible.</P>

      <P>It would not be possible to give information in the form sought by the Deputy on a segregation species by species and in age groups as a high proportion of State plantations is laid down as intimate mixtures of two or more species and as age categories tend to get mixed in the course of time through the replacement of failures, restocking of windblow, etc.</P>
      <P>The Census of Woodlands which is currently in progress will yield information as to the current stocking of plantations and will describe stands in relation to area, whether mixed or pure, principal species etc.  It is proposed to publish a digest of information when the Census has been completed.</P>
