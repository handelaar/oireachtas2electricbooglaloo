      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing both amendments Nos. 9 and 10.  The provision of the Bill is that houses which are over £30 valuation in Dublin City and £25 elsewhere should become decontrolled provided, after the passing of the Bill, they come into the possession of the landlord.  We feel that the limits which are laid down in the Bill are reasonable limits and that an upward ceiling of £30 covers the vast majority of houses which are controlled. We feel that there is no necessity at all for either of these two amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will realise that a house of £30 valuation today would be paying, depending on what part of the country it was in, in the region of £60 per annum rates.  Houses of this sort are not generally let and if they are let the number of them that would <Col N="477" /> come into the possession of the landlord would be very small indeed.  In fact, the amount of decontrol which will be brought about as a result of the paragraph as in the Bill will be very, very negligible.  I think it is an amount of decontrol that we can confidently incur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any particular reason for specifying £30 in respect of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire and £25 in other cases?  Was it drawn out of the air?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Once you go over £30 in valuation you are getting into a class of house which, generally speaking, if it is let at all, is rented by a person who is much better off. It is only people who rent houses of under £30 valuation that we are really concerned with in rent restrictions.</P>

      <P>To insert the following subsection before subsection (3):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The application of this Act to a dwelling forming part of a house (other than a house erected after, or in course of being erected on, the 7th day of May, 1941, or a house the letting of which is under the Labourers Acts, 1883 to 1958, or the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 1890 to 1958) shall not be excluded by reason only of the fact that this Act does not apply to the house.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will recall that on the Second Stage Deputy Costello expressed some doubts as to whether <Col N="478" /> the section as drafted was sufficient to ensure our intention that where a house became decontrolled and a room or flat in it was subsequently let that the room or flat should become controlled again.  I was told that the Bill, as drafted, ensured our intention. However, once the doubt was raised it is desirable to put the matter beyond any question so we are introducing this amendment to make assurance double sure.  The purpose of it is to secure that in any case where a house became decontrolled and where a room or flat was subsequently let control will again apply to the room or flat.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14 standing in the name of Deputy Russell:</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any tenant of a controlled dwelling shall be entitled at his option to a lease for a minimum period of twenty-one years at an open market rent where he or his family have been in occupation of the dwelling for thirty years or more.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing amendment No. 14.  In the first place the House should be aware that, under the Landlord and Tenant Act, it is already provided that on the termination of a tenancy a tenant is entitled to a new lease of 21 years at the open market rent where he or his <Col N="479" /> predecessors have occupied the house for 30 years.  The amendment involves a change in the existing law in so far as the landlord would be compelled to grant the lease irrespective of whether the tenancy had been terminated or not.  Such a proposal would not be a proper one for a Rent Restrictions Bill; it would be more appropriate to a Landlord and Tenant Bill.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposal itself, the House will realise that rents at present are well below market values as a general rule and any landlord would be most anxious to give a tenant a long lease if he would get the open market rent.  I do not think the proposal in the amendment is realistic at all.  It is open to any tenant to approach his landlord for a long lease at a fair rent and certainly in 99 cases out of 100, if not in every case, a landlord would be more than anxious to do business with him.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment, which I foreshadowed on the Second Reading, is to advance the date by reference to which basic rents are automatically determined from the 1st February, 1960, to the date on which the Bill will come into operation, the 31st December, 1960.  The amendment is desirable for two reasons.  Firstly, it will remove any difficulty in determining what the basic rent is when the Bill comes into force and, secondly, there is now no need to make provision for the basic rents which have been determined under the present law by the courts since the 1st February last.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to meet the point made by Deputy O'Higgins on the Second Reading.  As the Bill stands, it could be argued that this section applies to dwellings let for the first time after the Bill becomes law. This, of course, is not the intention. The basic rent of any such dwellings will fall to be determined under the provisions of Section 9.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The basic rent of a controlled dwelling to which this section applies shall be&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> (a)  in the case of a dwelling specified in the Schedule attached to the Agreement entered into on the 6th day of October, 1960, between the Dublin Artisans' Dwellings Company Limited and the Dublin Artisans' Dwellings Tenants Association&mdash; the rent specified in the third column of that Schedule in respect of the dwelling, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in any other case&mdash;the net rent at which it was held on the relevant date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment provides that the rents agreed upon between the Dublin Artisans' Dwelling Company and the association of their tenants following negotiations, under the chairmanship of Deputy Briscoe, shall be basic rents for the purposes of this Bill.  The Dublin Artisans' Dwelling Company is, I think, the largest single landlord in the country apart from local authorities. It owns 3,500 dwellings, almost all of them having been built before 1914.  In recent years about half of the dwellings were put into repair. Substantial increases of rents resulted from these exceptional repairs as the Company did not avail themselves of repair and reconstruction grants when they became available.  Protracted litigation between the Company and the tenants followed and by the 1st June last literally hundreds of cases were pending in the Circuit Court and District Court and under the special procedure provided by Part III of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I asked the Company and the Association representing the tenants whether they would be willing to meet, under an independent chairman, with a view to seeing whether the matters in dispute between the Company and the tenants might be settled.  The Company and the Association having agreed to this proposal I asked Deputy Briscoe whether he would act as Chairman at meetings between the Company and the Association. I am very glad to say he accepted because I have no doubt that it was largely due to his efforts <Col N="482" /> that agreement between the two sides became possible.</P>
    <P>The agreement set out the agreed weekly rents for each of the controlled dwellings owned by the Company.  In particular, those specified in column 3 of the Schedule were described as the agreed weekly basic rents having taken into account additions for improvements and certain agreed reductions but being exclusive of rates.  The agreement also specified the agreed gross rents inclusive of rates and provided that these rents would be payable by the tenants commencing on 5th November, 1960.</P>
    <P>It was provided that the agreement was subject to statutory effect being given to the agreed basic rents and provision being made that they would not be subject to review.  All pending legal proceedings between the Association and the Company are being stayed pending the passing of this Bill and will be withdrawn when it becomes law.  After withdrawal of legal proceedings each side will be responsible for its own costs and the Company will waive all claims against the tenants for legal costs to date.  As regards arrears, it has been agreed that any arrears will be paid and accepted at the rate of 5/- weekly or, in case of hardship, by such lesser instalments as the Company may agree.</P>
    <P>On the matter which caused the greatest dissatisfaction among tenants, that is, the fact that the Company had not taken advantage of repair grants, the Company agreed to give favourable consideration, in consultation with the tenants, to taking advantage of any grants which might be available in the future towards the cost of carrying out exceptional repairs.  Finally it was agreed that the Company would establish, after consultation with the tenants, a benevolent fund for the purpose of dealing with isolated cases of hardship among tenants.  Both the tenants and the Company will contribute funds for this purpose.</P>
    <P>It is a very great pleasure for me to move that the basic rents agreed upon between the Company and the tenants be given statutory effect and that they <Col N="483" /> should not be subject to review.  I should like, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, to thank Deputy Briscoe for his help in making the agreement possible and also to thank the representatives of the Company and of the Association for their reasonable approach to the matters in issue.  I hope that the good relations which have been re-established will long continue.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should add that this is not the first time that specific provision is being made in a Rent Act for the Company's tenants.  Provision was made in the 1946 Act for deeming the standard rents set out in an arbitration award of 1922 to have the same effect as standard rents determined by the Courts.  Owing to a technical defect, the provision did not achieve its object with the consequence that there was no longer any certainty attaching to any of the Company's rents.  I am hoping that the provisions now proposed to be inserted in the Bill will not have the same fate and it is with a view to preventing such a result that the amendment refers specifically to the particular agreement and not, as in the 1946 Act, by way of a general provision.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 20, 22 and 24, as indicated by An Ceann Comhairle, give effect to the provisions of the agreement that the agreed basic rents are not to be subject to review under Section 8.</P>

      <P>I am not interested in that.  This is the first occasion on which I have seen a provision like this where the agreement in question is not scheduled in the Bill itself.  We are asked to pass a section referring to a document that the House has not seen. That is a bad precedent.  It is an excellent principle that where two people come together and agree the <Col N="484" /> House should adopt that agreement. It is a very bad principle that the House should be asked to adopt an agreement without having had the opportunity of seeing it.  The size of the agreement that the Parliamentary Secretary is holding up depends entirely on the size of the type and the amount that is typed on each page.  It could well be that it is a page per house, so to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be identifiable in some way by the Legislature. One way would be to add a special subsection stating that the Minister shall embody it in an order.  Another way would be a similar type of regulation. There must be some way by which the Legislature, as apart from the individual Parties, can have access to this document at any time.  Otherwise it is improper to include a section to this effect.</P>
      <P>I welcome the principle that, if a large body on both sides get together, we should endorse it and adopt it. However, we should know, in some shape or other, what exactly we are adopting.  Tabling would be adequate, from the point of view of the discussion here, but tabling is not certainty for the legislation for the future.  We must not have a position, even for the purpose of a Court, that a successor of a tenant who was not a member of the association that negotiated this agreement cannot prove the agreement as a matter of statute law rather than as a matter of evidence of the document itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a variety of ways in which it can be done, if it is not desirable, because of bulk, to incorporate the document in the Bill.  I strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to adopt one of those ways.  He is aware that in all the normal cases the agreement is scheduled.  We had one the other day in relation to the new subsidiary of the World Bank.  The very long Memorandum and Articles of Association of the new international association were incorporated in a Schedule of the Act.  The Act took half a page but the Schedule took something like <Col N="485" /> 20 pages.  That is the right way to do it.  I do not mind whether this is done in that way but it must be done in some legislative manner&mdash;regulation, power for the Minister to order, or something like that.  But it must be available to the Legislature as a legislative document once it is incorporated in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the provisions of subsection (1) because they are far too indeterminate to be satisfactory.  It should be a basic principle of legislation that in so far as it is possible to be precise one should be precise.  I cannot see any prospect of subsection (1) of Section 8 being utilised except on the basis of building up a whole new set of case law as to what are special circumstances. That section as it is drafted is going to mean more litigation and far greater uncertainty as to what exactly is involved and I feel that if we enact it as it is at present we will do something which is going to be unsatisfactory, with our eyes open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that certain aspects of this situation have been considered by people who would be interested and they would far prefer to give way very substantially in paragraph 1, <Col N="488" /> clause (a) of subsection (1) in order to avoid the uncertainty and litigation that paragraph 2 would involve.  The suggestion was put to me that a variation in basic rent of one-eighth was perhaps so small that it might mean too much litigation if paragraph 2 was dropped.  They suggested it would make for greater certainty, less litigation and less expense on all concerned, landlord and tenant, if the amount by which the rent must be short of the basic rent was increased from one-eighth to one-quarter and paragraph 2 dropped altogether.</P>
    <P>In many of these smallish rents a difference of one-eighth from the basic rent would be very small and it would be undesirable to have litigation covering an amount as small as that. If it was increased to one-quarter and the special circumstances dropped, then the mere fact that the basic rent was one-quarter and the one-quarter could not vary must be to create the presumption that there was a special circumstance and you would not have the necessity to have the special circumstances in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With the Bill as now drafted I cannot see any vista in front of us who have to advise clients except to say that we cannot possibly tell what view the court is going to take about special circumstances.  It is not defined in the Bill and we can only wait to see what court decisions there are and until such time as the case law is built up we will be completely in the air.  It is going to mean expenses for both sides and, if I may put it facetiously, a type of expense which is going to be very unremunerative for the legal practitioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to Deputy Sweetman's in relation to this section.  This is a matter which I raised on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I must say I had hoped that the Parliamentary Secretary would appreciate the strength of the argument which, in all modesty, I feel I put up on that occasion and that he would have brought in an amendment to cover the position. Section 8, subsection (1) (i) corresponds roughly to Section 15, subsection <Col N="489" /> (3) of the 1946 Act, but the addition of the clause requiring a landlord to prove special circumstances is an entirely new one as between the present Bill and the 1946 Act.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Sweetman I feel that in the absence of some clear definition by the House&mdash;and I appreciate the difficulties in giving that&mdash;of what are to be regarded as special circumstances, this question can be settled only by building up a mass of case law to establish, having regard to various applications coming before the court, what are special circumstances. There must be a great number of these applications to cover the various contingencies that may arise.  The fact that a court decides on an application before it that special circumstances exist in that case is not going to be a guide if there is a slight variation in another application under this section. Like Deputy Sweetman, I can foresee a position in which a great number of decisions from the court will be required before landlords or their legal advisers get any kind of adequate guidance as to what will be regarded as special circumstances under this section.</P>
      <P>I expressed the view on Second Reading that I do not think this provision is fair.  If the landlord is entitled to a basic rent of a given amount and if the basic rent falls short of that, I think, in fairness to the landlord, he should have exactly the same right as the tenant to go to the court and ask it to remedy the position.  That right is given to the tenant in this Bill and was given to him in the previous Act. It was given to the landlord in that Act also but without this restrictive and limiting provision we now find in the new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman has put up an alternative suggestion which was put to him.  I feel that those who put up that suggestion are making a sacrifice which, to my mind, is unnecessary because I do not think they should be asked to make that sacrifice; but in support of that point of view I should like to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that in subsection (3), Section 15, of the <Col N="490" /> 1946 Act, the rate was set out at one-fifth by which the basic rent might fall short of or exceed the correct basic rent.  It seems to me that the Parliamentary Secretary would be following precedent and playing fair with both sides if he simply incorporated that provision in this Bill; in other words, adhere to the proportion of a fifth, which appears in the 1946 Act, leave it at that and not complicate the position by bringing in this requirement of special circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the landlord who would be prejudiced by the Bill as it now stands is the landlord who is a kindly, lenient type of landlord &mdash;the type of landlord who did not bother increasing his rents when he would have been entitled to lawful additions for rates and repairs.  He did not avail of them not because there were no special circumstances that might stand up in court but simply because that was his make-up. He was the type of man who was not going to be bothered troubling the tenant with minor increases which, however, over the years might accumulate to a fairly reasonable increase. That is the type of landlord who will be penalised and prejudiced by this section because he will not be able to prove special circumstances when he goes into court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I raise another point on this section?  There is some very considerable doubt in certain legal circles as to how the joint operation of Sections 7, 8 and 9 will arise in one type of case.  It arises because of the manner in which line 24 in particular, and indeed the whole of Section 8 in that page, brings in Section 9 in a case of determination of the basic rent.  You have a terrace of six houses, all let at the same rent.  One of them suffers very considerable damage in a storm.  We will say the basic rent of the whole six before the storm was £30 and one of them suffers very considerable damage.  The roof can be lifted and blown off.  It costs £100 for a new roof.  The landlord under the old Act has got the basic rent increased by the appropriate proportion of the expenditure. It has been suggested by <Col N="491" /> some people more competent to construe Rent Acts than I am that the effect of Section 2 and Section 9 as applied by Section 8 is that the court must fix the basic rent of the house that has suffered the storm damage at exactly the same figure as the other five and that the landlord can make no addition for the additional expenditure he had already incurred.</P>
      <P>I do not think that is intended but, as I say, counsel&mdash;I was almost going to say allegedly learned counsel but of course this counsel and all counsel are learned in the law&mdash;have given it, I am advised, as a formal opinion that the effect of the way in which the Bill has been drafted prohibits the court taking those circumstances into account.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary intend that?  I should be glad if he would have that matter examined by his legal advisers between now and the Report Stage.  I think he will agree, if he does that, that it is wrong and should not be so intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I shall deal with the question of special circumstances.  The whole motive of the Bill is to procure certainty.  We want to establish basic rents which will be known to everybody.  Section 7 provides that the rent which will be payable on 31st December, 1960, will be the basic rent.  Section 8 will apply to and come into operation in only a very limited number of cases. Its provisions should be transitory because, if a landlord does not avail of the provisions of Section 8 fairly quickly, he can be accused of having slept on his rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to get certainty into the conception of basic rents.  It is for that reason we have inserted special circumstances in the provisions of Section 8.  We want to ensure that only in a very limited number of cases will it be possible to apply to the court.  In the case of rents which were exceptionally low and about which the landlord has done nothing over the years, I do not think we can be asked to upset our principle of certainty for that type of landlord.  If he is the type of landlord about whom <Col N="492" /> Deputy O'Higgins spoke&mdash;the kindly landlord who has made a special letting&mdash;we are providing for him.  It is open to him to show that the rent was fixed at a very low level because of some special circumstances.  It is open to him to go to the court and have that rent brought up to what the court thinks is a proper basic rent. In any other case, if there were no special circumstances, even if the rent is exceptionally low, I am not prepared to prejudice the principle of certainty for a landlord of that sort. We must assume that landlords look after their rights and get what they are entitled to.  If they do not, and there are no special circumstances, I do not think we should be asked to worry about them.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that we increase the 12½ per cent. to 25 per cent. and drop special circumstances would not meet the case at all.  With regard to the suggestion that there would be difficulty in establishing what special circumstances are, I do not think there would be all that difficulty.  It will be a simple question of fact.  Was the rent fixed at this level because of some special circumstances affecting the case?  Surely, that is a simple thing for the court to decide?</P>
    <P>I imagine a typical case would be where a landlord let a dwelling to a close relative and, because of the fact that it was a close relative, he would fix a very low rent in order to be generous to his relative.  There, the landlord would have no difficulty in proving there were special circumstances and having the court fix a proper basic rent.  We have had a great deal of representation on this point.  As some Deputies know, we have considered it all very carefully and one would like to meet the representations that have been made to us as far as one could but the fear that I have in going any distance to meet them would be that we would be leaving a very great number of rents in a degree of uncertainty and we would be upsetting the basic principle of the Bill which is to give certainty in 99 cases out of 100.</P>

      <P>I do not know <Col N="493" /> whether I quite understand the point Deputy Sweetman was making in regard to Section 8, line 24.  Surely in the case he cited, the case of specific damage, there are two things that can happen.  If the tenant applies to have the basic rent fixed under Section 9&mdash;which will rule in the case&mdash; the state of repair is a factor to be taken into consideration.  That is the first point.  The second is that, presumably, in the case which Deputy Sweetman mentioned there would be the expenditure by the landlord of an amount on repairs.  He mentioned the sum of £100.  Would that not be captured by Section 10?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a doubt? First of all, the basic rent is fixed and the lawful additions in Section 10 are over and above the basic rent.  Is that not so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the lawful additions under this Act. When I say there is doubt, the doubt is as to whether it applies to lawful additions or exceptional repairs already incurred which were lawful additions under the previous Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but presumably Section 8 does not apply unless there is a controlled dwelling with a basic rent there already.  Although this is not the place for it, one sometimes cannot avoid getting into a fine legal argument on a section.  The net question I should like to put to save the time of the House is: could Deputy Sweetman nail down the point precisely for us?  If he did that I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to cope with it but for my part I do not quite follow the argument he is making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to Section 8, I appreciate his concern to get certainty into the legislation so far as the basic rents are concerned but, with respect, I think he is going the wrong way about it.  I think he is opening up a field which will give rise to anything but certainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> I think he is creating a situation which from its inception will be quite uncertain both from the landlords' and the tenants' points of view.  The Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate the point I have been trying to make, that you want some definition of special circumstances&mdash;and I know that Deputy de Valera will appreciate the difficulty of trying to get a definition&mdash; but in default of a fairly comprehensive definition as to what special circumstances are, special circumstances can only be ruled on and dealt with in each case as it arises.  You will have the case referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary which, like himself, I assume to be accepted as special circumstances but I do not know whether it would or not.  That is a matter which the courts have to decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes but we are dealing with this.  The Parliamentary Secretary assumes as I assume, that if a landlord has let a house at a nominal rent to a member of his family or to a close relative, that will be &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo; and will be so regarded by the courts.  I assume that will be the position but I do not know any more than does the Parliamentary Secretary.  That is a simple example. You will have a great number of other cases.  You will have the landlord who buys property, controlled premises occupied by a tenant, possibly an elderly tenant.  The landlord feels that, notwithstanding the fact that he is entitled to lawful additions, he does not want to increase the rent while this elderly person is there and he thinks he will let it go until that particular tenancy terminates and he is getting in another tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You may also have the case where the landlord simply did not know his rights, did not increase the rent and did not get what he was lawfully entitled to get out of a premises because he did not think of consulting a solicitor who might advise him.  You will get the case where, possibly, a landlord forgot to increase the rent when <Col N="495" /> he was entitled to do so.  You will get a case where the tenant has made representations to the landlord that he could not afford an increase.  You will get a case where possibly there is a dispute about the rent between the landlord and the tenant.  All these cases must be dealt with individually in the courts as they arise and there will be an infinite variety of them.</P>
    <P>By insisting on this position the Parliamentary Secretary is not bringing in any certainty at all but quite the opposite.  He is creating a very vague and uncertain position.  I certainly cannot see the reason for it.  There would be far greater certainty if the Parliamentary Secretary left the position as it was under the 1946 Act, if he allowed the position to be that if there was an excess, or if the basic rent was too little, by a definite fixed amount either the tenant or the landlord could go into court and get the position remedied.  That is a simple, straight, certain situation; nobody is in any doubt about it and there is no lack of certainty.  There was no lack of certainty under that provision in the 1946 Act.  The only element of uncertainty that arises is the bringing in of this new provision of the present legislation.</P>
    <P>I would very strongly urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that that subsection should be deleted and I think it would be better all around if it were deleted.  Deputy Sweetman referred to Section 9 and I want to make a few remarks on that but I think it might be better left until we are discussing the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>When I say that I want to get certainty I think I am right in saying that I should resist any proposal to delete &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo; in pursuance of that objective because Deputy O'Higgins's argument is for every rent and every landlord being thrown into the melting pot.  If Section 8 were to apply without any regard to special circumstances, every landlord presumably would consider that the rent was more than 12½ per cent. too low and would go to the Courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not forget that the provisions of that Act were only provisions to review rents which were in operation immediately before, open market rents operating before the passing of the Act.  The review provisions in the 1946 Act did not apply to the vast majority of houses that were fixed at the 1914 level of rents.  The 1946 Act in so far as it provided for review referred only to rents payable in the open market in 1941.  That is a completely different situation from the one we are dealing with here.  This Bill, when passed, will deal with all controlled rents, most of which have been rigidly fixed for years.  Unless there are special circumstances entering into the case, I am not prepared to leave it open to landlords to go to court and say: &ldquo;These rents are 12½ per cent. too low. We want them increased.&rdquo;  That would result in a great many claims being brought whereas the whole object of Sections 7, 8 and 9 is to have the minimum of legislation, to try to fix rents in such a way that everybody will know what they are.  Only in special circumstances affecting the original fixing of the rent will we leave it open to the landlord to go to court.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has unfortunately left the House.  With regard to the point raised by him, I should like him to state exactly what type of case he has in mind.  Does he envisage the situation he spoke about happening after 31st December when basic rents will be fixed for all houses or is he referring to something which happened before basic rents will be fixed?  As he has left the House, I suggest we leave the matter over to the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>It was dealt with reasonably fully by me on the Second Reading.  We can deal with it when we come to Section 9.  I do not want to prolong the discussion.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to have made up his mind.  He may be proved right ultimately in that this will limit <Col N="497" /> the class of persons referred to and also limit litigation, but I do not think he is right.  I think he is creating a situation of uncertainty.  I shall not pursue that any further except to ask him if he thinks his approach is a fair one to the landlord concerned.</P>
      <P>The basic rent is admittedly too low and a landlord can get this rights only by proving special circumstances. It does not seem to me that that is holding the scales evenly between landlord and tenant.  The Parliamentary Secretary says these rents have been fixed.  They have been known for a number of years; they have been paid for a number of years.  If a landlord did not take the trouble to adjust them when he should have adjusted them, we will not permit him to do that now, despite the fact that under the law, as it existed, he would be entitled to more.</P>

      <P>I think we are being perfectly fair to landlords.  The whole scope of the Bill proves that.  We are doing something for them which has never been done before.  On the particular point at issue, let me reiterate that we cannot be expected to lean over backwards for landlords.  Landlords must be presumed to know their rights and must be presumed to be receiving the rents to which they are entitled.  If there are odd cases in which that is not so, I suggest that it is not our fault.  It is not we who are depriving them of their rights.  It is they themselves who are doing that. We are going as far as we can when we say that if their rents are unduly low because of some special circumstances they can go to court and have them raised.  I do not think we can be expected to go further than that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised this matter <Col N="498" /> on the Second Stage.  The effect of the section as it stood would be that when the court came to fix basic rents, they would have regard to the 1941 level of rents and not to the 1914 level. That was a recommendation of the Conroy Commission and it is one with which, I think, the House will fairly readily agree.</P>
    <P>First of all, purely on the phraseology side, it has been suggested that it is inappropriate to have this reference back to the 1946 Act.  There is weight in that argument.  Furthermore, a practical difficulty arises in different parts of the country from the point of view that there would probably be no 1941 cases to which the court could refer easily.  Difficulty, therefore, would arise in that regard and we have decided that it is better to delete the reference to the 1946 Act and leave the courts free to determine the matter on the basis of the section with these words deleted.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that Section 9 will be invoked in relatively few cases. Section 7 should take care of the majority of cases.  It is only in exceptional cases where there was no letting either on 31st December, 1960, or within three years before that, that Section 9 will come into operation. We visualise its coming into operation mainly in relation to rooms and flats let for the first time after the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The point raised by Deputy Sweetman was that one may have cases to which this section refers where the landlord will, because of exceptional circumstances, have to pay out exceptional sums in repairs in order to put a premises into a proper state of repair.  As envisaged by Deputy Sweetman, you may have a terrace of houses, or a number of houses of the same type of construction and accommodation in the same locality, and it may be necessary to expend an exceptional sum to put one of those houses into the same state of <Col N="499" /> repair as the other houses of similar type.</P>

      <P>It does not matter whether it is before or after.  I do not raise it as a debating point but as a serious problem.  The situation envisaged by Deputy Sweetman may not apply at all, but if it did apply, the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that it is something which should be remedied.  If, for instance, one of the houses suffered storm damage and the landlord had to spend a considerable amount putting it into a reasonable state of repair, the court under this section will not be entitled to take into consideration any exceptional expenditure of that sort.</P>
      <P>I raised this on Second Reading and expressed doubt as to whether the phrase &ldquo;state of repair&rdquo; was adequate. The Parliamentary Secretary, when replying to me, as reported at column 1244 of the Official Report for November 17, agreed that he did not know whether the phrase was adequate to cover the situation.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I am right in this but I should like to raise it for the purpose of examination by the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;whether or not Section 9 would apply to cases where, under previous legislation, lawful additions had been made to a basic rent and whether, under this section, such cases, where covered, could be taken into account by the courts in fixing the rent under Section 9 in respect of lawful additions made already under existing legislation or again, may the courts have regard only to the state of repair?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly have the point examined.  Deputy Sweetman, I think, is concerned with the Section 8 cases which necessitate a determination of the basic rent on the basis of Section 9, because Section 9 would deal practically exclusively with rooms and flats.  I cannot see&mdash; perhaps I am wrong&mdash;that the sort of difficulty Deputy Sweetman envisages would have any practical application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> However, in case there is I shall examine the matter carefully.  My own view about the operation of Section 9, as to whether or not lawful additions to existing rents would be taken into account, is that they would, as part of the general level of rents of comparable dwellings, that is to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection to which the amendment relates says that in case the landlord is liable for the whole or part of the repairs to the dwelling, a sum equal to 12½ per cent. of the basic rent may be added to the tenant's payments.  This subsection, which we are seeking to delete from the Bill, provides for, in our view, a gift of 12½ per cent. to the landlord. It provides for permission to the landlord to impose this increase in rent without any provision being made which would show that the expenditure on the dwelling was in fact incurred. The subsection merely states &ldquo;in case the landlord is liable for the whole or part of the repairs to the dwelling&rdquo;.  Accordingly, the landlord needs only show that he is liable for repairs; he does not have to show that <Col N="502" /> he has spent any money on the repairs.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that for many years people have been paying rents on dwellings on which landlords are supposed to be liable for repairs up to the present time and having regard to the fact that the landlords have never spent a single penny on repairs, it appears to be completely inequitable that at this stage such landlords should be entitled to impose an increase of 12½ per cent. even though they may never carry out repairs but are only liable for them.</P>
      <P>There is the case of the landlord who is responsible for part of the repairs. Under this subsection, it would be possible that a landlord would enforce an increase of 12½ per cent. on a tenant even where the expenditure was a nominal one.  The main purpose of this subsection is to permit an increase in rent.  There are other provisions in the Bill for increases in certain circumstances, but this is one which permits the landlord to increase the rent by 12½ per cent. without any qualification.  The only condition is that the dwelling comes under the control of this Bill.  In circumstances where people today are finding it difficult enough to meet their commitments generally, it appears to be most unjust for this House to give authority to the landlords, on the day this Act is passed, to go to the tenant and say: &ldquo;I am responsible for the repairs in your dwelling whether in whole or in part because I got that responsibility.  Would you please give me an increase of 12½ per cent. on the rent you are now paying?&rdquo;  We are pressing, therefore, for the deletion of subsection (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would ask that consideration should be given to the fact that this section of the Bill is seeking to hand to landlords this additional money without requiring from them the expenditure of one single penny.  We are opposed to an increase in rent on these grounds.  We are opposed to any increase in rent in cases where it cannot be shown clearly that there is justification arising from essential <Col N="503" /> expenditure which is of benefit to the tenant.</P>
    <P>There are a considerable number of cases where efforts by tenants, who have repairs carried out, to have their dwellings put in proper order over the years have failed completely because of the attitude of their landlords.  In those circumstances, the proposal to grant all landlords the right covered under the section dealing with tenants coming within the scope of the Bill, the right to seek and obtain an increase of 12½ per cent. of the basic rent, is objectionable.  We say that the section should be deleted from the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well at this stage to appreciate the full content of this subsection.  I am rather disappointed that Deputy Larkin did not expand and take into account all the factors.  He merely put it on the basis, as he called it, of a present. To be kind to Deputy Larkin, that is a very serious over-simplification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is the situation you have to face in this Bill.  You had premises which had been out of repair in the previous Rent Act and particularly the 1946 Rent Act.  You had provisions giving sanctions to tenants in regard to their landlords for the maintenance of their premises in repair but the situation had developed where it <Col N="504" /> was clearly seen that the remuneration to the landlords did not fully cover the landlord in maintaining the condition of the property and the property had very frequently deteriorated as a result.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments that would be advanced for bringing this subsection in now is that it is in the tenants' interest that there should be proper maintenance of property in repair and that the primary purpose of this subsection is not to give a present to the landlords, as Deputy Larkin says so simply.  The primary purpose of this is to ensure that property is maintained in repair and that it is maintained in a proper condition as much for the benefit of the tenant as of the landlord&mdash;in fact, more for the benefit of the tenant than the landlord.</P>
    <P>The difficulty had arisen heretofore that the rents, when repairs were taken into account, were so uneconomic that no court or nobody responsible could in equity compel the landlord to go beyond a certain stage with it, having regard to the remuneration he had for the premises.  I think that is the essential reason for introducing this amendment.</P>
    <P>I will content myself with pointing out the other side to Deputy Larkin's argument.  I am not at all suggesting it is not arguable that it is a further burden on the tenant but this point should be taken into consideration. The section is in the long term as much for the tenant's benefit as for the landlord's.  That is particularly so in regard to other sections to which Deputy Larkin did not advert.  For instance, there are sections in this Bill, largely carrying over legislation already existing, giving sanctions to the tenant if his landlord does not maintain the premises in repair.  For instance, you have Sections 40 and 15. Section 40 provides for payment to the tenant in the case of disrepair of a controlled dwelling owing to the default of the landlord and Section 15 provides for a reduction of the rent owing to the default of the landlord in keeping a controlled dwelling in repair.</P>
    <P>These sections, I admit, are largely <Col N="505" /> parallel in previous legislation but one of the reasons for the failure, perhaps, of these sections to do their work as previously envisaged was the very fact that the maintenance of premises in repair by the landlord was uneconomic, having regard to the overall economic factors of the situation.  I make these remarks primarily to bring this discussion into a proper focus here at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should also like to express the viewpoint I mentioned on Second Stage and to point out that I have met tenants who, before this Bill was introduced, had complained about the state of repair of premises and had gone so far as to say that they would be willing to pay a little more if the landlord would keep the premises in proper repair.  That is the other side. It is a side which we should keep before us in this discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Larkin's amendment and Deputy Russell's amendment, which is rather similar.  I hold that landlords should not have the right to increase the rent by 12½ per cent. unless they are obliged to keep the premises in proper repair.  I have had from time to time complaints.  I had to communicate with the sanitary department of Dublin Corporation.  Certain repairs were alleged to be carried out by landlords but the defects were only doctored up.  In other words, landlords aim to spend little or nothing on repairs.  They exaggerate the cost of repairs.  Their repair is some little bit of a job carried out by some handyman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a gentleman who asked for a quotation for the building of a wall in a yard and he was told it would cost £100.  He got it built for £15 because he used old bricks and the wall was not half as thick as it had been.  Landlords ought to be compelled to carry out proper repairs.  It is the practice of some landlords, where their tenants are paying a small rent, to penalise those tenants by making it impossible for them to carry on.  They deliberately carry out repairs to that <Col N="506" /> part of the house where the tenants are paying a high rent and they leave the part where the tenants are paying the low rents in a dilapidated condition.</P>
    <P>Landlords are very clever gentlemen. They know the tenants who are paying the good rent and they know the tenant who is not paying so much and they put the squeeze on him.  If they get this 12½ per cent. increase for every tenant, then every tenant who has a claim for repairs should have those repairs done.  Remember that most landlords have a considerable number of vacancies now due to the activity of the local authorities in building houses.  Once a person has three children, he is entitled to a local authority house so that the landlords have been able to let to new tenants at double and treble the rent.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but if the former tenant had a very low rent, the landlord will at least get an increase from the new tenant.  He profits as a result of the vacancy, apart altogether from any backhandedness that goes on in regard to key money. There is no need to shed any tears for the landlords at all.  Much of the alleged repairs they do are only in the nature of a bit of whitewashing or the putting on of half a slate.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera may possibly be right in saying that to describe this 12½ per cent. increase as a present to the landlord is over-simplification but I do not think it is a very great exaggeration.  We are dealing here with three amendments, all of which relate to Section 10, subsection 2 (b) which is the provision in <Col N="507" /> this Bill designed for the purpose of allowing the landlords a 12½ per cent. increase in the rents of all controlled premises.  It is designed for the purpose of giving the landlords that increase if they are liable for repairs in whole or in part.</P>
      <P>It does not set out in any section of the Bill that the landlord will forfeit that increase if he does not do the repairs.  It is not made clear in the Bill what &ldquo;part repairs&rdquo; amount to.  A number of us referred to this matter during the Second Reading discussion. The Minister has done nothing in relation to the points made on Second Reading and which, I believe, are perfectly valid points.</P>
      <P>I can see that a distinction can and should be drawn in respect of tenants who are sitting tenants, who are in possession now and who have had the rent fixed by agreement as between themselves and the landlord or by legislation heretofore.  We are now saying to those people that we are going to interfere with those rights and that even if the landlords do not ask for it, we are going to insist that they will get an increase of 12½ per cent. on the rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not. There are rights in existence between the tenant and the landlord.  They are there by agreement, in the first instance; in the second instance, they are there because of the legislation which exists at the moment and which controls the rent which can be charged for these premises.  A great number of these tenancies were entered into in the knowledge of these rights&mdash;that they were controlled rents and voluntary letting under conditions as they now exist.  Under this section we are saying to the tenant that he must now pay an increase of 12½ per cent. in his rent because the landlord accepts liability for repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> It is necessary to note that the landlord gets what Deputy Larkin describes as a present and which I would describe as a bonus of 12½ per cent. of an increase in the tenant's rent if he is liable for repairs, whether he has them done or not.  Deputy Russell's amendment is designed to remedy that situation.  He is also going to get the 12½ per cent. increase in the rent not only if he is liable for the entire repairs but also if he is liable for part repairs, whether he does them or not.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any clear definition in this Bill as to what &ldquo;part repairs&rdquo; are, can we not have the situation where a landlord enters into a written agreement with the tenant and imposes on himself the obligation to replace broken glass in one particular window in the dwelling?  That is part repairs and once he accepts that liability under this Bill, he is entitled to the 12½ per cent. increase.  That situation possibly does exist now where landlords are responsible for minor repairs to existing controlled dwellings.</P>
    <P>The whole section in relation to this increase is altogether too loose and too dangerous to allow it to go through this House without some protest.</P>
    <P>I believe the principle is wrong that we should interfere with the existing situation voluntarily accepted by both landlord and tenant under present legislation and that we should wade in on behalf of the landlord to increase the tenants' rents.  I appreciate the arguments by Deputy de Valera and earlier by the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the necessity to ensure that a landlord will not be treated unfairly, that he will not be put in the position of having to do repairs in face of increasing costs while at the same time being pegged down to a limited income from the property which was fixed at a time when costs were lower.  There is a lot to be said for that argument.</P>
    <P>I shall go as far as agreeing that in the case of any new tenancies, where the rights have not already been fixed and ascertained between landlord and <Col N="509" /> tenant, an increase should be allowed. That is why I feel some difficulty in fully supporting Deputy Larkin's amendment.  Deputy D. Costello's amendment meets exactly the case in point.  In the absence of any clear definition in this Bill in regard to what repairs will consist of, in the absence of the requirement in the Bill that the landlord should do the repairs rather than simply be liable for them, I support Deputy Larkin's amendment as it stands that we should get rid of this section.  It is a new section that was not in the 1946 Act.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is entitled to point out that the 1946 Act, in dealing with controlled 1923 Act premises, did allow an increase of I think one-twelfth for repairs where the landlord was responsible for the entire repairs.  That section of the 1946 Act applied only where the landlord was responsible for the whole of the repairs.  This is a new section. It also gives the landlord the same increase where he is liable for part repairs.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading the Parliamentary Secretary claimed that this was simply putting into operation a recommendation in the Conroy Commission Report.  I do not think that is accurate.  The Conroy Commission recommended that there should be an increase to landlords on the basic rents for repairs.  However, they suggested there should be a differential as between a landlord responsible for the entire repairs and a landlord responsible for part repairs only.  I concede that the Parliamentary Secretary has taken the lower of the two increases suggested by the Conroy Commission and applied it to landlords whether responsible for whole or part repairs.</P>
    <P>The Conroy Commission suggested an increase of 25 per cent. to the landlord responsible for the entire of the repairs and an increase of 12½ per cent. to the landlord responsible for part repairs only.  However, the principle they enshrined in that recommendation was that there should be a differential&mdash;I do not know the amount &mdash;between the landlord responsible <Col N="510" /> for the entire repairs and the landlord responsible for part repairs only. That has not been accepted by the Government and that is not being incorporated in this Bill.  We feel a further important principle involved is that we should not interfere with the right of sitting tenants&mdash;those who are there at the moment&mdash;whatever we may do with regard to controlled premises that will be occupied by new tenants with new tenancy agreements.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept any of the amendments.  Deputy Larkin's amendment cuts across the entire principle of the Bill.  I regard the other amendments as unnecessary.  With reference to the 12½ per cent. increase in basic rents, there is no element whatever of a bonus to landlords.  Let me go over the background again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Conroy Commission sat in 1950 it recommended an increase of 25 per cent. in the case of landlords liable for all repairs and 12½ per cent. in the case of landlords liable for part repairs. In 1950, rents had increased by five times since 1914.  The majority of controlled rents are related to the 1914 level.  The other category of controlled rents are those which are controlled at the 1941 level.  Between 1941 and 1950 the cost of repairs doubled.  In that situation, the Conroy Commission recommended that an increase of 25 per cent. in one case and 12½ per cent. in the other case be given to landlords to compensate them, and no more than compensate them, for the increase in the cost of repairs.  The Conroy Commission pointed out that this proposal contained no element of an increase in the net income of landlords.  That was in 1950.  Since 1950, repair costs have increased by 40 per cent.  Despite that further increase we still are giving to landlords in this Bill an increase of <Col N="511" /> only 12½ per cent. whether they are liable for all or only part repairs.</P>

In the great majority of cases, landlords have received no increase of any sort since 1926.  I shall not weep for landlords but I want to be fair to them.  Every section of the community is entitled to a certain amount of fairness. It is a reasonable and fair increase.</P>

      <P>Landlords generally are entitled to a fair deal from this Bill. With regard to the 12½ per cent. increase, it does not apply when the landlord is not liable for any repairs.  But if he is liable for repairs it still does not apply if he has carried out exceptional repairs and got a lawful addition without taking a repair grant.  If he has got a lawful addition because of exceptional repairs and has taken a grant it does not apply to the element of the basic rent that is a lawful addition.  It applies only to the original rent before the lawful addition was added on to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Keeping all those factors in mind there is, as I say, no element of a bonus in it.  It will not increase landlords' net rents at all.  It will merely compensate them for the increased cost of repairs.  Landlords have had no increase in most cases since 1926 and in other cases since 1941, and I think on the side of justice, as between landlord and tenant, there is no doubt it is perfectly fair, and that most tenants will admit that it is fair. We have had no complaints from tenants <Col N="512" /> that it is unfair.  I think most reasonable tenants, if you ask them whether or not landlords are entitled to something, would agree that 12½ per cent. is not unfair.  Tenants will agree also because it will enable landlords to do repairs for which they are liable.  That is an important aspect of this question.  You cannot get blood out of a turnip and if a landlord just has not got the resources, or if his rent is not such as to enable him to carry out the repairs, then despite what the law says he will not carry them out.</P>
    <P>We are giving this 12½ per cent. in the first place to enable landlords to carry out repairs for which they are liable.  Let me come to the other point, that the provision deals only with landlords who are liable for repairs and that we are not insisting that the repairs be carried out.  That is the kernel of the two amendments, one by Deputy Russell and the other by Deputy Costello.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am sorry. Deputy Costello's amendment is designed to see that this 12½ per cent. should be applied only to new tenancies. With regard to Deputy Russell's amendment and the argument put forward by Deputy Sherwin and other Deputies that we should do something more than just saying that we will give the increase where landlords are liable, there are different provisions at the moment which are designed to ensure that landlords carry out the repairs for which they are liable.  Deputy de Valera pointed to Section 15 and Section 40 of this Bill.  Under Section 40 a tenant may go to the court and the court may award the tenant whatever sum is necessary to carry out the repairs.  Section 15 applies to the 1923 Act cases and under Section 15 the court can reduce the rent by up to 20 per cent. in order to compel the landlord to carry out the repairs for which he is liable.  There is also the ordinary, simple process of common law whereby the tenant can sue in contract and have the landlord compelled to <Col N="513" /> carry out the repairs for which he is liable.</P>
      <P>There is also Section 61 of the Landlord and Tenant Act where the tenant can call upon the landlord to carry out whatever repairs are necessary and if the landlord fails to do that the tenant can carry them out and then deduct the amount he expends on the repairs from the rent.  Surely those provisions are sufficient to ensure that landlords carry out the repairs for which they are liable.  If they do not carry them out, it is the fault of the tenants for not insisting on their rights. Deputy Sherwin and other Deputies can do a very good public service by informing tenants of their rights in this respect.  Rather than getting up here and talking about landlords not doing this or not doing that they can simply, calmly and factually tell the tenants what their rights are and show them that tenants can go to court or do this, that or the other, to have their rights enforced and ensure that landlords do the repairs for which they are liable.</P>
      <P>Those are the main arguments which have been put forward.  First of all, that the 12½ per cent. is unfair, unnecessary and unjust.  That argument cannot stand up for one moment, on any considerations of social justice. Here let me join issue with Deputy O'Higgins who, on several occasions, said or implied that the existing relation between landlord and tenants is on the basis of freedom of contract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  I said that tenancies entered into in the last 14 years were entered into by the landlord and tenant in the knowledge that the rents were controlled under the 1946 Act, and in that knowledge the tenancies were voluntarily entered into by the landlord and tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is only one fact in regard to all the categories of houses here, whether they were controlled under the 1923 Act or under the 1946 Act.  In the case of all those houses we have interfered with the rights of the landlord and have said, rightly: &ldquo;As a Legislature, for social reasons we are going to interfere in <Col N="514" /> this contract and we are going to see that you will not get any more for this property than so much.&rdquo; It is nonsense to argue that there is any element of freedom of contract with regard to the control of houses.  There is a most rigid control and we have kept landlords under that control in some cases for 45 years.  Now, for the first time since 1946, we are proposing to do some small thing to redress the balance.</P>
      <P>As I say, I think we can defend it on any principle of social justice and we can defend it as being good national economics.  We have a stock of houses which represent national capital.  Those houses are getting into a state of disrepair and dilapidation because landlords out of their rents are not able to carry out the repairs which they would like to carry out, apart altogether from whether they are good or bad landlords.  So far as this 12½ per cent. will do something to relieve that position and to enable that stock of houses to be kept in proper repair, it is a good thing from the point of view of the national economy.  I think it is fair and just and I am perfectly satisfied that it is a reasonable compromise in a difficult situation.</P>

      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary is being very fair indeed.  One might even say he is leaning over backwards in this matter to look after the interests of the landlords. It surprises me that the Parliamentary Secretary, a member of a Party so frequently concerned about tenants of local authorities, a Party whose spokesmen almost say that tenants should not have to pay rents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; should come in here and take the view that under this subsection if a landlord were only a landlord for the purpose of this Bill for 12 months, or if there had been changes in the tenancies of his dwelling or dwellings within the past year or so, as long as they were controlled dwellings&mdash;and without any requirement <Col N="515" /> to show that a single penny had been spent in respect of his liability for repairs wholly or in part&mdash;he could put out his hand to the tenant and say: &ldquo;Twelve and a half per cent.  Dáil Éireann has said that we are to get a 12½ per cent. increase in our rent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Provision is made in other sections of the Bill by which landlords may obtain increases for repairs carried out.  This subsection confines itself to saying that in respect of controlled dwellings the landlord can be given a gift of a 12½ per cent. increase in the rent.  A controlled dwelling may be a house, a couple of rooms or a single tenement room.  If this Bill is passed, the landlord, even if he never spent a penny on repairs, is entitled to go to the tenant and tell him: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann says I am entitled to get an increase of 12½ per cent. on the rent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that this subsection does not apply in cases where a landlord has carried out repairs under the previous Act and sought and obtained lawful increases in the rent.  I should hope it would not.  This subsection does not concern itself with whether a landlord has incurred any expenditure at all or has faced up to his responsibilities.  Deputy de Valera told us there was provision in the 1946 Act to compel landlords to complete repairs, but there were many ways in which a landlord could evade his responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that, by and large, landlords should be in the position of knowing their rights.  Landlords whose livelihood depends on the incomes they receive from rented dwellings under these Acts usually have the best of legal advice to make sure they get their pound of flesh.  However, that is not the case with the majority of the tenants.  I disagree fundamentally with the Parliamentary Secretary.  He says that subsection (b) is not unfair. I say it is unfair and unjust to the tenants because it would have the result of permitting landlords to extract from tenants an increase in rent with no evidence whatever that they actually <Col N="516" /> spent money on the repairs for which they are supposed to be responsible. Surely, if the case is made that a landlord is entitled to some increase in respect of repairs, it is only common justice that such increase should not be granted unless there is evidence that there has been some expenditure on repairs?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that over the years landlords were unable to carry out repairs because it was not an economic proposition.  As I say, this section has the effect of empowering landlords to impose an increase of 12½ per cent. without requiring them to carry out repairs involving the expenditure of even £1. It is based on a supposition that for many years a considerable number of landlords did not carry out repairs because they were unable to do so.  If you look around the city of Dublin and consult with tenants of long standing, you will find that a considerable number of them have occupied dwellings on which the landlord never spent a penny.</P>
    <P>In hundreds of cases, even though the landlords were supposed to be responsible for repairs, the tenants, rather than be involved in litigation, carried out the repairs out of their own pockets.  Only when it came to the point that they would have to seek the assistance of the sanitary authority did they make it an issue with the landlord.  Deputies know how difficult it is for a sanitary authority to succeed in compelling landlords to put property into a proper condition of habitation.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that this is a fundamental portion of the Bill because, to the ordinary man, it means giving permission to the landlord to obtain more rent without giving evidence of any greater service.  I believe it is fundamentally wrong that we should allow a landlord to obtain an increase in the rent without any evidence that the increase has any justification.  The Parliamentary Secretary recalled the position in 1926 and in 1950.  All the tenancies affected by this Bill do not go back to 1926 or 1950.  Deputy Sherwin was quite <Col N="517" /> correct in saying that there is a changeover in tenancies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But the rent remains the same.  It is controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is anticipating me.  The landlord is entitled to charge the tenant of a controlled dwelling, even though he may be a tenant of only 12 months, an increase of 12½ per cent. on the rent, though in respect of that dwelling perhaps not a single penny has been spent on repairs.  The tenant who came into possession under a tenancy agreement one, two or three years ago is faced now with the position that, without a single penny being spent on repairs, the landlord can collect an increase of 12½ per cent. The particular landlord may have, in fact, already benefited substantially under the operation of the Rent Restrictions Acts because he may have come into possession of a dwelling that was let at a low rent and possibly has taken advantage of the Act, as he would legally be entitled to do, after coming into possession and if there is a change of tenancy, to seek to have the rent brought fully into line under the provisions of the Act.  I do not know if he has done so will the position apply whether the tenancy is old or new, whether the landlord is the old landlord or a new landlord?</P>

      <P>I am quite aware of that, but it is not the dwelling that will have to pay the increase of 12½ per cent.; it is the tenant in that dwelling at that particular time, as the tenant on whose behalf no repairs whatever <Col N="518" /> may have been done and perhaps no attempt made to do repairs.  In some cases, there may even have been repeated applications without success to the landlord to have repairs carried out and the landlord is now told that because he is responsible for those repairs, we will give him a 12½ per cent. increase.</P>
      <P>I want to close by saying again that, in our view, this subsection is the equivalent of a gift to landlords by and large.  We oppose it and we think it should be deleted from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I shall deal with the points made by Deputy Larkin.  The position in law is quite clear.  In so far as a dwelling is controlled under the Rent Acts, a change of tenancy does not make any difference whatever.  The control applies to the dwelling and, if a new landlord comes, the rent applicable to the dwelling still applies to him.  If an unscrupulous landlord tries to increase the rent on a new tenant, the machinery of the Acts is available to the tenant who can go to court and have the rent reduced to what it should be.  It is wrong for Deputies to try to convey the impression which may be given abroad that it is open to a landlord to increase the rent on the tenant.  It is not.  Let us be clear about that.  I should be very unhappy if any contrary opinion were to go out from this House.  I think it very desirable that Deputies should make the position as clear as they can to their constituents generally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole point I am trying to bring out.  The tenants have all the rights and the statutes there to protect them.  Let us instruct them in their rights.  If there are unscrupulous landlords, the courts are there to see that their tenants are protected.  The best service we could give would be to get the true provisions of these Acts as widely known as possible and have clearly pointed out to tenants what their rights are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the 12½ per cent. <Col N="519" /> increase in respect of repairs, we are giving it only to landlords who are liable for repairs.  The provisions of this Bill and other Acts are such that a landlord who is liable for repairs can be made to carry out repairs. Therefore, as we are giving the increase to landlords who are liable for repairs, we are giving it to landlords who have either carried out repairs or who can be made carry them out.  There is no validity in the argument that it is a bonus or an addition to the landlord's income.  That applies even in the case mentioned by Deputy Larkin where a tenant came into a dwelling only 12 months ago and no repairs have been done for him.  Therefore, it was argued, the landlord should not be entitled to an increase.  That is fallacious.  The accommodation has been there and the landlord is liable for repairs.  Even though he has not carried out repairs for the tenant who has been less than 12 months there, he has presumably carried out repairs since either 1914 or 1941, or whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>The 12½ per cent. increase appears to be desirable from the point of view of national economics.  It is not excessive and it will not be a burden on the tenants.  It is some compensation to the landlords for the increased cost of repairs and it is perfectly fair, to my mind.  I recommend it wholeheartedly to the House and ask the House to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of compensation for the increased cost of repairs but he already stated the increase does not apply in cases where landlords took advantage of the earlier Acts to carry out repairs and obtain the lawful increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing two different things.  When I say it is compensation for repairs, I mean for the ordinary running repairs for which a landlord is liable.  In the case of the other type of repair, the special, exceptional repairs or improvements &mdash;the sort of thing that happens where a landlord puts in a new bathroom or puts on a new roof; a <Col N="520" /> major or exceptional repair of that nature&mdash;the landlord has for some time been entitled to make a special lawful addition to the rent.  In such a case, either of two things takes place.  If he carried out an exceptional repair and has taken a State grant to help him to carry out the repair, then we shall give him 12½ per cent. increase on the original rent but not on the increased rent.  If he has not taken a State grant and if he has spent, say, £100 or £200 on exceptional repairs and has increased the rent by the appropriate percentage of the entire, or almost the entire, of that £100 to £200 in the form of a special lawful addition, the 12½ per cent. increase does not apply to him at all.  We say he has already got a substantial increase on the rent charged or, rather, to put it the other way, the tenant's rent has been substantially increased and we shall not give any further increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary clarify this for me?  I am a little confused.  I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that this increase is compensation for landlords in respect of repairs in the past.  We have put the case to him of the landlord who has not done those repairs.  He is to be compensated as well as the landlord who has done them.  That is No. 1.  Secondly, under the remaining sub-paragraphs of this section, the landlord will be entitled to further lawful additions in respect of repairs.  Under paragraph (c) of subsection (2), he will get eight per cent. of the amount spent on the improvement or structural alteration on or after the critical date; under paragraph (d) he will also get eight per cent. of the amount spent on repairs if they were due to waste on the part of the tenant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

If the excess is over £100, he gets 15 per cent. on the first £100 and 8 per cent on the remainder.  If the excess expended is over £200, he gets 15% on the first £100, 8% on the second £100, and <Col N="521" /> 6 per cent. on the remainder.  I want to know what is the position of the landlord who has not done repairs heretofore who is to be compensated by getting the 12½ per cent. arbitrary increase which the Legislature is now imposing on tenants' rent and who, in addition to that hereafter does repairs? Having got his 12½ per cent. for repairs he did not do, he now does the repairs; does he then get the increases set out in the other subparagraphs?</P>

      <P>The short answer to that is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Let us take a case where there has been no special lawful addition to date.

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there should be some protection.  Take the case where a landlord is empowered under this Bill to get an increase of 12½ per cent. on the rent and the dwelling is in a bad state of repair; the tenant is one of those people who is in a position to get legal opinion; he takes the landlord to court to seek to have the repairs carried out.  Under Section 40 the landlord can plead a number of grounds to justify his not carrying out the repairs&mdash;the age of the building, the economic cost, etc.  But he has already got the 12½ per cent. under this subsection.  He seeks the protection of the court on various grounds. I am speaking now as a layman.  Is it possible that a landlord will be presented with an increase of 12½ per cent. irrespective of whether he has spent a single penny on repairs, on the basis that he is entitled to compensation for something he has not done but which he may do in the future?  If the tenant takes him to court and the landlord wins the case, he will not have to carry out the repairs. That is an added reason why this subsection should not go through in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in dealing with this question of the landlord's liability to carry out repairs, I mentioned several different provisions in the law.  Subsection (5) of Section 40 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The right of the tenant to obtain relief under this section shall not prejudice his right to seek relief in any other form of proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the landlord were able to establish to the satisfaction of the court that he should not be compelled under subsection (2) to carry out repairs, the other provisions to which I referred&mdash;Section 15 of the Bill, Section 61 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and the ordinary common law of contract&mdash;are still available to the tenant.  There is no need for Deputy Larkin to be worried about Section 40.  It provides that if a dwelling is not in good and tenantable <Col N="523" /> repair the tenant can apply to the court and the court can order the payment of a sum of money to put the dwelling into good and tenantable repair.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) was inserted at the suggestion of the Conroy Commission to deal with exceptional cases in which it would obviously be unfair to make a landlord put a dwelling into good and tenantable repair because of the kind of dwelling it is or because of the type of repair necessary.  It might be a completely uneconomic proposition, and might cause an increase in rent which no tenant could reasonably be expected to pay.  The Conroy Commission recommended that the court should have discretion in such a case. It is for the court&mdash;not the landlord &mdash;to refuse to order the payment of this sum.  That would arise, of course, only in very exceptional cases.  It could never reach the dimensions of a loophole through which landlords could seek to get out of their ordinary liabilities. The provisions of Section 40 will still apply in all cases where, due to the neglect of the landlord, repairs were not carried out and the dwelling fell into a state in which it could no longer be regarded as being in good and tenantable repair.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to very exceptional cases.  A census was recently taken by the Dublin Corporation&mdash;it is not official yet, but I got a copy of it this morning&mdash;and, according to that census, there are 1,500 families living in dwellings which are unfit for habitation. Those 1,500 families can be asked to pay this 12½ per cent., but the landlord will not be liable to repair the dwellings because they are unfit for habitation and, therefore, beyond repair.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Reading, certain points were raised about the liabilities of C.I.E. in relation to the Royal Canal and while the Minister indicated that he believed they were covered, he arranged to look into them.  The point about which I am most concerned is one which is not mentioned at all in Section 1.  The practice has grown up over the years to supply water from the Royal Canal to farmers out as far as Maynooth under a terminable agreement.</P>
      <P>The agreement is, without question, terminable in theory.  In practice, so long as the canal remained a navigable waterway, it is quite clear the owners would have been delighted to get the extra revenue from supplying water.  So long as it remained navigable, they would be naturally anxious to get any additional profits they could.  But once it is closed to navigation, as this Bill authorises it to be closed, there may not be the same anxiety to retain water in the canal and the position may well arise that C.I.E. would terminate the existing agreements for the supplies of water to the neighbouring farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they did that&mdash;and they may possibly have the right to do it legally&mdash;I know certain farmers who would be ruined overnight because there is no other method of their getting water supplies and they have got them in this way not merely for decades but for fifty years and upwards in many cases.  I think the Minister will find that virtually all the accommodation <Col N="525" /> land on which cattle are kept on nights before the Dublin cattle market takes water from the Royal Canal under these agreements with C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I want to be assured by the Minister that in closing the canal to navigation, not merely will the existing rights in respect of flooding and of road authorities&mdash;which are provided for in this Bill&mdash;be retained, but that there will not be any termination of the agreements by which water is supplied, at fees, of course, to the persons mentioned. I think it is significant that although C.I.E. are aware of the existence of those rights, there is no mention of them whatever in this section, though there is reference to our obligations in respect of flooding and of drainage.  Why if this is so, why if the Minister's view as expressed during the Second Reading is correct, is there no mention of the legal obligations entered into for years and years to supply water to those people, and why is there not a saving section in the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what will the position be in regard to waterways after they are closed to navigation.  There are certain works along the Royal Canal which, if not maintained, will completely deteriorate and disappear. The point Deputy Sweetman made about accommodation water supplies is also in question here.  I have already suggested canals as emergency sources of water supplies to Dublin in certain circumstances&mdash;supplies which would be available to cope with fires, if there were disruptions of the normal water supplies.  I am not therefore quite clear as to what closure to navigation will mean in respect to the canals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point to which I think the Minister should give attention. At the moment I do not think there is any particular threat in this matter, but along the Royal Canal north of Dublin there are towpaths which are used by people going out walking and as convenient short cuts. I take it that these towpaths will continue to be maintained, since the banks are regarded to some extent as amenities.  Into this question also <Col N="526" /> enters the point about the danger to children along the canal banks.  What will be the position in future in respect to these towpaths both from the point of view of rights and of safety?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I can assure Deputy Sweetman that the supplies of water to farmers from the canal will continue.  The whole stretch from Liffey Junction to Mullingar will, in the foreseeable future, have the water level retained.  It is only being closed to navigation.  However, if at any time C.I.E. decide either to lower the level or abandon the Royal Canal altogether, they would have to submit their proposals to the Minister for Transport and Power of the day and he would ensure that no one would be put to any extra expense whatever in maintaining supplies.  In other words, if C.I.E. wanted to discharge its obligation, it would have to make an agreement with some other body, possibly the local authority, to continue supplies. In making that agreement, no one would suffer financially and the water supplies would be maintained.</P>

The Grand Canal is no longer used for navigation, although it has not been formally closed.  There are no barges run by C.I.E. on the canal.  They are in touch with them in regard to the matter.  They are also in touch in regard to the future of that section of the Royal Canal between Liffey Junction and Spencer Dock in the hope of making some arrangement for the preservation of the towpath.</P>

    <P>The existing provisions of the Army Pensions Acts which allow for the payment of pensions or gratuities to officers, soldiers and members of the Army Nursing Service who become disabled as a result of wounds are applicable where such disablements are due to service with a United Nations Force.  Similarly, the benefits provided under the Acts for the dependants of deceased officers and soldiers are available to the dependants of those who are killed or who die of wounds in circumstances attributable to service with a United Nations Force.</P>
    <P>Where, however, disablement or death is due to disease attributable to such service there is no provision for the payment of pensions, gratuities or allowances because disease is not regarded as a peace-time hazard of Defence Force service and there are no peace-time provisions in respect of disease which could be automatically <Col N="530" /> applied, as in the case of the provisions for wounds or death on duty, to Defence Force service with the United Nations.  This Bill is therefore necessary to enable disablement or death due to disease attributable to service with a United Nations Force to qualify for the appropriate benefits.</P>
    <P>Section 3, in conjunction with the First Schedule, provides accordingly that pensions may be paid in respect of disease attributable to United Nations service subject to the same conditions which applied in respect of pensions for disablement due to disease attributable to service in 1922-1924 or in 1939-1946&mdash;the only two periods during which disease was hitherto reckonable for benefit under the Acts. The scales and rates of pensions provided are those currently payable to persons who qualified for pensions in respect of disablement due to disease in the 1939-1946 period.</P>
    <P>Section 6, in conjunction with the Second Schedule, extends to the dependants of officers and soldiers who die from disease attributable to service with a United Nations Force the benefits available in respect of death from disease contracted in 1922-1924 or in 1939-1946, and, in addition, provides a new benefit, which was not applicable to the latter categories, under which there is a 50% addition to the allowances payable to the widows and children of officers and soldiers who die within four years of the termination of their United Nations service from a disease attributable to such service.  This 50% enhancement already exists in the Acts in the case of the widows and children of personnel killed on duty or dying, within four years, of a wound but it has not hitherto been operative for death from disease.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 7 provide, in respect of United Nations service, for the payment, in circumstances where the normal disability pensions are not payable, of modified pensions for lesser disability or partial attributability similar to those already available under the Acts in respect of the 1922-1924 and the 1939-1946 periods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> Section 4 brings the Chaplaincy Service for the first time within the ambit of the Acts and enables pensions to be paid to members of the Service in respect of disablement, whether from disease or wound, attributable to service with a United Nations Force. Members are also included within the scope of the modified pensions mentioned in Sections 5 and 7.</P>
    <P>Sections 1, 2 and 8 deal with matters of interpretation, definition, citation, etc., and do not call for comment other than that it will be seen from Section 2 that the Bill applies to all United Nations service, past, present and future in which members of the Defence Forces have been or may be engaged.</P>

This Bill applies to United Nations service generally and it will cover either past service with the United Nations or any future service. The announcement to-day was made in the light of the special circumstances of the United Nations force in the Congo.  In future such circumstances may or may not apply and therefore there is no provision for those lump sums to be paid in respect of any other United Nations service at the moment.</P>

      <P>Of course we accept the proposals contained in the Bill.  I think that everybody will agree that the proposals in this Bill in its present form came as a shock to a great number of people and I feel that in this connection the Government should have issued the announcement that they issued subsequently.  The two should have come together so that we would know exactly where we were. We are told to-day in a statement in the Press that these gratuities are being paid.  I am glad that that step has been taken and it is clear that justice and equity demand that such payments should be made.</P>
      <P>However, it is going to relate only to this special case in the Congo.  This is permanent legislation we are now introducing for service with the United Nations.  I think that some reference should have been included in this Bill to show the Minister's intentions regarding further service of the United Nations.  Everybody realises that, no matter what the payment or pension is, it is very poor recompense to the dependants of those gallant men.  At the same time I think it is a very dangerous precedent to establish having regard to the provisions enshrined in this Bill and the fact that the gratuity is to be paid at the whim of the Government.  I do not think that the House should simply take the matter in that easy way.  It is true to say that this is an improvement on our existing legislation for the dependants of those who lost their lives in the previous emergencies, but it does draw attention to and emphasise the paucity of the payments and allowances made, especially with the present day value of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> I feel that the Minister in his statement in introducing the Bill should have brought out all the facts and that the Government should not have availed of a public announcement in the Press to say what their intentions were.  They should have said that in this House and nowhere else.</P>
    <P>I feel that the action of certain newspapers in collecting for a charitable relief fund was a very unwise thing.  These men are the responsibility of this State and of the United Nations and they are not subject to the charity of anybody.  They are either entitled to this or they are not.  We all know that they are entitled to it and I strongly condemn&mdash;perhaps condemn is too strong a word&mdash;I strongly disapprove of the steps taken by the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Standard</i> to start this fund for the relief of the Congo dependants.  This House should see to it that those who offer their services in the defence of the peace and good order of the world, in the interests of the Irish people as well as of the United Nations, are a national charge and not a subject for charity.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the great kindness and generosity of our people who are contributing so well to the funds.  The Army Benevolent Fund committee are to be asked to distribute the funds. That is wise and appropriate.  I trust the Government will not take credit for the amount they have got so as to relieve them of the obligation of paying a gratuity.  These funds must be outside and beyond the amounts the Government should pay.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to make comparisons. If a gallant young officer is hit by a motor car and killed and the case is tried by a judge and jury we may well ask ourselves what compensation his widow and children will get.  Some people may argue that the judgments in the courts are high.  Nevertheless it is a point that must be taken into consideration.  Here is a young man who would go far in his career.  He is cut off.  His value is rated at the value of his service at the time he is killed. The same remarks apply to N.C.O.s and men.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister and his Department, <Col N="534" /> after all their experience, will not insert the four-year period again? In this country the provision that if a person does not contract the disease in four years&mdash;and that generally meant T.B. or heart or something like that&mdash;created hardship on many occasions.  Men contracted disease and five, ten or fifteen years elapsed before it took effect.  However, because it manifested itself outside the four year period, no matter how justifiable the case appeared on paper, the Minister and the Department were able to say that the statute forbids payment.</P>
    <P>Take African service.  Is it not well known that disease can be contracted in Africa that will not manifest itself for ten or fifteen years?  However, unless the disease is found to exist within four years they are ruled out.  Is it not time that that four year provision were excluded?  If the Minister does not agree to insert an amendment to that effect we shall be compelled to move an amendment to exclude the four year period.  It is unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the person can be discharged, his time is up.  A boy who comes home from the Congo now can be discharged from the Army next year and if disease manifests itself in the fifth year is he not ruled out?  That has happened time after time.  There is not an official in the Department of Defence who is not aware that such cases have arisen under our legislation for our troops at home.  Several times it was admitted to be a hardship.  Therefore, I suggest the Minister should amend that provision. It follows that at some subsequent date we shall exclude it from other Acts as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount for the education of dependent children of an officer, N.C.O. or man is very low.  It is well known that the amount allowed, even for a day school, would not cover the expenses.  The Minister and the Government should consider that matter very carefully and see to it that <Col N="535" /> their position has not been worsened by the service of their parent to humanity.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the gratuity, I do not think any person in this House would approve of the proposal.  If this is permanent legislation with regard to future service with the United Nations, I do not think many will be anxious to go and it will require all the compulsory power in the new Act to make men go.  The princely pension the widow of a young officer, lieutenant or captain will get is £117 per annum.  The amount for the widow of a soldier is 24/6d.  Does that 24/6d. debar her from a widow's pension? What is the position there?  I should be glad if the Minister would tell us exactly what that means and where we are going in this respect so that the House will have an opportunity of fully understanding and appreciating the Bill.</P>

      <P>I suppose we would all agree that an Army Pensions Bill is necessary to cover those members of the Defence Forces who are now engaged in service with the United Nations and those who may be so engaged in the future.  From that point of view, I suppose all of us consider it desirable and necessary that the Bill should be introduced.  Like Deputy MacEoin, I feel the Minister should have said much more than the few remarks he made with regard to the compensation payments announced in the newspapers this morning.  He described them as <i>ex gratia</i> payments. Deputy MacEoin said he supposed that these are made in accordance with the past legislation.  I do not know whether or not that is correct.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister legislative authority to pay these gratuities?  I agree that the gratuities should be paid but I am very suspicious inasmuch as they are described as <i>ex gratia</i> payments. An <i>ex gratia</i> payment is made at the whim, so to speak, of a Government or a Minister for Defence.  I hope a precedent has been created.  I wonder if the Minister for Defence regards the payment of compensation now as a precedent that will be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> Eight members of our Defence Forces were unfortunate in losing their lives.  I do not want to appear morbid or pessimistic but if, say, the situation in the Congo deteriorates to such an extent that our soldiers there will not be doing police work but in effect will be on active service and in conflict with some of these tribes in the Congo and many of them lose their lives, are the Government prepared to say they will compensate the dependants of these soldiers to the same extent as dependants are now being compensated? It would only be natural for future dependants of soldiers who may be killed in the Congo to expect similar compensation to that which has been announced now.  Therefore the Minister should expand on the proposals which are Government proposals and which were announced in the newspapers this morning.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody could take exception to the amount of compensation which it is proposed to pay.  I for one am of the opinion that we should look after our Army personnel and their dependants in the matter of pensions and gratuities in a far more generous way than we have been doing.  I know our financial resources are limited and so also is the strength of our Army, but from time to time we receive complaints&mdash;in my opinion legitimate complaints&mdash;to the effect that, even having regard to its greater resources, Great Britain looks after her ex-Army men and the dependants of men killed in action or who die from a disease contracted in the Army, in a far better way than we do.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister&mdash; I suppose this is more a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;whether widows and children of soldiers who have been killed will be subject to a means test for the purpose of qualifying, say, for the widows' and orphans' pension?  So far as my memory serves me, I think the first £80 in payment of an Army pension is disregarded for the purpose of qualification for widows' and orphans' pensions.  The Minister should have second thoughts on that particular matter if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Full contributory pension? I accept that.  I am also concerned, as was Deputy MacEoin, about subsection (2) of Section 3, a provision from other Army Pensions Acts which is repeated here.  The provision is that a person must apply for a pension within four years after his discharge from the Army where he applies on the grounds of being disabled or having contracted a disease.  First of all, I should like to ask the Minister whether it is necessary to define what is a disease?  Does it mean an ailment, a hurt or permanent damage to a limb, and soon?  I presume it does mean permanent damage to a limb, but I do not know what &ldquo;disease&rdquo; means in this context.  I should also like to say that, in my opinion, four years is far too short a period.  There are many soldiers throughout the country with grievances because they have been refused pensions on the ground that they did not apply within the stipulated period of four years.  Four years is far too short because even outside the Army we know that a disease which has been contracted might not necessarily show itself within four years.</P>
      <P>I know many men who were active in sport&mdash;football, hurling, rugby and soccer&mdash;who received an injury when engaged in these sports and the effects of which did not show up for a period well beyond four years.  It is a well-known fact that many of the illnesses and disabilities under which men suffer at present could be attributed to some hurt they received while playing some of these games I mentioned during their teens.  It is hard luck on a soldier's dependants to say that if the disease does not show, if he is not aware of it within four years, they are not entitled to any of the pensions under this Army Pensions Bill or any of the previous Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the point raised by Deputy MacEoin, that is the special case of those now engaged on service in the Congo.  The medical authorities who have advised the Minister and his officials have I suppose many years' experience in the matter of diseases usually contracted here.  The main disease, at least up to recent years, was tuberculosis.  But <Col N="538" /> what do we know of the diseases that may be contracted in a place like the Congo?  Have we any idea of when a disease which is contracted now will show itself and show itself to the extent that it may be regarded as a permanent or semi-permanent disability?  I have no idea of what sort of disease one might contract in the Congo or whether malaria is one such disease.  I still do not know what are the full effects of malaria.  It may be that some of these tropical diseases might not show themselves until well after the four year period. For that reason, the Minister should take another look at subsection (2) of Section 3 to see whether or not there could be an extension of the period in which to apply for a pension.  One can plead for the same sort of extension for service in this country but if this Bill dealt only with soldiers serving in this country I think many of us could make the same plea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be proved that the disease is attributable to service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be very difficult for an applicant to prove that. Many ex-soldiers and soldiers say that they got tuberculosis as a result of wettings but it is very difficult for them to prove that.  They have very limited resources through which to prove their case.  They get assistance from medical officers and such people but the Minister is entirely responsible as head of the Department and resists these claims very strongly.  If such is to be the case with people to be covered under this Bill, it seems that many who would be morally entitled to a pension will not get it.</P>
      <P>I repeat that the Bill is necessary in view of the fact that at present we have soldiers serving with the United Nations in the Congo.  But there are amendments which should and could be inserted before the Bill finally passes through the House to ensure that we will be doing the best we can for those soldiers serving in the Congo &mdash;at great sacrifice to themselves&mdash;so that their dependants will be compensated to the utmost extent that this country can afford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of compensation, which I heard today for the first time, have changed my approach to this Bill.  I should like to express now my appreciation to the Government for the way they have met this situation.  This Bill, as it stood before the announcement of the terms of compensation, undoubtedly would have been a poor reward for services rendered as a result of our troops being sent on U.N. duty by this House. Unfortunately, I had not the opportunity of hearing the Minister's opening statement, and I should like him to let me know whether this <i>ex gratia</i> compensation payment is payable to the dependants of all the members of the Defence Forces who lost their lives while on U.N. duty.  Whether a man dies on the operating table or is killed by bows and arrows, I feel that, once this House has sent him on U.N. service, compensation should be available to his dependants.  The man who dies through illness has done his duty just as well as the man who unfortunately happens to be killed when engaged on active service.  Therefore, I hope the compensation terms will apply to all concerned.  The <i>ex gratia</i> payments are fair.  There is no distinction between an officer, an N.C.O. and a man in regard to payment, and I think that is highly desirable in a matter of this nature.</P>
      <P>In regard to claims arising from injuries or illness, I think the period of four years in the Bill is unreasonable and I should like to support Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Corish in that regard.  As an ex-Army man, I had personal experience of men who served from 1939 to 1945 and who, because their illness did not show up within four years from the date of their discharge, were precluded from compensation.  In view of that, I do not think the Army authorities are in a position arbitrarily to lay down a four-year limit in regard to foreign affairs.  Good and all as our medical advisers at home may be, I do not think they are equipped to advise as to what might occur to men serving in the Congo or any other part of Africa and, therefore, I think the four-year period should be left open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> In regard to education, the Bill provides that allowances will be made available up to the age of 18.  It is time we woke up to our responsibilities in the field of education.  Is it suggested that the child of a soldier or an officer is finished with education on reaching the age of 18?  Is that not what this Bill suggests?  Have we not accepted the fact that if a child has the intelligence and ability to equip himself or herself for the professions, such a child should have the opportunity of taking out a degree in a university?  Surely this Bill will preclude children with intelligence and ambition from getting higher education? A Commission has been set up to investigate the whole field of higher education, and I hope one of its recommendations will be to extend to all children who are capable of qualifying in the various professions the benefit of a higher education.  We should not at this stage limit the grants for educational purposes to those up to 18 years.  Provision should be made for making available a full university education to all children who, in the opinion of their teachers, are suitable for further education.  I hope the Minister will consider that aspect carefully.</P>
    <P>The allowances are based, I think, on the general allowances which obtained in the past&mdash;widows' allowances and so forth.  To my mind, the amount involved is very small.  If the value of the £1 today is taken into account, the allowances are miserable, to say the least of them.  Were it not for the compensation terms and the <i>ex gratia</i> payments, this Bill would not get a very warm welcome.  I am very glad the Government moved with expedition in this matter.  The feeling was abroad that there was a likelihood the Government might shelve its responsibilities in view of the fact that well-meaning voluntary organisations were apparently taking it upon themselves to compensate or help the relatives of those who lost their lives.</P>
    <P>There is too much charity of this nature in this country.  In many fields, the State is relieved of its obligations by the fact that a number of charitable <Col N="541" /> organisations step in.  I know the position with regard to charity as such.  It is admitted, even between nations, that where a thing can be described as charity, the receiver has no great regard for it.  We have the case of the United States which has poured money into various countries, possibly in a friendly manner to help the people, and the result has been that those very people have decided they do not want charity but want technical help and assistance&mdash;they do not want to be looked upon as poor relations.  If that applies in the international field, the same thing applies to individuals.  If it is demoralising for one State to look upon another as a poor relation, it is equally demoralising to have the same principle applied within the community itself.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that, in this instance, the Government have hastened to shoulder their responsibilities, because it was the Government and this House who asked these young men to volunteer.  We should accept our responsibilities.  I hope the Minister will clear up the point in regard to compensation&mdash;whether it includes all those who have lost their lives?  If any serious mishap or catastrophe should happen, God forbid, to a contingent of our troops, can this matter of <i>ex gratia</i> payments be used as a means of evading responsibility for the quite large sums involved in such circumstances?  It is this question of <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  Is there a danger of its being utilised as a means of evading responsibility for quite large sums that might be involved in such circumstances?  We all hope that such will not be the case but, when we make provision in this House in the form of compensation in respect of those who have already, unfortunately, lost their lives, we should accept this as setting a precedent for the future and I am sure we would all take what is being done now as a precedent if any tragedy took place in the future on service such as our troops are engaged in at the moment, and similar arrangements would automatically be brought into operation.</P>

I am glad that the Government have been able to move as quickly as they have and with the adequacy reflected in the Bill.  I think I share one point of view with Deputy McQuillan to the extent that I am afraid that this limitation in time may be the cause of future trouble.  I know this has been a difficulty in the case of other pensions, but in this case I do not know if the Minister would consider some provision by which a <i>bona fide</i> claim that arises after the years in question would be considered. I think that point might be attended to.  Otherwise, this measure is nothing more than a simple duty for the House and a duty which I am glad the Government has discharged as quickly as it possibly could.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that it should be said that the publication of the Bill&mdash;apart from the statement which was issued later&mdash;came as a shock to Deputies.  It was made clear at the time the temporary measure authorising the sending of these troops was put through the House that the existing provisions of the Army Pensions Acts covered death or disability due to wounds on such service and that due to the particular circumstances attending service in the Congo it was the Government's intention to extend the provisions of the Army Pensions Acts to cover death or disability due to disease contracted in the Congo.  That is what this Bill does; this is the Bill that was promised then.</P>
      <P>In reply to a Question in the Dáil some time ago I said that the Government were considering the adequacy of the rates to be paid and their decision was to leave the rates as they were and to pay extra compensation in respect of the Congo by way of lump sum because we have no way of saying in advance whether the circumstances that attach to service in the Congo will be applicable to other United Nations service or not.  But in so far as a precedent is set the precedent is to consider each case on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> I agree that it would have given Deputies a clearer picture if the statement with regard to the actual lump sums had been issued simultaneously with the Bill but it was considered a matter of urgency to get the Bill brought before the House as quickly as possible and a decision as to the amount of the lump sum to be paid had not been made at that time.  It was not feasible, therefore, to have the two documents published together. However, the statement with regard to the lump sum provision was issued before the Second Reading of the Bill and I think that has cleared up that point.  I agree that this question of compensation for members of the Defence Forces who suffer either disablement or die as a result of their service with the United Nations in the Congo is the responsibility of the Government and the United Nations. The Government have accepted that responsibility.  Anything that has been done by other people is no responsibility of mine.</P>
    <P>The question was raised as to whether this is to be regarded as a precedent for any incidents similar to those that have already occurred in the Congo that may occur in the future. I think the statement is quite clear in that respect.  The Government have decided that in addition to the benefit available under the Army Pensions Act and under the Army Pensions (No. 2) Bill, 1960, payments by way of lump sum shall be made to dependants of members of the Defence Forces serving with the United Nations Forces in the Congo and who were killed while so serving, who die of wounds attributable to such service within four years of the date of the wounds or who die in the Congo as a result of disease attributable to such service or who die within four years after their return from the Congo as a result of a disease attributable to such service, such additional payment to be made without distinction of rank and to be at the rate of £3,500 in respect of a married man and £2,000 in respect of a single man.  I think it is quite clear from that that it will apply to any similar such tragic <Col N="544" /> occurrence that may happen in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that later.  Deputies may take it that this applies to service in the Congo but not necessarily to other United Nations service.  It may or it may not; it will all depend on the circumstances that exist at the time.</P>
      <P>The four Deputies who spoke referred to the time limit of four years. That has been specified in previous legislation and in this legislation.  The reason for it, of course, is the difficulty of establishing medically whether a disease which only appears a considerable time after the discharge of the soldier from the Army is in fact attributable to his service during a particular period.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to members of the Defence Forces who found themselves disabled as a result of disease after a period of more than four years since the conclusion of the Emergency period, for instance.  In that instance, because the disease only became noticeable more than four years after the Emergency they were precluded from applying but surely it must be obvious to Deputies that anybody in those circumstances would have very great difficulty in any case in trying to relate such a disease to their service during the Emergency period.  It would obviously be almost impossible.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that I certainly do not know what type of disease may be contracted in the Congo or how long it may take such a disease to show up but I think it is wise to have this provision.  It may be found necessary in the future to amend the Acts in this respect, but this is a provision that has always been made and I think it is a very wise one in everybody's interests.  It is only right that anybody who has such a disease should claim as soon as possible so that it would be possible for him to establish that the disease was in fact due to service during that particular period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> It is obvious there should be some time limit because of the medical difficulty of establishing that the disease is attributable to service during the period in question.</P>
    <P>As I have clearly indicated, all the people concerned at the moment are entitled to the full contributory widow's pension and that pension will not be reduced because of the benefits payable under the Army Pensions Acts.</P>
    <P>With regard to the education allowance, 18 years has always been the upper age limit.  That runs right through Army Pensions legislation. There is no special case for altering it in this instance.  If there were a case, then it would obviously have to be altered right through the whole of the Army pensions code.  I do not think there is a good case for altering it.  It seems reasonable to provide for the education of children up to 18.  After that, as in the case of other categories, scholarships should be sufficient to provide for further education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The paucity of pensions and allowances was referred to by Deputy MacEoin.  These are, in fact, the rates normally paid for disablement or <Col N="546" /> death, and they have been increased on a number of occasions.  They were increased in 1949, 1953, 1956, 1959 and 1960.  Judging by that, Deputies can rest assured that at any time in the future when allowances like these are being increased, these people will share in the increases.  They do not compare unfavourably with the provisions made for people following other callings.</P>

Everybody knows that if we pass this four years now, it will be there forever.  The only reason it is in this Bill is because it was incorporated in previous legislation. I do not think it is unreasonable to put the onus and obligation on the applicant to prove that the disease is attributable to a particular kind of service.

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before subsection (3), page 9, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an amount is expended on improvement, structural alteration or repair of a dwelling, being improvement, alteration or repair commencing on or after the 1st day of April, 1961, and</P>
      <P>(b)  apart from this subsection, there would, having regard to paragraph (c), (d) or (e) (as the case may be) of subsection (2) of this section, be a lawful addition to the basic rent of the dwelling by reference to the amount,</P>
      <P>there shall be no lawful addition to the basic rent of the dwelling by reference to the amount unless the landlord has, at least fourteen days before the commencement of the improvement, alteration or repair, served on the tenant a notice in the prescribed form, or a form substantially to the same effect, containing particulars of the work proposed to be done and the estimated cost thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to remedy a situation which has been the cause of some contention in the past.  The House will recall that in speaking to the amendment which gave effect to the agreement between the Dublin Artisans' Dwellings Company and their tenants, I mentioned that protracted litigation had taken place because of exceptional repairs which the company had carried out on several of their properties.  The position up to date has been that a landlord could come along and carry out exceptional repairs on premises and proceed to procure a special lawful addition to the basic rent in respect of those exceptional repairs.  It was open to the tenant subsequently to go to court and apply to have the special lawful addition either wiped out altogether or reduced, on the basis that the exceptional repairs had not been necessary, but tenants were in the difficulty <Col N="551" /> that the landlord would carry out certain repairs which, because of their nature, it would be impossible for the tenant subsequently to prove were not necessary.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides that where a landlord wishes to carry out this sort of repairs, he must give 14 days' notice to the tenant that he proposes to carry them out.  That will mean that the tenant will then in these 14 days have an opportunity of examining whether the repairs are necessary and procuring evidence to that effect.  It will be open to the tenant if he wishes, for instance, to call in an architect and that architect will then subsequently be in a position to testify as to whether or not the repairs were necessary.  That is all that is involved in the amendment. It is just putting the obligation on landlords to give 14 days' notice to tenants.</P>

      <P>This is sensible. The only thing that occurs to me is that it leaves the position almost dangling in the air if it does not go the stage further of enabling the tenant to serve a notice of objection, if he does not think the repairs are necessary.  I am not making any point on it except to draw it to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before subsection (4), page 9, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a building consists of two or more controlled dwellings and the landlord of the dwellings expends an amount in excess of two-thirds of the aggregate of the basic rents of the dwellings on putting the building into a reasonable state of repair, and</P>
      <P>(b)  all the controlled dwellings benefit directly or indirectly from the repairs,</P>
      <P>the following provision shall have effect for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  a calculation shall be made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) of that subsection of the sum which would be the lawful <Col N="555" /> addition if the building were a dwelling having a basic rent equal to the aggregate of the basic rents of the buildings,</P>
    <P>(ii)  that sum shall be apportioned among the dwellings in proportion to their respective rateable valuations,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the said paragraph (e) shall be taken as having provided, as respects each dwelling, for the sum apportioned to it on the apportionment (and no other sum) being a lawful addition to its basic rent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When this Bill was in the Seanad, we inserted subsection (3) and our object in doing so was to deal with a case where the landlord carried out exceptional repairs on a premises which had a number of dwellings in it; in other words, a multiple dwelling.  There is some doubt about the present position. If a landlord of a multiple dwelling incurs exceptional expenditure on that dwelling, there is a doubt as to whether he can apportion that expenditure over all the tenants in the building for the purpose of the special lawful addition to the rent.  The present position is that it would have to go on the tenant immediately affected.  If a landlord put a new roof on a building, the present position is that the tenant immediately under the roof would have to bear the full brunt of the special lawful addition that would arise as a result of the expenditure incurred in putting on that roof.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad, we wanted to deal with that position and enable that expenditure to be apportioned over all the tenants and we introduced subsection (3) for that purpose.  On further examination, however, it seems that subsection (3) might not achieve what we want.  It is our intention that in that sort of case, the special lawful addition would, first of all, be determined in relation to the total expenditure and then divided up over each of the dwellings.  What subsection (3) does at the moment is this: it divides the expenditure over all the dwellings. It is then possible that a landlord <Col N="556" /> would get the full 15 per cent. on the expenditure applicable to each dwelling. Instead of getting the graduated scale of 15 per cent. on the first £100, eight per cent. on the second £100 and six per cent. on the remainder, he could possibly get 15 per cent. on the entire expenditure.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that It will work out this way: first of all, we take the total expenditure and work out the total special addition in relation to the building as a whole, and then divide that special lawful addition over each tenant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might look into the matter at his leisure.  We all know that common chimney stacks have two sets of valuations on two adjoining houses, but it may well be that where the flue in the chimney stack may be letting water into one house and doubtless in time into another house, it is necessary to repair the whole stack if an enduring repair is to be effected.  Does the term &ldquo;a building&rdquo; cover that type of house or is it restricted to one building subdivided into flats?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says this amendment deals with multiple dwellings.  I think he referred to the question of cost where exceptional repairs were found necessary in the case of a roof of a multiple dwelling, where the tenants may be directly or indirectly affected.  There are many multiple dwellings that have return rooms not under the main roof, and where the tenants in the main portion of the dwelling would find it difficult to show that they were directly or indirectly affected by the repair to the return section of the house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Manifestly, the Parliamentary Secretary must see the flaw here with which I am concerned.  Perhaps it could be made the subject of examination between now and Report Stage.  Let us take a pair of semi-detached houses.  Suppose the repairs to the roof are of such character as to persuade the landlord that the only rational way to deal with the situation is to put a new roof on the house and he does so.  Is it argued that you cannot apportion that between the two houses but must charge the whole cost to one house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No; that is not the point.  Presumably, if there is a terrace of houses and the landlord replaces the roof on the whole terrace, the cost would then be divided and so much would be attributed to each house.  It is a perfectly normal situation.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Rent Acts are concerned with that at all.  Where there is expenditure in relation to one house what I am concerned with in this section is dividing it over the dwellings inside the house. This section is not at all concerned with the situation envisaged by Deputy Dillon.  I do not see any difficulty of apportionment in that case.  I think it is perfectly permissible to apportion it over a row of houses.</P>

      <P>The giving of lectures on dental hygiene in primary schools is primarily a matter for arrangement by local health authorities as part of their school health service.  Having regard to other pressing demands on the services of school health staff, including dental staff, and to the number, 4,800 approximately, of primary schools in the country it would not be feasible for these authorities to arrange for the giving of such lectures as frequently as at quarterly intervals.  However, I should like to assure the Deputy that I regard instruction on dental care to be an essential feature of a progressive public dental service for children and that it is my policy to urge health authorities to make lectures and talks on dental hygiene a regular feature of the school health service.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is, I presume, already aware from my reply to a question by Deputy Ryan, on 24th November, 1960, that my Department has a standing arrangement with the National Film Institute for the showing of suitable health films, including two films on dental care, to children in schools throughout the country.

In order to relieve the position there, I have approved of a proposal to provide a 40-bed maternity unit at the County Hospital and planning of this extension is well advanced.</P>
      <P>In order to afford a measure of immediate relief I asked the Mayo County Council in August last to coordinate the use of the District Hospitals of Swinford, Ballina and Belmullet with the County Hospital so that suitable patients could be discharged from the County Hospital to the District Hospitals for completion of their hospital treatment.

      <P>Before these changes were made observations were taken over a lengthy period on the general pattern of traffic in the street and its vicinity and when the changes were being effected consideration was given to (a) the convenience of the bus-travelling public and (b) the necessity for increasing the flow of traffic through the street.</P>

      <P>It may be that the beneficial effects of the new arrangements are not yet fully apparent because they have been accompanied by changes in the general traffic pattern of the street due to diversion of traffic caused by road reconstruction work which has been going on for some time in streets in its immediate vicinity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the foot and mouth disease epidemic reached serious proportions in England and Scotland about three weeks ago, my Department has taken every possible precaution in order to ensure that the infection would not be brought into this country.  As indicated in the Deputy's Question, one of our main fears has been that infection could be brought in by persons in the livestock or meat trades coming in here from England or Scotland, or by Irish livestock traders returning from visits to those countries.  For that reason, we have on a number of occasions in the past three weeks published press and radio announcements to the effect that such people should avoid travelling, and we have urged them, if they must travel, not to bring in here any clothing or footwear which they use in the course of their business in England <Col N="575" /> or Scotland.  The Livestock Trade Association has co-operated with the Department in making similar requests to its members.  The Department has asked the proprietors of every livestock sales yard and market in the country to make announcements on this subject during the course of their sales.</P>
      <P>My Department also instituted a system whereby every person arriving in this country by boat or plane must present to an officer of the Department on landing a card indicating whether in the previous 28 days he has been on land or premises infected with foot and mouth disease, on a farm or in contact with farm animals, or associated with the meat trade.  The Department has on duty at all ports and airports a very large staff of officers whose duty it is to examine individually the card presented by each incoming passenger and to disinfect the footwear and clothing of any passenger about whom there is any doubt.</P>
      <P>I am considering measures which will enable us to deal more drastically with any used clothing or footwear being brought into this country which may be a source of danger.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider it reasonable to make an Order effective on the 24th November in connection with the shipment of horses, considering that it takes so long to make arrangements for the purchase of space on a ship, and for planning the itinerary of the ship, in addition to the purchase and examination of the horses for export?  Is he not prepared to facilitate people who found themselves so committed, who have a ship coming along possibly in a couple of days' time, and who cannot put the horses on now under the new regulations? If they had been able to do it today they would have done so, but they could not have anticipated the position in which they find themselves today regarding these commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that hardship and inconvenience have been caused to sellers of livestock and cattle dealers at fairs in South Kerry because of the closing of branch lines.</P>
      <P>No area in South Kerry or elsewhere has been abandoned by C.I.E.; they have replaced uneconomic rail services with adequate and satisfactory road services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though the matter is one entirely for C.I.E., I have been furnished by the Board with a report on a complaint that they did not promptly remove all cattle from the fair held at Kenmare on 26th September, 1960.  On that occasion the output of cattle was some 2½ times greater than at the corresponding fairs in 1958 and 1959.  When <Col N="579" /> it became clear that the number of lorries allocated to the fair would be insufficient to cope with the unprecedented number of cattle additional lorries were obtained.  The first lorry load left the fair at 9 a.m. and the last at 8.5 p.m.  I am assured that in the particular circumstance of this case just as much delay would have occurred if the railway service were still in operation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that taking account of C.I.E.'s own road services, and of the road services of licensed hauliers, the transport facilities in the area are adequate and that there is, therefore, no need for the measures urged by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a supplementary question by the Deputy on November 17th, the responsibility for the compilation of the electors lists rests on the Registration Officer.  If he should decide to take the steps indicated in the present question, the cost involved would become part of the registration expenses and the question of recoupment in accordance with Section 12 of the Electoral Act, 1923, as amended, would be considered.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that there are particular circumstances this year which are beyond the control of the registration officer, in that the committee inquiring into electoral reform issued a report when the checking of residences was partly completed in Dublin, would the Minister not provide money to ensure that everybody who becomes 21 between September and April will get the same treatment as their more fortunate neighbours who were not inspected until after the change?</P>

There also enters into it the difficulty which gave rise to the problem in the first instance, the question of the time factor.  It becomes even more pressing in relation to the proposal implied by the Deputy in his question.  Further, I understand that Dublin Corporation are about to consider what should be done.  In the interval, I do not think I could do anything further except to reiterate that every possible means and publicity are being used to bring the matter to the notice of the persons concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, where it arises. But this problem is not one that has arisen elsewhere other than in Dublin. That it arose in Dublin is due, I take it, to the fact that it is a big problem to compile the register and, therefore, work on getting the names brought up to date would have to start earlier than elsewhere.  It is unlikely that this problem, even in diminished form, will arise in any other registration unit.

Is the Minister further aware that persons with much higher valuation got the additions, including a person who has two holdings already, one of which he was setting, and who has since acquired another holding?

      <P>This amendment seeks to make provision for a landlord who may have incurred expenditure prior to the passing of the Bill but who may not have got the lawful addition by that time. As the Bill stands, it is possible that such a landlord would be denied the 12½ per cent. increase in rent to which he would be entitled, even though he had not got the special lawful addition.

    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that where a landlord, after the passing of the Bill, incurs exceptional expenditure and seeks a special lawful addition in respect of that, the 12½ per cent. increase on basic rent which this Bill is giving him will cease to apply if he does not take a grant.</P>

      <P>It is not anxiety to get people to take grants but to protect tenants from very heavy increases.  As the Deputy is aware, the special lawful addition is related to the expenditure. If the grant is deducted, the amount of special expenditure on which the lawful addition is calculated will be all the less.  Therefore, the special lawful addition itself will be all the less so that once the grants are given&mdash; and it is desirable the landlords should avail themselves of them&mdash;increases in rent will not be very great.</P>

      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, there was a feeling abroad that the grants available were there for the individual type of landlord and that it was not considered by the Department of Local Government or the local authorities as being good form for a substantial company to apply for these grants. That view was very widely held.  I want to get it clear from the Parliamentary Secretary that the purpose of the policy he is now implementing is that he disagrees that that urge was there.</P>
      <P>There were undoubtedly cases where some landlords did not apply for the grant for the purpose of getting a higher rent.  In my own view, that was utterly stupid and short-sighted because what they would have got under the grant would have been far more than they would have got under the excess provision in the rent.  It did not work out that way at all. There was undoubtedly some criticism of companies who did apply for grants of this nature.  Undoubtedly, there was some belief that there was a certain type of means test in relation to these grants.  It seems a little unfortunate that what I describe as the decent landlord in that respect should be penalised as against the landlord who was merely availing of a loophole to charge an excessive rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  We are concerned to give the landlord a 12½ per cent. increase to compensate for the increased cost of repairs.  In those cases where exceptional expenditure has been incurred, landlords have already got very satisfactory increases. The average return on an expenditure of £300 has been approximately 10 per cent. on the money invested.</P>

It is not for me to debate housing policy, but, as I understand the position, these grants are made available to anybody who wants to take them.

      <P>This is really a drafting amendment. The object of it is to bring the provisions of Part III of the Bill dealing with the adjustment of basic rents into line with the provisions of Section 8. It is desirable that the same principles should be followed by a district justice when he is provisionally determining rents under Section 21 as he follows when adjudicating on an application by a tenant to have his rent reduced under Section 8.  If the tenant of a small controlled dwelling were to apply to the court under Section 8 to have his basic rent reduced, the criterion which the court would apply in determining whether the basic rent was unduly high would be the levels of comparable Chapter I basic rents, that is, the 1914 basic rents of premises which have remained under control since 1915 and which are related to 1914 levels.  This amendment will ensure that the same criterion will be adopted by the district justice when he is deciding on an application for a provisional reduction of rent under Part III.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1) (e), page 20, to delete &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; in line 17 and substitute &ldquo;equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There has been a departure from the terminology used in the 1946 Act. The words &ldquo;equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects&rdquo; have been omitted.  The words used in the section which it is desired to amend are, &ldquo;reasonably suitable to the residential and other needs of the tenant and his family&rdquo;.  The effect of the subsection could be that where alternative accommodation is being made available the words &ldquo;reasonably suitable&rdquo; could be interpreted to mean suitable as regards the physical needs of the family in regard to the number and size of the rooms.  The rent of the alternative accommodation might be beyond the means of the family.  The words used in the amendment are &ldquo;equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects&rdquo; which would cover not only suitability for the family from the physical and health points of view but also from the point of view of their social needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can visualise that a tenant might be living in a four-room dwelling and that the landlord might seek possession of that dwelling.  The dwelling might consist of four rooms but might be in a street of fairly good <Col N="602" /> standard in an attractive area and in a desirable position.  It could be argued that the term &ldquo;reasonably suitable&rdquo; could mean that, in order to gain possession, the landlord merely had to provide another four-room dwelling even though the tenant might consider the area to be unsuitable or even though the rent might be in excess of the rent of his existing premises.  The words &ldquo;equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects&rdquo; provide greater protection for the tenant than the words in the subsection.</P>
    <P>I understand that the wording in this Bill is different from the wording in the 1946 Act.  What is the reason for the change?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the words &ldquo;reasonably suitable&rdquo; do not afford to the tenant the protection the amendment seeks to give him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a change in the wording but I do not think Deputy Larkin need have any fears about it. First of all, may I point out that we are dealing in this amendment with the case of a man who is seeking premises for his own occupation? Secondly, there is the overriding consideration of reasonableness.  The court will all the time have regard to whether the thing is reasonable or not. If Deputy Larkin reads subsection (5) of the section, he will see that it is as follows:</P>
      <P>In making a decision, pursuant to paragraph (e), (f) or (g) of subsection (1) or paragraph (c) of subsection (4) of this section, as to the suitability of alternative accommodation, the Court or the appellate court (as the case may be) shall, in particular, take into account the proximity of the accommodation to the place of work of the tenant and of the members of his family residing with him, the means of the tenant and of the members of his family residing with him and the extent and character of the accommodation.</P>
      <P>So that, broadly speaking, we are providing much the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the change is purely that it was recommended by the Conroy Commission.  The Conroy Commission, <Col N="603" /> having examined carefully the existing requirement of alternative accommodation felt that alternative accommodation would be adequate if it were reasonably suited to the residential and other needs, say, proximity to work and so on, of the tenant, and was available in controlled premises. I want to make it clear to Deputy Larkin that the alternative accommodation found for the tenant must be in controlled premises so that the rent will still be a controlled rent.  If all these things in mind, are kept in mind, there is nothing really to worry about. We are giving very adequate protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am not entirely satisfied with the explanation. Controlled rents might vary from district to district.  The question of proximity to work is mentioned all right but there is the question of the rent and there is the other factor which is considered rather important, that is, the area, the type of neighbours and so on.  I would suggest that the words in the amendment would give the tenant better protection than those in the subsection.</P>
      <P>I am aware, of course, that the subsection applies only to a case where a landlord is seeking to acquire a residence for his own living accommodation but in doing that, he is, in effect, seeking to put the tenant out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but he is seeking to put the tenant out.  The tenant and his family may have lived in the dwelling for a considerable period. They are the subject of very serious disturbance from the point of view of children, social position and so on. Consequently, they are entitled to the maximum protection we can give them in this matter.  I would submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that the words in the subsection do not provide the maximum protection and are not as satisfactory as the words used in the 1946 Act.</P>

    <P>I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned in this matter <Col N="604" /> to be fair in dealing with this aspect of the problem.  I would ask him to bear in mind that there may be a very wide difference from the point of view of desirability between two houses having the same type of accommodation with regard to the number of rooms, toilet facilities, water supply and so on.  There may be no difference between the houses from the point of view of accommodation but there may be a very wide difference between them from the point of view of desirability as a residence. There may also be some difference in the rent payable.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that this matter arises only when a landlord is seeking to obtain possession of a dwelling for his own occupation and, in doing so, is seeking to put a family out of it, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that the family it is being sought to put out should get the maximum protection.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin has not persuaded me that I am wrong in what I am doing.  This is one of these thorny questions of trying to keep the balance fairly between two groups of people.  On the one hand, there is a man who has a house and wants to live in it himself&mdash;not an unreasonable request&mdash;and on the other hand, there is a tenant who has lived in that house probably for a long time and who has built up his position in the community and so on and we are going to disturb him.  Where does the balance of equity lie?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel that the old provision was much too onerous on landlords.  The Conroy Commission felt that very strongly.  The old wording was to the effect that the alternative accommodation must be equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects.  We are changing that to make it somewhat easier for the landlord to get possession of his own house for his own occupation, but, if we are doing that, we are hedging it around with all sorts of safeguards for the sitting tenant and I think they are being adequately protected. There is the overriding consideration of reasonableness; there is the question of suitability and proximity <Col N="605" /> to employment; and the rent is still being controlled.  Then the court must have regard to the capacity of the tenant to pay.  If you take the thing as a whole it is a fair compromise between the two conflicting interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary appears to be leaning towards the side of the landlord.  We seem to be talking in terms of the landlord who has owned a dwelling for quite a long time and then requires this dwelling for his own use and, if he does not get it, there will be hardship inflicted upon him.  However, for the purposes of this subsection a landlord can well be somebody who has come into the dwelling only a relatively short period before seeking to occupy it.  A landlord may seek to purchase a dwelling which is subject to the control of this Act.  He may decide to purchase it because it is a dwelling which would be suitable to him but he may have purchased it only 12 months previously.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the tenants may be a man, his wife and a growing family.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that in these circumstances it is only reasonable to provide the maximum protection. There are many examples, especially in the city of Dublin, of tenants of controlled dwellings being in residence for 30, 40 or 50 years. They are married, have reared children; perhaps the children have gone away and there is only the man himself and his wife.  Then the landlord comes along and desires to occupy the house.  These people have lived in these circumstances for 30 or 40 years and have always kept the house as best they could.  They are then told the Court will give possession but they are not being given the same type of protection they would have had under the 1946 Act.  These groups of people are those in which I am particularly interested.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will look into this between now and the Report Stage to see whether it is possible to deal with it in some other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 40:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (i), page 20, line 47, to delete &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;six&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a relatively simple proposal. The subsection provides that where the tenant must surrender possession of the dwelling the court will be empowered to grant them compensation. The basis on which compensation will be granted is set out in a number of subsections, but in subsection (1), the subsection with which we are concerned, there is a limitation of three years allowable to the court. Even though the court might well feel that an amount of compensation in excess of that allowable would be fully justified, the subsection prevents the court's awarding any more than the equivalent of three years.  I propose that the court should be given a little more latitude so that where this application for compensation is made and where it appears to the court there are justifiable grounds for awarding the compensation the court will not be limited to three years as set down in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point about this is that whatever is put into the section is likely to become a minimum, standard figure.  This figure of three years was arrived at by the Conroy Commission after careful consideration and consulting with its professional advisers, valuers, solicitors, auctioneers and the other people who are intimately connected with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will happen is not that any landlord who is suffering from financial stringency will get possession of his house at all.  All that will normally happen is that he will sell the house to the tenant.  If he sells the house to the tenant at the moment he will get nothing near the market value. The ultimate effect of this provision will be that he will sell the house to the tenant and get the market value of the house less three years gross <Col N="607" /> rent.  I imagine that is the way it will work out.</P>
    <P>That is no hardship on the tenant. He is still getting the house at considerably less than the market value. Any building society will advance him up to the net figure he will be paying the landlord because the difference between the market value and what he will actually pay the landlord would normally be the deposit which he would put down if he were buying the house from a stranger.  If you look at it in that way the provision in the section is a reasonable one.</P>

      <P>That being so, there is far more likelihood of an agreement without recourse to court proceedings as the Bill is than as the Bill would be with the amendment.  With the amendment the landlord would be inclined to stand back and insist on a court decision.  With the provision as it is in the Bill there is a better chance of agreement being made outside the court and these three years being utilised, as one might describe it, as the deposit the building society would require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Do these two subsections apply only in the case where the landlord is proposing to sell the premises?</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the compensation is given to the tenant for a particular purpose in a case where the landlord has recovered possession of the premises.  It is given to compensate the tenant, to some extent, for his particular problem arising from the loss of the premises.  In this case, the landlord does not require the premises for his own occupation.  He may require it because of economic circumstances, but the necessity for disposing of the dwelling has nothing to do with the tenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin realises the difference between paragraphs (i) and (j).  In paragraph (i), it is a maximum of three years and in paragraph (j) it is a minimum of three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that, but in regard to paragraph (i), I am suggesting that the maximum should be increased. It is hardly correct to say that if the maximum period in paragraph (i) is increased to six years, that must necessarily be the amount the court will award, because the paragraph says &ldquo;... such sum as the Court considers proper...&rdquo; The figure of three or six years is not an arbitrary one.  The only arbitrary thing about the paragraph is that the court is prevented from awarding more than three years.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the court will use judgment in dealing with applications under this paragraph.  It is most unlikely, in a case where there are not very strong grounds for awarding compensation in excess of three years, that it would be awarded automatically. Where the tenant could only show that he had some reasonable claim in justice and equity to be awarded a sum equivalent to six months', twelve months' or 18 months' compensation, he would not be awarded compensation equivalent to six years.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is purely to give the court greater latitude in this regard.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will not advance the argument that, if the period of three years is extended to six years, in any case where the applicant goes before the court for compensation under this paragraph, the court will automatically award compensation at the level of six years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they not always biassed in favour of the underdog, and properly so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to deal with that aspect because there are many occasions on which I am afraid I would be inclined to take the contrary point of view.  After all, this paragraph deals with a case where a landlord complains that he is suffering from financial stringency and, arising from that situation, he feels called upon to seek the permission of the court to acquire the premises.</P>
      <P>I would be inclined to take the view that the landlord or his representative would go to the court and make the case that he requires permission to acquire the premises for the purpose of selling it because of his economic situation.  In those circumstances&mdash; whatever Deputy Sweetman says about the court being in favour of the underdog&mdash;they are hardly likely to agree automatically that the major sum which they can award by way of compensation should be awarded to the tenant.  In those circumstances, I think they would be inclined to go near the major amount permissible, only if a substantial case were made on behalf of the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all the amendment seeks to <Col N="610" /> do.  In such a case, it seeks to give the court the necessary leeway to award more than is provided in the paragraph, having regard to the fact that the possession of the premises is sought arising from the fact that the landlord is suffering from some financial stringency.  In that case, I would not anticipate that a justice sitting in court will examine the matter from the legal point of view only, but also from the point of view of equity and justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there will be odd cases where the tenant will give up possession to enable the landlord to sell and will seek alternative accommodation. In that case, he goes off armed with three years' gross rent, with three years in which to look around for suitable alternative accommodation. He can live rent free for three years.  The most likely thing to happen, and what I am sure will happen is that the landlord will want to sell&mdash;and the section specifically indicates that he must want to sell the dwelling because &ldquo;... is suffering financial stringency which arose since he acquired the dwelling and which can be relieved only by recovering possession of the dwelling with a view to its sale...&rdquo;&mdash;and he will sell to the obvious man, the tenant.  What we are deciding in fixing the number of years is how much below the market value of the premises are we to let the tenant buy it for.  As Deputy Sweetman clearly pointed out, that is what we are deciding.  We have decided that three years' gross rent under the market value is being reasonably fair to the tenant.  If we moved it up to six years, I think we would really be putting our hands in the landlord's pocket, particularly in view of the fact that, in this case, he is suffering from financial stringency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think there are two points.  There is no provision that the dwelling must be sold only to the tenant.  He can endeavour to obtain permission to sell it to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the economics of the thing, the tenant is the obvious man to sell to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="611" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such provision. In many cases, the obvious person is not necessarily the tenant. In addition, I come back again to the point that this is a permissive provision which does not say that the landlord must pay compensation amounting to six years.  It says that the court can award compensation up to a maximum of the equivalent of six years.  Again, surely we in this House must accept that a justice sitting in court dealing with an application of this nature under this Bill will deal with it in a judicial capacity and not on the basis of automatically handing out an award.  That appears to be the Parliamentary Secretary's main objection to my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2), page 21, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) In considering whether it is reasonable to make an order for the recovery of possession of a controlled dwelling, the Court shall <Col N="612" /> have regard to the extent, if any, to which the conduct of the landlord contributed to the existence of the grounds upon which he relies in support of his application for recovery of possession.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is an attempt on our part to deal with something to which Deputy Sherwin drew attention on the Second Stage.  He pointed out that an unscrupulous landlord can create a very difficult situation for a tenant if he refuses to accept rent.  In the lower income group, it is likely that the tenant will not save that rent but rather spend it.  People in that position live from week to week.  Suddenly, the landlord comes along with a demand for a large amount of arrears and can get an eviction.</P>
    <P>There will always be unscrupulous landlords and they will always invoke the aid of tricks of one sort or another to defeat the purposes of the Acts but we have tried in this amendment to do something about this matter. I do not know how effective the amendment will be but, at least, it is an attempt to deal with the situation. Of course, I might say that in Section 33 the Bill gives power to the court at any time after the issue of a decree for possession and before its execution to grant a further stay or stays of execution as it thinks proper.  It is also proper for me to say at this stage that the real protection for the tenant in such a case is to save the rent and have it available for the landlord when he demands it.  Alternatively, as I pointed out on Second Stage, the tenant can get a postal order and post it to the landlord.  I do not imagine it would be very likely that a landlord would refuse in those circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the Parliamentary Secretary, am not so certain how far this can help but at least it gives something to the tenant to argue about when it comes to a court issue.  A very large number of tenants are simple people.  They have less than a primary education and do not understand the law.  They are afraid of the very thought of the courts. Landlords take advantage of them <Col N="613" /> especially when there is a new landlord, the fellow who has no right to act in that way because he bought the premises with all its faults.  Nevertheless, in most cases that I have come across these gentlemen set about refusing to accept rent.</P>
      <P>The practice has been that they wait four or five months and then they suddenly demand the rent or they actually go to court and pretend they were never offered the rent.  The tenants I speak about live from week to week, as has been admitted, and in particular if they are people who like a jar they are not going to save money and keep it for the landlord.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Landlords have got away with it.  That is the part I do not like.  People who may owe £10 or £15 will gladly get out rather than face the court.  Being a local councillor, I have those people coming to me looking for houses and asking what is going to happen.  They have nowhere to go and they have been told they must leave.  I am acquainted with this problem.  At least, they now have something to argue about if they can get witnesses or evidence that, in fact, the rent was refused.  Perhaps, the landlord might lose in the end and only get his money back at a bob a week.  It is some help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised another question at the same time that I raised this one.  I do not know whether this section helps me at all.  I refer to the case&mdash;I do not know whether I am entitled to make the point&mdash;of landlords making <Col N="614" /> tenants caretakers.  That is a stunt which I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary has covered in the Bill at all.  People are engaged as caretakers without any work as such. They pay rents.  They are some kind of a caretaker.  They are asked to pay excessive rents.  There are many cases where people were asked to pay excessive rents just because they complained about rents in the court.  The landlord took action and possibly because they are only there as caretakers succeeded.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Caretaker&rdquo; ought to be defined some way in the Bill.  A caretaker is a person who does not pay rent.  He is a person who has certain work to do as a caretaker.  Where there is evidence that such a person is actually paying rent, he is certainly not a caretaker. Could the Parliamentary Secretary help me in that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not strictly in order on this amendment.  There are special provisions for caretakers' agreements and possibly the provisions could be used unscrupulously to avoid the provisions of the Acts.  As I said on the Second Stage, the only real defence I can offer Deputy Sherwin is that if all the facts are put before the court, no court will tolerate that sort of conduct by a landlord. If the circumstances are fully explained, the court will quickly see through the device and I am quite certain will deal with it accordingly.</P>
