      <P>May I direct the attention of Deputies to the fact that there are 148 questions on today's Order Paper and also to the fact that there are 21 questions eligible for to-morrow's Order Paper?  I know I can count on the co-operation of Deputies in disposing of all those questions within the allotted time but may I suggest, with some trepidation, that the best way to co-operate is to restrict to the utmost the asking of supplementary questions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when and in what terms the Board of Aer Lingus pressed on him the decision to proceed with the transatlantic air development referred to by him in Dáil Éireann on the 15th July, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board of Aer Rianta, which is the policy making body, sought and obtained an interview with me on 29th October, 1957. My reference to Aer Lingus in this connection was intended to be a reference to Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>The Board informed me that they had been giving exhaustive and serious consideration to the possibility of starting an Irish transatlantic air service and had come to the conclusion that, in the light of the circumstances then obtaining, a decision should be taken to establish the service, and that the time was appropriate for such a development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main considerations which had led the Board to this conclusion were (i) that valuable time had already been lost and that it was desirable to establish the service before the jet <Col N="4" /> age should begin, (ii) that the introduction of the new 3rd class fare on the North Atlantic presented a new opportunity to get the Irish service into operation and (iii) the prospect of a leasing arrangement which would obviate the need to purchase aircraft at a time of rapid obsolescence of the aircraft then in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it now transpires that no view was pressed upon him by Aer Lingus&mdash; that he meant to say Aer Linte&mdash;does the Taoiseach not think it might have been appropriate when his attention was first drawn to this misprint in the Official Report to have informed the Dáil that there was some misunderstanding?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At an informal meeting held in Paris on 14th January, the twenty Governments members of, or associated with, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation decided to constitute themselves, together with the European Economic Community, a Committee for purposes of examining problems of commercial policy of particular concern to them. This examination is to cover, as a matter of priority, the relationship between the European Economic Community and the European Free Trade Association, with due regard to the commercial interests of third countries and the principles and obligations of the GATT.</P>

    <P>The Committee so constituted has not yet met and it is thus not possible at this stage to say anything about its discussions.

      <P>The Government have taken no specific decisions concerning the transfer of Departments or sections to provincial centres.  Certain proposals in this connection are under preliminary consideration, but it would be premature, at this stage, to give particulars of those proposals.</P>

      <P>The external assets of the Central Bank, the Associated Banks and Departmental Funds at 31st December, 1959, amounted to £210.2 million.  The corresponding figures for the years 1956 to 1958 are given in Table 16 of the Report of the Central Bank for the year to 31st March, 1959.</P>
      <P>With regard to external assets in private hands, there is not sufficient information available on which to base a reliable estimate of their magnitude. Indications are, however, that there was no fall in the value of such assets in recent years.  The current value of external assets is, of course, affected by the earning capacity of the individual companies, etc., in which the assets are held and by the prevailing rates of interest.</P>

I would agree if there were many figures but there are only three.</P>

      <P>The annual estimates of the number of persons at work in the main branches of economic activity have been getting progressively less reliable as the 1951 census, from which the basic data are derived, become more remote.  The stage has now been reached when it has been decided to discontinue the publication of the estimates in the detail hitherto provided, pending the next comprehensive census of population which will be taken next year.  It can, however, be stated that it is estimated that the number of persons at work in agriculture, forestry and fishing in 1959&mdash;including farmers, farmers' relatives and wage-earners&mdash;showed a reduction of 9,000 on the previous year.  This trend has been noticeable for a number of years past.  The estimated number of persons at work in manufacturing industry in April, 1959, was 3,000 greater than that in the previous year.  As I told the House in answer to questions on 9th December, 1959, the trend of employment generally in industry was markedly upwards during the remainder of 1959.</P>
      <P>Between 1926 and 1936 the total number of persons aged 14 years or over at work increased by 1.2 per cent. and between 1936 and 1946 it decreased by 0.6 per cent.  It is estimated that between 1946 and 1956 the total number at work declined by 5.3 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 to 27 together.</P>
      <P>The detailed investigation of the &ldquo;City of Waterford&rdquo; incident, which has been conducted by my Department with the assistance of Nautical Surveyors of the Department of Transport and Power, has now been completed, and the findings will be issued within a week.  If the investigation shows that any further improvements are desirable in the regulations governing the shipment of horses, they will be made.</P>
      <P>The official investigation which has just been concluded was an independent inquiry on behalf of the Government into an incident that occurred on a ship owned by a private commercial company.</P>
      <P>The Diseases of Animals Acts are the statutory authority for regulations concerning the transport of horses. The maximum penalty provided for offences under the Acts is £100.</P>
      <P>As regards the setting up of a commission of inquiry, as suggested in Question No. 25, the points mentioned at (a) and (b) of that question were covered by previous inquiries.  As to (c) of that Question, it has already been made clear that the issue is not the economic value of the export of live horses but the principle that, subject to proper safeguards such as already exist in our case, it is legitimate to carry livestock by sea.  As regards (d), the Government have already intimated that it is their policy to encourage and facilitate the slaughter of horses in this country, by competent firms, for export as dead meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may add that I would welcome a proposal for an inter-governmental investigation by an appropriate international organisation of the conditions under which horses are transported by <Col N="18" /> road, rail, sea and internal waterways in all countries.  I know that an investigation of this kind would disclose that few countries take such satisfactory precautions in this regard as Ireland, and the Government have no hesitation in saying now that they would accede to any international convention that might result from it.</P>
    <P>With regard to Question No. 27, I have seen a newspaper report of a statement alleged to have been made by an Irish veterinary surgeon who, so far as I can ascertain, did not examine the horses prior to shipment.  I have complete confidence in the integrity, competence and independence of judgment of the veterinary staff of my Department, whose duty it is to inspect all horses presented for shipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government are under certain obligations to take all the sugar produced by their colonies.  In order to ensure distribution at prices which the British manufacturers and consumers of sugar can pay they have established a levy system on these imports.  If the sales conducted by the central body make a loss then the levy is chargeable; if the sales make a profit there is a repayment of the surplus to the importers; that has happened only once since the system was set up.  As far as imports of sugar into this country are concerned, my information is that our sugar factories are working to full capacity in the production of sugar and the import of sugar is engaged in only when the Irish producers are not in a position to supply the beet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the question relates to all voluntary hospitals other than the specialist maternity hospitals.</P>
      <P>Following upon negotiations with representatives of the medical staffs of the Voluntary Hospitals, arrangements were made for the remuneration of visiting medical staffs who provide institutional services under the Health Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of services provided for in-patients in a teaching hospital, health authorities pay to the hospitals a capitation charge of £1 Os. 8d. a day.  This includes a sum of 2s. 8d. which, under the arrangements referred to, is transferred in each hospital to a pool for subsequent distribution amongst certain of the visiting medical staff on a basis fixed by themselves.  The supplement <Col N="28" /> paid to the non-teaching hospitals is 1s. 8d. a day.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;pool&rdquo;, as mentioned, is divided between certain of the parttime visiting medical staffs of the hospitals.  Full-time staffs, paid on a salary basis, and anaesthetists, radiologists and pathologists are not remunerated from the &ldquo;pool&rdquo; but are paid by the hospitals from their revenues, derived as to more than 50% from payments by local authorities for &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; patients and as to more than 25% from the Hospitals Trust Fund as &ldquo;deficit&rdquo; payments.</P>
    <P>In respect of specialist services for out-patients at approved specialist clinics, the arrangements provide generally for the payment by health authorities to the hospitals of a fee of £4 4s. Od. per session of 3 hours. Radiological and Pathological sessions are paid for at the rate of 4½ guineas per session of 3 hours.  These fees are for the remuneration of the specialists who provide the services.</P>
    <P>The sums paid to the hospitals under the foregoing arrangements are paid in the first instance from local authority funds.  Fifty per cent. of the amount involved is subsequently recouped to the health authorities from the Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>The information readily available to me in regard to the amounts received by hospitals as contributions to the &ldquo;pool&rdquo; relates only to the hospitals which participate in the scheme of grants from the Hospitals Trust Funds towards revenue deficits.  The aggregate amounts received by those hospitals in the year 1956 was £76,331.  In 1957 it was £139,367.  In 1958, it was £151,393.  The figure for 1959 is not yet available to me.</P>
    <P>Information as to the amounts paid by local authorities to voluntary hospitals for the remuneration of specialists conducting out-patient clinics for patients receiving specialist services under the Health Acts is available only in respect of financial years ending on 31st March.  The aggregate amounts paid in respect of the years ended 31st March, 1957, 1958 and 1959 were £57,000, £68,900 and £74,800 respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No general means scales are prescribed for the purpose of determining eligibility for medical cards.  Health authorities are bound to take into consideration all the circumstances of each individual applicant for a medical card.  I understand that in certain areas, including Kerry, in order to facilitate the early issue of cards in clearly eligible cases, income scales have been drawn up and cards are issued automatically where the income is within these scales, but where such a scale exists and an applicant, by reference to the scale, is not automatically regarded as eligible for a medical card, the case is fully examined on its merits and the final determination is made in the light of all the relevant circumstances.</P>

    <P>Prior to September, 1958, the assessment of means, for unemployment assistance purposes, where such were derived from the occupation of land, was based on values for stock, crops etc., adopted in 1940.  Since September, 1958, up to date values as are used for old age pension purposes, have been applied to the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state in respect of the past twelve months the number of old age and other State pensions payable by his Department which were reduced in amount or stopped because the pensioners won a prize in a foot ball pool, raffle or other like event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question arises from a complaint which appeared in a Dublin evening newspaper on 25th January last.  In this connection it should be stated that the law requires that where a person who is in receipt of any pension which is subject to a means test receives an increase in means that person's means must be reinvestigated and if the reinvestigation discloses that the person is not entitled to the rate of pension in payment the pension must be reduced or revoked, as the case may require.  There is some doubt, however, as to whether the letter referred to could have been based on an actual case.  An old age pension could not be reduced by the figure of 7/6d. per week mentioned in the letter, since old age pension <Col N="36" /> rates are graded in 5/- steps and a 27/6d. per week pension could only be be reduced to 22/6d. or 17/6d. or 12/6d. per week or else revoked entirely.  Neither would it be reduced for a period of two years or any specific period.  A decision reducing a pension would operate indefinitely until superseded by a later decision. The sum of £90 7 6d. mentioned in the letter would be treated as capital for the purpose of assessing means and the annual value of this sum would be £3 5 4d.  This would not operate to reduce a pension of 27/6d. per week unless the pensioner had other means exceeding £49 4 8d. per year.</P>
      <P>A special enquiry made to ascertain the information sought by the Deputy indicates that there were four cases of the kind during the past twelve months, all relating to old age pensions. In one case the pensioner, who had been in receipt of the maximum pension of 27/6d. per week won £2,000 in a Sunday newspaper Crossword competition.  The annual value of this sum, £178 15 Od., exceeded the statutory limit, £104 15 0d., for receipt of a pension and accordingly the pension was revoked by decision of the local pension committee.  Details of the other three cases are not available at present but it is presumed that they would have followed a somewhat similar course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates of social assistance and benefit payable by my Department have never been determined by reference to the level of public transport charges.  Rates of assistance payments are fixed, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, by relation to the amount which the Exchequer can reasonably be expected to provide.  The level of contributions by employers and employees is, of course, an important determining factor, in the case of benefit payments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that as recently as August last increases estimated to cost the Exchequer £1,313,000 a year were granted in old age pensions, widows' non-contributory pensions and unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason why the Parliamentary Secretary should be debarred from establishing increases. <Col N="38" /> Is it not a fact that due to the gross inadequacy of the allowances to-day of the unemployed and old age pensioners, and other similar dependent groups, the unemployment groups in particular, they are on the verge of destitution?  These increased charges will mean greater hardship on them and on their children.  The Parliamentary Secretary should take steps to see that the allowances are increased in order not to increase that hardships.  There is no reason why he should not take a new step.  He need not be bound by precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A payable order drawn on the Paymaster General is in the <Col N="45" /> from of a receipt and as such requires the payee's signature.  It is not proposed to change this convenient method of securing receipts for payments from public funds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the rise in interest rates in Britain and the Six <Col N="46" /> Counties following the increase in Bank of England rate from 4% to 5%, an increase in bank deposit rates was necessary here to safeguard the availability of funds for domestic needs and this in turn necessitated an adjustment of lending rates.</P>
      <P>I was duly informed of the increases proposed and considered them reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether the two increases mean a decrease or an increase in the overall position or do they approximately equate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>Replies have been received from virtually all local authorities in response to the invitations issued by the Taoiseah and the Minister for Local Government for suggestions relating to State investment in public projects of economic merit. Proposals received up to the beginning of October, 1959&mdash;numbering about 150&mdash;have been examined and replies have been issued to the local authorities concerned.  Proposals received subsequently&mdash;numbering several hundreds&mdash;are still under examination. These figures include proposals of a minor nature and also general suggestions submitted by more than one local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of the proposals has so far been sanctioned.  A substantial proportion does not satisfy the criterion that capital expenditure productive of <Col N="47" /> competitive goods and services must receive a greater priority than formerly in the public capital programme.  Some relate to schemes which either had previously been rejected or were already under consideration by the Departments concerned.  In other cases a final decision cannot be given until more extensive investigations have been completed or further information has been received.</P>

      <P>Members of the House will have learned with profound regret, during the recess, of the death of Deputy Joseph Hughes.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although we were all aware that Deputy Hughes had been in failing health for some time, his unexpected and untimely death came as a shock to us.  He had, in fact, not long before <Col N="80" /> his death, resumed his public duties after an illness.</P>
    <P>The late Deputy entered the Dáil in 1948 for the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny and was re-elected at each General Election since then.  He was also a member of the Carlow County Council and of the Carlow Committee of Agriculture and Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>Himself an extensive farmer, he was widely recognised as an authority on agriculture in all its aspects.  Of a gentle and unassuming disposition, his contributions to our deliberations here were expressed with conviction and a sincerity of purpose which won him the respect of all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes was deservedly popular, and his unexpected death will be deeply regretted on all sides of the House.  His constituents will miss his unstinted devotion to their interests and welfare, but it is, of course, by his widow and children that his loss will be most keenly felt.</P>
    <P>I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to his family an expression of our deepest sympathy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>As the Bill is of a somewhat technical nature, I arranged for the circulation of an explanatory memorandum which I trust Deputies have found helpful. The purpose of the Bill is two-fold. Firstly, it provides for the conferring on the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the power to regulate by order minimum deposits and maximum periods of payment in connection with hire-purchase and credit-sale transactions and the information to be given in relation to goods advertised or displayed for hire-purchase or credit-sale. Secondly the Bill provides for the amendment in a number of important respects of the Hire-purchase Act, 1946, which deals with the private rights and liabilities of parties to a hire-purchase or credit-sale agreement and the powers of the courts in legal proceedings arising out of hire-purchase transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the more important economic phenomena of recent years has been the increase in the use of consumer credit facilities.  This development has been most pronounced in the case of hire-purchase transactions.  While the consumer credit system was firmly established in this country before the last war, it is only since that time that it has attained its present proportions. Figures compiled by the Central Statistics Office show that in 1938 there were 64,000 hire-purchase and credit-sale transactions the total retail value of which amounted to £1.5 million, while in 1958 the number of such transactions was 242,000 and their total retail value £15.6 million.  Thus, between 1938 and 1958 there was a four-fold increase in <Col N="85" /> the number of transactions and a ten-fold increase in their retail value.  Part of the increase in retail values as compared with 1938 is due to the decline in the value of money in the interval.  Nevertheless, it is clear that the use of the facilities of hire-purchase has increased very considerably.</P>
    <P>Hire-purchase benefits the community in a number of ways.  It increases the demand for a wide range of consumer goods and other products and in that way promotes production and employment.  It enables persons of limited income to furnish and equip their homes and to acquire many of the conventional necessities of life, the purchase of which would otherwise have to be deferred.  So long as hire-purchase facilities are utilised sensibly and prudently there is no doubt but that the system is a useful one and that in normal conditions it can be beneficial to the national economy.  This may be particularly true when the facilities are availed of for productive purposes as, for example, the purchase of industrial machinery and plant which will add to the national income and provide useful employment.</P>
    <P>Hire-purchase has now become such an important economic and social factor in the life of the community that I am sure that the House will agree that it is essential that the conduct of this business should continue to be subject to regulation so as to ensure, firstly, that the economic consequences of hire-purchase spending can be controlled in the national interest and secondly, that the practical operation of the system as between the owner and the hirer of goods is fair and equitable.</P>
    <P>While the growth of hire-purchase plays an important part in the development of the economy it can give rise to serious problems.  Hire-purchase credit provides spending power and creates a demand for goods and services.  To the extent that the demand is for imported goods, it is capable of having an adverse effect on our balance of payments.  Furthermore, if hire-purchase were to encourage and facilitate expenditure on consumer goods, the quantum of national savings available for productive investment <Col N="86" /> would be affected.  It is very desirable, therefore, that, if circumstances at any time so require, the Government should have the power to control those undesirable consequences of hire-purchase.  Part II of the Bill provides, therefore, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may make Orders regulating the volume of business transacted by prescribing minimum deposits and maximum periods of payment.</P>
    <P>This Part of the Bill also authorises the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prescribe, by order, the information to be given in relation to goods advertised or displayed for hire-purchase or credit-sale.  The interests of hirers or buyers in this matter are already protected to some extent by Sections 3 and 4 of the Hire-purchase Act, 1946, which provide that, before a hire-purchase or credit-sale agreement is entered into, the hirer or buyer must be informed of the cash price of the goods.  The agreement itself, which must be in writing, must show the cash price and the hire-purchase or total purchase price of the goods. When advertising and displaying goods for sale on hire-purchase and credit-sale terms, many traders do not show the cash price or the hire-purchase or total purchase price but merely the amount of the weekly or monthly instalment.</P>
    <P>I think that it will be agreed that the practice of showing only the amount of the instalment induces many people to buy goods without knowing the exact cost or the full extent of the commitments being entered into.  I consider, therefore, that it is very desirable that, at the time that goods are displayed or advertised, consumers should be made aware of the price at which the goods may be purchased for cash, the total hire-purchase price and the number, frequency and amount of the instalments payable.  The powers contained in Part II of the Bill will enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to require that information of this kind shall be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>The Hire-Purchase Act, 1946 was primarily designed to protect the interests <Col N="87" /> of persons who hire or acquire goods under credit-sale agreements. As I mentioned at the outset, it establishes and defines private rights and liabilities between owners or sellers, and hirers or buyers of such goods, and it provides guidance for the courts in legal proceedings arising out of hire-purchase transactions.  A detailed examination has been conducted by my Department of the present state of the law on this subject and of the manner in which the Act of 1946 has been operating.  There have been consultations with various interested parties including hire-purchase companies, and an opportunity has been taken to obtain the views of the Judiciary and Court officers who have specialised experience in this field. The investigations which have been carried out show that a number of changes in the law are desirable and it is with these changes that Parts III and IV of the Bill are concerned.</P>
    <P>Under existing law, if a hirer defaults in payments under a hire-purchase agreement and the owner takes legal proceedings for the recovery of the goods, the court may make an order giving the hirer an opportunity of paying the outstanding balance of the hire-purchase price by instalments.  If, due to some misfortune such as illness or unemployment, the hirer falls behind in the payments under the court order and, fails, or is unable, to apply to the court for a variation of the order before his default occurs, he may lose the goods, even though at the time he may have paid off practically all his indebtedness.  It is clearly inequitable that the hirer should lose the goods in such circumstances, and provision is, therefore, made in the Bill to enable the court to vary its order at any time before the goods are actually returned to the owner in accordance with a delivery warrant issued under the order.  The hirer is also being given the right, which he does not at present possess, to pay the outstanding balance of the hire-purchase price instead of handing over the goods in compliance with a delivery warrant.  This provision will not interfere with the rights of the owner to recover whatever costs <Col N="88" /> and expenses may have been awarded to him by the court.</P>
    <P>In ordinary civil proceedings, if a defendant admits a plaintiff's claim and makes an offer of payment which the plaintiff accepts, judgment is entered in the court often without any query and without attendance of the parties.  This cannot be done at present in hire-purchase cases, since the Act of 1946 provides that an order giving relief to a hirer may be made only at the hearing of the action after the court has regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case.  These precautions are not really necessary where the owner has accepted the hirer's offer of payment and, accordingly, it is provided in the Bill that in such case the court may enter judgment forthwith.  This provision should help to speed up court procedure and reduce legal expenses, to the benefit of both hirers and owners.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1946 renders void any clause in a hire-purchase agreement authorising an owner to enter the hirer's premises for the purpose of seizing the goods which are let under the agreement.  The Act furthermore provides that, where one-third of the hire-purchase price has been paid, the owner cannot enforce any right to recover possession of the goods except by action in the courts.  It has been represented by the hire-purchase companies that these provisions operate harshly.  It has been said that there have been cases in which a hirer acquired a motor vehicle or tractor under a hire-purchase agreement and subsequently abandoned it in a place or in circumstances in which it was subject to serious damage or depreciation.</P>
    <P>The hire-purchase companies claim that in such cases they should have the right to recover possession of the vehicle&mdash;and, if it is necessary for that purpose, to enter the premises of the hirer&mdash;pending legal proceedings under the Act of 1946.  The Bill seeks to provide an equitable remedy for owners in cases of this kind.  It includes a provision to enable the owner to insert in a hire-purchase agreement a clause permitting him to enter upon any land or premises of the hirer <Col N="89" /> (except a dwelling house or a garage or other similar building attached to a dwelling house) for the purpose of recovering possession of a vehicle let under the agreement.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, moreover, that, even where one-third of the hire-purchase price has already been paid, the owner will, in circumstances of the kind mentioned, be entitled to recover possession of the vehicle without a court order and hold it pending the making by the court of an interim order for the purpose of protecting the vehicle from damage or depreciation. Two safeguards are being provided against the abuse of this provision. Firstly, where an owner recovers possession of a vehicle he will be obliged to make an application to the court within 14 days for an interim order as to the custody of the vehicle.  If he fails to do so he will be deemed to have recovered possession in contravention of the Act of 1946, and this means that the hirer will be released from all liability under the relevant agreement and may sue the owner for payments already made on foot of the agreement.  The second safeguard is that if, on the hearing of the action, the owner fails to satisfy the court that in all the circumstances of the case he was entitled to seize the vehicle, the court may award damages against him in respect of the recovery and ensuing retention of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>In the Circuit and District Courts, most civil proceedings founded on contract may, at the election of the plaintiff, be brought before the court in the circuit or district in which the contract is alleged to have been made.  Many of the hire-purchase companies are situated in Dublin, and it is generally claimed by them that the contracts which they enter into are made in Dublin, irrespective of where the hirer resides.  As a result, many actions involving defendants resident in country areas are brought in the Dublin courts.  It would be more proper that they should be disposed of in the local courts since the expense involved in defending such cases in the Dublin Metropolitan District would often be substantial in relation to the value of the goods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> I am satisfied that it would be more equitable that all Circuit Court and District Court proceedings arising out of hire-purchase transactions should be taken in the area in which the hirer resides and the Bill provides accordingly. By virtue of Section 20 of the Hire-Purchase Act, 1946, this is already the position in regard to actions brought in the District Court for the recovery of possession of goods let under hire-purchase agreements.  Lest there should be a tendency to bring actions in the High Court, the Bill also provides that the High Court may of its own motion remit to the Circuit and District Courts any proceedings which, in its opinion, ought have been commenced in those courts.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the Bill to revise the limits on the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts in relation to hire-purchase actions.  It is now being provided that the Circuit Court shall have jurisdiction in all such actions where the hire-purchase price of the goods involved, or the amount of the claim for arrears of rentals, does not exceed £1,000 and that in the case of the District Court the limit of jurisdiction shall be raised to £100.  This revision of the limits of jurisdiction is justified by the decline in money values since 1946.</P>
    <P>In hire-purchase actions taken in the High Court and Circuit Court, if the defendant does not enter an appearance or defence, the owner is entitled to apply for judgment in the office of the court.  I am informed that, in the majority of cases, defendants do not enter an appearance or defence and judgment is given in the office of the court usually for the recovery of the goods, arrears of rentals and costs. This procedure of judgment being given in the office of the court deprives the defendants of the reliefs to which they may be entitled under the Act of 1946. In the circumstances I am satisfied that the law should be altered so as to compel owners to apply to a judge in court for judgment in default of appearance or defence.</P>
    <P>As a result of the recent examination <Col N="91" /> of hire-purchase law by my Department, it has come to my notice that in some hire-purchase actions in recent years judgment has been entered in the office of the court against both the hirer and guarantor&mdash;against the hirer for the recovery of the goods and arrears of rentals due at the date of commencement of the action and against the guarantor for the outstanding balance of the hire-purchase price, with costs against both hirer and guarantor.  Such judgments are obviously inequitable; but it seems that, when an action is not defended, the office of the court has no option but to enter judgment for the full claim made by the owner.</P>
    <P>Under the Hire-Purchase Act, 1946, if a hirer defaults under a hire-purchase agreement and determines the agreement by returning the goods to the owner, his liability for further payments to the owner is limited to payment of the arrears of rentals due at the time of termination of the agreement and, in addition, payment of any sum which it is necessary to add to the amounts already paid and the arrears due in order to make up one-half of the hire-purchase price.</P>
    <P>When the Act of 1946 was passed it was clearly the intention of the Oireachtas that, whenever a hire-purchase agreement is determined, the most that the owner should be entitled to recover, in addition to the return of the goods, is the arrears of rentals due plus whatever additional sum is needed to make up one-half of the hire-purchase price.  It was the view of the Oireachtas at the time that one-half of the hire-purchase price represented reasonable compensation to the owner for the use of the goods and depreciation while they were in the possession of the hirer.  I think it is only equitable, therefore, that, in any case in which the goods are returned to the owner, the liability of a guarantor should be exactly the same as the liability of the hirer. Provision to this effect is made in the Bill.</P>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to an abuse arising out of the sale by dealers of goods which they have acquired under hire-purchase &ldquo;stocking&rdquo;<Col N="92" /> agreements.  Cases have occurred in which dealers have sold to the public goods so acquired, without first discharging the &ldquo;stocking&rdquo; agreement. The purchaser found afterwards that he was not the legal owner of the goods and, in order to acquire title to them, had also to pay the hire-purchase company concerned.  It is proposed to amend the law so as to safeguard the purchaser in a case of this kind.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the Bill, the need for which, I feel sure, will be generally accepted.  In the preparation of the measure, I have tried to hold the balance as fairly as possible between the parties to hire-purchase transactions, and I hope that I have succeeded in so doing.  I feel sure that the general principles underlying the Bill will commend themselves to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures which the Minister gave of the number of hire purchase transactions in 1938 and 1958 indicate that, so far as this country is concerned, hire-purchase has been a post-war development.  While we were familiar with the use of this system of credit in other countries before the war, the phenomenal growth of the system in this country has been a post-war development.</P>
      <P>I wonder if particulars are available in the records kept in the Department of Industry and Commerce of the goods covered by hire-purchase transactions or if there is a record available in the Department or in the Central Statistics Office which differentiates between the types of goods and the value in each case?  Undoubtedly, the growth of hire-purchase transactions in the post-war period has been very considerable, even allowing for the depreciation in the value of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true that much of the credit advanced for this form of transaction is being used for the acquisition of certain forms of equipment which people could not afford otherwise, such as house furnishings and articles of that sort and for the purchase of plant and machinery for agricultural and other productive purposes, I should imagine that quite an amount of the credit so advanced has been in directions which <Col N="93" /> encourage people to avail of credit without considering the consequences. For that reason, although hire-purchase is generally recognised as a method of finance that has come to stay, some views, that might be regarded as old-fashioned, on this method of finance may not be entirely out of place.  I should be glad if the Minister in the course of his reply would furnish particulars of different categories of goods, machinery and equipment.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes in the Bill are, in the main, improvements but there are certain matters to which I should like to refer.  Under Section 6 details of the agreement may be required by the Minister and certain forms of agreement may be insisted upon.  Section 9 authorises the Minister to appoint authorised officers and it appears that the section is rather widely drawn.  Very considerable powers are granted to these officers to enter premises, carry out inspections, demand whatever particulars they require, and generally carry out investigations with a view to ascertaining the terms and the conditions under which goods are sold under a hire purchase agreement.</P>
    <P>The penalty provided for under this and other sections is a maximum fine of £100 for a person convicted of an offence or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both a fine and imprisonment.  The powers granted in Section 9 are somewhat excessive and there should be a safeguard guaranteeing the owner of the premises certain rights.  These should be incorporated in a provision which would prevent any undue exercise of authority by an inspector unless on foot of an authorised warrant.  While the inspector has to have a warrant, this warrant is a different warrant from the search warrant which a Garda officer would have and these warrants are used only in certain specified cases.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the growth of hire purchase has stimulated very considerably the demand for goods and has generated a whole new business that was not there before this form of finance came into existence and certainly before it was used so widely <Col N="94" /> as in recent years.  It may well be there will be a far greater increase in hire purchase transactions in the future.  For that reason, it is desirable in the public interest that power should be taken to specify, as is taken in Section 6, the terms and conditions under which agreements are made.</P>
    <P>There are many cases of simple people, people unused to reading agreements or interpreting them, who find themselves in a position in which they undertake commitments and subsequently find these commitments beyond their capacity.  Having paid a certain number of instalments, they discover that the hirer either can reclaim the goods in question or, alternatively, the person who has gone guarantor and who in many cases is no better qualified than the purchaser has been committed to repayment or to refund the balance outstanding on the transaction.</P>
    <P>It is important, therefore, that full publicity should be given to the rights of people entering into these agreements. When the Act is passed, the Minister should avail of the opportunity to publicise the fact that agreements must be in the prescribed form, notifying intending purchasers, or people who are about to enter into these transactions, of their rights under it and of the obligation on people entering into a hire purchase agreement to have the agreement in the prescribed form.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that it was because of the fact that a number of these transactions took place in areas outside Dublin it was proposed to make the change in Section 25, and that that applied to both the Circuit Court and the District Court.  As I understand the Section at the moment, the High Court has power to remit a case under this section.  Is the High Court prevented from doing that where the transaction exceeds £1,000? In Section 19, as I understand it, the present Circuit Court limit of £1,000 is retained.  There is no limit in Section 25.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House generally will welcome this Bill because it has been realised that the <Col N="95" /> 1946 Hire-Purchase Act had certain infirmities which have been brought to light since then, as the hire purchase business developed as it has undoubtedly developed since that year. In so far as this Bill takes up the slack in the 1946 Act, it has everything to commend it.</P>
      <P>Of course, there were some noticeable deficiencies in the 1946 Act.  The first was the fact that there was no power to compel people in the hire purchase business to display the cash price of the article in addition to the amount which would be paid weekly or monthly on the article if it were purchased on the hire purchase system. There was one case in this city of a firm from across channel which set up business here on a most elaborate scale and produced a bewildering collection of the most attractive goods in the main shopping centre.  You looked in the window but you could not find out what was the complete price of any article in the window.  A ticket was attached to the goods saying: 1/- a week, 2/- a week, 2/6 a week, 4/- a week; the amount varied according to the type of article.  It is tempting human nature too much to expect people, seeing these very attractive rates of weekly payments on an article in a window and feeling that they need that commodity at home, to exercise all the prudence they ought to exercise both in relation to the quality of the article and their financial resources with the result that you find people in these circumstances temporarily dispossessing themselves of any judgment as to whether they are getting good or bad value for their money.  They are attracted by the article, by the simplicity of the payments and the moderateness of the charges.  They buy, and continue to buy other articles with the result that they find a heavy draught on the family income which eventually means that they either default in the payments with the subsequent loss of the articles or that they run into debt in other directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the provision in the Bill which compels the seller to show both the hire purchase charges and the cash value of the article will enable <Col N="96" /> the person to give some consideration to the value of the articles in a shop window and not allow himself to be misled into buying the articles merely because the price per week or per month is made to look small.  By concealing the cash value, an article displayed for purchase under hire purchase conditions could work out to be very expensive and not worth the money ultimately paid for it in hire purchase repayments.  Stopping that gap in the 1946 Act is doing something which is desirable; it will prevent people being carried away by their enthusiasm into buying something which they badly want simply because they think they can pay the low price at which it is exhibited.</P>
    <P>So far as hire purchase generally is concerned, I am strongly in favour of it.  I have listened to people say that they do not like it. It has its deficiencies but on the whole it is a good system.  You need prudence and commonsense to operate it so far as the purchaser is concerned. I think that hire purchase enables people to acquire good household furniture which they would not acquire if they had to save the cash for it but if they are to acquire good furniture and other attractive articles they must steel themselves to paying the instalments regularly.  They must also see that they do not, by means of hire purchase, involve themselves in financial obligations in excess of their ability to pay.  If people are prudent in what they buy, hire purchase can be a good scheme and a very valuable economic stimulant in so far as encouraging families to improve their domestic living standard is concerned, and also as a means of creating a demand for manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>The system is not without its disadvantages. If you take a range of articles costing between £50 and £100 and compare it with similar articles made outside the country which are somewhat dearer it is quite possible that hire purchase conditions may react to the disadvantage of the Irish produced article.  If you take an Irish article costing £80 and compare it with an imported article costing £90, you may find that, by a system of attractive <Col N="97" /> terms over a longer period of years and no deposit, the imported article is offered on more advantageous terms than the Irish article.  You may get a longer time to pay for the imported article and that facility may, in fact, overcome any tariff or protection given to the Irish article.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is right when he says that uncontrolled hire purchase can easily create a position here in which foreign manufactured articles would be in an advantageous position as against home produced articles by setting the period for the hire purchase repayments for the imported article over five years while the period for the repayments on the Irish produced article would be only two or three years.  I am glad that the Minister is taking power in the Bill to deal with a situation of that kind and to regulate the type of payments to be made.</P>
    <P>In Section 6 of the Bill, which is probably the most effective section of it, the Minister is taking power to regulate and control hire purchase, sale on credit and the letting of goods. One of the things that the Minister may do is to state the minimum deposit to be paid.  Trying to make provision for the payment of a deposit is a pretty intricate business.  When it was attempted in connection with the methods adopted by the previous Government to deal with the heavy importation of goods, it was discovered that quite a number of people who wanted to sell goods on the hire purchase system, where a substantial deposit was required as a condition of the sale of the goods, managed to dodge the requirement by lending the purchaser the amount of the deposit as a separate transaction.</P>
    <P>Where a deposit of £2 or £3 was required and where the buyer was unable to deposit the money, the seller came along to him and said that he would lend him the money privately. The seller trusted the buyer with the amount of the deposit and possibly hoped to get it back in some other way.  I think it is very difficult to close that gap as far as deposits are concerned. We tried the method of saying that, if the deposit was not paid, the whole transaction was invalidated as <Col N="98" /> far as the seller was concerned and that he could not enforce the agreement if he tried any &ldquo;fiddling&rdquo; in respect of the deposit.  I mention that matter to the Minister so that consideration can be given to it when he comes to regulating the matter of deposits.</P>
    <P>I notice that Section 6 gives the Minister power to make regulations to control the hire purchase of goods.  Is it intended to control the hire purchase of services as apart from goods?  One can see from the newspapers that one can now go to America for a holiday by paying a deposit on a ticket and paying the remainder over a certain period after the holiday.  Is that hire purchase?  It is very like it.  I do not know if there is any agreement of the hire purchase type but such holidays are not goods and the money cannot be refunded afterwards if you do not like the holiday.  If services of that kind developed, is it intended to class them as hire purchase or does the Department propose to stand aside from that and let it take its own course?  The Minister might well ask whether goods in this Bill mean that only goods as such are covered, and whether services, professional services, medical services, transportation charges, or services of that kind, are likely to be caught or whether they are to ride free while the Bill itself relates only to goods.</P>
    <P>I think, generally speaking, however, the Bill will be welcomed as a means of closing some gaps the closing of which has been shown to be necessary by experience.  I think the House will generally approve of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies in welcoming the introduction of this Bill which if anything is overdue.  We have had no amending legislation in relation to hire purchase since 1946.  In view of the very substantial growth in this form of finance in the purchase of goods which has taken place since, it was desirable that the legislation now before us should come for consideration at this stage. The Bill is described as the Hire-Purchase (Amendment) Bill, 1957, which indicates that it was drafted <Col N="99" /> nearly three years ago.  For some reason which the Minister probably can explain the final draft has been delayed since then.  I feel that, in the final drafting, if certain anomalies which came to light since have not been taken into account, it is possible the Bill might be now brought up to date.</P>
      <P>As far as can be understood, this measure is generally welcomed by the public at large and substantially agreed to by the hire purchase finance companies operating in this country.  As everybody knows there has been a very substantial increase in the past few years in the number of hire purchase companies that have come into this business particularly in the past year.  I understand that about 13 very large hire purchase companies are now operating here a hire purchase business in a variety of high priced articles and that possibly 12 more are carrying on activities in the hire purchasing of furniture and small articles in the line of domestic appliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one particular respect the Bill is very satisfactory.  I refer to the provision in relation to the decision of issues that might require to be dealt with by the Court.  Under the 1946 Hire Purchase Bill, in the case of court proceedings, cases had to be listed in the District Court area proper to the head office of the finance company involved and not where the hirer resided.  That position created considerable hardship in the case of hirers who found themselves in the unfortunate position of having to go before the court on the application of the hire purchase company. It was particularly so in small transactions such as bicycles and smaller articles where the amount involved was only £15 or £20.  The cost that would necessarily have to be incurred in coming to Dublin where most of these cases were heard appeared to the hirers to be such that whether or not they had a good case, they were inclined to let the decision of the court be made without appearing. They decided it was too expensive to put in any evidence that might be relevant to their case and let the decree be given by default.  I am quite <Col N="100" /> sure the Minister's Department was inundated with complaints in that connection and as a result the Minister thought fit to rectify that anomaly now whereby future court proceedings will have to be instituted in the areas where the defendants live.  That gives an opportunity to every hirer who finds himself brought before the Court for possession of the goods to come before the local court, make his defence and get an equitable decision.  I understand that the hire purchase companies have taken some objection to this particular section.  They make their case that from their point of view it does not give them the protection they have under the previous Act.  If the hire purchase companies have a grievance in that respect I suggest the Minister might look into that point and see if the difficulty can be surmounted.  In the case of larger transactions, where the amount involved is pretty substantial, my view is that the powers under the previous Act were not too detrimental to such hirers.  In some cases they would actually prefer to have the hearing of the case carried on at a court in the city as a result of which there would possibly be less local publicity about the transaction.  However we cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>To meet the hire purchase point of view in this connection it occurred to me that the Minister could provide in the Bill that where the hirer was agreeable to have the Court proceedings, whether District Court, Circuit Court or High Court, taken in the area where the hire purchase company carried on the business it might meet the position.</P>
    <P>With regard to the supervision of hire purchase, in the past we all know that there was none at all.  The power the Minister now seeks to have under the Bill of some degree of supervision is a step in the right direction.  Officers are to be appointed to obtain whatever information the Minister requires to enable him to review the position from time to time and to make any consequent orders accordingly.  The power the Minister has reserved under the Bill to make orders with regard to the deposits to be paid and the period of repayment is a very satisfactory way of handling this matter. <Col N="101" /> The hire purchase interests feel that that power could best be utilised if it was put into the Bill and exercised from the terms of whatever would be included in the Bill.  I do not think that would be the best way.  The general economy of the country would influence the orders the Minister would have to make from time to time.  In a period of inflation it is obvious that the Minister would have to discourage the development of hire purchase.  The only practical way in which the Minister could keep it under control is by having power to make these orders as and when necessary and have copies of them placed before the House.</P>
    <P>Hire purchase as operated in this country at present is, generally speaking, conducted on straightforward lines.  The rates of interest are, however, considered excessive.  In recent times, owing to the high degree of competition existing among the various houses engaged in hire purchase, rates have been very substantially reduced. In due course, when that competition becomes keener and when the hire purchase companies find they have a very high degree of protection under this legislation, we can look forward to a further general reduction in these rates bringing them into line with the rates of the commercial banks.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the provision made under the Bill for the purchase of goods by a hirer in cases where such goods are already under hire purchase.  A number of cases have appeared in the Courts during recent years where a hirer, who still owed instalments on a particular article, re-sold the merchandise to a new hirer without paying off the outstanding liability.  In such cases the last purchaser eventually found himself faced with a demand not alone for the amount of accommodation he got himself by way of hire purchase but also for whatever amount was left outstanding by the previous hirer.  In a number of cases the new hirer contested the issue but, as the law stood, the decision invariably was that the last hirer had to make good the whole deficiency.  Certain relief is intended <Col N="102" /> under the Bill to a hirer involved in that type of transaction if he can prove he purchased the goods in good faith and took all reasonable steps to ensure they were not the subject of a hire purchase transaction already.</P>
    <P>There was also another very serious defect in the former Bill in regard to what is known as a stocking plan. That was where a finance house financed a trader with a stocking plan whereby he was enabled to stock vehicles or goods in his showrooms under what was known as the stocking plan system.  That system provided that the dealer could hold the goods on show for a certain period but if they happened to sell the merchandise in the meantime they were obliged to notify the company financing the transactions. In a number of cases&mdash;not too many happily&mdash;unscrupulous traders sold the goods and did not inform the stocking plan company that they had been disposed of.  In due course when the payments were not forthcoming and the finance company investigated, they found the goods were disposed of to another person, very often under hire purchase transactions with another company.  They then proceeded to obtain the goods from the new purchaser and a very embarrassing situation arose.  I am glad the Minister has provided for that. In my opinion he has made adequate provision to ensure that in any situation of that kind the person so affected has a reasonable chance of establishing his claim and will not be dealt with too severely.  I have nothing further to say on the Bill at this stage but I am glad it has been found acceptable by the various interests concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that this Bill should generally be welcomed by the House.  The passing of the 1946 Act and similar Acts in England shows that, whilst, as Deputy Norton says, hire purchase can be a very useful thing, it is also necessary to control some of the wily operators who appear on the hire purchase scene.  Therefore, I welcome this Bill which very effectively closes up some of the gaps which were displayed in the 1946 Act as it was submitted to the wear and tear of the <Col N="103" /> wiliness of the operators and the care of the Courts in dealing with the essentials as it came before them.</P>
      <P>For that reason the Bill is to be welcomed, but it is most unfortunate that the Minister should in certain parts introduce some of the most obnoxious and unwelcome sections one could find in a Bill.  Deputy Norton very rightly said that the type of tradition provided for in section 6 is a good thing.  That is quite true but we are here to legislate in regard to such things.  We are not here to give the Minister power to walk away and, at any time he thinks fit, do what we think we should do here and what is our bounden duty.  There is no reason I can see why there could not be put before this House specific provisions in relation to all the matters which are contained in subsection (2) of section 6. In fact, speaking from memory, in the 1946 Act, there were specific provisions which are now being handed over by this House to the Minister or to some administrative back-room boy and he may do as he wishes in respect of the matter.</P>
      <P>I refer to subsection (6) which provides for the giving of information in visual advertisements.  As far as I remember, the 1946 Act did specifically legislate for that and there is no reason why we cannot have such legislation again.  I often think we might as well go home at 4 o'clock on a Wednesday and play Ludo when we are giving Ministers power which really resides in us and which we should be very slow to resign to any Minister.  Therefore, while we are protecting the hire purchaser, we should be very careful in this Bill not to do violence to the rights of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While protecting the hire purchaser, we should also be careful not to do violence to the rights of the individual of the nature involved and foreshadowed by, for instance, section 7, which gives the Minister the widest powers over the citizens of this State, be they operators of hire purchase or otherwise.  The Minister can ask for details of almost any matter of a most <Col N="104" /> secret nature that arises in the course of their operations.  I think that is bad. Something might be necessary but I do not think legislation from this House should tend that way.</P>
    <P>While it is quite true that the necessity for something of that nature might arise in regard to hire purchase, that is no reason why the House should be unduly restrictive on the rights of the ordinary individual.  Mark you, this Bill does not give a person even the right to appeal against the Minister after this assault upon his freedom.  It does not say he can go to any Court. It puts the Minister on a pinnacle above the ordinary man in the street and gives him powers which, I think, rival even the powers of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is even worse&mdash;that persons who are to be appointed by the Minister can walk into any business which is being operated by a hire purchaser and do almost anything. They can take the man's breakfast off his plate.  They can require him to give almost any information they want, no matter how secret it may be or how damaging it may be to his business. Whilst the Bill in a sort of weak way tries to pay lip service to democracy by saying you need not answer any questions that will incriminate you, it does not impose on the gentleman who goes in with the Minister's warrant the obligation to tell the person to whom he goes that he need not answer any question.  The worst criminal in this State is given that opportunity.  A policeman has to warn him that he need not give any answers.  In this case, once the person appointed by the Minister gets his warrant, he can walk in and get as much information as he likes.  He can say in an incidental way&mdash;in fact, there is no obligation at all imposed on him and it would simply be an act of grace for him to do so&mdash;when walking out: &ldquo;By the way, you need not disclose anything you think would be incriminating.&rdquo;  I think that is careless legislation&mdash;it is worse; it is dangerous and I deprecate it.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out also that Section 10 is most injurious.  It <Col N="105" /> purports to say that any information that the gentleman with the warrant gets from anybody may not be disclosed to anybody and goes on in a most ambiguous way in subsection (2) (b):</P>
    <P>the disclosure of information for the purpose of legal proceedings under this Part of the Act</P>
    <P>may be made.  It does not say to whom the disclosure may be made. Under the section as it is if I decided on legal procedure in a hire purchase case, be I the hire-purchaser or the person letting out the goods, I could go to one of these gentlemen with the warrants and he could, as the Bill stands at the moment, make any disclosure he chooses.  I think that again is careless legislation, dangerous legislation. I commend to the Minister the points I have made.  I think he understands the nature of the protest I made. He knows as a lawyer the necessity for protest of that nature.  He knows the necessity for curbing efforts by any Minister, by any Department of State, to rob from this House the rights which they have.  The House should be slow to surrender them to a Minister and the Minister should be slow to ask the House to do so.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the speakers earlier I was reflecting that the processes of democracy are slow and necessarily so and the Minister should not ask the House to do violence to those processes as he now invites the House to do by passing this Bill.  At some later stage I would ask him to investigate the points that I have made. I think some of them at least are worthy of notice and if the Minister were to pay attention to the points made we might get a better Bill.  We would certainly get a safer Bill and we would certainly be&mdash;not setting a precedent&mdash;not continuing the unfortunate tradition that has grown up not alone here but in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a matter of the greatest importance.  The decisions we take here will clearly bind us for many years to come if we go on the precedent established by the Minister of amending the 1946 Act in <Col N="106" /> 1960.  It is very important that the legislative processes of the House should give the best possible legislation especially in an important service which I suppose now affects a great part of the lower and middle income groups in our society in one way or another.  The proof of that, I suppose, is that if one were to go to any of the houses equipped with a garage and take away much of the household equipment and the motor car and other such items bought on hire purchase there would be very little left in the house where the garages are, or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>Hire purchase is only in its infancy, if one takes the American figures. The expansion is only beginning and consequently the pattern it should take is of the greatest importance.  I welcome the Minister's decision concerning the insistence on displaying the total price because the abuses of that which occur are outrageous. The &ldquo;£78 television set for 2/6 down&rdquo; offer and no mention of the total cost in my view amounts, in many cases, to taking money by false pretences. Hire purchase is a new service to which many people have not yet become accustomed and in many of their minds it is an outrage against their ideas of thrift and the general idea there was in the past that one should not owe money.  That has given way to this new idea of it being quite respectable to borrow money. That largely stems, I think, from a sense of greater economic security in our community in which people can foresee conditions under which they can continue to make reasonable payments and for that reason they can enter into commitments with the intention of seeing them out to the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a desirable and inevitable development and the only question now is the pattern in which it should operate.  The difficulty which arises in pleading the case which I propose to put before the House comes from the fact that there is a tendency to use hire purchase for luxuries rather than for what were, or have become, necessities in many houses.  There is the difference between the housewife who wants water heaters, electric fires, <Col N="107" /> equipment, irons and various things for furnishing the house, the essentials for furnishing, household equipment and the other extreme mentioned by Deputy Norton of paying for holidays on hire purchase.  Very few, I think, would be unduly worried about the conditions under which people enter into agreements about their holidays, but in regard to these other matters, the semi-essentials or essentials for a modern standard of living I would ask the Minister to consider this point of view.</P>
    <P>It seems that hire purchase has become the poor man's banker, the small man's banker and it has enabled many people who could not otherwise do it to buy everything from the kitchen necessities right up to television sets and radios, enabling a commercial traveller to buy a motor car and in that way qualify for a particular job. But there is a fallacy in this banking system for the middle income group or for the small or poor man and that is the&mdash;as far as I can see&mdash;uncontrolled rates of interest.  It has been established or accepted that most banks have what most people might consider were not very acceptable or very desirable rates; others might consider they were quite good or at least within reason for many people. Most of the people concerned with hire purchase are people who do not have&mdash;certainly up to recently, they did not have&mdash;bank accounts and could not get loans at the rates which the banks charged, which may be high or low as different people may regard them.  The middle income person cannot get these loans at reasonable rates and has to go to the hire purchase companies in order to buy different goods with which to equip a house.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised to consider this question of interest rates.  I have been told by a Deputy that this is interference with the liberty of the individual but at the same time hire purchase is becoming a great social service and for that reason I think the Government has a right to fix a maximum rate of interest to be charged.  I was interested to read the other day that the hire purchase <Col N="108" /> development has gone as far as Russia and according to what I read in <i>The Observer</i> or one of these papers, the interest rate charged by the Government there is two per cent.  This seems remarkably moderate.</P>
    <P>The Government here established hire purchase long before outside companies in so far as buying houses, for instance, is concerned and in those cases moderate interest rates are charged.  Hire purchase rates should more closely approximate these interest rates.  At the worst, surely the rates charged by the commercial banks are those which the Minister should try to impose in regard to these transactions. It is no good saying, as it might be said, that the commodities bought on hire-purchase are things which people can do without.  I do not think they are in respect of about 80 per cent. of the items at present covered by hire-purchase.  They are not things which the average person in a modern society can do without and, consequently, the consumer should be protected in this way.</P>
    <P>Somebody was talking about the invasion of rights by the enquiries involved and the examination of books. That goes on in relation to income tax.  There may be invasion of rights but that is in order to protect the consumer, the general mass of the public.  In addition to that, of course, the hire purchase operator has a number of protections conferred upon him by this Bill, so that it is not all one way at all.</P>
    <P>The first point is that I do not think the hire purchaser has the right to opt out or refuse to avail of the particular service.  In most cases, people go into these things because they simply have to, because they cannot borrow the money at a reasonable rate and are not of sufficient standing that the banks would lend them money and, out of their own earnings or employment conditions, are not able to accumulate the capital to pay the cost downright.  Consequently, they have no choice but to go to the hire purchase company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moloney suggested competition, whereby we might get a reduction in interest rates.  From what <Col N="109" /> I have seen of the operation of most of these companies, there is no competition. There is no competition in interest rates or, if there is, it is getting to the stage of cut-throat capacity and that will be the end of the competition, and we will have the same position obtaining as we find at present in relation to the petrol companies, the motor car people and the various other price rings, cartels and agreements, which are made between these organisations and are continuing to be made by these organisations, in order to exploit the consumers.  So, I am afraid I do not agree.  There is so much talk here about the advantages of the competitive factor in private enterprise but we see very little of it in action and, in fact, what we find is that the consumer is faced with an interest rate which does not vary from one society to another, from one article to another, and that he has no choice then but to borrow money&mdash;which is all he is doing&mdash;at exorbitant rates.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to lay down that the total price must be clearly displayed so that the consumer knows what he has entered into, then it would be wise to consider establishing that some maximum interest rate must be charged, and no more than that, by the hirer of the goods.</P>
    <P>The service is one of great value and, in view of the Minister's and the Department's relative inertia since the last Bill, it is quite clear that we are not going to get any amending legislation for many years to come.  It seems to me, therefore, that one of the most important points must be the interest rates at which the money is lent.  There should be some limitation.  It is reasonable to impose some limitation because this is a service which affects in the majority of cases the poor people and the middle income group and it is a service which is growing all the time and to which there is, apparently, little or no limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is mainly a Bill for Committee, of course, where the details can be discussed and where we can have our various points of view put forward in order to bring about a better measure.  I except one <Col N="110" /> matter, which is a question of principle, that is, the one stated by Deputy Barrett a moment ago: Why should all this legislation pivot upon Orders to be made by the Minister? Why should not the House get its full freedom of criticism on any important proposal such as will be contained in Orders about to be brought forward? The Minister and his officials must have their minds made up at the moment on the scheme within the framework of Section 6.  That scheme ought to be revealed to the House before we give the Minister the tremendous powers that are being taken here in Part II.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, this House occasionally gives over to Ministers various types of control.  There are two ways in which that control may be regulated.  One is by having the situation that where Ministers get tremendous powers, wide and sweeping powers, by Order, the Order has to be brought before the House and affirmed by the House by resolution passed from time to time.  The lesser form of control is the one in this measure: The Order must come before the House but, unless annulled, is accepted and the annulment has to take place within 21 days, that is, 21 sitting days, after the Order is brought in.</P>
      <P>We have, therefore, an Order with the slighter type of control.  We have an Order, which is effected, as Deputy Barrett said, by an extension of Ministerial powers, very wide indeed, without any indication being given of the necessity for these powers being put into the Minister's hands.  In addition, there is all this question about securing information by all the procedures that certainly up to this have been reserved for search warrants when matters in the nature of criminal matters were thought to be going on in certain premises.</P>
      <P>Finally, there is the penalties section. Anybody who commits an offence under the Act is liable to a fine not exceeding £100 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the whole scheme of Ministerial <Col N="111" /> control, with the lesser type of parliamentary control, having the Order negatived, and finally we have the penalties section.</P>
    <P>In between, the Minister took great powers with regard to furnishing information&mdash;Section 7; the appointment of officers&mdash;Section 8; and then there is what these officers are given also in the way of powers.  I am not sure that I am reading too much into one phrase because some of the Deputies seem to think that we are going to have great extension of control through many men being appointed as authorised people for the purposes of the Act.  I see in subsection (1) of Section 8:</P>
    <P>The Minister may appoint such and so many of his officers as he thinks fit to be authorised officers for the purposes of this Part of this Act.</P>
    <P>I took that to mean that the authorised officers are mainly going to be members of the Department and are not going to be extra people employed or hired for the purposes of this Act.  If it means that the Minister makes an appointment, the person then becomes an officer and then may become an authorised officer, then, of course, there can be a very definite and big extension of the number of people of the Civil Service type who are going to get great powers under the Act.</P>
    <P>There is, as Deputy Barrett pointed out, certain prohibition with regard to the disclosure of information.  That prohibition seems to be a bit one-sided. Deputy Barrett pointed out that while there is prohibition against disclosing information, and contravention of that constitutes an offence, at the same time, subsection (2) of Section 10 ordains that &ldquo;subsection (1) does not apply to the disclosure of information for the purpose of legal proceedings under this Part of this Act.&rdquo;  I presume that means disclosure to the Minister or to those who are going to prosecute the person.  However, I can imagine circumstances in which the person who is being brought up under this Order for refusing <Col N="112" /> to give information would like to see a report that has been made by an authorised officer to the Minister. I am sure for that particular document privilege would be claimed and would, of course, be granted by the courts but this is very one-sided.  That is quite clear, and there has been no case made why these extensive powers, backed by this penalty clause, should be put into this part of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised the question of what he called the giving of credit for holidays.  I do not see how that can possibly come under the sweep of this Act because this Act is related to the 1946 Act.  The 1946 Act, in an earlier section, defined goods and I do not see how what Deputy Norton refers to could possibly be brought under this Act and I hope it never will.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also mentioned there was a possible danger that people who wanted to push the sales of goods not manufactured in this country could give easier terms and that the Minister might be able to prevent that under Section 6.  I cannot see that the Minister will have power under this Bill to stop that.  All he can say is that there must be a minimum deposit, that the down payment must be a certain fraction of the price of the article and the instalment must be not less than or any more than a certain amount.  They cannot prevent one firm giving better terms than what are the ordained terms.  I take it the ordained terms will mean that they cannot go beyond a certain figure.  I think the hope expressed in that regard by Deputy Norton is bound to be falsified.</P>
    <P>Another point is that if an action is taken, it is to be taken in the area in which the contract was made instead of as it is at the moment.  It has to be made where the defendant resides instead of being at the option of the plaintiff, where the contract was made. It is suggested that will mean a saving of expense.  I should like to know how that will save any expense.  At the moment, if a Dublin hire purchase firm takes an action against a person in Cork who has entered into a hire purchase transaction and who has failed to make the required repayments or <Col N="113" /> acted in breach of the hire purchase Order, the case is listed in Dublin and the person in Cork travels to Dublin. Under this Bill the purchaser will remain in Cork but the hire purchase witnesses must travel down to Cork.  I cannot see how there will be any saving but I can see the Cork solicitors may do more business this way than the Dublin solicitors are doing at the moment.  This is only a change as between the legal people in the background who are for the plaintiff and for the defendant, but if the Minister can give me an explanation as to how shifting the area will mean any lessening of expense I would be very glad to hear it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised the question of the transfer of actions.  It is now proposed that the High Court may transfer, of its own motion, cases either to the Circuit Court or District Court.  The Circuit Court jurisdiction is based on a limit of £1,000.  It is scarcely the case that the High Court will ever send to the Circuit Court a case which is outside the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  Does this mean that if the matter in dispute does not involve a sum of more value than a £1,000 that it must automatically go to the Circuit Court, or what will the High Court consider of its own motion when it comes to decide whether an action pending in the High Court is to be sent either to the Circuit Court or to the District Court?  I take it also that Section 28 is not going to be exhausted when an action pending in the High Court has been transferred. Will the Minister explain what he thinks will operate in the mind of a judge of the High Court when he is transferring, of his own motion, a case listed for the High Court which he desires to transfer to the Circuit Court?</P>
    <P>I do not know what will be the position in regard to cost as affected by Section 26.  The Minister said there are many occasions on which hire purchase companies will take actions and there will be no appearance entered, with the result, of course, that there is no defence put up.  I do not know how many such cases there would be&mdash; some percentage was mentioned but <Col N="114" /> it was taken up by my colleague, that a very high percentage of hire purchase transactions are not brought to Court.  If that be the case, the situation is that for some reason or another a person who is made a defendant in a hire purchase case and decides not to contest it, can save some costs by that.  The Minister is now going to put the whole matter into Court and the judgment must be given either by a judge, or if appropriate by the Master of the High Court.  Does that mean that the defendant in the hire-purchase action who wanted to minimise his costs will now have to make some appearance in Court which will mean incurring extra costs?  That will not cheapen the cost in relation to legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton suggested that hire purchase was a good development. Deputy Dr. Browne thinks it is almost a social service.  I believe the reason why there is such an increase in hire purchase transactions in this country is simply because of the situation that has developed in regard to wages and salaries since they continue to be tied to the 1939 level of wages and salaries.  With all the efforts that have been made for many years back, only nominal improvements have occurred in order to bring the purchasing power up to the 1939 level.  So long as those conditions continue, so long will hire purchase become more and more popular.  The wage packet has not increased to such an extent as to give a real advantage to those who depend on the wages and salaries they receive for the service they render to the community.</P>
    <P>We have been told also that hire purchase has now become respectable. The banks are going into it and Deputy Dr. Browne thinks the interest rate should be in some way restricted; if it is going to be restricted it ought to be restricted not in relation to hire purchase only but to bank transactions generally.  I do not know whether the Minister intends that the authorised officers should have the wide control this legislation will give them.  Under Section 9, any authorised officer may do any one of <Col N="115" /> the following things: he may enter and inspect premises at which any activity in connection with the business of letting or selling goods is carried on.  He may take extracts from books, request information in regard to any entries in such books, and so on, and it is made an offence if there is any obstruction.  I presume that will apply in future to a bank which engages in the financing of hire purchase activities, because it would certainly seem to be an activity in connection with the letting or selling of goods.  It would be a rather peculiar performance if in a casual way under legislation like this a power is given for the inspection of the bank books simply because a bank happens to engage a very small part of the funds at its disposal in some type of hire purchase.  In any event, the fact that that comes in Section 10 is another reason why these matters under Section 6 had better be put into legislation.</P>
    <P>The House should know what it is the Minister is proposing to do.  The whole thing is clouded and vague at the moment and the Minister should tell us what Orders he proposes to make under Section 6.  We should know the general terms of the Orders and if he has not thought them out already I would be very much surprised. There must be a fairly good idea in his Department as to what these Orders are likely to be.  I should imagine that if the measure is put through the House by St. Patrick's Day the Orders would be made within a month.  If that is so he should now tell us what they are likely to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few general remarks on this matter.  Being a member of the Dublin City Council it is my lot, usually at this time of the year, to meet thousands of people threatened with eviction because they cannot pay their rents.  From now until the striking of the rate, everybody who owes money will get a court order or an eviction order.  I shall be meeting thousands of these people.  In nearly every case I shall get the story as to why they are in trouble.  I find that in a large number of cases it is due <Col N="116" /> to hire purchase.  They tell me that they have to pay this and that and that they are not able to pay both rent and hire purchase.</P>
      <P>They have other commitments and it is my experience that while hire purchase is a good thing, in so far as it enables people to get furniture and other articles which otherwise they would not be able to buy, thousands of those who avail of it are uneducated people.  Whether we like it or not, a very large number of the working people are uneducated.  Most of them have little or no experience of reading or writing.  From the time they leave school they forget most of what they have learned and when they go to buy something they think in terms of the &ldquo;never-never&rdquo;.  They sign agreements.  I have one here and the print is so small that I could not read it without my glasses.  I find it difficult to read it with my glasses.</P>
      <P>From conversations I have had with those people, I am well aware that, in the majority of cases they do not know what they have signed.  They simply want the article and I am satisfied, from reading the agreement, that it is such that they do not know what it is all about.  We are here, not to protect the &ldquo;wise guy&rdquo; but to protect the innocent.  The &ldquo;wise guy&rdquo; can look after himself.  That is why it is a good thing that there are certain sections in the Bill to prevent people losing their goods if their circumstances disimprove.  We have something like that in the Housing Department of the Corporation.  We agree to reconsider such cases and where a person's economic circumstances have disimproved we give him another house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is into the barrow of the &ldquo;smart Alecs&rdquo; when these poor people get into financial difficulties and for that reason the phraseology in the agreements should be such that even an illiterate person would be able to follow it.  The Minister should have a say in the wording of these agreements and in the manner in which they are printed.  The average buyer does not know, and probably does not care, what is in the agreement.  He is <Col N="117" /> only concerned with getting the article but he is the one who suffers in the end.</P>
    <P>While I have said that hire purchase is both good and bad, I must admit that it leads to deception and even to conspiracy, if you like.  For that reason I am not at all certain that the deposit should be small.  I think that the amount of the deposit should be fair to ensure that there is good faith on the part of the purchaser.  A lot of people buy goods on the hire purchase system and sell them for half the money to pay off somebody else.  I know of people who knew that they were to be evicted for non-payment of rent and who went out and bought an article on the hire purchase and then &ldquo;flogged&rdquo; it for half the money to save themselves from eviction.  Anyone looking for goods on hire purchase ought to be able to produce a clear rent receipt.  I am saying that for the good of the people themselves.  I cannot understand a person who is in debt, and who is not able to pay his way, going out and getting an article on hire purchase. That kind of thing should be discouraged.</P>
    <P>I make those remarks from my own personal experience because I hear these stories day after day.  Advantage is taken of these poor people who signed this agreement in good faith. They are people who think that they can keep up the payments but, being pressed for other debts, find that they cannot do so.  These are the people we must protect.  I say again that people ought to have a clear rent receipt before they are allowed to sign hire-purchase agreements.  The Minister should do something about the form of the agreement because people tell me that they do not know what it is all about.  The Minister should protect these simple people because there are some clever sharks going about and some of them are too clever.  There are other gentlemen who lend people money and charge them 50 and 60 per cent.  The Minister should smash that sort of person. Anyway it is a good or a bad business. I think it has a balance of good.  That <Col N="118" /> is the only way I can describe it because it is my only personal experience.</P>

      <P>Hire purchase is with us.  I do not think there is any use in saying, in this day and age, it is possible even to envisage a situation in which all citizens will be enabled to pay cash for those things they require in the course of their ordinary lives.  Possibly the State itself is one of the biggest hire purchase operators. The financial operation of lending money to people to purchase their houses is hire purchase.  Similarly with regard to the supply of motor vehicles and every imaginable article one can think of.  The procuring of furniture on the hire purchase system encourages people to enter into the commitment of buying a home.  The purchase of a house involves an immediate secondary commitment for the average person starting out in life on a salary or wage, the commitment to purchase furniture, essential kitchen utensils, and so on, as well as decorations for the home.</P>
      <P>In view of the average salary or wage rate paid at present to young people entering upon matrimony and starting life together, it would be utterly impossible for them to provide themselves with these necessaries without the hire purchase system.  Our concern to-day, basically, is to protect people forced to use the hire purchase system against exploitation and unfair and unjust treatment.  Some of the practices of people operating in the hire purchase field in the past have certainly been neither just nor equitable nor charitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister dealt with proposals in the Bill which call for the publication not only of the amount to be paid by a prospective hire purchaser weekly or monthly but also the gross amount of the cost of the particular goods and the cash value of the same goods. Regulations on these lines are essential. It is essential, whether it is made legal by Act of this House or by Ministerial regulation, to publicise these facts.  Specific attention should be drawn to the necessity to publicise them widely and not just to permit people engaged in hire purchase to display in front of an article of, say, <Col N="119" /> furniture &ldquo;2/6d. a week&rdquo; and then, in very small print, on the remote corner of the same notice &ldquo;£20&rdquo; or &ldquo;£30 cash value&rdquo; and a certain amount gross value.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by Order provide for the regulation and control of hire purchase, the sale upon credit and letting of goods or any class or description of goods.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether a matter I want to refer to now is covered by that description but I think it is.  Aside from the practice of selling goods by way of the gradual payments system or &ldquo;payments out of income&rdquo;, which is the term used by many of the more important stores in this city and various towns and cities in the country, and the term &ldquo;weekly payments&rdquo; or &ldquo;hire purchase repayments&rdquo; there is another system which has become a public scandal in the city.  I refer to the operation of the sale by commercial enterprises of goods through an agent.  This system operates on the basis that an agent alleged to be the representative of a particular company offers to intending purchasers not just an article but a docket which, on production by the purchaser to the particular firm involved, entitles him to receive the goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that would not arise on this particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want guidance on this.  I do not think, in this particular case, it should be excluded in so far as the purchaser is obtaining goods on credit.  He may not be signing a formal hire purchase form but he is not paying cash for the goods and the goods are not being paid for at the time of purchase.  They are getting the goods on some promise to pay, over an extended period, for the goods issued by the owners of the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this matter not because a system operates which promotes hire purchase to function in this way but because, functioning in this way, an <Col N="120" /> opportunity is left to unscrupulous people to issue dockets to citizens in difficulties and then to re-purchase those dockets, representing an article, maybe a wireless set, a washing machine, a suite of furniture, a bed or something else, for a fraction of the initial cost.  The purchaser is then left in the position of engaging in a transaction to buy a piece of furniture which he never receives.  He may enter into this arrangement to buy, say, a bed for £20.  He gets the authority to go to the firm and collect that bed valued at £20.  However, he is in temporary difficulties.  The agent, acting on behalf of a huge reputable firm, then proceeds to buy that authority back from him for £5 but the purchaser has to pay the £20.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has he now not got the bed and £5?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that he has never had the bed; they have never obtained the bed, they have obtained authority to acquire the bed for a sum of £20.  Because they are in financial difficulty, they sell that authority back for £5 and they must pay to the person from whom they originally received the docket the sum of £20.  This is a common practice in the city of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it but if he will make inquiries I am sure he will find that there is not a housing area in the city of Dublin in which these alleged agents&mdash;and, mind you, they all act on behalf of fairly substantial firms in the city&mdash;are not engaged in this practice of &ldquo;illegal money lending.&rdquo; I think that is the only correct description to apply to it.  I feel that as long as the eventual purchaser or proposed purchaser of an article is involved, whether they actually possess the goods or not, if they are offered goods on credit whether by way of a formal hire purchase arrangement or by some agent acting on behalf of a company, they should be provided with a formal hire purchase agreement which would protect them.  To my mind, it should be illegal for agents, operating in the <Col N="121" /> manner they do, to offer goods without having such a formal hire-purchase form completed.</P>
    <P>I am fully in favour of arrangements being made under hire-purchase regulations to afford people an opportunity of obtaining essential goods by means of a hire-purchase system and I am particularly interested that any operations which involve, proceed or are based upon a projected sale of goods under the system should be covered by proper regulations and proper machinery.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter because the situation for a number of years has been so serious that families have been cut short of essential food; families have been deprived of clothing because of the operations of unscrupulous people through the system of the check or docket system.  I do not say for one moment that everyone who acts as an agent is unscrupulous, harsh or unfair or indulges in this practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin referred to his knowledge of practices in the city.  I know of one individual case which came to my personal notice only three months ago where a mother with eight young children was facing eviction through arrears of rent and on three separate occasions obtained the money to clear her arrears of rent through this docket system.  Her situation on the last occasion was so serious that she obtained the money through the operation of the system on the basis of a payment over a period of two months of £6 a week.  Almost the total income of the family had to go out in order to repay such a small sum.  I am sure that there are Deputies who are familiar with the position in areas where there is severe unemployment and where a substantial number of our people are living and existing on a low income.  Each and every Deputy is aware that these circumstances exist.  I would suggest to the Minister that having brought this Bill before the House, he should have the situation to which I have adverted considered with a view to protecting the unfortunate people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a Bill that in my estimation represents a social advance.  When an <Col N="122" /> honest person purchases furniture and, through no fault of his own, becomes ill or unemployed, he has the right under this Bill, if pressed by the firm which supplied him with the goods under the hire-purchase system, of going to the courts and pleading his case, thus being saved the humiliation of having the furniture taken away. The majority of hire-purchase firms are decent, respectable firms and we cannot say that they have unduly pressed people over the years.  It may be that a vicious system has grown up in certain areas but in the city and county of Dublin, as I know them, the persons giving out goods on the hire-purchase system want to retain their good name and they have been very reasonable over the years.</P>
      <P>There is one type of character I should like to see dealt with under the Bill.  That is the individual who comes along and tells a person that he will not get any credit unless he gets a friend, perhaps working in the same job as himself, or a friendly neighbour, to act as guarantor.  Directly the friend signs that guarantee, the other fellow who has no notion of paying at all, defaults and the unfortunate guarantor is followed up.  These are the lads I would like to get after and to see punished because I have had that experience with some of them.  Some people in a position to pay will not pay; they want the guarantor, having signed on the dotted line, to pay. These are the type of people who will take advantage of their neighbour, their neighbour possibly existing in shocking circumstances.</P>
      <P>I was on that particular line just before the Dáil adjourned for the Christmas recess.  Before the adjournment an unfortunate man came to me. He was in receipt of £6 10s. per week. Because he happened to have a Corporation house in Ballyfermot, a man working with him asked him to go guarantor for a bicycle.  The first thing this scoundrel did was to sell the bicycle and get out of the country.  I should like to see an extradition order against such people allowing them to be tried and sent to jail.  A friend and myself had to save that unfortunate guarantor from jail by paying the money ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> We also have the case, mentioned by Deputy Larkin, of these agents who go around housing schemes giving unfortunate people goods, encouraging them to take goods, without asking any guarantee but charging exorbitant fees.  Such behaviour is a disgrace. These people have broken up families because sometimes the husband will hear nothing about it, perhaps, until he gets the bill.  These agents are bleeding the people.  I have never come across a decent hire purchase company that did not deal reasonably with people who, through unemployment or illness, were unable to pay for a period, but these agents in the Corporation housing schemes play on the feelings of the people.  A lot of our work is dealing with cases of that kind, trying to bring families together again&mdash;families that have been broken up by these unscrupulous agents.  I shall raise a number of other points on the Committee Stage.  I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess, having listened to the speech of Deputy Burke, there is one thing about which I am satisfied.  It certainly is not the social advantage he claims for this Bill but that there appears to be more voters than agents in county Dublin. When is this kind of thing going to end&mdash;that we must come in here making pleas for people who enter into agreements with their eyes open and, through pride or human frailty or for any other reason, want to enter into those agreements voluntarily and then, when they find they are unable to pay, come to their local T.D. or somebody else to help them out of their difficulty by himself or himself and his friend paying up and saving them from the fate which would be theirs if they had defaulted?  This is a most awful state of affairs.  The implied confession in the speech we have just heard must, in my view, border very closely on a very severe breach of the Electoral Abuses Act. One would imagine, listening to the speeches made here, that hire purchase companies, their agents and canvassers <Col N="124" /> and the sellers of the goods who can put hire purchase at the disposal of purchasers, had all cloven hooves and that they were descending upon a group of holy innocents, certainly in some counties if not all over the country.  Hire purchase is a form of economy that is with us to a very considerable degree and, as Deputy McGilligan said, is not likely to be taken out of the economy so long as wages and salaries are fixed in the manner they are fixed now and related to certain periods in our cost of living assessments.</P>
      <P>I do not see any particular reason for becoming enthusiastic about this Bill.  Neither, on the other hand, do I see any very great reason for rejecting it <i>in globo,</i> but there are certain aspects of it that will require investigation and, moreover, require explanation by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I should like to know, as I am sure the House and the country would like to know, what the reasons for the changes are.  What has happened to make these changes necessary?  If allegations are to be made involving hire purchase companies, those allegations should be made and the people should be informed as to the exact necessity for the proposals contained in the Bill. Then the public might receive it with more enthusiasm and be ready to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reaction from the public yet as to their enthusiasm for the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>If this memorandum is to be any indication of the Minister's desire to make the Bill clear and let the people know what this is about, he will not have anything by way of enthusiasm or rejection.  I want to know like Deputy McGilligan and, I think, Deputy Cosgrave, what the reason is for sending actions from Dublin to the country.  If it is to save cost, Deputy McGilligan has already explained that it will only increase costs.  If it is to give country solicitors in any part of Ireland work which they are not now getting from the hire purchase companies, that will not save cost because what will <Col N="125" /> happen is that the recognised and retained Dublin solicitors for the betterknown hire-purchase companies will employ solicitors in the country as their agents and that will increase the cost, and the cost of it all is going to go on to the purchaser whether the case is heard in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Sligo, or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>What is the reality of this business of bringing cases to the country instead of having them in Dublin?  Is it that it affords an opportunity to the defaulting person in the country to come to the nearest court?  I do not think there is any reality in that because the man that will not defend a hire-purchase summons for default in Dublin in the comparative privacy and secrecy of a court in Dublin is certainly not going into the local district court in front of his neighbours to defend something, and he will not welcome it.  I do not think that the hire purchase companies at all relish a situation wherein they have to sue people for non-compliance with the terms of their agreements.  I think they would do far better if people were sufficiently well off to be able to honour their agreements or fulfil the clauses of their agreements by regular payments.  What advantage will it be to get a postponed agreement for that type of person?  A person who defaults once in hire purchase&mdash;with the exception of one struck down by sickness or temporary loss, and I want to emphasise the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;&mdash; will default again and you are only putting the hire-purchase company to the expense of having the hearing and the further postponement and transfer of title and a further agreement upon which they will have to sue again sooner or later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a reputable hire purchase company is suing a defendant down the country who has no intention of defending the case&mdash;he has got what he can out of the transaction and has no further interest in it&mdash;the plaintiff wants to have that heard in Dublin. Equally, the defendant wants to have it heard in Dublin to avoid the resultant publicity of a country hearing. What right has the Minister or this House to compel the plaintiff to go to <Col N="126" /> the country or to compel the defendant to undergo the sort of publicity he is trying to avoid and, incidentally, the resultant increase in cost?</P>
    <P>I sympathise with Deputy Barrett's view of this legislation by Order and, as Deputy McGilligan said, we would like to know what sort of Orders are contemplated before the House should be ready to give the Minister the very wide powers he seeks whether by way of order or appointment of his officers for the raiding, as it may well be described, of hire purchase company offices, or even commercial banks.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there is no appeal to the Minister but I would not give twopence for a section giving that right of appeal.  If there was to be any sort of appeal it should be an appeal by way of arbitration and if it was to the Minister or to some person appointed by him it should be an appeal by oral hearing, where the person appealing will be able to give his point of view against the Departmental point of view or, what is more important, where he will be able to know what the Departmental view is and how he can overcome it in order to make his appeal successful.</P>
    <P>With those exceptions I think the Bill is completely innocuous in so far as it tends to be a social advance.  It is a denigration of legislative powers; it is an inroad on the rights of individuals and corporate bodies and above all, it interferes with the freedom of either a company or an individual to select his ground and his venue for the hearing of any particular action.  Finally, if you are going to remit a case to the Circuit Court, as the Minister well knows, under the guise of saving expense, let us suppose it is sent down to the Circuit Court&mdash;I shall not say in Cork&mdash;in Galway or in Ballina.  For some reason or another the appropriate witness for the hire purchase company is not able to attend at the particular sitting, say, in November in Ballina or, on the other hand that the defendant who purports to defend by reason of the High Court of its own motion having come to his assistance, moryah, is able to get his case adjourned through illness or some other reason that must <Col N="127" /> be accepted by the Court at that time, then it goes on from November until next February, another hearing, and more witnesses, and something may go wrong again, whereas with the judgment in the office here there is none of that difficulty or delay or recurring expense.  I think the Minister and his advisers would do well to look into the section dealing with these particular aspects of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the hire purchase system with us for a long time and Deputies have had an opportunity of seeing it work.  The system has served a very useful purpose in as far as it was used by the people for the purpose of furnishing houses and acquiring the ordinary necessities of life, but a large amount of the hire-purchase dealings at the present time are concerned with luxury goods.  I cannot help feeling that the Government have been motivated in introducing this Bill by finding themselves faced with a considerable deficit in the balance of payments due to the importation of goods which are manufactured elsewhere, and are sold to our citizens to the detriment of our economy.  Be that as it may, I do not agree that this Bill is the correct approach to the situation.</P>
      <P>I have always been very much against control and very much against bureaucratic interference with the ordinary way of life of our people. Unfortunately, practically every new Bill introduced in this House is a further inroad on the liberty of the individual. If we pass this Bill unamended I think sufficient has been said on this side of the House, principally by Fine Gael speakers, to show that it would be highly desirable that the Minister should give the Bill a great deal of consideration.</P>
      <P>Section 7 provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person who carries on, or is employed in connection with, the business of letting or selling goods shall, whenever so required by the Minister, furnish to the Minister any books, documents, records, particulars, or information in that person's power or control which the <Col N="128" /> Minister may require for the purposes of this Part of this Act.</P>
    <P>Does not that mean that if we pass this Bill the officials&mdash;which I take it means the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;may enter any premises and may enquire into the most intimate and private details concerned with any firm?</P>
    <P>While accepting the fact that there is a temptation under hire purchase for people to exceed their capacity to pay or ultimately to meet the demands that will come on them when they submit themselves to the hire-purchase system, it is only natural in a country such as this, with small wage-earners, where the vast majority of the people have limited means, a comparatively poor country, that there are incentives to utilise hire-purchase.  It is reasonable to assume that there should be some method of controlling or curbing the desire or inclination of people to live beyond their means.  It is often said that they are not set a very good example by Governments in this matter.  As Deputy Barrett so rightly put it, there should be some form of legislation whereby this House itself would have control over the specific measures that are to be adopted.  In this case, it seems to me &mdash;not being a lawyer, I may be wrong &mdash;the Bill gives <i>carte blanche</i> to the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his officials to interfere in the private lives and business of the citizens.</P>
    <P>Surely there must be some other way by which we can deal with the situation if it is getting out of hand. If we have reached the stage where everyone is living beyond his means, where there is a tremendous inflow of luxury goods, and it is causing embarrassment to the Government, surely there is some other way of meeting it openly by directly clamping down on the particular instance that is affecting our economy, rather than by introducing a Bill such as this.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if the officials of the Department go into business premises, it is mandatory on them under the Act not to disclose what they find to anybody.  There is, of course, the escape clause, that they may utilise <Col N="129" /> the information for the purpose of prosecutions.  Who is going to prosecute? If anyone is going to prosecute in any matter in relation to this Bill, it is the State, and the State will prosecute through the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Therefore, the escape clause or, rather, the sop which is put into the Bill in order to indicate that some sort of secrecy will be observed in the affairs of a private individual, is entirely abrogated because we assume, when powers such as these are being sought in the Bill, that if the Minister or his advisers find that there is any matter in connection with which they should resort to the law, all the intimate and private details connected with the business concerned will be exposed to the public eye.</P>
    <P>Does that make for efficiency?  Is that an incentive to private enterprise? Is that the principle to which the majority of this House are committed? I have often listened to Ministers saying that our economy is based, in the major issues, on a private enterprise economy.  No matter what the situation may be, even though it is a fact that there are people here who are exploiting the poorer elements in the country, this Bill is not the way to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Having read this Bill and having listened to the debate this afternoon, I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that many cogent reasons have been advanced as to why he should take another look at the matter. The House should not pass legislation such as this which will give bureaucracy another stranglehold over our people and will give the officials and the State the right to interfere with the private lives of individuals.  The liberty of the subject should be sacred to every Deputy.  I personally object to the passing of what I consider to be blind legislation and, therefore, with respect, I would ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to refer to two matters.  I would suggest to the Minister that, in view of the wide powers conferred upon him by section 6, section 4 is not the appropriate form <Col N="130" /> for this Bill and he ought seriously to consider bringing his regulations, made under section 6, before the House and getting approval for them before they acquire the force of law.  I readily concede that where powers to make law by regulation are very narrow and restricted by the terms of a Bill, the provisions of section 4 of this Bill may be sufficient safeguard but to use those provisions for so wide a section as section 6 of this Bill is to do something which is not necessary and which constitutes a very serious inroad on the power of this House to make the law.</P>
      <P>I should like, further, to refer to the provisions of section 16 which relate to recovery of the possession of motor vehicles.  Under the original Act of 1946, I understand that the person who sold a motor vehicle under a hire-purchase agreement could not enter the premises of the hirer to recover the vehicle without an order of the court. It is proposed now, I gather, to give him certain rights of entry to recover a vehicle and even where a third of the price of the vehicle has been paid he is entitled to seize the vehicle and to hold it pending a decision of the court as to where the true ownership of the vehicle lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very grave matter to give anybody a right to enter another person's premises to effect a seizure without the intervention of the court and I do not really understand why it should be necessary to give the vendor of a motor vehicle that power any more than you give it to the vendor of any other commodity. Although the motor vehicle is the subject of a hire-purchase arrangement, in fact, it is a credit transaction. There is no obligation on a motor salesman to sell a motor car to anybody he does not like to sell it to.  He certainly does not sell it to somebody for the love of that person's lovely blue eyes.  He sells a motor car in the ordinary course of trade hoping to make a legitimate profit on the transaction.  I suggest to the Minister that in those circumstances there is no good reason why he should be given the right to enter the hirer's premises to seize his car without getting the appropriate order <Col N="131" /> from a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The trouble I find, Sir, in Dáil Éireann is that we sometimes casually legislate in this way, justifying it as being an exceptional departure to deal with an exceptional situation. I am not prepared to concede there is any fundamental difference between a motor car or an armchair or any other article of commerce which would justify a man breaking into his neighbour's premises to seize the one while he is forbidden to make such an entry, under the authorisation of a Court of competent jurisdiction to seize the other.</P>
    <P>The queries put by Deputy McGilligan and others call for an answer. One is the strange power of the High Court, on its own motion, to transfer a case from its Court to another Court without stating in the Bill what matters the High Court should consider if they proposed to act in this way.  Secondly, Deputy McGilligan makes a strong case for the proposition that the transfer of proceedings under this Bill from the place where the contract is made to the place of residence of one of the parties may involve the purchaser in additional cost.  It would appear the Minister brings in this proposal with the intention of saving costs.  I would be interested to hear from him if he is in a position to rebut the suggestions that have been made from this side of the House that the new procedure, instead of reducing costs, will substantially increase them.</P>
    <P>I hear the merits and the beauties of the hire purchase system universally sung in these days.  I see a great difference between hire purchase facilities for the purchase of a house and hire purchase facilities for perishable commodities like wireless sets, cheap furniture and other articles of that character.  This may be an old-fashioned view but I believe it is in the best interests of individuals and in the best interests of society that persons proposing to purchase commodities under hire purchase should have accumulated some part of the purchase price before they embark on <Col N="132" /> contracts of this kind.  From the point of view of the community, it often astonishes me the extremes to which it is thought expedient to go on occasion to restrict public investment on the grounds that in a given period that might be detrimentally inflationary in the economy while, at the same time, very great expenditure may be undertaken for the purchase of consumer goods under the facilities of hire purchase with little or no general control being exercised at all.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the individual, it is a cause of constant astonishment to me to see how many of my neighbours have installed television sets.  I have never been able to afford a television set; yet I see growing around me on the houses of neighbours who heretofore I did not think were as affluent as I, forests of television aerials.  Surely there must be something inherently mistaken in the view that one is to equip oneself with every luxury for which one's heart can long without any reference at all to one's capacity to pay for it before one begins to enjoy it.</P>
    <P>If a young family wants to establish itself ordinary providence requires that they should have some prospect of being able to pay the current expenses of the family, but it is reasonable, after making prudent calculations, that they should equip themselves with a house if they intend permanently to reside in one area.  They can often pay the instalments on a house under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act or similar legislation which will be less than the rent they would have to pay if they became tenants and they are accumulating an asset which at any time they can sell; and in the ordinary course if it is a good house it is an asset that will be worth all that has been paid for it at the end of the period prescribed for payment.  It is reasonable, I suppose, to purchase the essential furniture wherewith to establish the home if one can clearly foresee one's ability to meet the weekly charge out of one's weekly income, but when you get beyond these things, I cannot help asking myself if we are not creating very serious social problems by stimulating the purchase of what could reasonably be regarded as legitimate <Col N="133" /> luxuries on the never-never, rather than waiting until one has accumulated a surplus which would justify one's indulgence in luxuries of that character.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to know with certainty from the Minister: do the regulations which it is proposed to make under Section 6 give him power to differentiate in regard to the size of the deposit with reference to the quality of the goods, that is to say, can he prescribe there must be a deposit of 50 per cent. on a television set and that 10 per cent. would be sufficient to purchase furniture, or is he restricted to prescribe a minimum deposit for all hire purchase transactions? I think he should have a differential power.  I admit that a strong argument can be made that everybody ought to be free to make his own bargains and to abide the consequences thereof.  However, where you have growing up in our community a high-powered credit system such as this hire purchase business has become, some rational safeguards are necessary if very serious social and national economic evils are to be avoided.</P>
    <P>I particularly urge on the Minister that this is not an occasion when the provisions of Section 4 are appropriate. I further urge upon him that he should alter that Section to provide that regulations made by him under this Bill shall be approved by Dáil Éireann within a limited time on his motion rather than that they should automatically be deemed to be approved consequent on the failure of anybody to raise them in this House.  I press that view particularly upon the Minister because we all know there simply is not available to our Parliamentary institutions the secretariat and the research facilities which make it physically possible for an Opposition, however well intentioned, to scanevery Order that is laid before the House with the close attention that would be necessary if this procedure under Section 4 were to become the norm.  Therefore I suggest to the Minister that in our circumstances it is apparent, that where wide powers are taken, he should charge himself with the responsibility of seeking approval and justification for any regulations he <Col N="134" /> may make from Dáil Éireann on his own motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in a difficulty today in that we are asked to approve an unknown law.  We are asked to give our approval to Orders which the Minister may make under this Bill which gives him power to make legislation about which nobody will know until it is put on the table of the House.  It will then join the company of so many Orders put on the table of the House of which we have 22 today. As Deputy Dillon has already said, even the best intentioned Deputy has no more time allowed him by his Creator than 24 hours in every day. It will be next to impossible for this House to keep the necessarily watchful eye on the type of legislation which we are being asked to enact under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not take the opportunity to write into the Bill some fundamental principles of good hire purchase transactions, such principles as he obviously had in mind under Section 6.  It should not have been impossible to draft a section in this Bill to govern some basic hire purchase principles to be followed.  It should not have been impossible for the Minister to make a decision as to what minimum deposit would be required for particular types of goods. One of the effects of the Bill may be that those carrying out hire purchase transactions may be ignorant of changes in the law for some considerable time after Ministerial Orders have been made and they will be rendering themselves liable to penalties under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be answered that advertisements in the papers and the placing of Orders on the table of the House will cover that.  However, the busier a man is, the less time he has for looking up the legal columns and the Government notice columns in the newspapers and he will frequently find himself in the position of having broken Orders which have been made without his knowledge.  I would therefore respectfully ask the Minister to consider before the Committee Stage whether it might not be possible to enshrine in the Bill some of the <Col N="135" /> accepted principles of good hire purchase transactions.</P>
    <P>There is an element in connection with hire purchase which cannot be overstressed and which could be covered in some way by this Bill and not left to Ministerial Order.  It is well known, and I have learned from my own experience, that people frequently enter into hire purchase agreements without understanding the contents of them.  As the Minister well knows, it is an accepted rule of law that a person cannot be heard to say that he did not read or understand the contents of any document which bears his signature.  Again and again, practitioners in our law courts hear that argument being made by defendants and it is my firm belief that in a considerable number of cases it is a very genuine argument. On that account, I should like to see some radical steps taken to ensure that a person does not sign a hire purchase document until he has had ample opportunity of reading in detail the document he is asked to sign and of even getting an opportunity of obtaining legal advice on some paragraph or clause in the contract which he may not understand.</P>
    <P>We all know that a salesman is mainly interested in getting an order. A salesman carrying out a transaction under a hire purchase contract does not have to bother about getting the customer to come back again because he knows that, if a customer buys a television set or some such article, he will be paying for it for two or three years by which time he will have got heartily sick of the very appearance of the shop.  We have cases in which salesmen encourage people to sign hire purchase agreements with glib phrases like: &ldquo;Sign here and it will be delivered for the week-end.&rdquo;  That is happening day in and day out and even people engaged in the hire purchase business themselves have confirmed with me that that is the position. I should, therefore, like the Minister to consider putting a clause into the Bill whereby it would be compulsory for the owner of an article which he proposes to sell under <Col N="136" /> hire purchase to send to the address of the proposed hirer not less than 24 hours before the contract is signed a draft of the contract which that person is being asked to sign.</P>
    <P>I say that in all seriousness in order that we may prevent in future the undoubted arrangement which does exist whereby innocent people sign hire purchase contracts without realising what they are doing.  If these people are given a period of 48 hours to read a contract, get advice on it and have second thoughts on it, we might have fewer people in our courts incurring additional legal costs and many other unfortunate people incurring the costs which accrue when the owner of the goods brings them into the enforcement courts to collect the money from them at the rate of 5/- and 2/6 a week.  What frequently happens is that the costs of litigation far exceed the amount due at the time that litigation was initiated</P>
    <P>On that account, I find myself in agreement with the Minister and in disagreement with my colleagues who are opposed to the provision in the Bill that litigation in connection with hire purchase transactions should be brought where the hirers live.  I am in complete agreement with the Minister in that.  I fail to see why this House should continue to approve of the present system which suits only the large hire purchase companies who write into the hire purchase contracts a clause providing that the contract may be sued on where the contract is accepted.</P>
    <P>There is a further clause in many of the agreements to the effect that the contract shall be deemed to be accepted in the City of Dublin.  That means that people who enter into hire purchase contracts for small amounts throughout the country can have a district court civil process issued against them for hearing in Dublin in respect of an amount of perhaps £6 or £8.  Alternatively, a guarantor whose name has been forged to a hire purchase contract down the country may have a civil process issued against him for some small amount like £5.</P>
    <P>Many of those people find it is not <Col N="137" /> worth their while to travel to Dublin, and bear the expense involved in travelling to Dublin, to give evidence in their own defence when they are unlikely to recover even their expenses. Where the amount is small, that happens very frequently.</P>
    <P>I speak with some knowledge of this subject by reason of the fact that in my profession as a solicitor I act from time to time for solicitors down the country.  Not infrequently I receive correspondence from them confirming what I am now telling this House, namely, that people who get civil contracts for small amounts served on them find it is not worth their while to come to the city to defend them.</P>
    <P>I feel that what the Minister has in mind in introducing this section which provides that the hire purchase companies, who can well afford it, ought to bring the proceedings in the area in which the people reside is that if they have a defence they may contest the case and if they have not a defence they need not appear and judgment will be given as a matter of course&mdash; and I do not mean that it will involve the degree of publicity which Deputy Lindsay has in mind.  If a person has no defence in such a transaction a decree will be given and that is all there is to it.  If the person has a defence he should be given an opportunity of making his defence on his own ground.  Therefore, I would approve of that section.</P>
    <P>I find obnoxious the sections which give the High Court power to remit to other courts some cases without stating the reason for so doing.  The Minister may say&mdash;speaking respectfully of our Judiciary, that they would not tend to remit cases to lower courts without good reason.  However, judges are human beings and might act without good reason.  The danger is that remitting some cases may involve additional expense.  It is undesirable to write into an Act such an unlimited power.  No doubt the Department have in mind the types of cases in which such power ought to be exercised.  I respectfully suggest the Bill ought to contain the cases in which it is felt that power ought to be <Col N="138" /> exercised.  We should not give power to the court in any other type of case to exercise power of that nature.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is an old-fashioned stand to take that there are powers in this Bill which are excessive and which would allow a quite improper interference with respectable business men.  Under Sections 7, 8 and 9, officials may inspect the books, records or documents relating to the business of any man or woman who sells an article to another under a hire purchase transaction.  The Bill is loose enough to allow such an inspector to inquire into the profits of a business, to inquire into the expenses of running a business and to inquire into the debts of a business and into the creditworthiness of any particular businessman.</P>
    <P>It is undesirable that officials who would be moving around from one business house to another should be given that power to probe into the financial affairs of various people. The Bill is general enough, on my interpretation, to give officials that power.  I do not believe it is necessary for the proper working of the Act.  I do not believe the Minister needs it to make the Orders he is asking us to give him power to make under Section 6.  I believe these powers are far too great.</P>
    <P>It certainly allows any inspector to pester, annoy or irritate any business house.  The reasonable times during which inspectors may carry out these inspections will in most cases be interpreted as hours of business and these will be the most unreasonable times for the carrying-out of such inspections.  I am sure the Minister and his Department have not in mind that these inspectors would facilitate businessmen by carrying out their inspections after business hours.  It is most likely that the inspectors will insist that the inspections be carried out not later than 5 p.m.  That might well upset any business house and particularly the smaller business house.</P>
    <P>On that account I ask the Minister to move very carefully in seeking such very wide powers which are not necessary for the proper working of this Bill when enacted.  I should like the House to consider that I am not <Col N="139" /> unconscious of the grave need that exists to regulate hire purchase transactions for the betterment of all parties to these transactions.  Certainly such a need exists but I do not believe this Bill is going the right way about it.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by returning to the section which gives the Minister powers of inspection.  I respectfully ask the Minister to consider setting up some arbitration tribunal to which disputes might be referred because, as it is framed, the Bill will lead to many serious disputes.  There will be disputes which will be caused by many respectable and reputable businessmen.  It would be most undesirable that it would be left in the hands of officialdom to deal with these difficulties which are almost certain to rise because of the very general nature of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this amending Bill is not going far enough to deal with the abuses in hire purchase. One feature I like about it is the increase in down payment for hire purchase. I think this Bill has been introduced because the Minister feels the impact that television will have on the community warrants its introduction; that people have to be saved from themselves or, rather, from the Joneses.  We have that mentality.  We see it.  It is very striking for any country Deputy coming to Dublin.</P>
      <P>They can see the forest of television aerials and where they protrude from. I think we are all aware that they mostly protrude from houses where people can ill-afford them, not that one begrudges in the least the ordinary working man the luxury of television, but on the cost of television, I find myself in agreement with the section which calls for an increase in the down payment.  I feel that where luxury goods are concerned the down payment should be increased to help to save people from themselves, as I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that, before legal action is taken in cases of hire purchase defaulters, the guarantor should be given prior notice.  I have seen cases where a guarantor knew <Col N="140" /> nothing about it until the bailiff walked in and demanded the money from him. Such a situation should not be tolerated.  I welcome certain sections of the Bill but, as I said, it does not go far enough and the Minister has left it very vague on the question of down payments.  I think the Minister, knowing him as I do&mdash;he is a reasonable man in that respect&mdash;will see that where unnecessary luxury goods are concerned, there is a good limit placed on people who can ill-afford these goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been generally recognised in the course of this debate, hire purchase is something that we have and that we are likely to continue to have.  Like many facilities available to us, used wisely it can be very beneficial but used imprudently it can be a very dangerous thing.  Having got hire purchase, we must look around to see to what extent it is being used in an imprudent manner.  There is some evidence that it has been so used, and there was such evidence before the enactment of the original Act in 1946.  It was for the purpose of offsetting this abuse that the original Act was passed.  Since then it has appeared that there have been some defects in that Act and the purpose of the Bill is to cure, so far as they can be cured, these defects.</P>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that an impression seems to have been created here that almost everybody who is a hirer or is an owner of goods under a hire purchase agreement has sinister motives&mdash;the hirer to get away if possible with as much use of the commodity without paying for it, and the owner to eke out as much by way of repayments out of the hirer as well as getting the property back.  I should like to refer the House to the speech I made when introducing the Bill when I said that there were 242,000 transactions in 1958.  I feel sure that only a small fraction of these transactions have ever come before any of the courts for determination as to the rights of ownership of the article or for the making of decrees, due to repayment not being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be denied that there are defects in the administration of hire <Col N="141" /> purchase; there are defects in the manner in which both owners and hirers operate and the purpose of this Bill is to cure these defects.  Most of the members of the Fine Gael Party who spoke seem to see something very sinister in Section 6 which is the section giving the Minister power to provide by Order for the regulation and control of hire purchase and credit sales.  But subsection 2 of Section 6 sets out very clearly what the Minister may provide by Order&mdash;first of all the form of the agreement of the hire purchase or credit sale of the goods; secondly the minimum deposit to be made; thirdly the maximum period of repayment and amounts and the frequency of instalments or rentals and fourthly the information to be given in the advertisment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain opening there but, as far as the Minister is concerned, the purpose of this section is to provide the means of making these Orders for providing the form of orders, the amount of a repayment and the periods in which repayments are to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the speakers who spoke on the Fine Gael side seemed to ignore the existence of Section 4 until Deputy Dillon spoke and the only comment&mdash;it was not quite the only comment he made in dealing with the Bill&mdash;he made on Section 4 was that he thought the Order should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas before the particular Order comes into operation. However, it will be seen the Order must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within a period of 21 days or within the next subsequent 21 days in which the House has sat.  It gives <Col N="142" /> either House of the Oireachtas that power.  There is extensive provision to ensure that legislative power here resides in the Oireachtas in the course of making these Orders to control and regulate hire purchase and credit sale agreements.</P>
      <P>The next point to which most criticism was directed was the powers of officers of the Minister to enter upon premises and examine books.  If it is accepted that regulations will have to be made, that forms of agreements have to be adhered to and the minimum deposits have to be made, that maximum periods have to be fixed within which repayments for the hire of goods are made, it can be realised that the Minister would tie his hands unless he had some means of ascertaining what the facts were in any single place, some means whereby he could acquire knowledge as to whether the provisions of the Bill were being complied with by particular traders.  I do not envisage the invasion into the privacy of individuals anticipated by some of the Fine Gael Deputies being carried out by these officers.  In any case, and I am not using this as a defence for it, there is ample precedent, especially in all legislation which is in any way parallel to this type of legislation&mdash;in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, in the Apprenticeship Act and so many others in which certain knowledge is necessary in order to ensure that the Minister will have means to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the other criticism was directed to the regulation of court proceedings.  It was suggested there was no reason why cases should be brought in the area in which a defendant resides.  I think it will be generally agreed that the Court leans in favour of the person to be sued as far as facilitating him is concerned. The plaintiff himself in any action founded on contract, has the option of suing in the place where the contract is made or where the defendant or one of them ordinarily resides.  It is not a tremendous extension of that right, or, opportunity, to have an action tried where a person resides, if a <Col N="143" /> person who enters into a hire purchase agreement with him will be obliged to sue in the court area in which that particular hirer resides.  It is only fair to him, particularly having regard to the extent to which cases are being brought in Dublin against people living in remote parts of the country in respect of small amounts that might be outstanding in the repayment arrangements arising out of hire purchase transactions.  Deputy Ryan was quite right in giving his approval to this provision, having regard to his own personal experience of the manner in which cases involving small amounts are frequently heard in the Dublin courts against people who live far away from Dublin and who, for one reason or another, feel it would not be worth their while to come and defend them, even though they felt they might have a very good defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is Section 19?  I am wondering does it interfere with the jurisdiction of the High Court?  If the hiring company were to decide to use the High Court machinery, could they still do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended dealing with that on another point but I shall do so now.  Deputy McGilligan in particular suggested that the increasing of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the District Court to enable cases to be taken in these courts where the defendant resides within the area, is something of doubtful value to a defendant if the suggestion is made of reducing the cost. There are many cases in which the defendant would prefer to be sued in his own area than to be brought to the Dublin Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first instance, most hire purchase companies have agents throughout the country who actually effect the contracts on the premises of the hirer.  Even though they are ultimately deemed to have been made in Dublin, the person who will give evidence as to the making of the contract usually is a person residing in or about the area in which the defendant resides.  Therefore, there can be no force in the suggestion that in any case <Col N="144" /> somebody would have to go down to Ballyhaunis District Court from some office in Dame Street in Dublin in order to prove the contract and therefore that there will be no expense saved in the bringing of the case in Ballyhaunis rather than at Inns Quay. If, therefore, the hire purchase company, in order to defeat the purpose of that section, brings an action in the High Court in which there is jurisdiction in the Circuit Court, the High Court can of its own motion, remit that action to the appropriate Circuit or District Court as the case may be. It is not unknown that people bring actions in the High Court even though the Circuit Court jurisdiction is ample.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, a form of centralisation.  It is only in such cases, where the jurisdiction is within the limit of either the Circuit Court or the District Court, that the High Court will have power to remit. If the jurisdiction is clearly High Court jurisdiction, the power to remit will not be there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I made my query clear.  The Minister is aware of the ordinary court procedure in the High Court.  Even at the moment if a person resides somewhere down the country and the plaintiff wants to bring proceedings in the city of Dublin, even if the amount is within the District Court jurisdiction he can issue a summary summons in the High Court and look for default judgment in the High Court.  I am wondering is that procedure interfered with?  Admittedly, he is only awarded the appropriate costs at the moment. Is that procedure interfered with by the provisions of subsection (3) of Section 19?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The default procedure is being changed in order to prevent what appears to have been abuses&mdash;not necessarily deliberate <Col N="145" /> abuses but hardship on guarantors in particular.  Hitherto judgments by default could be obtained in the Court office but now, as a result of the provisions of this Bill, judgment would have to be procured in court.  Therefore, what the Deputy has in mind will not occur because the High Court office will not have power to mark judgment.  The office will have to send the matter on to the judge and at that stage the judge could remit the action to the appropriate court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is the judge only.  I shall check on that.  The Master would have power to remit as well.  The whole purpose is to ensure that there will not be power in the Court office to mark judgment in order to ensure that no hardship will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That there is a hearing.  The ordinary case is this. The hirer has defaulted in his payments. If he has handed back the goods or if the owner gets possession <Col N="146" /> of the goods otherwise, the owner usually sues the hirer and the guarantor.  He sues the hirer for the payments in respect of which he has defaulted and sues the guarantor for the payments outstanding.  If judgment is marked against both the owner gets the full value of the goods and also gets the goods in his possession. It is to prevent abuses like that that the provision is being made for the necessity to go to court.</P>
      <P>I want to assure both Deputies McGilligan and Lindsay that I have no ulterior motive such as trying to get work into the hands of Cork solicitors, work that might otherwise be done in Dublin.  That suggestion certainly ran through their speeches. The whole purpose of this is to assist the defendant to avail of his remedies more easily than he might otherwise be able to do.  There are many instances in which the facility of having the case heard or decided in the court area in which one resides gives the defendant certain advantages. For example, there is the case of postponed orders for possession of goods, where the defendant having come to court and made some defence and the Judge is satisfied at least as to his <i>bona fides</i> and notwithstanding making an order for the specific return of the goods hired, will, nevertheless suspend the operation of the order provided the defendant can make alternative arrangements to pay for the goods.  If during the course of the payment of the instalments now ordered by the court, or agreed to, he makes default, and even if he has paid for the goods to a considerable extent, the owner is in possession of his execution order and can immediately execute.  If the defendant is sick or precluded for some other innocent reason from keeping up his payments as ordered by the court, under this Bill he can go back to the court and ask for extra relief.  If the court was in Dublin it might not be possible for him to reach Dublin whereas now he will have the court immediately available in which he can get the extra relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked some questions in regard to the type of goods that are hired through hire-purchase <Col N="147" /> or credit-sales transactions. At the moment there is in preparation by the Statistics Office some figures for the Trade Journal.  Since he spoke I have received a proof of them, an uncorrected proof.  As far as a rough calculation on the figures given on the draft statistics goes, the number of transactions in motor cars represents 16 to 17 per cent. of the whole. I want to warn the Deputy that these are my own calculations based on a rough check.  The figure for commercial vehicles is 3.5 per cent.; agricultural tractors, machinery and equipment&mdash;4.5 per cent.; motor cycles and scooters&mdash;5.4 per cent.; pedal cycles&mdash;20 per cent.; contractors' plant and industrial machinery&mdash;.8 per cent.; radio and television sets&mdash;16 per cent.  The money value involved&mdash;I have taken only three figures but they are fairly representative&mdash;is, in the case of motor cars which form 16-17 per cent. of the number of transactions, 12 per cent. of the total money value: agricultural tractors machinery and equipment, which are about 4.5 per cent. of the number of transactions, form about 10 per cent. of the money value; and radio and television sets which form about 16 per cent. of the number of transactions form about 6 per cent. of the money value.  These are calculations I made since the Deputy asked the question, but they give some indication of the balance between the type of goods concerned and the money values involved.</P>
    <P>I want to tell Deputy Norton that this Bill certainly does not take into account services as opposed to goods and I do not think it is likely that services will ever be taken into account in hire-purchase legislation.  If it is necessary, and if it appears that difficulties of a social and financial nature affecting many of the population or the nation would arise, it may be necessary to have a look at the position to see whether or not similar legislation might be necessary in the case of services but at the moment it certainly is not envisaged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the possibility of prescribing interest rates. That is a very big question and it is <Col N="148" /> tied up, as he knows, with financial considerations of a very broad character. It is tied up, for instance, with the bank rate, the building society rate and the money lending rate and, while he seemed to discount the possibility of competition regulating rates and ensuring that there would be a reasonable level, it has been shown in England that the competition that has arisen there has kept interest rates in hire purchase at a comparatively low level.  It is interesting to note that, as Deputy Dillon&mdash;I think&mdash;pointed out, many banks are taking an interest in hire purchase and even in this country we have an instance of a bank taking on certain hire purchase interests with another group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to justify the impression that it is not such high-risk capital as they pretend&mdash;the fact that the banks accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly that is so, but on the other hand, there is the danger of the destruction of goods and also the difficulty of the owner in many cases not having any guarantor or any other security except the existence of the goods themselves.  It is a wide question and it seems to me at the moment that there is a reasonable degree of competition to ensure that interest rates will not become exorbitant and I think the tendency is for them to become more keen and competitive as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin referred to some transactions in which I could not follow him completely.  I think what he was referring to was an activity whereby persons had order forms which they could supply to individuals for a certain value of goods to be purchased at a particular shop.  I think that is not hire-purchase&mdash;it is a form of money lending.  Let us say a person named John Browne has the facility of ordering goods from a store owned by John Murphy and if Mrs. O'Brien comes along to John Browne and says: &ldquo;I want an order for £15 worth of goods,&rdquo; John Browne gives Mrs. O'Brien the order for the goods which Mr. Murphy will supply, but, as a form of separate transaction, Mrs. Browne would have to pay John Murphy £20 for that order <Col N="149" /> form.  It is not hire purchase; it is a form of money-lending.  It is something that I feel might have been prevalent in the City of Dublin at a certain stage but something that, as a result of well-ordered hire-purchase arrangements, is, perhaps, on the decrease to a considerable extent.  It is the first complaint I have heard of the nature and if it were widespread I am sure we would have heard much more about it than just a statement in the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any other specific points that I need refer to. There were many specific points made but, as Deputy McGilligan said, these points are better discussed on Committee Stage.  I think I can interpret the feeling of the House in general in saying that the Bill in its general form is welcome, that there is a feeling that the provisions of the Bill are necessary and that in its broad terms it is something to which the House gives its approval.</P>

      <P>Of course, there will not be objection to the Money Resolution, but I think it is well to remind the House and the Minister that the Bill was introduced here with an explanatory memorandum which outlined the primary object of the Bill as being to provide a more efficient and more economical administration of the health services.  It does seem strange that, with such an object being put for the Bill, a Money Resolution should be needed.</P>
      <P>Is the fact that it is felt that the operation of this Bill, if it becomes an Act, will be to increase the cost of the health services?  If so, it can be understood why a Money Resolution is needed.  If that is not so, then, what is the purpose of asking this House to vote money for the operation of the services envisaged in the Bill?</P>

That makes it necessary, in order to conform to Standing Order 115 (2), to have a Money Resolution before we take the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before subsection (6), to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) (a)  Subsection (5) of this section shall cease to have effect on its being so provided by order made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  An order under this subsection shall not be made save upon request made by the council <Col N="152" /> of the county of Wicklow by resolution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House is aware, of course, that under Section 2 of the Bill there is certain provision being made for the representation of the Wicklow County Council on the Dublin Health Authority. Well, it may happen that the Wicklow County Council may wish to be relieved of the obligation of being represented there and the purpose of the amendment is to give the Minister power by regulation to relieve them of that responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any reason to give the House as to why Wicklow County Council would wish to be removed from this body?  As I know the position at the moment, the Grangegorman Hospital is administered by several of the existing Dublin health authorities and it is also related to Wicklow and from the County of Wicklow the ordinary patient is admitted to the Grangegorman Hospital.  Has the Minister any reason to think that Wicklow would wish to opt themselves out of a body on which they would have some say in the administration, some say in the expenses?  I presume they have to strike the rate, even though in future it will not be the rate of a mental authority alone because in this case they will not be affiliated to the body as they were before but they will have some considerable say in the administration. Surely it is reasonable to assume that Wicklow would want to stay there?</P>
      <P>The only reason why I rise is that Wicklow adjoins Wexford, where I live, and quite a lot of Wexford people live in Wicklow.  There must be something in the Minister's mind when he particularly refers to Wicklow as wishing to opt out.  I would like the Minister to be more explicit on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has secured a rather tenuous foothold in the debate by speaking for his neighbours but the position is this: This is a purely permissive amendment, which would give the Minister power to permit the Wicklow County Council to <Col N="153" /> release itself from the obligation of appointing three persons to act on the Dublin Health Authority for the narrow purpose of all business relating to the Mental Treatment Act which is, in fact, the management, one might say, of the Dublin Mental Hospital.  The Minister cannot make that regulation unless the county council by resolution ask him to do so.</P>

Is it envisaged that the Wicklow County Council may at a later stage alter its attitude and desire representation and, if it did so would the Minister say whether the subsection could then be put into operation again?</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, one matter I wish to raise arises out of directions which were recently given by the County Manager in respect of holders of general service medical cards.  Recently the County Manager issued a direction to the district medical officer that the holders of general service medical cards who require hospital treatment must go to St. Colmcille's, Loughlinstown.  This has given rise to some criticism in Dún Laoghaire Borough Area because Loughlinstown is for them not as convenient as St. Michael's.  It is true there are certain exceptions.  Certain brain cases or cancer cases do not come under this direction and so far as they are concerned the doctor is free to send them wherever he considers is the most suitable hospital. As well as doctors having an objection to this, relatives have objected on the <Col N="154" /> ground that St. Colmcille's is not as convenient as St. Michael's.</P>
      <P>This direction, which was an oral direction, not a written one, has arisen because of a fairly recent decision by the Wicklow County Council not to send patients to St. Colmcille's.  As the Minister is aware, St. Colmcille's hospital, Loughlinstown, is a Rathdown hospital and up to quite recently Wicklow County Council also sent patients there as well as the Rathdown patients being sent. Recently Wicklow changed and the result is that the hospital is not as full as it was previously, and since then the County Manager has issued this direction.</P>
      <P>While many of the patients from Dún Laoghaire Borough were in the ordinary course sent there, it was not obligatory on the dispensary doctors to do so.  As a result of this direction not merely is the patient liable, if sent elsewhere, for the cost, but in addition there is the point that was put to me that while in a matter of distance St. Colmcille's is within the Rathdown area, it is on a different artery from the Dún Laoghaire area and transport facilities are not anything like as convenient for residents of Dún Laoghaire Borough.</P>
      <P>I should like also to ask the Minister what will be the position when the various health authorities are amalgamated.  As I understand the position and as I think it operated up to quite recently, a dispensary doctor or a patient who has one of these cards was free to choose, provided accommodation was available, any hospital in the whole Dublin area. They could be sent to any one of the voluntary hospitals or to St. Colmcille's or St. Michael's which is a voluntary hospital or to St. Kevin's. Under this new direction they are restricted to St. Colmcille's and that has given rise to a certain amount of apprehension.  I should be glad, if the Minister is not in a position to answer now&mdash;he may not have heard of this before now&mdash;if he would have the matter examined between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no knowledge of the incident to which Deputy <Col N="155" /> Cosgrave has referred but I do not think it is relevant to the Bill.  It is a matter of administration.  It is true that in the city of Dublin generally people have a very wide choice of hospital in so far as they can go to any general hospital and be treated there as a Section 14 patient, but that is done purely as an act of grace by the health authority.  If the health authority decided to reduce the number of hospitals which would be available to Section 14 cases, I do not think the Minister has any power to interfere under the law as it stands.  I do not think this Section we are now introducing will make any change in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not recently looked at Section 14 but I understood that the principle operated was that the patient and the doctor had a choice of hospitals and that that was granted under Section 25.  The patient, I suppose, in consultation with the doctor, or the doctor, in consultation with the patient, could opt for a particular hospital, and that freedom of choice was preserved.  This recent direction limits entirely that freedom and those people who have mentioned this to me already&mdash;it is only quite recently I was approached about it&mdash;regard it as a radical departure from the practice which has operated up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred just now to Section 14 cases; I ought to have said Section 15, but again it is a matter of administration over which the Minister had no control.  I am not making the case for the manager but one can see that if an institution which belongs to the health authority is not being fully and economically utilised the manager is in duty bound to the ratepayers to ensure it is run as economically as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of this problem to which Deputy Cosgrave has referred but it would pose a question in people's minds as to what might happen under a unified health authority covering all the areas, if the result were to be that people say, in Shankhill, found themselves directed to a hospital in Dún Laoghaire <Col N="156" /> or people in Dún Laoghaire found themselves directed to a hospital in Loughlinstown.  While it is an administrative matter I would imagine that on enquiry the balance administratively would be very much against that kind of direction and it would be found far more desirable to leave things as they had been up to this where any person entitled to the services under the section, once he found himself in any of the Dublin hospitals, would not be asked how he got there but would be treated as if entitled under the Act and the appropriate charge would fall to be paid by the health authority responsible for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the situation would improve if we had the unified authority because the burden of giving that facility, which they have in the city of Dublin, to people in suburbs, in Dún Laoghaire and in the county generally would be greatly eased.  It will be distributed over a much wider area of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but in so far as T.B. patients are concerned the local authorities have been tending to ply Blanchardstown hospital with patients on the consideration that the Minister mentioned&mdash;that it is a local authority hospital.  At the same time in the county area, there are two non-local authority hospitals&mdash;Our Lady of Lourdes at Peamount and the other at Newcastle. For some years past neither of these two hospitals has been full because of the drop in the number of patients and while it may be reasonable enough for the county manager to direct the patients to Blanchardstown the actual hospital position is that we have excessive accommodation for T.B. patients and some inquiry into the general situation might be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point I want to raise.  It is a question relating to the rights and <Col N="157" /> privileges of the holder of a medical card.  Apparently the Dublin County Council have recently taken a decision whereby, if the holder of a medical card goes to a private doctor, he is not entitled to get the free use of the ambulance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a decision of the Dublin County Council which is now being amalgamated with other health bodies such as Dún Laoghaire, Rathdown, Balrothery and Dublin Corporation.  If we are going to have a unified authority such as that, the Minister should give us a guarantee that such a state of affairs would not apply to Dublin as a whole.  In Dublin County, as in all rural parts of Ireland, in the majority of localities you have only one doctor.  In the City of Dublin, however, you may have in the one area a half a dozen or a dozen doctors.  It might be that relations of a patient might like to take the opinion of a private doctor, even though the patient is a holder of a medical card. That may happen in County Dublin occasionally but in the City of Dublin it might happen twice a day that the ratepayers would call in a private doctor.  Are they then to be denied the right of free use of the ambulance? The precedent has been set in County Dublin that such a person could not have the free use of the ambulance.  Under this new Bill the object of which is to promote greater efficiency is it likely to happen in the City of Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not think that he might make that point to a member of Dublin County Council?  That would be much more effective.  The point has already been made elsewhere.  I am surprised at the Deputy coming along with that kind of old hash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I protest strongly against the Minister's attitude and what he has said.  This is a general case I am putting forward. It can happen in Dublin.  I have been <Col N="158" /> a medical officer myself and I know it does arise.  When people are anxious about a case they are likely to go to a private doctor and this is quite likely to happen in Dublin.  I am asking the Minister to tell the House whether the holder of a medical card, if he goes to a private doctor, is entitled to the service of the ambulance.</P>

      <P>This section is opposed.  At the outset let us make it quite clear that there is as much in common between the Minister and ourselves in so far as we have proved that we are all interested in the Health Act.  We appreciate the fact that the Minister is anxious to improve it.  So also are we anxious to do our part towards making this improvement. It is because we believe that this section will be detrimental to Cork and to the present health services in Cork that we are opposed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last November, when the Minister was speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, he posed a question when he stated that he often wondered whether Cork was part of Ireland or <Col N="159" /> Ireland was part of Cork.  As a Cork Deputy, I shall try to answer the Minister by stating that when a person goes to a doctor and gets a bottle of medicine we often find on the label the instruction: &ldquo;Keep it corked when not in use.&rdquo; Since the Minister posed his question we have passed through the happy season of Christmas. In every house, including that of the Minister, I am sure there was a bottle for friends who might be calling and I am sure that everybody knows that, no matter how good the contents of such a bottle may be, they are no good if not kept corked.  We believe that without Cork Ireland would be no good either.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins that the explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill starts off by saying that the primary object of the Bill is to provide more efficient and more economic administration.</P>
    <P>We realise the Minister has one advantage in so far as he is being supplied with reports from his expert advisers in relation to the operation of the Health Act in Cork City and County, as well as elsewhere.  If there are flaws in the operation of the present Act the Minister is in a position to know what is happening. In many instances he then, through the advice tendered to him, will be able to make up his mind on what he believes will remedy the flaws.  We appreciate, therefore, that from the viewpoint of reports submitted to him he has that advantage.</P>
    <P>Without offering criticism in any derogatory manner, I should like the Minister to understand that our approach to this section is based not on reports submitted to us as members of the Cork County Council or as members of the Cork Corporation but on actual experience as members of these public bodies.  It is from our experience as members of these boards that we offer criticism to the proposals in section 3.</P>
    <P>At present we have North, West and South Cork Committees combining South Cork and Cork City with the South Cork Board of Public Assistance. <Col N="160" /> We also have the County Health Services Committee.  The main fact is that all matters in relation to West Cork, all matters in relation to health services as obtaining in North Cork are dealt with first and foremost by members of the local authority elected in these areas.  That in itself must give these members a certain advantage in relation to the needs under the Health Act of the people in these areas, particularly when these members are advised by the local authority officials of the medical opinion of the officers of the various committees.</P>
    <P>It is only on that advice and on their own judgment that these members can from time to time offer suggestions as to the successful operation of the various committees in these areas.  In South Cork, we are in the same position.  In that area, we have five cottage hospitals and one main hospital. Combine that with the fact that we have an orthopaedic hospital.</P>
    <P>In relation to all these areas, therefore if we are to take the different combined units and if we are to consider the position of the orthopaedic hospital, of the Cork Mental Hospital and its subsidiary Youghal, and also the sanatorium in Cork, we must pose one question to the Minister: What is wrong with the present system?  Is there something weak in the operation of the general health services in relation to, in South Cork, St. Finbarr's, the Bandon, Macroom and other Cottage Hospitals?  We have in that area an M.O.  Naturally, in the new Bantry Hospital, the same arrangements must be made in West Cork as in North Cork.  All these men are considered at the present time as R.M.O.s in each area.  With regard to the R.M.O. in the mental hospital and the men holding equal rank in the sanatorium, are they all as it were to come under the one roof and be placed under some supreme authority?</P>
    <P>I am not opposing the Bill in any critical manner.  I want to draw attention to the difficulties that may arise. Will they all be placed in the position that while in the past they carried out their work in an admirable manner they must now accept an inferior status <Col N="161" /> in so far as somebody in authority is to be placed over them?  Whether we like it or not, at least the county manager and the city manager must stand in line with the ordinary members of the councils when it comes to a question of medical opinion.  In all questions he must consider the advice tendered to him by the R.M.S. or the R.M.O. in the various areas.  What will happen under section 3?  That is one of the points.  We consider the present situation to be far better than any suggested improvement through the Bill with this section 3.</P>
    <P>We fail to understand how, based on their activities in the past, any system envisaged in the Bill will give us, as stated in the memorandum, a more efficient&mdash;leaving out the question of economic&mdash;service.  By bringing all these units under one roof, as it were, where is the possibility of achieving a more efficient service?</P>
    <P>I have yet to hear of any complaint of the relationship between the mental hospital authorities and the R.M.O. there, as against the R.M.O. and the other hospitals under general health.  I appreciate, as a member, the close liaison between the orthopaedic hospital, and the surgeon and matron there, and the St. Finbarr's Hospital authorities. I realise that all that can be done is being done in the way of co-operation between these two hospitals. I am also aware that, whenever required, there was always a close-knit co-operation between the mental hospital medical authorities and the authorities of the sanatorium at Sarsfield's Court.  If such has been the case in the past how is it hoped that, under section 3, these systems which have been in operation will be improved on the basis, as stated here by him, of a &ldquo;more efficient&rdquo; service, apart altogether from the question of its being more economical?  We believe that cannot be and therefore we are opposing the section in part.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in relation to the present working of the sanatoria board, though some of us are not members of that board we believe, as members of the local authority, the system in operation there is such that excellent results are achieved, particularly from the <Col N="162" /> viewpoint of the treatment being given to patients.  We realise that the fullest and utmost co-operation exists between the sanatoria board and the staff of the sanatorium in Sarsfield's Court and of every part of the County of Cork as well as the city.  That being so, why suggest there is a more satisfactory method of running that hospital under the so-called unification of the health services in Cork?</P>
    <P>Much publicity can at times be given to patients leaving this country and going abroad for treatment.  We know also of the outstanding achievements in surgery in Sarsfield's Court.  Nothing is ever heard of it.  We are proud a Corkman is doing brilliant work there.  It is a pity more consideration is not being given to that aspect rather than to suggest that that board and that hospital be brought under the one roof due to the so-called unification of the health services in Cork.</P>
    <P>Another point that must receive consideration is this.  Take the city and the county of Cork.  In the city there are 112,098 persons, according to the recent census.  In the county of Cork we have 224,565 persons.  That gives a total of 336,663 persons.  The Minister may say that that would not bear a relationship to the over-all population in Dublin and the county where agreement has been reached on unification.  But even the Minister on the Second Stage himself admitted that Cork must stand out on its own in so far as conditions and geographical considerations were concerned. The outlying areas in the county must be considered, as he admitted on the Second Stage of the Bill, on a different basis completely from that of Dublin and elsewhere. We consider that one committee meeting discussing the problems of Cork city, with a population of over 112,000, and the same committee discussing the problems of 224,500 people in the county, will be faced with a colossal problem, not to mention the question at all of administering this unified authority.</P>
    <P>It is because of the problem involved that we believe that in spite of shortcomings&mdash;we all realise there are shortcomings connected with the Health Act; we <Col N="163" /> appreciate that in every system there is some shortcomings&mdash;the present system even as it is, is better than that now being proposed or being forced on the people in the city and county of Cork by the Minister in Section 3 of this Bill.  I am not going into the matter in great detail as other members will be anxious to speak on this as well, but considering that you will have some city members attending meetings where problems in relation to medical cards and matters of that kind for people in Castletownbere are to be discussed; where a man from East Cork will raise his voice in relation to the problems of some one around Youghal and other parts of the county, if the members are to do their duty properly&mdash;and I will say that members of every Party in Cork, who are members of the County Council, are anxious to do their best&mdash;that committee of 28 suggested by the Minister will have to meet at least once each week.</P>
    <P>Where then, I ask the Minister does the question of more economic administration come in?  If they are not to meet regularly, it means that the administration of the Act in relation to the various parts of north, south and east of the county cannot be attended to in the same diligent manner as in the past and at the present time.  Again, is it fair to the 112,000 people in the city of Cork, that so much time must be allotted at the various meetings, so much time with the manager, whether the city or county manager, who is to operate this, time taken from the city in relation to health services so the same official can give sufficient time to the administration of it than in the county?  All these are questions we are anxious to have answered because, while we may be at a disadvantage in relation to the overall reports of the Health Act, we base these questions on our experience.  It is from our own experience we can see everything at this stage that will arise day after day if Section 3 stands part of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has already in the amendment that has just been <Col N="164" /> passed increased the membership.  It must be understood that, even when speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill, I did not base my sole argument on the question of membership.  I did say then, and I say now, it is important that every member of the local authority should be on the committees as at present but it is not solely the case with me, and it never has been, of begging for an increase in the membership of the board.  We cannot be satisfied by the Minister telling us: &ldquo;I have increased membership now to 28.&rdquo;  It is the service and the operation of the Health Act upon which we must base our first considerations, not on a question of who is going to be on the board, whether a member here speaking in this House or a member of the local authority or their friends.</P>
    <P>The two points can be coupled.  The local men in West Cork are in the best position to consider the overall local problems in West Cork; so also does that apply in North, South and East Cork but, fundamentally, the most important thing of all is the administration of the Health Act in these areas.  Therefore, I could not agree with the Minister that just because he brought in this amendment to increase the membership of the board, bringing in a few extra members, that can in itself provide the improvements we wish for or could bring on a level plane the conditions at present existing there.</P>
    <P>We have had our problems in the past and the Minister knows it.  The Minister knows that in relation to South Cork we are in a terrible condition over dispensaries but it is not our fault and the Minister knows that. Grants towards the erection of dispensaries have been denied us.  Does the Minister say now that under Section 3 of this Bill, if it passes, grants are going to be given for the erection of dispensaries in Cork?</P>
    <P>Section 3 covers future activities in relation to Cork.  We want to know where we stand in relation to the services that we have been trying to offer to the people.  We are anxious to know why it is that the recommendations are submitted to the manager and in turn <Col N="165" /> submitted to the Minister; why it is, on the one hand we are told of a more economical and efficient service and at the same time there is no question of giving us more economical services based on the improvements that we have already asked for.</P>
    <P>Again, we have had many other complaints; perhaps this is not the time to go into them in detail, holding up the House, but how often have members here, members of the Minister's Party as well, been with us when we asked the Minister, would he inform us of what may be contained in reports in relation to the operation of the Health Act in connection with the dispensary services?  We knew of course, as in other years, an inspector would go down from the Minister's Department once every year and a half but beyond that we were refused any information.  We do not know whether the Minister is satisfied through the reports that the dispensary system is working properly for the whole of the area or whether any bad or faulty parts of it exist.  Is this new authority, this unified service, to be given all that information we had requested and which we have been refused?  Is the unified authority to be placed in a position of making the necessary improvements in relation to the dispensary service in South Cork as well as North and West Cork.  If it is, then perhaps the Minister may say something will be done but we cannot see any improvements whatever as envisaged by this Bill.</P>
    <P>No later than yesterday, the Cork County Council, through its health service committee, met and discussed the estimates for the coming year. The result was an increase for health services of something over £29,000. Admittedly, a 50 per cent. grant will be given towards it.  Nevertheless, provision is being made for approximately £15,000 more than last year. Is that not proof that the members are helping to operate the present system and doing their best to provide the best possible health services?  If the Minister could show that the officials were not carrying out their duties or that the members were not cooperating with the County Manager <Col N="166" /> or the various officials, he might be justified in asking for unification of the health services in Cork.  But where the opposite is true, where it can be shown that all concerned are co-operating to the best of their ability to give the best possible services under the present system, the Minister can hardly say that the Cork City and County health services require unification. It is on these points we are basing our opposition.</P>
    <P>Speaking in the Dáil on 5th November, 1959, the Minister said at column 807, Volume 177 of the Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The existing staffs and the existing institutions will have to be maintained but there is the fact that we shall be able to make a more effective use of these institutions and of these staffs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For a long time past the members and officials in Cork have been pleading to be allowed use portion of St. Stephen's Hospital for the curing of little children.  Why is it the Minister is satisfied to see some blocks of that hospital closed without acceding to the members' request?  There is a serious hospital accommodation problem in South Cork, yet there is a hospital closed in Macroom.  The Minister said lately that it is small, but nevertheless it is a hospital.  It is still closed although the local authorities have been asking the Minister to be allowed use it for other purposes under the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill is in itself a condemnation of the present system of operating the Health Acts in Cork. There is no use suggesting we are not getting the best out of the Health Acts when we can point to these hospital problems in Cork.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated at Column 807:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In relation to Cork, it may be that the need for further examination may arise and that we may not be able to carry through the same close-knit integration as we hope to achieve in the case of the City of Dublin because, perhaps, of the territorial difficulties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> It all boils down to this.  This is a small country and there is no use saying that what should be done in regard to the unification of health services in the City of Dublin should also be done in Cork.  On the Second Stage the Minister submitted there was a great difference between conditions in the two areas.  The Minister said a lot might be done on the Committee Stage, but nothing is being done by the Minister except on this question of the few extra members on the Committee. That is one step in the right direction but it is far removed from 46 or 28.</P>
    <P>We are interested only in the improvement of health services and did not raise the question of advantages from the financial point of view.  The Minister has admitted there can be no changes in present staffing arrangements. That means there cannot be any financial advantage.  Of course, it may relieve a couple of Assistant County Managers of a little work, but we will still have to pay them and there will be no saving to the country on that score.  One member of a staff may be switched from one section to another, but in view of the Minister's statement that staffs cannot be interfered with, we believe there cannot be a saving but instead that there will be an increase in costs.</P>
    <P>Our opposition to this section is based on the belief that the Minister is on the wrong lines in the matter of improving the Cork Health Services. It cannot be done through unification; it can be done only through the opposite&mdash;by leaving things as they are.  The Minister knows that there are regular conferences between the city and county managers and the other officials concerned.  What is to prevent them bringing the medical officers into these conferences?  If there are any weaknesses in the health services, could they not be remedied at such conferences?  If Section 3 stands part of this Bill I must say we believe it will be detrimental to the health of the people of Cork city and county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I are at one, I am sure, in that we both want to do the best we can for the <Col N="168" /> people of Cork as far as the health services are concerned.  The only question which arises is whether you can do better for them if you make available to every citizen to the extent to which it is practicable to do so whether he lives in Cork city, in the suburbs of Cork or in the more remote districts of Cork, all the joint resources of the health institutions and services in both the city and the county.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has praised very highly the work of the Cork Sanatoria Board and he has told us about the professional eminence of some of the members of the staff there but that Board is, in itself, a unified authority for one particular service. It is a service which covers the city of Cork and the county of Cork as well.  If it is good in that case, if it is useful to have that sort of unification in one institution or in a service devoted to the care of tuberculosis patients, why would it not be equally good to have the same sort of unification, a little more decentralised in its operations in respect of the whole city and county?</P>
      <P>The Deputy has spoken about the Cork Mental Hospital Board.  There, again, you have an institution which provides the treatment for mental illnesses which is necessary for those who are so unfortunate as to be afflicted in that way, whether they live in the city or in the county.  What are we trying to do under this section? Nothing more than to make available to everybody that same sort of uniform service&mdash;perhaps &ldquo;uniform&rdquo; is not quite the word&mdash;the same sort of comprehensive service in respect of all forms of illness, as well as those which are being so effectively treated when we are dealing with these two particular types&mdash;those who suffer from tuberculosis and those who suffer from mental illness.  We want to do that&mdash;to put everybody in the city or county of Cork who may suffer from other maladies in a position to have the resources of the city and country at his disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the present position in Cork?  You have Cork Corporation. It is the health authority for the Cork <Col N="169" /> city area but its services, except as an act of grace, are reserved in general for the population who live inside the city of Cork, some 80,000 people. Those services relate to the infectious diseases services generally, food control measures, the services under the Health Act, 1953, which relate to general practitioner, maternity care, institutional services and extern institutions generally, specialist services and disabled person's allowances The operations of Cork Corporation in respect of the health services are strictly limited to those who live inside the city boundary.</P>
    <P>We know of course that the present city boundary in Cork does not include all those who make their living in Cork and who by the mere chance that Cork Corporation was not able to find appropriate places to house them inside the city boundary, where they make their living, have been compelled to live outside the city boundary where you have a large urban population of between 30,000 and 40,000.  For all intents and purposes they are townspeople.  Being in that category they might not appeal to a certain Deputy in this House, but at least I think they ought to appeal to Deputy Desmond and his colleagues because a very large number of them are wage-earners.  Cork County Council only has dealt hitherto with these people who might perhaps more properly be the immediate concern as things stand of Cork Corporation.  The County Council is the health authority for the county area and provides its own set of services.  I am not saying &mdash;I have never suggested&mdash;that these services are not being run efficiently. The only thing is that they could be run in such a way that the services provided both by Cork Corporation and the County Council would be more readily available or more conveniently available to everybody in the city and county of Cork whether a person happens to live inside the county borough or in a rural area in Cork.</P>
    <P>Then you have the South Cork Board of Asistance which also runs its own institutions and provides its own services.  There may be a degree <Col N="170" /> of overlapping and for that reason there may be&mdash;I think there is certainly in the case of certain services a degree of overlapping and therefore a degree of unnecessary expense.  I am not making a case for this Bill let me point out, on the ground that it is going to produce economies.  I think it will produce economies, but that is not the purpose for which we have introduced this Bill, or are trying to secure the acceptance of the principle that there should be one common authority wherever there are contiguous populations with common interests.  That is not why we are trying to get this unified authority for&mdash;perhaps I had better be specific&mdash;Dublin, Limerick, Waterford and Cork.  It is not merely because we hope that there will be economies accruing by reason of the unification.  It is because we will be able to make better use of our resources that I am asking the House to accept this Bill.  I am asking it because I think it is going to make it much easier for a person who has to avail of the health services to get the treatment which he requires.  That is the primary purpose&mdash;to improve the services&mdash;although we do think, and I want to repeat it, that as well as improving the services which is the primary objective, we will also eventually secure a certain degree of economy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the speech which I made on the Second Reading of the Bill, dealing with Cork and I think he quoted me quite accurately. I did say that the existing staffs and existing institutions will have to be maintained but there is the fact that we shall be able to make more effective use of these institutions and of these staffs.  That is what we hope to do.  We are not proposing at this stage to close any institutions although the time may come&mdash;and with the blessing of Providence will come&mdash;when we should certainly be able to find another use for say, Sarsfield Court, but at the present moment it is not proposed to close any institution what we do hope is this: If we secure the unification which we are looking for, if we can make these institutions available for the use of every person in Cork city and county, the need <Col N="171" /> to enlarge institutions, to spend more money on buildings will be obviated. That is the purpose and that is why I said that at the moment we must maintain the existing institutions and staffs but we hope by reason of what we are doing in this Bill to obviate the need&mdash;I am sorry to be repetitive, but I want this to get home&mdash;for further building and perhaps building which time will show to have been unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Now, I did say also that, for the time, until it is clearly demonstrated that there is no need to do so, the Cork unified health authority will have to maintain its existing facilities which it has in Mallow and elsewhere&mdash; Clonakilty I think &mdash; for the convenience of those members of the public who have to avail of them. What I do think, however, is that here again we will be able to avoid an unnecessary expansion of staff because in most instances we have three staffs. We certainly have in Dublin.  We have three separate staffs, perhaps, dealing with the one person and it would be much more economical if we were able to have that one person dealt with by one unit of staff rather than by three separate units.</P>
    <P>Another thing, I think the Deputy was under a misapprehension as to what is going to happen under this Bill.  The existing R.M.S. or R.M.O. as the case may be, in the mental hospital will maintain his status.  So also will the R.M.S. in the case of the sanatoria. The county physicians serving the hospitals in Bantry and Mallow and the county surgeons will all maintain their status.  We are not going to put one hospital over the other in any way, but what we do hope is that, perhaps, in due time, we will be able to dispense, say, with one county medical officer.  There is, I think, a vacancy already or, if there is not one already in Cork, one is about to arise.  The same is the case in Dublin.  It will not be necessary to fill one of these vacancies if we have this unified authority because the top man there will be able to serve the city and county as a whole.  He may need an additional assistant but <Col N="172" /> at least that additional assistant will receive an assistant's remuneration and will not be receiving the remuneration of a county officer.</P>
    <P>That is the situation in relation to it.  That is the only case I can think of where there is likely to be any substantial change in that direction.  Let me put this again.  While, with the need to maintain and improve the health services, we do not anticipate that there is going to be any reduction in staff, and certainly not any that could be regarded as drastic, we do think that there will be a fuller utilisation of the services of the staffs and of the institutions and that, as I have said so often, but I would like to get it over even by this sort of uninteresting repetition, we do hope that we may be spared the need to incur certain capital expenditure involving loan charges, and additional burdens upon the ratepayers and that we can utilise whatever money we may be able to save in the way for the future extension of the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct one mistake the Minister made.  I am afraid that he is so anxiously looking after Dublin that he has not kept himself up to date in regard to Cork.  The houses built by the Corporation of Cork outside the previous city boundaries have been taken inside the city boundaries of Cork and are portion of the city now.  I would just like to correct that portion of the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>In so far as play is being made about those living outside the city, I would make a present of it and let them all into the city.  We are better off without them, together with the bill that they are costing the county.  They said, &ldquo;No fear.  We are not taking them&rdquo;.  I should like the Minister to look at the loan charges for housing, sanitary arrangements, sewerage arrangements and all such facilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not dealing with the Department of Health in general, a Cheann Comhairle.  What I am dealing with is a previous move of the same Department.  This thing was tried before.  We had a Board of Health before for Cork County.  I admit that the city was not embraced in our arms that time.  The Board of Health consisted of eight members who were to look after housing, sanitary services, everything in the county, for about eight years.  It lasted about two years and was withdrawn in fear and trembling by the Department, who fell back and left it so.  I never exactly found out the means by which it was abolished but it was abolished.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> I said on the Second Reading of this Bill that as far as I was concerned I was supporting the Bill for one thing that is in it, and that is, that the unfortunate people of South Cork rural area were no longer going to be loaded with, not alone their own poor, but the poor of Cork City.  However, I do not believe there will be the economies the Minister has suggested.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, being of opinion that it is not in the national interest that cross-Channel shipping should remain almost exclusively under foreign control, requests the Government to institute, as a matter of urgency, an investigation into the whole position with a view to securing that a substantial proportion of the Cross-Channel trade shall be brought under Irish control.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the outset, in dealing with this motion, I should like to make some reference to the history and development of cross-Channel shipping over the years.  As a maritime nation, Ireland has all the advantages of her geographical position.  She also suffers from the disadvantages in that she must import virtually all the essential raw materials she lacks; in the main, these have to be delivered by sea transport and practically all the exports which she needs to maintain national solvency must be carried in ships from her shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present pattern of cross-channel shipping can be traced from the developments which took place from the early years of the 19th century onwards.  These were the years of the industrial revolution in England with its consequent demand for cheap Irish labour and cheap Irish agricultural produce.  In exchange Ireland secured British manufactured goods and raw materials, especially coal, for her increasing urban population and for her limited industrial development. The military occupation of the country <Col N="175" /> and the preponderance of British influence at the time set the seal on the position which exists to-day.</P>
    <P>A century and a half later the movement of Irish workers to England to build factories, roads and railways extended the movement of passengers by sea and the subsequent exchanges of mail.  The personnel and supplies were shipped back and forth across the Channel.  The service of military forces stationed in Ireland and the growing army of urban workers in England, this type of traffic proved an attractive proposition to enterprising investors of whom the vast bulk were British due to the lack of adequate capital and business influence amongst Irish nationals.  Those who could and did invest were subsequently bought out or forced out and contracts for the carriage of mail and goods were awarded to loyal subjects.  Thus from the earliest days the carriage of goods across the Irish sea was consolidated in non-national hands.</P>
    <P>The improvement in rail and road facilities around the middle eighteen hundreds rendered uneconomic the small ports particularly in the West of Ireland which had been developed to service the needs of local areas through the media of small sailing ships.  This gave rise to further centralisation which has developed to such an extent that to-day four ports handle over eighty per cent. of our trade, the remainder being shared by the other ports and the air companies.  The same four ports to-day handle over ninety per cent. of the seaborne trade and the decline in the imports of coal and grain over the past thirty years has further resulted in the consolidation of trade between England and Ireland through the east coast ports.</P>
    <P>The introduction of steam propulsion had a profound effect on cross-Channel shipping.  The railway companies saw the advantages of coordinated rail and sea traffic for passengers, goods and mail.  They built suitable ships, developed the necessary ports and gradually ousted the smaller companies which lacked the essential capital or influence.  To-day British Railways are the inheritors of several smaller shipping companies <Col N="176" /> which once linked Ireland, Britain and the Continent.</P>
    <P>At present there are eight companies operating a wholetime liner service between the Republic and the cross-Channel ports.  All are British-owned save one.  In the case of two, their ships are registered under the Irish flag.  Four of the companies are in the Coast Lines group and two are independent. The biggest of the lot is, of course, British Railways which services four ports and operates many passenger and cargo craft.  These companies were formed during the first half of the last century.</P>
    <P>This combination of British concerns operates cargo services to the four main ports of the east coast, Drogheda, Dundalk, Dublin and Rosslare, and two main ports in the South, Waterford and Cork.  These services handle three-quarters of our exports and one-quarter of our imports. No British company provides a service on the West coast of Ireland where 5 per cent. of the country's total trade is handled between the six principal ports there and, further, none of the British companies concerned operates on a route covered by one or other of its competitors.</P>
    <P>This network of foreign-owned shipping services is so completely and closely knit that all efforts by outsiders to enter the field have failed. The vested interest created by privilege has continued down the years to the great disadvantage of the Irish economy.  The growth of the railways on both sides of the Channel in the second quarter of the nineteenth century raised problems connected with the through transport of goods between the different systems.  At the outset it was the practice of certain companies to come together voluntarily to secure the provision of through facilities for traffic.  Eventually in 1864 it was decided to form the first cross-Channel Conference, namely, the Irish Traffic Conference to deal with livestock and goods traffic.  During the years that have passed since 1864, a number of these conferences have been formed, have failed and have been re-formed.  In 1867 the Irish and English Traffic Conference was formed. In 1870 the Irish Cattle Traffic Conference was formed.  In 1874 the <Col N="177" /> South of Ireland Traffic Conference was formed.  These three conferences continued until 1914 when they were replaced by the Irish and English Livestock Conference.  In 1950 the Irish and English Goods Traffic Conference was formed.  This continued for a number of years and in 1925 were added to by the Scottish and Irish Traffic Conference.  In 1937 a certain amount of consolidation took place and the Irish and English Traffic Conference was formed.  This continued up to 1951 when the present Irish and British Traffic Conference was formed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Some indication of the reduction in the number of steamshipping, railway and canal companies can be gauged from the numbers which formed the various traffic conferences over the past 35 years.  In 1915, there were 17 steamshipping companies, 28 railway companies and one canal company, a total of 46 companies in all.</P>
      <P>In 1937 this total had fallen to less than half of which the number of steamship companies had been reduced to nine and the number of railway companies to 12.  In 1958 when the Tribunal was set up to inquire into the position of cross-channel rates, there were only 12&mdash;eight steamship companies and four railways.  The number of railway companies has since been reduced by one by the passing out of operation of the Great Northern Railway.  The present cross-channel Conference is composed of the British Transport Commission, the British and Irish Steamship Company and their subsidiary, the Cork Steamship Company, the Burns and Laird Line and the Limerick Steamship Company, which is the only one registered in the State, the Clyde Shipping Company, the Belfast and Manchester Steamship Company, C.I.E., the Isle of Man Company, the Ulster Transport Authority and the Wexford Steamship Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some indication of the importance of the cross-channel trade is indicated by the following figures: In 1938 the <Col N="178" /> total inward and outward trade amounted to 921,000 tons.  In 1950 it amounted to 870,000 tons and in 1957 it amounted to 864,000 tons.  A breakdown of the exports for 1957 indicates that livestock accounted for almost 35 per cent. of the total exports.  The Coast Lines and their associated companies got 56 per cent. of the total trade, the British Transport Commission got 25 per cent. and the remaining small shipping companies got 19 per cent. of the livestock trade the Coast Lines had 61 per cent., British Transport Commission 37 per cent. and the remainder only got 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Some idea of the importance of the cross-channel trade to this country can be further emphasised in terms of money by the import and export figures over the past seven years from 1952 to 1958.  The total imports for the seven years in question amounted to £676,000,000 and exports, including re-exports, amounted to £555,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, external trade to Great Britain.  That makes a total of £1,231,000,000.  To further emphasise the importance of the cross-channel trade to this country, I should like to touch on the question of passenger traffic over the same years, 1952 to 1958.  The total number of persons who travelled to Great Britain from Ireland in those seven years was 5,200,000.  The total who returned from Great Britain to this country, and this is a significant figure, amounted to 4,948,000.  In spite of the growing competition from the air the total of passengers travelling by air back and forth to Great Britain is still very substantially lower than those travelling by sea.  Even in 1958 a total number of passengers travelling by sea to Britain of 783,00 was substantially greater than the total of 239,000 travelling by air.  Over those seven years the number of people who travelled by air and returned by air is almost automatically the same, while there is a significant difference between the numbers of those who travelled out by sea and the number who returned in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> The cross-Channel cargo and livestock trade is almost completely owned and controlled by British interests. British Railways operate a cargo cum-passenger cum-mail service between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead and Rosslare and Fishguard.  The Burns and Laird Company operates the Glasgow and Dublin route and the British and Irish Steam Packet Company operates the Dublin-Liverpool route.  These figures indicate that there is no competing service on any of these routes by the British owned services.  Cross-Channel services are completely owned and controlled by the British Railways and by Coast Lines and its subsidiary companies. The Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire route, the Rosslare-Fishguard route and the Waterford-Fishguard route is operated by British Railways while the Dublin-Liverpool route is operated by the B. and I. and the Dublin-Glasgow route by Burns and Laird.</P>
    <P>Since 1939 44 steamships have been transferred from the Irish register with the result that today's tonnage is little in excess of the 1937 figure of 137,000 tons.  There is no control over replacements.  In 1926 the B.&amp;I. had 50 vessels and now they have only eight.  Since 1939 British Railways have transferred three passenger ships and five cargo ships from our register.  In spite of increased traffic there is no increase in the number of ships on the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire route.  Some of the vessels have been increased in size and carrying capacity but not to a sufficient extent.  In the B.&amp;I. there has been a reduction of almost one-third in the number of ships.  The pre-war total of three ships has been reduced to two with a greater amount of space allocated to cattle than in the previous ships.  This is probably much more profitable to the company but is not so good for the passenger traffic.</P>
    <P>This question of passenger traffic is of fundamental importance to the tourist industry.  Passenger traffic has increased by over 70 per cent. while British Railways have increased their carrying capacity by only 40 per cent. while the B.&amp;I. have reduced their <Col N="180" /> carrying capacity by about 30 per cent. compared to pre-war.  Hardly a summer passes without some complaint of the treatment of passengers on the cross-Channel routes.  Many of these are tourists coming to Ireland for the first time so that their first impressions must be very bad ones.</P>
    <P>It is certain their experience in Ireland, however pleasant their holiday may be, will to some extent be coloured at least by their experience passing to this country and away from it.</P>
    <P>There is no means of knowing what profits or losses accrue to the British companies which control our cross-Channel services.  According to a statement made before the Tribunal set up to inquire into the level of the cross-Channel freight rates, the Holyhead-Dublin losses amounted to £75,000; the Fishguard-Rosslare losses amounted to £100,000 and the Fishguard-Waterford losses amounted approximately to £51,000.  Losses on the North Wall service went back to 1952.  During the three years prior to that, there had been slight profits.  The Rosslare-Fishguard services had been losing since 1951.</P>
    <P>No information is available in regard to the financial returns of the British and Irish service but certainly its parent company, Coast Lines, has been making very satisfactory profits over a number of years.  It is certain that, even if the shipping companies themselves are not making profits, various concerns which sell their goods and services benefit substantially owing to the large annual amounts paid in cross-Channel freights by Irish exporters and importers.  Some estimate of this sum can be made by calculating the freight content of imports and exports.</P>
    <P>In the years 1952 to 1958, the total trade between Great Britain and Ireland amounted to some £12 million. If the freight content is estimated at 10 per cent., this would give a total of £123 million.  If we take a figure of 7½ per cent., we get a total figure of £92 million.  If even half the lower figure, that is, £46 million, could have been spent in this country it would have brought considerable benefit to Irish shipyards, provisioning merchants, <Col N="181" /> ships' chandlers, dock workers, and so on.</P>
    <P>If the Free Trade Area materialises, as seems almost certain in some form, it will result in a considerable increase in inter-European trade, both cross-country and cross-Channel.  Such a development will mean greater competition with the other European countries and will make it more than ever necessary for our producers and manufacturers to be efficient and progressive. How can they or the country take full advantage of this new and greatly expanded market if they have no control over the essential cross-Channel services?  The same will, of course, apply in the event of an expanded and progressive Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.</P>
    <P>In October, 1957, the present Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, after, I think, the seventh consecutive increase in cross-Channel freights, decided to act in the matter.  On 23rd October, 1957, as reported in Volume 164, Column 67, of the Official Report, he stated:</P>
    <P>The importance of shipping charges on the competitive position of Irish exports is obvious.  During recent months there have been discussions in my Department with a representative cross section of firms engaged in the export trade. These discussions were directed towards ascertaining and remedying the difficulties which impede further development of our exports. With a remarkable degree of unanimity, these firms have referred to cross-Channel shipping arrangements and freights as being one of the greatest deterrents to the full development of their export trades.</P>
    <P>Further on, he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Before leaving that point, however, I would request Deputies not to confuse the issue raised in the motion with the question of the possible extension of Irish control in cross-Channel shipping operations. The two issues are quite distinct and separate.  The problem of high freight charges and of concerted action to arrange the charges <Col N="182" /> could conceivably arise, even if only Irish controlled companies were engaged in the trade, and indeed a number of the companies which are involved in the arrangement to be investigated are Irishregistered companies.</P>
    <P>Then he went on to say:</P>
    <P>It may be, of course, that the inquiry may reveal information which will have a bearing on the other issue, but that is another day's work.  I may say also that there are some discussions taking place regarding the possibility of an extension of Irish control in cross-Channel shipping.  Apart, however, from indicating that the matter is having active attention, I am satisfied that it would not be helpful if I were to say more at this stage.</P>
    <P>In the same discussion, I said, after the Minister had spoken, as reported at Column 73:</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that one should not confuse the issue.  There are not two confusing issues but rather they are all part of the one issue.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister is putting the cart before the horse. This is the seventh or eighth increase in cross-Channel shipping charges over the past few years.  I feel that, if the recent 7½ per cent. increase had not taken place, the Minister would not now be setting up a tribunal to inquire into the level of freights, and other matters.</P>
    <P>Later on, I said, as reported at column 74:</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that consideration is being given to the question of some participation by this country in the cross-Channel trade.  My only regret is that the question of this participation was not considered and something done about it over the past 30 odd years.</P>
    <P>In his reply, the present Taoiseach, Deputy S. Lemass, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, said, as reported at column 87:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> The purpose of this inquiry is to ascertain the facts and report on the facts.  When the facts are known, in so far as it will be possible for the inquiry to produce the facts, then decisions on policy will be taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>Further on, at the same column, he said:</P>
    <P>The disturbing factor in relation to the shipping freight rates is the regularity of the increases notwithstanding the frequent fluctuations which have taken place in freight rates upon other shipping services, on this cross-Channel service they have gone up step by step almost, as Deputy Lynch said, year by year and they have gone up on the basis of a percentage increase applied to existing rates without any reference to the economics of any particular type of traffic...</P>
    <P>When he was concluding, he said, as reported at Column 89:</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with the question of charging for a service, not with the adequacy of the facilities or the desirability of Irish participation in that service which, though an important question, is a separate question, and I emphasised that these two questions were distinct and separate because, as I said, some action in regard to the extension of Irish control of the shipping services is proceeding and I do not intend that that action should be impeded in any way by the fact that this inquiry is taking place.  There is no reason why it should be delayed on account of the passing of this motion by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>At the end of his speech, the then Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We will consider then the steps that can be taken to deal with this problem of shipping rates of cross-channel services.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Volume 164, Sir. Following the debate on the setting <Col N="184" /> up of the tribunal, an article appeared in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of October 13th. 1957&mdash;I must say a very well-written article and a clarion call to us in this country about the strange-hold of the monopolists who could choke us to death.  I quote from the article:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass has announced a public inquiry into cross-channel rates.  This enquiry will be one of the most important events in modern Irish history.  It may herald in one of the greatest economic battles of our era.  Over the centuries the British have ruined our shipping trade.  When they had killed it, they monopolised it for themselves. Now their monopolists are putting our whole economic position in peril.</P>
      <P>It is a consistent consideration of British policy, and the fact that we have gained political independence has not wiped out the terrible wrong this nation has suffered when Britain, by foul and fair means, was building up her empire.  Now is our chance to stand and fight.  Now is Britain's opportunity to right an ancient wrong.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He quotes the I.B.E.C.&mdash;that is the American report of 1952&mdash;which said that its data indicated that Ireland, overall, paid out at least seven times the amount in foreign exchange for transport what it received for transport services rendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote a letter to the editor of the <i>Irish Press</i> suggesting that while the idea of setting up the tribunal to inquire into freights was an excellent one, I felt that the first and most important factor was to secure an adequate degree of control over, or at least, a participation in the cross-Channel shipping services.  But as Deputies are aware the tribunal held a number of public sittings during last year and finally it issued its report about the middle of 1959.  That report is an extremely interesting report. There is no doubt that great credit is due to the members of the tribunal.  I do not know how many Deputies have read the report through in detail; I did and found it extremely interesting and as Deputy Haughey has noted, a very revealing one.  Certainly it provided <Col N="185" /> me with most of the data I raised here this evening but I beg leave to make some quotations from the members of the tribunal because I think they are very relevant to this motion and I think are of importance to the country.</P>
    <P>I quoted from page 138 of the Report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;External trade forms a high proportion of the national income. In 1955-56 exports represented one-fifth of the gross national product compared with 15 per cent. in Great Britain while only the Netherlands, among O.E.E.C. countries, devoted a higher proportion of the national expenditure to imports.  Of the total annual imports in the years 1954 to 1957, inclusive, from 50 per cent. to 55 per cent. originated in Britain. The proportion of our exports going to Britain was much higher, ranging from 74 per cent. in 1954 to 60 per cent in 1957.  In addition to sea traffic the figures include goods carried by air and cross-border traffic originating in or consigned to Britain.  Live cattle represented by far the most important single item in our export trade with Britain accounting for 40 per cent. of the total value of the trade in 1957.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to give figures for cattle exported in 1955, 1956 and 1957 as 484,000 of which 80 per cent. were stores.  About 98 per cent. of the livestock shipped in 1957 were shipped by subsidiaries of the B.T.C.  Livestock accounts for about 30 per cent. of the volume of traffic for 1957 and 84 per cent. of the total volume of livestock traffic passed through the port of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to comment on page 145:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is notable that the general level of internal Irish railway rates increased by a smaller percentage between 1938 and 1957 than did through rates in the cross-channel trade...  On the other hand, internal British railway rates, despite rapid intensification of road competition in recent years, increased by a greater overall percentage during this period than did Irish railway rates....  The position of sea transport, <Col N="186" /> however appears to reflect the absence of the sort of competition which the railways had to meet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that since 1938 the actual increases accruing to sea transport have exceeded those for the rail portion of the through rates and have substantially exceeded the increases in the internal rates of C.I.E. I do not know whether that was intended to make C.I.E.'s rates too low or cross-Channel rates too high&mdash;possibly some of both.  It states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Consequently while the sea portion of the through rates increased by about 45 per cent. from 1951 to 1957, inclusive, the port to port rates increased by 60 per cent.  The difference between the increases in the general level of rates for sea and rail cannot be explained on the grounds of costs as the financial experience of the railways would scarcely support this.  A more probable explanation would appear to lie in the competition experienced by rail as compared with sea transport. Until recent years when ferry services emerged in the Six County trade, shipping undertakings did not have to meet anything approaching the intensity of competition that has for so long existed between road and rail transport.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to confirm the competition or lack of competition making the significant observation:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is evident that the primary concern of the Conference members has been with the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> in the sense of the existing relationship of traffic flows by the various routes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At any rate, it is clear that the members view any sudden disturbance of this pattern with alarm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, to summarise the substance of the Tribunal's report, I think it is correct to say that while they did not find evidence of gross overcharging in respect of cross-Channel rates, they did find evidence that the existing companies who formed the cross-Channel Conference opposed any form of competition from newer types of cross-Channel services. Evidence is shown in this Report that when an effort was made to establish ferry services between this country and England, they were blocked by the action of the established shipping companies who eventually took them over altogether.  The Tribunal is of opinion that this new development, ferry services, would be a very useful, indeed a very vital, cross-Channel link for this country, which depends so much on the quick and efficient transport of goods, particularly agricultural produce and livestock from this country to Great Britain.</P>
      <P>May I quote the concluding paragraph of the Report, which suggests:</P>
      <P>(i) A valuable safeguard could be provided by greater Irish participation in the cross-Channel trade.  Since the area where a compromise on rates is most likely to be made is in the provision of ferry services, it is here that participation would probably be most effective.  There are clearly aspects of such a course which are outside the scope of the Tribunal and which would require examination, particularly in relation to the needs of the livestock trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to submit that if we agree that the present position is, to say the least of it, highly unsatisfactory, the time has surely come when the Government should take action in the matter.  As I indicated in quotations from speeches of the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Taoiseach, two and a half years go he apparently was taking some action in connection with the question of Irish participation in the cross-Channel services.  During the two <Col N="188" /> and a half years that have passed since then no indication has been given to the Dáil of the progress made in these efforts, or indeed if any progress at all has been made.</P>
    <P>With the present set-up in cross-Channel shipping trade it is quite impossible for any private enterprise effort to enter into the trade.  Apart from the question of the purchasers of ships, which would be extremely heavy, there is the question of port facilities on both sides of the Channel, the question of lairages and other services that go hand in hand with shipping.  All these are completely tied up under the ownership which has existed for almost 100 years.  Anyone endeavouring to break into that tightly-knit circle would be faced with an impossible task.  It seems to me that there are only two joint ways in which this country can get some measure of adequate control over this vital service. No. 1 is, as I have indicated earlier on, to seek by negotiation an adequate share in the cross-Channel shipping services, either through joint participation with the British Transport Commission or with Coast Lines, which is the other large interest involved. Secondly, I think the present Minister should make an all-out effort to establish a regular ferry service between this country and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the ferry service I should like to see a container service established.  I know that in stating this there are certain difficulties in the way of establishing such a service, that the dockers have indicated they will only accept such a service on certain conditions.  But I believe that, with energy on the part of the Minister and goodwill on both sides, a way could be found for ensuring a substantial Irish participation in these cross-Channel services.</P>
    <P>I notice in recent reports in British newspapers a suggestion that British Railways are due for a drastic overhaul of their entire services and it has been suggested that their hotel interests and also their shipping interests may be disposed of.  If there is any substance in these reports, I would suggest to the Minister that <Col N="189" /> this might offer an opportunity to gain a foothold in the cross-Channel trade.</P>
    <P>Finally, might I say that any suggestions or any criticisms I have offered here are made in the hope that the Minister will appreciate that if this country is going to expand in the era ahead, if this Anglo-Irish Trade Conference comes to fruition&mdash; as we all hope it will&mdash;and if it is going to lead to a substantial expansion in trade between the two countries and between the two countries and the Continent of Europe, it is vitally necessary that we have an adequate measure of control over an economic and efficient shipping service between this country and Great Britain and Great Britain and the Continent.</P>

      <P>I wish to say at the outset that the Government have no objection to the acceptance in principle of the motion because in fact this question of seeing what can be done to improve the cross-Channel services is under examination and has been under examination for some time.  I was very interested to hear Deputy Russell's carefully composed analysis of the general position.  It will save me the need to repeat a good deal of the statistics which he brought into play in discussing this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, just to put the picture at balance, it is true, of course, that there is no completely Irish cross-Channel service of any magnitude.  There are two small companies who have a certain amount of trade.  Then, of course, there is the British and Irish Steampacket Company which is an Irish registered company although owned by Coast Lines Limited.  The vessels are Irish registered, Irish people are employed and the headquarters are in Dublin.  A vessel was recently built at Liffey Dockyard at a cost of £500,000 and a sum of £45,000 is spent in repairs annually.  I simply mention that in order to indicate that there is <Col N="190" /> some Irish participation in the cross-channel trade, though not of a fundamental kind in the sense that there is no very large company of 100 per cent. Irish interest carrying livestock and goods and passengers across the Channel.</P>
    <P>There have been certain changes in the pattern of cross-Channel traffic that have occurred in the past few years, one of which has been the concentration of traffic and goods through the ports of Dublin and Cork.  In 1927 half the total exports and imports carried by sea were through the port of Dublin and by 1954 the proportion had risen to two-thirds.  A considerable amount of money has been spent on the improvement of port facilities in the smaller ports around the coast and that has had the effect largely of stabilising the position since 1950.  In other words, the tonnage brought into and from the smaller Irish ports has neither shown any increase or decrease since that date.</P>
    <P>Quite evidently there has been this concentration of traffic through the port of Dublin in spite of reasonably sufficient&mdash;I think&mdash;efforts by Governments to modernise the small ports.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals have been made in connection with the problem of greater Irish participation in cross-Channel trade and I think I should give some indication of the present position because there have been changes taking place fairly continually during the period that this problem has been under examination.  As indicated by Deputy Russell the existing traffic is handled by very well organised undertakings who have the ships, the personnel and what is more important, tremendous dock and warehousing facilities both at British ports and at the port of Dublin.  I think it is possible to say immediately that to establish an entirely new undertaking, a new Irish company engaged in cross-Channel traffic either for goods or for passengers would be extremely difficult.  The mere difficulty of acquiring the necessary port space at British ports, for example, would be almost impossible to surmount.  It would require many millions of capital, and to find the necessary <Col N="191" /> depreciation for brand new vessels and at the same time &ldquo;break in&rdquo; competitively into long established traffic carried out by competitive concerns would, I think, be a hazardous operation.</P>
    <P>The alternative is to buy an existing undertaking or to take a share in one. I should like to mention that Irish Shipping experimented for a time with two vessels and tried to get traffic but was unable to secure business from importers and finally had to convert the vessels acquired for the purpose of entering this trade to carrying traffic to the Continent.  I should make it absolutely clear that if any action of a positive kind is to be taken in relation to our cross-Channel traffic we must be certain that it will reduce freight costs. I see no other purpose in investing money in any existing undertaking or taking part in an existing undertaking unless we can be sure that freight costs will come down.  As is well known both here and in the Six Counties our very lifeblood depends on competitive export trade and every element of cost in that trade, whether in relation to agriculture or livestock or to industry is of vital importance so that we would have to be absolutely certain that participation would mean that the service would be more efficient, more speedy and less costly. We would naturally be glad if, as a result of such participation, increased employment could be given to our own people but the major factor must, under our circumstances, be the effect on costs.  If we were to take part in carrying passengers we must be certain that we shall be able to generate more passenger traffic that does not exist now and not merely make passenger traffic generally more pleasant for the existing traffic.  In other words we must be certain we can produce results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it would not be sufficient to do that alone.  We would like to make travel more pleasant <Col N="192" /> but at the same time if there was to be a great amount of capital involved we must be certain that there would be other desirable results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the other is a legitimate aspiration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Like Deputy Russell, I have read the report of the cross-Channel Tribunal two or three times very carefully and I cannot help feeling that they have quite rightly expressed the view that, taking it by and large, there have been no excessive rate charges and that many of the fears expressed about enormous profits being made at the expense of exporters and importers do not seem to have been justified.  Some of the figures they give there are interesting.  They have shown that there have been greater increases in certain types of rates.  I should like to refer to one statement made that, taking the general price index as 100 in 1938 and as 338 in 1958, the land portion of freight rates went up to the figure of 307 while the sea portion went up to 340, that is to say, the sea portion of through rates. The livestock charge went up to 311 and the port-to-port rates&mdash;rates of charges purely from port to port&mdash;for goods to 388, a figure somewhat above the general price index.</P>
      <P>The Tribunal remarked on those figures and concluded, as I said, that there had been no evidence of excessive rates being charged.  They criticised the Irish traffic conference in rather measured terms for having resisted innovation in certain types of traffic at the same time making it quite clear that the resistance was of a temporary kind&mdash;in other words, that they would show co-operation as soon as the methods for carrying goods inevitably changed&mdash;their resistance, so to speak, was limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal reported equally that the collective arrangements of the conference were not inimical as a whole to the interests of the country.  The tribunal also commented on the statements in regard to profits made by the various concerns and the profits reported and published indicated that at no time did they appear to be excessive. <Col N="193" /> They were steadily reducing all through the last five years&mdash;that is up to the time the tribunal reported&mdash;and, allowing for replacing ships and depreciation, some of the concerns were showing losses in 1957.  Some of them succeeded, through the combination of carrying passengers as well as cargo and in the Report the various profits and losses for the different types of carriage, are analysed.  As Deputy Russell indicated, the British Transport Commission reported a very heavy loss. One of the interesting features of the report was that although complaints were made by individual importers and exporters in regard to the freight charged they found it very difficult to make comparisons with freight charges to and from ports in other countries. I think that was largely because of the short haul.  The complaints made were mostly of an individual character and as far as I can gather from reading the report they relate to special types of goods for which there were no specially reduced rates.</P>
    <P>There was one complaint in regard to charges for motor cars being greater than the charges on routes of roughly the same distance elsewhere.  One or two other comments were made but in general one could not say that exporters and importers had presented evidence to the tribunal really proving the existence of excessive rates. As I said, the comparison is difficult because of the short haul and it may be noted that some of the shipping companies reported that 40 per cent. of the cost of transport for goods here was incurred at ports and not on ships at all.  Of course, 40 per cent. is a very high figure.  It is impossible to compare the freight rate on goods, say, from Dublin to Naples with the freight rate from Dublin to Liverpool unless you compare the proportion of port costs to the cost of the actual transport on the ship.</P>
    <P>The tribunal also had some comments on the cost of handling in the port of Dublin and reported that one of the factors that enter into the port charges was the high cost of handling goods at Dublin.  They gave the figure of £1.066 per ton as the average cost <Col N="194" /> of handling dry cargo as compared with £.825 at Liverpool and £.875 at Manchester, again indicating that factors outside the immediate control of the Shipping Company enter into freight charges as a whole.</P>
    <P>So much for the background facts in relation to this whole problem.</P>
    <P>During all this period there have been fairly continuous changes on the part of the various carriers concerned in the method of charging for rates which, again, make it very difficult to take a firm decision as to what part we can play in the cross-Channel shipping world.  For example, in Great Britain the railways are gradually changing over from charging on the basis of the value of the goods to charging on the basis of the physical characteristics of the goods and the ease with which they can be carried on a train.  In the case of both Great Britain and our own railway system here the establishment of package charges and greater freedom to charge individual consignors individual rates have again altered the position.  At the same time heavy competition of road traffic with rail traffic has been a very noteworthy factor in keeping rates down.  Most important of all, the container business has commenced and, although the container ban operates at the Port of Dublin, except for certain types of livestocks and other goods, it is in full operation in the Six Counties and has very greatly altered the position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What kind of livestock do you ship in a container?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;livestock products. It has been highly successful in the Six Counties and the result of the container ban here has been to divert traffic to Belfast, to Rosslare and Waterford and a further result has been a reduction in the total number of sailings by the British Transport Commission, who intended to specialise in container traffic.  Their <Col N="195" /> container business rapidly expanded up to the point of the ban in 1956. It is absolutely certain that when, as we hope, the negotiations in regard to the container ban here have proved successful, there will be very considerable changes in the pattern and the flow of traffic and this in turn will create new problems of its own.</P>
      <P>Cargo ships have to be adapted to take container traffic.  Specialist ships can be built for carrying containers and for operating ferry services and that, in turn, will have some effect, possibly, upon the rate structure for all types of traffic.  None of us can foresee the future but if container services develop they will take, it is believed, the cream of the traffic, the traffic that used be charged for at high rates because it consisted of goods of high value, presenting the old fashioned type of carrier and carriers dealing with livestock and with commodities that cannot be taken in containers with the problem that they have lost some of the more valuable traffic to container services and that will again alter the profit pattern in regard to a number of these services.</P>
      <P>So that, the whole position of transport across the channel is in a state of flux and has been so for two or three years.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister what categories of commodities has he in mind for transfer in containers which are now not eligible for container traffic?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, all the raw materials for light industries, for example, goods of that description, raw materials for the radio industry, the light metal industries, anything that can be conveniently put into a container and, of course, the ban on containers, as the Deputy knows, also applies to turkeys at the present time although it does not apply to carcass meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The assembly of turkeys for installation in containers presents a domestic transit problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. <Col N="196" /> I think it should be clear to the House that this is not an easy problem to solve, that if you took any particular action at this moment in the direction of participating in this traffic it would be difficult to see what the result would be having regard to the changing patterns that are quite evident.  If we are going to take any action we want, naturally, if we can, to underbid the existing traffic rates, to lower the costs of exports and imports, to assist industrialists and to assists the farmers. As I have said, we intend to examine this question and if we feel that by participation we can assist the country's trade we shall, naturally, take positive action.</P>
      <P>I can certainly make it quite clear that the cost involved would be very high.  It will not be, as I have said, a question to any great extent of generating new goods traffic; it will be a question of carrying existing traffic and, perhaps some new traffic at a lower cost and the capital cost naturally, has to be considered in relation to the whole of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the suggestions of the tribunal was that a voluntary committee representative of shippers should be formed to examine shipping problems and discuss them with the traffic conference.  I am glad to say that certain representatives of Irish shippers have already interested themselves at my request in establishing a committee on the lines envisaged by the tribunal and the Irish and British Traffic Conference has also expressed general agreement with the tribunal's recommendation and I hope to be able to announce the formation of a committee on a satisfactory basis fairly soon.  In relation to any decision we make it will be very valuable to have a live committee of traders who are in close contact with the countries and who perhaps will be able to underline some of the observations made in the tribunal's report, will be able in some cases perhaps to prove that the tribunal was conservative in its observations. Such a committee may raise problems which reflect the need for changes.  A closer connection between traders and the shipping conferences will be of considerable value and if they can <Col N="197" /> make any recommendations to me and to the Government which will help me to solve this very difficult problem I naturally shall be delighted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell referred to the number of boats serving passengers on the cross-Channel routes.  Of course there has been a great deal of dissatisfaction in the past.  Equally I must admit, as did my predecessor, that there has been a great improvement in regard to the carriage of passengers on the cross-Channel routes, particularly last year.  The number of sailings have increased as required on the days of peak travel, so one cannot really compare the number of vessels used; it is really a question of the number of sailings.</P>
    <P>The House knows there have been very great structural improvements at Dún Laoghaire, and those improvements are continuing.  It is intended to extend the accommodation for passengers on the pier by continuing the second storey around the whole of the pier and to provide an outlet for motor cars in the form of a special track.  A crane will be installed on the pier to assist in the quicker discharge of motor cars.  I understand that cranes are being established in the same way at Holyhead, and I hope the service will continue to improve there.  I am glad to say that last summer not a single person who had a sailing ticket was left behind.</P>
    <P>We must study the problem of how we are to participate at all in that traffic.  It is peak traffic and according to the statement of the British Transport Commission there are losses incurred each year.  It is very easy to provide extra vessels so that people can travel more comfortably but those vessels cannot be used in the winter months with the exception of the very few days at Christmas; it is virtually impossible to charter extra vessels because all the vessels carrying passengers on the various cross-Channel routes around the coast of Great Britain are equally competing for peak traffic.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while in theory it would be a grand thing if we could invest in a cross-Channel steamer passenger <Col N="198" /> service we would have to look into the cost to make quite sure the losses would not be of a very high order. We must always face the problem of the very high peak traffic in the summer months.  Deputies may have read reports of some of the discussions that have taken place both here and in Great Britain in regard to the general staggering of holidays.  There have been numerous discussions in Great Britain as to whether, in relation to school holidays, it would be possible to stagger the whole of the holiday traffic, so that it would extend from June until September.  If that should ever come about&mdash;it requires a degree of planning and ordering of people which probably would prove excessive&mdash;we would be able completely to solve the problem of the peak passenger services which operate during a very few weeks of the year.</P>
    <P>There is constant examination of this problem being made but conditions are changing so rapidly and the question of the carriage by containers is so vital and of such importance in making any examination or any proposals, that it would be impossible for me to say at what time I could form final conclusions.  I can only say we shall put the same degree of energy into the examination of the problem as we are, for example, putting into the generation of transatlantic air traffic, where efforts are being made to develop more traffic, although, as I have said, the problem is quite different in connection with the cross-Channel service because there you must draw traffic from competitive carriers to a very large degree in taking any action of the kind which involves capital investment on our part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole question of cross-Channel traffic is very important to our economy.  How far the general traffic can be considered as being of an importance similar to that which attaches to the live stock trade I am not qualified to say.  I do not know in how far we can expect materially to reduce our costs of industrial production by reducing freight rates of components in transferring them from their current form of shipment into <Col N="199" /> containers.  I cannot imagine that the differential could be very large.  It may be but I do not know.  However, I do know that the freight rates on live stock are a matter of vital consequence.</P>
      <P>This problem is one of immense complexity; it is not simply a question of measuring how much per bullock it costs to ship bullocks from the North Wall to Liverpool.  You must look into all the different kinds of freight rates that were at one time available and have from time to time been withdrawn.  There was a time when, if you loaded a beast at Ballinasloe, you could get a through rate for it from Ballinasloe to almost any town in England, and that was a very important concession to the live stock industry.  Most of these kinds of rates have now been withdrawn to the great detriment of the live stock industry but the withdrawal of this composite kind of rate makes it extremely difficult to compare current charges with charges in 1938 to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister rather shocked me when he blandly said, taking 1938 as 100 and 1960 as 320, or whatever it was, and finding the actual cross-Channel freight rate is 380, there was no great disparity here.  I think it is a very great disparity.  There has been a considerable advance in the facilities and in economies in the operation of shipping services between 1938 and 1960.  I would have expected that if the general rate of increase was of the order of 100 to 320 the Minister would have regarded himself as being satisfied if he discovered there was only an increase of 220 in respect of freight rates, but I am not a bit satisfied when he states that when everything else has gone up from 100 to 320, the freight charge on the shipment of live stock from here to Great Britain is 380.  This causes me extreme consternation and dismay and I am amazed that the Minister for Transport and Power who has nothing else to do, is not exerting himself to get a satisfactory explanation as to why these shipping companies are not able to show better <Col N="200" /> records than they are apparently in a position to do.</P>
    <P>What has happened in this connection is that, by a wide variety of minor adjustments of one kind or another, the live stock industry is bearing more than a fair increase in the freight rates payable between here and the ultimate destination in Great Britain.  I agree with the Minister in his apprehension that entering into the trade might not produce the results that are hoped for.  The Minister has nothing to do now but look after power and transport.  I often wondered were we daft when we set up this separate Ministry when I listen to the things the Minister talks about.  I used to handle the general question of transport rates on livestock from here to Great Britain when I was Minister for Agriculture as a kind of side show and it did not tax my capacity to do so.  I remember frequently interviewing these traffic conferences the Minister described and bringing the Live Stock Exporters Association and the traffic conferences together in consultation with the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that there was not a good deal of &ldquo;jiggery-pokery&rdquo; going on.  I remember that at one stage there used to be the question of wagon rates and then it became a matter of urgency as to who would fill the wagons and you discovered that the question of who would fill the wagons meant a difference of about 22/- per head in the transport of catle.</P>
    <P>I discovered that if you could get these men sitting down around a table you could get some sort of reasonable agreement between them.  It did some good and you could get some arrangements made.  They finally arrived at an agreement that the original arrangement would be continued provided that there would be a representative of the railway company present and, if there was an argument, there was some arrangement whereby an official of the railway company and an official of the livestock shippers would arbitrate and settle it there and then.  Thus, by operating a Health Robinson kind of arrangement, we succeeded in operating a transport system but, like most <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements <Col N="201" /> of that kind, it had the saving quality that it worked.  There was realisation and knowledge on both sides that if a irreconcilable argument did arise there was machinery to resolve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt for a moment, the port to port rate, that is for the loading of livestock at the port and the unloading at the port of destination, in 1957 was 298 as compared with a base index of 330. In regard to through rates the livestock rate was 341 compared with 330.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that the port to port rate is of a character that would entitle the Minister to say that it is fair enough.  When we come to the through rate, the Minister should be on his inquiry to ask why it has gone up substantially more than the overall rate.  We are entitled to ask the shipping companies for an explanation as to why that is so.  Doubtless they will make the case that they do not control the internal rail rates in England, that there is a rising level of wages in England and that the railway workers, having fallen behind the general trend, are seeking to recover their position, but, as against that, the railway companies are being modernised.  They are going over from steam to dieselisation, as we have done, and if they are losing something on wages they must be economising on the side of increased efficiency.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to say to them then that since 1948 we have quadrupled the numbers of livestock we are sending over their systems and if we are sending over four times what we were sending before there ought to be some sort of wholesale rate but, as far as we can see, the more we send the higher the price goes.  I would press very strongly that they stop these fantastic increases and that the increased volume of traffic should entitle us to a lower rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other point which I wish to make.  I want to concentrate on the matter of livestock because I believe that that is the important thing in so far as freight rates are concerned. <Col N="202" /> Turkeys may be of great importance and then there is this argument about containers but that is a matter which is not so easily solved.  Nobody has told us how you are going to put turkeys from the four corners of Ireland into containers.  You have got either to bring the turkeys to the containers or the containers to the turkeys.</P>
    <P>Nobody but a damn fool, and there are damn fools in this country, will go about bleating that our turkeys arrive in the Smithfield market in a state of decrepitude owing to the existing form of pack.  The existing form of pack is excellent and the turkeys arriving in Smithfield from Ireland compare favourably with turkeys arriving from any other country in Europe, or in the world for that matter, and they arrive in better condition than they do from any other source of supply in Europe. It is injurious and dangerous to a valuable trade for people to tramp all over this country and say that unless Irish turkeys arrive in the British market in containers they are not fit to eat.  Ninety-nine per cent. of the turkeys arriving in the British market from this country arrive in better condition than turkeys from any other country in Europe.  No other country can deliver them in as good condition.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Transport ought to be able to do something to make it easier for tourists to come to this country with a car.  There is no country in Europe into which it is more expensive or difficult to bring a motor car than this country and it ought to be one of the easiest.  The Minister should investigate, as a matter of high urgency, the facilities for tourists to bring a motor car here and the cost.  It would be a good investment and a good propaganda stunt to be able to say that Ireland is the cheapest country in Europe into which to bring a motor car and that anyone could bring a car here from any part of Great Britain for £1 during the tourist season.</P>
    <P>If we did that for three or four years and gave them every possible facility for transport we would find that we would get back in tourist income a great deal more than any cost in which it might involve us.  There is no use taking 3/4d.  off the freight of a car. <Col N="203" /> You have to make a big feature of the fact that Ireland is the cheapest country in the world into which to bring a tourist car.  Every car which comes in that way will bring three, four or perhaps five tourists with it and they will spend money in areas where it is most difficult to provide industry or other forms of employment at the present time.</P>
    <P>However, there would be no use persuading a vast number of people to tender cars for transport if you cannot take delivery of them but if we built the trade up sufficiently it might be possible to run a ship every night carrying cars.  There is such a car ferry running to certain Continental countries which carries nothing but cars and tourists.  I ask the Minister to give a decision on livestock transport and tourist car transport and he will be doing something really valuable for the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day, I asked the Minister two separate questions to which he gave one answer.  That is why I asked permission to raise both of them on the Adjournment.  I asked the Minister in Question No. 47 if he would state in respect of the years 1957, 1958 and 1959 the number of claims for unemployment benefit (a) made and (b) allowed.  Then, in Question No. 51, I asked the Minister if he would state in respect of the years 1957, 1958 and 1959 the number of claims for unemployment assistance (a) made and (b) allowed.  I was very much surprised with the Minister's reply that the information was not compiled by his Department.  I wonder why?  It is not information that it would be difficult to get.  It is vital and very useful information for members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peculiarly enough, I asked the Minister the very same question in respect of sickness and disability benefits. I asked him how many applications <Col N="204" /> had been made in the three years 1957, 1958 and 1959 and the number allowed.  I suggest that if I can get a reply to that Question I should very easily have got a reply to Questions Nos. 47 and 51.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that a person could make several applications for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance during the years and that it would be difficult to compile the different applications which even one person might make over the three years.  The same could be said in respect of disability and sickness benefits where a person who was sick three or four times in the year or maybe more often has to apply for either sickness or disability benefit.</P>
    <P>The amount of detailed information we have extracted from the Minister for Social Welfare on other occasions is extraordinary.  Questions were put down, to which replies were given, in respect of working days lost through illness.  Details were volunteered by the Parliamentary Secretary in respect of fraud.  He made a statement some two years ago about fraudulent claims and the fraudulent affixation of stamps.  He could give us very detailed information about fraudulent claims, about the number of prosecutions that have been made and about the number of convictions.</P>
    <P>We also had over the years&mdash;I remember giving them in my time, as well, when I was Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;details of investigations carried out by Social Welfare officers. Some members of the Fianna Fáil Party during 1954 to 1957 seemed to suggest that people in receipt of or applying for these benefits were being investigated much more frequently than before; incidentally the figures proved the contrary.  That information, which would not be as readily available as the information for which I asked today in Questions Nos. 47 and 51, could be got.</P>
    <P>We get many detailed statistics from the Taoiseach's Department through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach in an answer arising out of a very simple Question.  Whether or not the Taoiseach's Department is <Col N="205" /> more efficient than the Department of Social Welfare I do not know.  I am sure there is not much difference in the personnel or the calibre of the civil servants but the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach knows that, day after day he gives information which I readily admit is pretty difficult to obtain but it is obtainable because this is a public Assembly and Deputies who ask these Questions want the information for their own benefit and for the benefit of the public.</P>
    <P>I do not know, unless the Minister has a very convincing reply, what difficulty there might be in getting the information I require in regard to the number of applications made for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance and the number of claims allowed It seems quite simple to get that information from the local offices if it is not already in the Department. The Parliamentary Secretary, replying for the Minister, said: &ldquo;Statistics from which the information requested could be obtained are not compiled by my Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Maybe I am wronging the Parliamentary Secretary when I say he has refused to give this information.  When he says &ldquo;not compiled by my Department&rdquo; is the accent on &ldquo;my&rdquo; or does he suggest it is compiled by another Department?  Is it possible that the Questions addressed to the Minister for Social Welfare should have been addressed to the Taoiseach who is responsible for the compilation of statistics?</P>
    <P>The ordinary practice is that when a Question is sent from the Dáil Office to the Minister to whom the Deputy addresses it, if it is not appropriate to that Department it is passed along to another Department.  In view of the Parliamenary Secretary's reply, I must conclude that when he says &ldquo;Statistics ...are not compiled by my Department&rdquo; he means they are not compiled at all.  In view of the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude and, I am sure, the attitude of the Minister, as well, I can only conclude that the Minister has something to hide.  I should like to know what it is.</P>
    <P>My information is that the Minister for Social Welfare is and has been for <Col N="206" /> the past two or three years carrying on a purge against people who apply for unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit or sickness benefit.  It seems that what is uppermost in the mind of the Minister for Social Welfare and of his Parliamentary Secretary is the desire to cut down the unemployment figures so as to show a reduction, I will not say at all costs but at certain costs.</P>
    <P>The Government promised, and the Minister for Social Welfare as a member promised, they would declare war on unemployment.  The contrary seems to be the case.  Their behaviour seems to suggest that, rather than waging war on unemployment, they are waging war on certain of the unemployed. I do not know whether other Deputies have the same experience as I have but I understand that practically every person who now applies for unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, sickness benefit or disability benefit is immediately suspect.  I do not say there are not people who would make fraudulent claims.  I do not say there are not people who would claim on the assumption that they are entitled to unemployment benefit who have not the necessary contributions.  The trouble is that many people at present are being held up on their claim for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance for as long as six weeks.  The claim may eventually be allowed but in the meantime they have to exist on what they can get from the Home Assistance authorities.  That is the reason why I want to get these figures which the Minister for Social Welfare refused to give me today.</P>
    <P>If what I say is wrong then the Minister for Social Welfare should produce the figures to show that there is no purge or to show that all these people are not suspect and that the claims are accepted in good faith and are not suspect and that the direction of the Minister by officers of the Department of Social Welfare to such an extent that people are held up not alone for periods up to as much as six weeks but in some cases&mdash;I will not say a great many cases&mdash;for months before a decision is made on them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> I suspect that the officers of the Department, on the direction of the Minister, are working overtime in an effort to sort out these claims, to sort out the claims of those people who are deemed to be suspect until they prove their innocence through a court of appeal after waiting for a period of six weeks or in some cases for months.</P>
    <P>When some of these people make their application for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance and are refused by a deciding officer, or whoever it is, there are some of them&mdash;again I shall not exaggerate and say a lot of them&mdash;who take that decision from the deciding officer and do not appeal.  They are turned down because they are immediately suspect, but it might be proved on appeal they are perfectly right, that unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance should be allowed to them or that they should be paid back money.  But there are some people who are not aware&mdash;not through any fault of the officers in the local exchanges&mdash; people who, even though the matter is brought to their notice, do not realise they should appeal and who let their claim for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance go by the board.</P>
    <P>If I am wrong in saying there was a purge to cut down on the unemployed and show good figures, I will be the first to admit it.  But from what I can see&mdash;and I do not speak with any detailed knowledge because I have no figures before me&mdash;and from the approaches I get from my constituents and other people I can only conclude this purge is in progress at present at the behest of the Minister for Social Welfare.  Even if it takes two or three weeks or a month, I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to make this information available to the House because I believe it is vital information and information which is the concern of many tens of thousands in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy) Michael Joseph Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have nothing to hide in the administration of social services or social benefits.  There is no purge on.  The <Col N="208" /> officers are doing their work and are interpreting the Act as it should be interpreted.  It is very easy to talk about sickness and disablement benefit. It is continuous in a great many cases.  There is direct contact with the Department in the matter of certification. The Department have their finger on the pulse of the matter because they can have these statistics available in that particular section and know how many cases are genuine or otherwise.  The medical certificate comes into these matters where there is a doubt.</P>
      <P>Statistics which would enable the information sought by Deputy Corish to be given have never been compiled in the Department.  Prior to October, 1957, particulars of daily registration and re-registration for unemployment were maintained but, even then, these were not kept in such a way as to enable them to be segregated into claims for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance or as registration for employment or change of employment only.  It was found, however, that these statistics served no useful purpose.  They could be misleading. Many would find employment on the same day they registered or in a day or two afterwards.  This refers in particular to workers like dockers, who register today and are in employment tomorrow.  The data the Deputy is seeking is quite unnecessary for Departmental purposes, and even if it were compiled it would give a distorted picture as it would include many claims which would never result in payment of benefit or assistance since the claimant would find employment within a very short time of making the claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weekly count of persons on the live register in the various categories of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance and others gives a reasonable and sufficient picture for all administrative purposes.  If we were to attempt now to compile the information the Deputy requires, it would entail an enormous amount of work in examining all current claims and in going back over such documents and all lapsed or closed claims for each of the years in question.  As I said, there was such an examination <Col N="209" /> and it involved a half day's work at a time when employees in the exchanges could be doing much more useful work.  Even then we could not be sure that they were reliable figures. Some of the documents would be replaced and others would be destroyed. The work would have to be done outside normal hours.  It would cost quite a lot of money and would not be justified under any circumstances.</P>
    <P>The figures for unemployment benefit this year&mdash;that is benefit on stamps&mdash;at the 30th January were 42,126, as compared with 46,351 on the 31st January, 1959.  There is no interference by the Minister, no purging or anything else.  There was a drop of over 4,000 in that figure alone. The unemployment assistance figures are 29,312 this year and 34,254 this time twelve months.  That is not due to an examination of the qualifying certificates or anything else.  The drop is too steep to justify such a change.</P>
    <P>In regard to fraudulent claims&mdash;we are not making a fetish of this&mdash;there was a time when all the beneficiary got was a day's pay for each stamp he had.  Under the 1952 Act that was more liberally interpreted and he got a half year's pay for certain stamps. The temptation was there, and is in every other country as well as this, to commit fraud.  It did not apply to the vast majority of the workers but to a percentage of them.  When that temptation was there, it was the duty of the State to put an end to it.</P>
    <P>The honest decent workers, the majority of the workers, would not stoop to fraud and I heard them myself in my own locality condemning such actions.  I am sure the same applies to Wexford and elsewhere and that honest workers do not stand over such practices and it is not proper for any Deputy to stand up here and say we are punishing the workers when we try to put an end to that.  Every decent worker is against the land holder who has cattle on the 11 months system, who has conacre here, there and everywhere and who has money in the bank and who makes false representations claiming unemployment assistance.  As long as we are in Social Welfare we <Col N="210" /> shall make war on that type of people and we shall not allow them to put their hands into the pockets of the taxpayers and take out money that they are not justified in taking.  Any Deputy who wishes may make all the political capital he likes out of the fact that we instructed our Social Welfare officials to watch for that type of thing and put an end to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish says we have statistics about it.  We have statistics about it.  We are dealing even in the present month with 74,350 people.  Of that number 100 may be malingering and even though someone may point out that the fraction is only point nought something we are justified in following up these people so that they will not set a headline for the honest workers or those seeking unemployment assistance. We have no apology for what we have done in the Department of Social Welfare and for what I did in particular in urging war on the type of individual I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Going back to the point made by Deputy Corish and the information he wanted in his question&mdash;we see no reason for going into detail as he advocated.  That was tried out in the Department before and it was found to be a waste of time and money and, as long as we are there, we shall not go back to that practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>These are quite different matters.  All the information in the case of sickness comes in, as the Deputy knows having been Minister for Social Welfare, to the Department. All the certification for sickness reaches the Department of Social Welfare. That is not so with unemployment figures.  They are dealt with in Limerick, Wexford, Galway and everywhere else.  There is not the same direct contact with our Department in <Col N="211" /> matters of unemployment claims as there is in the case of sickness benefit, as the Deputy well knows.  He knows that every payment of sickness benefit is issued from Store Street while every payment of unemployment assistance or benefit is issued by the local office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <P>NOTE 1.&mdash;The grants at (a) represent 40% recoupment of approved provisions by the local authorities concerned for main road upkeep.  The figures marked with an asterisk are provisional.</P>
    <P>NOTE 2.&mdash;The grants at (b) and (c) are allocated on a mileage basis.  In a few cases minor transfers as between the two classes of grants were effected, in accordance with general conditions laid down by the Department, during the course of the year.</P>
    <P>NOTE 3.&mdash;The grants at (d) are confined to counties in the Gaeltacht and Congested areas in accordance with an eight year programme initiated in 1953-54.</P>
    <P>NOTE 4.&mdash;The grants at (e) are made available for selected works on main roads, such as the replacement of dangerous bridges, which cannot be dealt with under the main road improvement grant (b).  In addition to the allocations listed, there are provisional commitments in respect of certain bridges where increases in cost, etc., are likely to arise.</P>
    <P>NOTE 5.&mdash;The grants at (f) arise following the passing of the Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1959, and are given to certain road authorities to enable them to deal with the road problems created by railway closings and the establishment of major industrial undertakings.  In addition to the grants allocated, certain commitments have been agreed to in other cases, the actual grant allocation to be determined later.</P>
    <P>NOTE 6.&mdash;The distribution of the £150,000 at (g) is determined having regard to the relative needs of each area.  In addition to the above Dún Laoghaire Corporation were allocated a sum of £124,000 approx. for the improvement of a section of the Dublin-Bray road; this was made out of a provisional allocation of £500,000 made in 1947 for works on the arterial roads in the County Dublin area.</P>

      <P>A grant was recently sanctioned for the erection of the first section of a new school to replace Sexton Street Convent N.S.  The first section will accommodate 488 pupils in all classrooms.  Tenders have been invited by the manager's architect in the case and have been submitted to the Commissioners of Public Works for their consideration.</P>
      <P>In the following cases the proposals are as shown:</P>
      <P>(1)  a girls' school in the Ballinacurra-Weston district, having accommodation for 640 pupils;</P>
      <P>(2)  a school to replace the St. Vincent de Paul Senior and Infants' Schools having accommodation for 704 pupils;</P>
      <P>(3)  an infants' school at Corbally having accommodation for 128 pupils. </P>
      <P>A suitable site has been offered by the Revd. Manager in each of these cases.  Certain preliminary arrangements which are being attended to will have to be completed before the Department will be in a position to sanction grants towards the cost of the new schools.</P>
      <P>The question as to the need for extending St. Patrick's Boys' and Girls' National Schools is under consideration.</P>
