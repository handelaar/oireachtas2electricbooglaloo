    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The usual procedure under Standing Orders has been to devote a particular period each week to Private Members' Business. In recent times that arrangement has been disrupted to the disadvantage of Private Members of the House whose motions are on the Order Paper. I think it would be agreed by all Deputies that, where a motion is listed for discussion, Deputies who are concerned are at least entitled to a week's preliminary notice so that they may be refreshed in their own minds with regard to the subject matter of the motion concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the past three weeks the position has arisen that the whole of Thursday in two different weeks was devoted to Private Members' Time and no prior notice was given to the <Col N="179" /> Deputies concerned that their motions would come up, one after the other, on those two particular dates.  I want to ask the Taoiseach whether we can have any indication at this stage that a certain period of time will be made available each week from next week so that all of us may know when our motions are likely to come under discussion.</P>
    <P>The position at the moment is that two or three motions can come up, one after another, on Thursday and the only notification we get is when the Parliamentary Secretary comes in, as he did this morning, and states that the entire day on Thursday is to be devoted to Private Members' time.  I appreciate the indication given last night but an indication of that nature is not sufficient to permit any Deputy to be in a position to deal properly with the subject matter of a motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the matter was raised, I expressed sympathy with the problems of private Deputies in that regard and recognition of the fact that the original purpose of Standing Orders was not being fulfilled by reason particularly of the desire of Deputies that Dáil Éireann should not meet on Fridays and I arranged that the matter would be raised at the Committee.  It has been raised and I understand that discussions as to possible <Col N="180" /> alternative arrangements are being discussed.</P>

      <P>Go ndeonfar suim fhorlíontach nach mó ná £10 chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch ar 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1961, le haghaidh Tuarastal agus Costas Roinn na Gaeltachta, maille le deontais le haghaidh Tithe agus Ildeontais-i-gCabhair.</P>
      <P>Sé faoi ndear don Roinn an Vóta Forlíontach seo a lorg ná go bhfuil cead ag teastáil chun níos mó ná an soláthar de £12,500 atá déanta chuige sin mar dheontas-i-gcabhair faoi fhomhírcheann N den Vóta d'íoc le haghaidh scoláireachtaí saoire agus scoile sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá méadú mór arís i mbliana ar an líon páistí atá dá gcur go dtí an Ghaeltacht seachas an méad a cuirtí sna blianta roimhe seo.  Sa bhliain 1957 cuireadh 333 pháiste go dtí an Ghaeltacht; sa bhliain 1958 cuireadh 465; sa bhliain 1959 cuireadh 1,129 <Col N="181" /> agus i mbliana tá iomlán de 2,372 dá gcur go dtí an Ghaeltacht, do réir na bhfigiúirí is deanaí atá ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Den iomlán sin i mbliana cuireadh 264 pháiste go dtí an Ghaeltacht ar scoláireachtaí trí mhí agus cuireadh an 2,108 eile go dtí an Ghaeltacht fain sceim scoláireachtaí saoire.  Faoin scéim sin lomháiltear ó Vóta mo Roinne deontas nach mó ná £4. 10s. le haghaidh gach páiste a cuirtear chun na Gaeltachta ó cheantar Átha Cliath agus deontas nach mó ná £4 le haghaidh gach páiste a cuirtear ó cheantair eile.  I gcás na scoláireachtaí trí mhí íocann an Roinn deontas de £17 10s. le haghaidh gach páiste.</P>
    <P>Bhí méadú i mbliana ar an líon coistí a chuir na páistí sin go dtí an Ghaeltacht; 38 gcoiste a bhí páirteach ins na scéimeanna i gcomparáid le 20 coiste ar fad an bhliain seo caite agus 14 choiste an bhliain roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>Chun an caiteachas breise seo ar scoláireachtaí saoire agus scoile a shlánú táthar ag cur leis an méid fáltas a húsáidfear mar leithreasa-igcabhair don Vóta i dtreo is go mbeifear in ann fáltais ilghnéitheacha breise áirithe a chur i gcoinne an chaiteachais bhreise agus dá bharr san ní gá ach suim chomharthach de £10 a lorg anois mar Vóta Forlíontach.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach cá bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ach níor mhaith liom dul isteach sa cheist mhór sin ar an Meastachán Forlíontach seo.  Nuair a cuireadh Roinn na Gaeltachta ar bun cuireadh cúram ar an Roinn eolas d'fháil cá raibh an Ghaeltacht.  Do rinneadh gach ab fhéidir a dhéanamh chun a fháil amach cá raibh na háiteanna ina labhraítear an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra i measc na ndaoine.  Níor nochtadh na figiúirí-a fritheadh san áireamh speisialta a deineadh an tráth úd óir níor aontaigh iniúchóirí na Roinne Oideachais le hiniúchóirí na hOifige Staidrimh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, ó tharla nach bhfuil eolas againn cá bhfuil na háiteanna in bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt mar ghnáth-urlabhra i measc na ndaoine, ba mhaith liom a fháil amach cá bhfuil na scoileanna úd ar dúradh go raibh <Col N="182" /> na páistí ag freastal orthu.  Cá bhfuil na ceantair úd gurb é tuairim an Aire ina dtaobh go raibh an Ghaeilge chomh beo iontu gurb fhiú páistí ón nGalltacht a chur chucu?</P>
    <P>Fé mar a deirim, is ceist mhór í ach b'fhéidir go mbeadh ar chumas an Aire a chur in iúl go cruinn don Teach ar an Meastachán seo cá bhfuil na háiteanna úd ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt mar ghnáth-urlabhra i measc na ndaoine.  Ansin, tá dualgas ar an Roinn féin mar gheall air sin.</P>
    <P>Tá taobh eile den cheist seo ann. Tá móráireamh le déanamh amach anseo i dtaobh na coda sin den tír atá faoi chúram Roinn na Gaeltachta chun a fháil amach cad iad na háiteanna ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt go nádúrtha, coitianta ag na daoine i ngnáth-obair an lae.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir, leis, go bhfuil ceist eile le freagairt agus go dtabharfaidh an tAire a thuairim ina taobh?  Tá airgead le fáil ag páistí a bhfuil cónaí orthu sa Galltacht chun dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  An bhfuil scoláireachtaí ar bith le fáil ag páistí a bhfuil cónaí orthu sa Ghaeltacht chun dul go Baile Átha Cliath, Corcaigh nó áit stairiúil ar bith eile sa tír faoi stiúradh lucht scoile nó faoi stiúradh daoine a chuireann suim phríobháideach i gcúrsaí oideachais agus mar sin de?  Is dóigh liom gur saghas &ldquo;reservation&rdquo; í an Ghaeltacht le haghaidh páistí ón nGaeltacht.  Ní dóigh liom gur deineadh aon rud ó cuireadh an Roinn ar bun chun aigne na bpáistí a leathnú agus eolas a thabhairt dóibh trí mheán na Gaeilge agus faoi stiúradh daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu chun na páistí a thabhairt go Corcaigh, Baile Átha Cliath nó áit ar bith ar fud na tíre. B'fhéidir go n-inseodh an tAire dúinn an bhfuil aon rud á dhéanamh chun scoláireachtaí a thabhairt do na daoine atá i gceist agam?  B'fhéidir go n-inseodh sé, leis, cad tá á dhéanamh chun a dheimhniú cá bhfuil an Ghaeltacht &mdash;na háiteanna úd ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt mar ghnáth-urlabhra ag na daoine i rith an lae?</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Gearóid Mac Pharthaláin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Nuair a cuireadh an Roinn seo ar bun, cúngaíodh an limistéar ar a dtugtar an Ghaeltacht de <Col N="183" /> ghnáth do cheantair na beo theanga. Ní ró-mhaith a thaitin an scéim liom féin&mdash;duine a bhfuil dhá Ghaeltacht mhóra ina cheantar aige.  San am céanna, bhí mé sásta go raibh iarracht á dhéanamh le go mbeadh buntáisti faoi leith ag na ceantair iontu a bhí i dteideal fíor-Ghaeltacht a thabhairt orthu.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios ag an Teachta Ua Maolchatha gur cuireadh ceantair áirithe eile isteach leis an gcéad limistéar a leathnaíodh amach mar FhíorGhaeltacht. Nílim cinnte.  Ba mhaith liom dá n-abródh sé liom an iad na ceantair bhreise eile seo atá i gceist aige.  Nuair a cheistíonn sé mé i dtaobh cá bhfuil an Ghaeltacht, cad iad na scoileanna atá suite sa Ghaeltacht agus an ceart scoláireachtaí don Ghaeltacht a chur ar fáil iontu, séard is mian liom a chur in iúl nár mhaith liomsa aon chur isteach a dhéanamh ar tharraingt na limistéar nuair a tháinig me isteach mar Aire na Gaeltachta. De réir mar fuair mé amach, bhí amhras orm go raibh cuid acu nach raibh ceart iomlán acu a bheith curtha isteach mar cheantair Ghaeltachta, ach d'fhág mé an scéal ansin cé gur chuir mé ceist ar na hOifigigh sa Roinn cén nós atá acu nuair nach bhfuil an ceart iomlán acu a bheith sna limistéir Ghaeltachta, agus cén nós atá acu, cuir i gcás, i dtaobh na ndeontas £5, na ndeontas tithe agus na gcúrsaí meán scolaíochta.  Is é an rud a dúirt siad ná iad a fhágáil go deas mar atá siad, agus, ós rud é nach raibh fonn ormsa na limistéir a athrú, agus na scéimeanna a bhí socraithe a chur bun ós cionn, d'fág mé iad mar a bhí siad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bá mhaith liomsa go dtabharfadh an Teachta Ua Maolchatha aon eolas atá aige ar na háiteanna atá istigh sna limistéir Ghaeltachta nach bhfuil sé ceart iad a lua mar cheantair Ghaeltachta agus bhéarfaidh mé geallúint go dtabharfaidh mé lán-chreidiúint don Teachta Ua Maolchatha as ucht a chuid oibre i dtaobh na ceiste seo. Maidir leis an móráireamh tá sé i gceist go mbíonn tairbhe is tábhacht ar leith ag baint le labhairt na Gaeilge. Tá an lucht staidrimh an-sásta na Gaeltachtaí a fhanacht sa teorainn atá <Col N="184" /> acu ach tá deacracht acu ar aon cheist atá ag baint le tuairimí na ndaoine. Más &ldquo;facts&rdquo; atá i gceist, is féidir an bhréag nó an fhírinne a aithint ach, nuair is tuairimí atá i gceist, tá deacracht ann.  Cuir i gcás, má tá dhá cheist, ceann amháin a fhiafraíonn: &ldquo;Bhfuil Gaeilge agat?&rdquo;  agus an ceann eile: &ldquo;An í an Ghaeilge an gnáth-urlabhra i do theach?&rdquo;  má tá roinnt Gaeilge ag duine amháin, b'fhéidir go dtabarfadh sé freagra á rá sin, agus duine eile a bhfuil Gaeilge aige ach nach í an Ghaeilge an gnáth-urlabhra ina theaglach, b'fhéidir go ndéarfadh sé nach bhfuil.  De réir lucht staidrimh is féidir dhá thuairim a bheith ag daoine ar an gceist agus tá deacracht acu conas an cheist a chur.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil níos mó le rá agam.  Ní bhaineann sé seo ach le húdarás a fháil ón Dáil mar nach raibh an Meastachán a rinneadh anuraidh sách iomlán i gcóir na gcásanna atá faoi chúram mo Roinne, ach tá rud amháin ba mhaith liom a insint don Dáil, agus is é sin, go bhfuil sé ríachtanach ar daltaí meánscoile scrudú béil a sheasamh leis an scrúdú Árd-Teistiméireachta a bhaint amach agus, ó socráiodh é sin, tháinig méadú <Col N="185" /> mór ar lucht cuairte chun na Gaeltachta. Léifidh mé amach na figiúirí anois.  Sa bhliain 1957, bhí 333 acu ann; i 1958, bhí 465; i 1959, bhí 1,159; agus i mbliana, 2,372.  Tá fáilte agam, mar Aire na Gaeltachta, roimhh an méadú seo agus ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil creideamh agam sa chúis seo.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That in view of the serious position of the dairy and cattle industries Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the whole question of price and marketing should be reviewed.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputy Wycherley.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>If any further evidence is required that all is not well with the agricultural sector of our economy, the tables which we received this morning relating to the national income provide food for thought.  I notice on page 7, Table 3 which gives the percentage distribution of the national income of the different sectors, that the agricultural share of the national income has gone down as between 1953 and 1959, from 29.4 per cent. to 24.7 per cent.  I appreciate that there are certain reasons for that, particularly in the past year or two when the two bad harvests contributed to this decline, but taking the picture for a particular seven year period, I think we certainly have reason to take a close look at the rewards which the agricultural sector of the community get for their contribution to the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not regard subsidies as an ideal solution.  The most that can be said for them is that they are a part solution of the problem but in regard to certain products of the farmers, I think subsidies must continue to be paid, particularly in respect of the dairying industry which is the keystone of the entire agricultural industry. The rest of the country must face the fact that the dairy farmer is in a unique position in many regards and that he must be maintained at the expense of the community as a whole in the interests of the community as a whole.  Meanwhile, every possible <Col N="190" /> effort must be made by the industry itself, with the assistance, the drive and the leadership of the Minister and his Department, to find other and more economic outlets for milk, and particularly for surplus milk, which is a recurring problem.</P>
    <P>In that regard, the recent entry of the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland factory at Limerick into this industry is welcome, if somewhat belated.  It is a great pity the directors of that concern did not engage in other outlets for milk in the past, such as chocolate crumb.  It is senseless economy to send milk out of the greatest milk producing area in the country and its contiguous areas into other areas where these chocolate crumb plants have been situated. However, that is past history.  In any future expansion of other outlets for milk the position of Limerick in regard to milk production should receive prior consideration.  Certainly the factory at Lansdowne in Limerick is a very valuable centre which should be used to the maximum extent and which certainly has not been used to the maximum extent or potentiality in past years.</P>
    <P>I would far prefer that any assistance which the Department gives or intends to give to the agricultural industry would be devoted to lowering costs.  Taking the long term view of it, the more sensible farmers would rather produce at prices which would allow them to compete in the outside world, particularly as their traditional market, the British market, to which I referred last night is, for reasons into which we need not go now, partly political and partly economic, decreasing in value.  The fact that the British are now spending £250,000,000 a year subsidising their farmers and that our farmers have to compete at those fictitious price levels is some indication of the necessity to look outside the British market for a growing proportion of our export trade.</P>
    <P>In that regard the emergent states of the African Continent would appear to offer one outlet that should be pursued with energy by the Minister and his Department.  I do not know what plans the Minister has already made <Col N="191" /> for exploiting these new markets.  As far as I know, the Minister's Department has made no statement to the effect that it is alive to the potentialities in these countries. We naturally appreciate that the purchasing power of these countries is small now but that will grow and grow rapidly as these States come under the control of their own Governments and when they start pumping capital into the economy to expand it and raise the standard of living of their peoples.</P>
    <P>Therefore we would be very well-advised to be the first, or among the first in the field exploiting these new markets.  The Middle East and the East should also offer great opportunities for Irish agricultural produce. In saying that, I do not want to be taken as writing off the British market which must continue for many years or possibly for the rest of time to be our main market.  We should do far more to exploit the English market. We seem to take absolutely no interest in the agricultural trade shows or fairs held in England.  For some reason or other, we have given up having stalls or stands there and we seem to be quite content to market our produce in England under other trade names.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy from time to time receives letters from Irish people living in England stating that they cannot get Irish butter, Irish bacon or other Irish products under an Irish trade name or even under the normal words: &ldquo;Made in the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  There may be reasons for the practice established in the past and reasons why it should be continued but, if we intend to adopt a positive, aggressive sales policy, we must take our courage in our hands and, whatever the temporary upsets may be, seek our own outlets even if it means going into wholesale and retail trading in England.  It is sad from our point of view to see the energetic efforts of the New Zealanders and the Danes to push their products in the British market under national brand names.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have spoken before me on this motion have stressed the necessity of marketing generally.  I <Col N="192" /> appreciate that the Minister has this in view but I want to join with those who criticised the slow and ineffective progress made to date.  If we want to sell anything, whether it be eggs, beef, bacon or butter, we must be far more aggressive in world markets than we have been up to now.</P>
    <P>In this regard I do not know of any contact more useful&mdash;with all due respect to the numerous boards which have been set up from time to time&mdash; than that of the individual manufacturer or groups of manufacturers going over themselves to exploit these markets. I should like to see far more of that done by the agricultural community as well as by the industrial community.</P>
    <P>Greater effort should be made in regard to publicity and propaganda. There is a limited amount of that done but there is nothing catchy or attractive about it.  More attention should be given to what has now become a world wide tendency in selling and that is publicity in various forms.  The publicity content of any items nowadays is enormous compared with even a few years ago.  I think it is no exaggeration to say that in some instances the cost of the publicity is at least equal to the value of the article.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who always subscribed to the viewpoint that in giving employment industry must make a major contribution, but no industrial development should take place at the expense of agriculture.  I have the feeling that, if in the past we have not developed the industrial side of our economy at the expense of agriculture, certainly we have done so at the neglect of agriculture.  The two should go hand in hand and our orientation and our thinking must be guided by the fact that our basic national asset is 12,000,000 acres of first-class agricultural land.</P>
    <P>An expanding industry associated with an efficient, prosperous agricultural sector is the ideal solution for our economic problems.  For years to come there is bound to be migration, even emigration, from the rural areas for historical reasons as well as economic reasons.  The only way to <Col N="193" /> adjust that is to ensure that if our people have to migrate from small holdings their migration will be as short as possible and that they will be within reasonable distance of industries based, wherever practicable, on the raw materials the farmer produces himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It requires very few words to recommend this motion to the Dáil but this is an occasion on which certain facts should be drawn to the attention of the House.  The portion of the national income arising from agriculture has declined from £131.2 millions in 1957 to £116 millions in 1959.  The farmers are receiving for what they dispose of off their lands £16 millions a year less than they were getting three years ago, since this Government came into office.  Statistically it is all right to say that you may have regard to the varying values of stocks on the land but the rise and fall in the value of stocks on your land does not provide an income for a farmer who has to feed a wife and family day in, day out.  His income is controlled by what he can sell and what he gets for it.  In terms so expressed, the income of the farmers has declined from £131.2 millions in 1957 to £116 millions in 1959 and over that period these same farmers have been required by this Government to pay 6d. more for the 2-lb. loaf which they have to buy for their families, 10d. more for butter and 40/- more per ten stone of flour for every bag of flour they bring into the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard a Fianna Fáil Deputy groaning yesterday when someone referred to the small farmers in Roscommon.  There are a number of Deputies in this House from the city of Dublin and some of the Eastern counties who do not understand what is happening over a large part of this country.  That is that the small farmers in Monaghan Cavan, Donegal, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway, Clare, Kerry, West Limerick and West Cork are being wiped out.  The result is that they are migrating in whole families from their holdings because at present they can no longer live.  That has happened <Col N="194" /> in the last three years.  I have seen&mdash;and any Deputy familiar with conditions amongst the small farmers has seen&mdash;the price of cattle decline by £10 per dropped calf, from £20 to £10, in the last 18 months.  The price of a yearling beast has declined from £40 to about £28 or less and it is on that kind of production that the bulk of the small farmers depend for their existence.</P>
    <P>I am told in regard to the dairy farmers that this Government have provided them with one penny a gallon more for creamery milk but nobody adverts to the fact that the annual output of a dairy cow consists of a calf and her milk.  There has been a drop of £10 in the price of the calf which represents 2,400 pence and, if she is a 600 gallon cow, that represents a reduction of 4d. a gallon on milk.  It means that the producer at present is 3d. a gallon worse off than he was twelve months ago.</P>
    <P>It is now nearly 4 years since this Government came into office and, as they boast so frequently, one of the first announcements they then made was that they were going to appropriate £250,000 to study new methods of marketing agriculture production. They are still cogitating on that problem and now, on the eve of a general election, we are told that they are going to have a Bill introduced to establish a milk marketing board. Nobody will see very many results from that this side of the election but of course it will be a good talking point.  If this Government meant to do anything, or intended to do anything, or was fit to do anything, they would have done it well before a general election was upon us.</P>
    <P>This Government are at present making an effort to feed this country on a diet of fantastic statistics.  Figures are juggled and the people are persuaded the national income is booming. Recently I saw a headline in a national newspaper&mdash;&ldquo;Boom, Boom, Boom&rdquo;.  Then I went home to some of my neighbours in Mayo and Monaghan and for the first time in my memory in the last 15 years, the impression was made strongly on my mind that they were poor&mdash;poor again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> They found it hard to find the money to pay their weekly bills.  Those who live in this fairyland of statistics feel they can turn their backs on all that and deal in global figures and ignore the fact that what matters to the average farmer is what he gets for his beast when he brings it to the fair or market place.  Judged by that criterion a very large part of the 350,000 farmers living on the land at present are growing poorer every day.  It is true that the repercussions of that on the towns and cities may, in some degree, be delayed but nothing is more certain than that if we allow the agriculture community to wither away, as they are doing at present, the whole economic fabric of the country will collapse.</P>
    <P>It is no use imagining that there is any substitute, as a foundation for our economic life, for the land and the people who get their living from it. These are the people who today are forgotten and abandoned.  There is no Department of State which has so declined in prestige in the eyes of the people as the Department of Agriculture in the last three years.  You can say what you like about it&mdash;in the past it may have been the subject of controversy&mdash;but there were people who esteemed it and people who blamed it.  There were people who thought is was too active and people who thought it was interfering with things that should have been left alone, but at least there was pretty general agreement that it was a strong and vital force and that it was concerned as best it could to help the farmers and provide them with some leadership in the direction in which they should travel if they were to have a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>Can anyone say that now?  Does anyone know what the Department of Agriculture stands for, or what the Minister for Agriculture believes in? The impression created on my mind in any case is that he does not believe in much and that he does not care a damn about any aspect of the industry of the farmers for whom he is supposed to be responsible.  I sometimes despair of getting those who have the <Col N="196" /> power to work or help to appreciate the elementary considerations which should affect us in considering the live stock and dairying industry.  We should bear constantly in mind when talking about cattle and the dairy industry that we must think, not only of cows, bullocks and calves, but of the pig and bacon industry as an integral part of the dairy industry.  It we want to come effectively to the assistance of the dairy industry, we cannot do it if we do not come effectively to the rescue of the pig and bacon industry as well.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that there is a limited time for this debate and that the Minister for Agriculture should be provided with an opportunity to intervene but I want to make this point.  In large parts of this country the dairy industry is substantially dependent on the contribution made to the producer by the ancillaries of pig production.  When we were in office we tried to provide stability and in some measure we succeeded by guaranteeing the price of Grade A pigs.  There is entering into that situation a new element of insecurity.  That is that producers now feel that the grading of pigs in factories is producing for them an inequitable result.  I do not want to underestimate the difficulty of that problem.  It is a problem with which I had to wrestle when I was in the Department but at that time I felt that we had made some progress towards restoring confidence to the producer.  I think that some further step is required now to convince the producers that they are getting the full value of their pigs at the factory.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the statement of Messrs Lovell and Christmas who put forward the point of view that it is the function of the factory rather than the producer to process the pigs.  I think that the present system of grading is probably for us the right system, but if that system is to be carried on the confidence of the producers must be restored and they must be convinced that they are getting the full value of their pigs.  I believe that, in certain circumstances, farmers are not getting the grade to which they are <Col N="197" /> entitled.  I have known of pigs being brought into a factory and being graded B, when I have very little doubt that they were entitled to a higher grade.  I have known of individual cases where, when representations were made, the curers concerned were prepared to concede that a wrong grade had been allocated to a producer. I am bound to say in all honesty that it is the experience of all of us charged with the supervision of such matters that one case of inadequate grading will get ten thousand times the publicity of one hundred cases of accurate grading.</P>
    <P>I want to say deliberately that if all the pigs graded in factories were checked you would find that in the vast majority of cases justice is done but there are exceptions and it is the exceptions which show the necessity for a proper independent supervision of the grading.  Unless that is done public confidence will decline and the growth in pig production, which is essential for the development of the dairy industry, will not proceed.</P>
    <P>I take the view that in agriculture, as in industry, we are in the dilemma that you cannot get markets if you have not got supplies and that you cannot make a more disastrous mistake than to go out and get markets before you have the supplies.  If you do that and cannot supply the markets which you have obtained the result will be a very strong prejudice against your product when it is available.  There can be no doubt that our first task is to produce supplies.  We should make up our minds that we are going to produce bacon, butter, dried milk, cheese, livestock and livestock products. It may happen that when we have maximised our production of such supplies we will find in practice that our best effort may fail to find an adequate market for certain items.</P>
    <P>When that failure comes upon us let us concentrate on the other items which we are producing in order to provide a continuous supply to the markets which we have obtained.  We have got to make up our minds that for those items for which we have a secure market we shall provide adequate supplies.  We should then find the <Col N="198" /> market and if certain items prove to be unmarketable&mdash;and there are very few in my opinion which will so prove&mdash; then we must turn over to something else but having once secured a market we must keep that market fully supplied because there is no other way of effectively holding our markets.</P>
    <P>We are told, and I believe it to be true, that one of the greatest lacks in the human dietary throughout the world today is protein foods, meat and milk products.  There is no country on the face of the earth better equipped to produce both of these in quantity than this country of ours.  Taking the long-term view, and bearing in mind that our principal market is the British market, I believe that with a marginal extension of these products we can look to the whole world, particularly to the new emergent nations, for new markets.  Let us not doubt our capacity to deliver meat and milk products to tropical climates because, with modern methods of preservation of these products, it is the only way in which we can have access to these markets.</P>
    <P>I have no anxiety on the score of our ability ultimately to get markets in all these countries for our products and at a price which will reward us for our labour.  The problem is to get the maximum output from the land.  The longer I know these problems, and the more I am connected with them, the more I am convinced that we cannot do that until we effectively bring to the farmer the technical know-how and guidance that the people engaged in business have acquired if we are to go forward to maximum production.  I can never understand how we can regard it as normal and natural for old-established business institutions to pay £5,000 and £10,000 for the services of business consultants and why we should think it extravagant to bring to the owner of a ten, fifteen, or twenty acre farm similar assistance by way of agricultural advice.</P>
    <P>I know of no effective way of bringing that advice to a farmer except through a national agricultural advisory service.  I know of no effective way of bringing the Minister into that very close contact that he ought to have with the farmers except through <Col N="199" /> a national agricultural advisory service. I know of no comprehensible reason why we should send out of this country to Rhodesia, Canada, Tanganyika and Nigeria the agricultural graduates of our Universities who can get jobs in any agricultural community in the world except their own. That is the kind of daftness which drives me mad.  They are told that they are not wanted in their own country.  I am certain that there is work in this country for up to 800 agricultural graduates if we put them effectively to work in a way that they could help the farmers and earn a living here for themselves.</P>
    <P>I detest and have grown to loathe this whole claptrap about national economic objectives.  I have grown to distrust and detest these White Papers that provide vast and ephemeral objectives designed to dazzle and bewilder the minds of men.  I have a pragmatic mind and all I want to see is that my neighbours will have enough to live on in decency, security and peace on their own holdings. While we are talking about White Papers, national objectives and broad policies for the redemption of the economic life of the Irish nation I see my neighbours flying out of their homes because they cannot live on the land any longer.</P>

      <P>That is not true and nobody knows that better than Deputy Moher.  It is perfectly true that when we are dealing with young fellows who are surplus to the domestic requirements of individual farms and where they are offered jobs in neighbouring towns, in Cork or in Dublin, they are going to Birmingham because they can do better, but I have never known of a man to leave his home with his wife and family and go to look for work in industrial England unless he was no longer able to get a living from the land he was leaving.</P>

      <P>That may be Deputy Moher's experience but it is not mine. I believe the small farmers are being driven out because they cannot get a living at home and I am concerned to get them a living at home.  I believe a way to get it for them is to help them to expand the total output of the land of Ireland by putting within reach of them the knowledge, know-how and guidance of an effective national agricultural advisory service with the assurance that the Department of Agriculture will accept responsibility for organising the marketing of that output whatever it may be.  I believe that is an eminently possible thing to do and I think it is the greatest reproach to this Government that they have made no effort in the last four years to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I exhort the Minister&mdash;no; I do not exhort the Minister because I do not believe he will ever achieve anything effective in the Department in which he is at present because to be quite honest, I do not believe he gives a damn about it.  But in connection with this motion, I think it right at this stage to point out to him that I warned him when he started this cracked £15 a head scheme in regard to bovine tuberculosis eradication that he would run into trouble, that it would not work and that it was thoroughly unsound.  That is the scheme under which the Minister proposed to pay £15 to a farmer if he is prepared to sell his beast to a cannery. The original scheme was that the Department of Agriculture bought the beast and disposed of it and bore the loss, if there was a loss, but there was no room in that scheme for the kind of jiggery-pokery that has now become widespread in the south-west of Ireland. I suppose we all learn by experience.  I presume the Minister <Col N="201" /> was prevailed upon to give his sanction to this scheme but the sooner he drops it the better it will be for all concerned and I hope this unpleasant experience he has had will make him revert to a more rational approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>There is much more I should like to say on this subject, but we are limited to three hours for the debate on the motion and the Minister for Agriculture, presumably, desires to intervene.  Deputy Wycherley is then entitled to make some reply and, in those circumstances, I shall hold for another occasion much of what I should like to add.</P>

      <P>I think this motion has been on the Order Paper for the best part of twelve months.  It deals with the dairying and cattle industries and it would take a long time to cover the whole field of the debate.  Indeed, I do not think I shall have sufficient time to deal with the substance of the motion itself.  As the Taoiseach has explained, a Bill was introduced earlier to-day not, as was suggested by Deputy Dillon, because of the year in which we live, but because this was the earliest date it could be introduced, having regard to a number of factors over which the Government and my Department had no control.</P>
      <P>An advisory body was set up some time prior to my coming into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> Its reports on different aspects of agriculture and agricultural marketing began to trickle into my Department about this time twelve months ago and it was not very long afterwards that the Government's attitude to its recommendations was made known.  The public were advised of that attitude and then the legal advisers of the Government were instructed to take steps to prepare measures so as to give effect to the recommendations and decisions of the Government.  The preparation of a Bill dealing with such a matter as the dairying industry is very tedious.  One has to have consultations with so many interests and then, after a general scheme is prepared, it goes to the legal advisers who take time to prepare the various measures that the scheme necessitates. As I have already said, this motion has been on the Order Paper almost twelve months and, since we will have a full Second Reading debate on the Bill introduced to-day, and which I hope will be circulated this week, it is not necessary to cover the whole field in the short time left for discussion of the motion.</P>
    <P>However, so far as the dairying industry is concerned, let me say briefly that it is the one agricultural activity in which I have had confidence all my life.  It is the one section of agriculture that I have always tried to assist and support.  Not only in regard to it but in regard to every other aspect of agricultural policy, it is not a matter of my defending myself or my Government here.  I am always willing and ready to go before these people to whom Deputy Dillon has referred, the small farmers of Monaghan, Cavan, Mayo or any part of Ireland.  I shall go before them and accept their judgment and their verdict on the policies I have recommended and pursued as Minister. I shall accept their verdict as to my competence to give effect to those policies and to play my part in any Government of which I have been a member.</P>
    <P>No Deputy has better personal knowledge of the farmers' position and difficulties than I have.  When I hear Deputy Dillon talking about the essential aspects of agricultural policy, <Col N="203" /> I take my mind back to the crazy notions to which he gave expression here all down the years since he came into public life, both as Minister for Agriculture and as Deputy.  I think of all the prophecies that have been made, say, in regard to milk.  I look at the figures.  Deputy Dillon does not like figures.  I shall give the figures some other time, perhaps on the Second Reading of the measure that was introduced today.  I look at cattle prices. I trace them back to 1956, 1957, 1958 and 1959.  I think of all that has been said by Deputies for the past two or three years to the effect that milk production failed in 1958 because it was a bad and wet year.  The year 1959 was a dry year.  The year 1960 was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What did the Government of which he was Minister for Agriculture do in 1956 about the price of cattle?

      <P>I have the records here and I can refer to them at a later stage.  One of the things I never did and never shall do is to pretend to farmers that a condition of affairs exists as far as they are concerned that does not in fact exist.  I believe in admitting what I know to be true. I know that farmers have intelligence. I know those who have produced milk and have raised livestock. During their lives and the lives of those who went before them, the cattle trade has been unsteady and a little uneven. I have said in this House what I repeat now, that I have confidence in the cattle trade.  At times it will be more profitable than at others but there is a good future for it.  I believe in milk production and in increasing it.  I believe in developing the creamery organisation of the country.  I believe in expanding it and I shall contribute my part to secure that end.  It may create problems for us but they are problems that we shall face as a community.</P>
      <P>No amount of misrepresentation, no amount of vulgar abuse, will rob me of the fact that my reputation as a Deputy and as a Minister who has stood by the dairy farmers has never been shaken in the minds of the majority of our people.  You will not shake it now.</P>

This motion was put down with the best intentions and I am very sorry that it should have been bedevilled by cross-fire between the Minister for Agriculture and the ex-Minister for Agriculture.  This motion or any matter of importance to agriculture is worthy of the time which responsible people in this House can give to it.  We often waste time here discussing the problems of all the countries in the world but when it comes down to discussing the problems of the Irish farmers, it always ends up in a heated cross-fire between the two major political Parties in this House, which is detrimental to the interests of the farmer.</P>
      <P>What we want to do, and what my motion is intended to do, is to improve the marketing of our produce. I am very disappointed by the interest taken in the House in that aspect of my motion.  Instead of the motion being dealt with intelligently, there was abuse and all the rest.  We have reports and we have the promise of a Bill and of new boards and all the rest of it, but of what use is it to go to the farmers I represent and tell them that their problem will be solved by the introduction of a Bill or the setting up of a new board?  Something practical must be done.</P>
      <P>As I explained last night, we want practical steps taken to put our agricultural produce into the best markets in the world.  The best market in the world is at our door-step, in the cities of England.  My motion is intended to get our trade delegations into those areas where we can dispose of our produce to the best advantage, for the good of the Irish farmer.</P>

There are changing circumstances all over the world and we must change with the times.

I do not know what is in it and listening to Deputy Moloney last night, I thought he would have had the details today.

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Having regard to the paramount importance of flour and bread as the staple diet of our people, and the necessity to bring these commodities within the reach of all the people without hardship to them, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the national interest and the common good require that the production and distribution of these commodities should be taken over by a State corporation on the general lines of the Sugar Company, such corporation to be non-profit making and all its shares to be held by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>We put down this motion for a very simple reason.  We put it down because we believe it is high time the whole question of the flour milling industry, and the wholesale and retail distribution of the products of bakeries should be considered in this House.  It is possible that the result of such consideration would be that a company such as we suggest would be set up in order to try to bring about some kind of order in the industry, to try to give to the farmers some greater measure of security in the marketing of wheat and, above all, to try to bring about some reduction in the price of bread, the staple diet of our people, particularly the poorer sections of the community.</P>
      <P>In moving a motion of this kind, suggesting that there should be a takeover by a State company, obviously in the context of the society in which we live, the case must be a very compelling one.  I think it can be shown to be a particularly strong case by virtue of the failure of the flour milling industry to operate in the most efficient way and thereby provide bread for the consumer at the lowest possible price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three main approaches to this question of securing a reduction in the price of bread.  One which was favoured by the Government in the post-war period was that of the raising of funds from the Exchequer and the provision of subsidies, and by the provision <Col N="208" /> of subsidies, causing an artificial reduction in the price of bread.  Clearly, that policy went overboard in 1957, and clearly the Government do not favour its re-introduction.  Consequently we must rule it out.</P>
    <P>The second way in which one could make bread more readily available or, as we say, &ldquo;...bring these commodities within the reach of all the people without hardship to them ...&rdquo; is as a result of trade union action.  We suggested during the debate on the subsidies that trade union action could so increase the income of the workers that they could provide this staple commodity for themselves without any great hardship.  I am afraid that device or solution has not been satisfactory either, in so far as recent figures have shown that the real income of the average worker has not increased by one penny piece since 1939 as a result of trade union action over the years, admirable though it may have been.</P>
    <P>It seems to us anyway that we must rule out the system under which the industry at present operates, that is, private enterprise.  Private enterprise has been given the total period of the life of the State to maximise output, to improve output, to reduce costs and to maximise its efficiency.  The net result since 1939 has been that the cost of a 2-lb. loaf has gone up by 191.1 per cent.&mdash;nearly 200 per cent.  The trouble about bread is that the poorer one is, the more one needs and the more one must buy.  It is the high cost which, in our view, has led to the reduction in bread consumption which is alleged to be worrying the millers so much.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need dwell at any great length on the ethics of the nationalisation of these industries.  Both sides of the House have accepted the principle that in certain circumstances it is perfectly permissible to intervene&mdash;in fact, the State has a responsibility in certain circumstances&mdash;to control and operate an industry where it is decided that it would be in the public interest or in the common good.</P>
    <P>Article 43 of the Constitution deals with the question of private property in this State.  There is no doubt whatsoever that it recognises the right to <Col N="209" /> own property and indulge in profit-making enterprises, but this right is not absolute but relative.  Where it is felt that some damage is being done to the common good, then the State is perfectly within its right in intervening and taking over any such industry. We have had illustrations from both sides of the House: Comhlucht Siúicre and the E.S.B. and the many State companies established by the present Government; then there are in the very important sectors of our economy, Irish Shipping, Irish Steel Holdings, Aer Lingus and various other companies.  The State has a perfect right to take over existing private enterprises or establish completely new industries sponsored, financed and administered by the State.</P>
    <P>The consumption of bread has dropped considerably.  The consumption pre-war was 288 lbs. per head per annum and has dropped to 264 lbs. per head in 1957-58.  There are various explanations for this reduction in the consumption of bread, one explanation&mdash;and it seems to me a paradoxical one&mdash;being that it is a sign of our increasing prosperity: the more prosperous a society is, the lower is its consumption of cereals, bread, potatoes and so on and the higher its consumption of proteins.  That is a very flattering interpretation of the reduction in the consumption of bread.  I do not subscribe to that view.</P>
    <P>Another reason is that given by the President of the Irish Association of Master Bakers.  He suggested that because in 1956 the amount of native wheat in the grist was increased from 38 per cent. to 68 per cent., it is difficult to get the housewife to buy the bread.  I am not inclined to believe that is so, either.  Bread is such an essential commodity that even if it is unpalatable, people must eat it.</P>
    <P>I think the reason for this fairly substantial drop in bread consumption is the impact of the removal of the subsidies which has put bread outside the purchasing power of too many middle-income and lower-income families.  Of course, the bigger the family, the less is a family able to purchase all the bread it needs.  The reason they are <Col N="210" /> not eating bread is not that they are eating cake as Marie Antoinette would have them, but simply that they are engaging in a private rationing scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right to eat carbohydrates if one cannot afford anything better but these people cannot afford even the carbohydrates.  This point of view is supported to a considerable extent by the findings of the Nutritional Survey.  Admittedly, this survey was carried out in 1946-47 but it is the only one we have available which goes into very great detail.  It gives the consumption of food by the varying classes in the cities and towns and in rural Ireland and it discloses that a high percentage of the food consumed by what they called the slum dweller, the lower income group, the unemployed, the old age pensioner, is bread and that 44 per cent. of the meals of children under 14 years of age was composed of bread and spread, The difference in consumption between the lower income and the middle income group is that 18 per cent. in the middle income group and 44 per cent. in the lower income group eat as a predominant item of their diet bread and spread, that is, butter, margarine or other such commodity.  That was the position in the city of Dublin. In the farming community, one-third of all meals taken consisted simply of tea and bread or tea and bread and butter or margarine, and the poorer the family, the higher the consumption of bread.  I think this claim which is made that the more prosperous a society is, the lower the consumption of bread is true.  While it is true internationally, it is also true nationally, and the lower the income, the higher the percentage consumption of bread or cereals in any family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people we are trying to help most are those who cannot afford to buy any of the other expensive commodities such as meat, eggs and so on.  We want to secure a reduction in the price of bread in order to help such people in the middle and lower income groups and, in particular, the large families.  The Nutritional Survey <Col N="211" /> also showed that the larger the family, the lower the consumption of bread because they are unable to afford it.</P>
    <P>I want to give some figures which may be of some help in assessing the validity of the suggestion that the drop in the consumption of bread is a measure of our prosperity.  The consumption in Ireland, as a percentage of Britain, of bread is 131 per cent.; of fish, 23 per cent.; butter, 88 per cent; potatoes, 172 per cent; and fruit, 80 per cent, so that in fact the general level of food consumption and general dietary standards are relatively low.  That, of course, has a considerable effect on the general physique and health of the middle and lower income sections of the community.</P>
    <P>We believe therefore that there is an important principle involved, the necessity to try to see that the flour milling industry is operated in the most efficient way and in a way which is likely to lead to the maximum reduction in the price of bread.  As I said, there are various ways which can be tried&mdash;subsidy, trade union action or nationalisation.  In the nationalisation of the industry, we are given the assurance that the money which now goes in profits to the millers and to the various components of the flour milling industry and bakery industries generally will be ploughed back by a State company into the industry and either used for its improvement by providing more efficient equipment or for better wages for the employees and for the reduction of the price of the end commodity, bread, to the consumer, who is of course to a certain extent an employee.</P>
    <P>We believe that in these circumstances, the high price of bread and the fact that so many of our people are faced with the inevitability of using bread as the most important component of their diet, we are justified in claiming that we cannot afford the luxury of running this very important industry under private industry and that we cannot afford the luxury of paying profits to private individuals out of the milling industry.  The need to reduce the price of bread is so great we are justified in asking and insisting <Col N="212" /> that these people forego their profits and in that way we shall have money at our disposal to help secure a reduction in the price of bread.  This suggestion is not based on the classical socialist belief in the ownership and control of industry being vested in the people but is a simple proposition that in certain circumstances, where it serves the common good and where we believe it is contrary to the public interest that a profit be made, we are justified in suggesting the industry be organised so that profits can be absorbed back into the industry in one of the many forms I have suggested, better wages, better conditions for the workers and a better price for the end product, which is the bread.</P>
    <P>We could not be justified in putting forward this far-reaching suggestion, a proposition which certainly affects one of the greatest industries in the State, affects hundreds of individuals, and which would mean radical changes for many people&mdash;of all of which we are fully conscious&mdash;were it not for the fact that we feel a case can be made against the flour milling industry and against the bakery trade, on foot not only of the needless distribution of profits but also on foot of the demonstrable inefficiency in the flour milling industry.</P>
    <P>We have one very great advantage in trying to assess the position in the flour milling industry, that is, a number of reports from commissions set up by successive Governments.  These are magnificent reports so far as the examination of the facts disclosed are concerned and the energy with which the whole matter was pursued, but they disclose, first of all, a situation which points to a considerable measure of inefficiency in the flour milling industry and bakery trade generally.  They must also disclose the measure of disquiet felt by different Governments at the position of the flour milling industry. One of the most disturbing things is that, in spite of many categorical statements, recommendations and findings of these people&mdash;nobody would call them socialists; I suppose they were mildly conservative individuals who formed the greater part of these commissions&mdash;their recommendations <Col N="213" /> have been completely ignored by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>One of the most important recommendations is made by the first Flour and Bread Inquiry, 1950, which is referred to on page 27 of the Final Report of the Flour and Bread Committee, 1956.  At paragraph 29 it quotes this recommendation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Our first and fundamental recommendation is, therefore, that a proper uniform costing system be put into operation in each mill without delay, so that costings may be available for interim periods as soon as possible and for the year ending 31st August, 1950 in due course.</P>
    <P>That recommendation is really the basic recommendation of the Flour and Bread Inquiry and it is reiterated in the subsequent Flour and Bread Inquiry, 1956, in the report of which they also pointed to the wide variation in costings.</P>
    <P>On page 57, paragraph 58 they set out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The wide range in production and distribution costs is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of wide variations in efficiency &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and they repeat then the recommendation that a proper, uniform costings system be put into operation.</P>
    <P>The report also states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is surprising to find that&mdash;seven years after the submission of the Inquiry's Report&mdash;there is still no complete costing system in the industry, nor is there any indication that one will be installed in the near future.</P>
    <P>Of course, they made the obvious point that until a proper costing system is introduced into the flour milling industry, it will be impossible to be certain as to the degree of efficiency that is to be found in that industry.</P>
    <P>On page 59 of their report of 1956, they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We accordingly strongly recommend that a uniform costing system, on the lines of that devised by the Department of Agriculture, amended, where necessary, in the light of <Col N="214" /> developments since 1950-51, should be installed in the mills without further delay.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, the flour millers have completely ignored this recommendation and have allowed the demonstrably inefficient mills to continue to operate, without taking any steps to bring themselves up to the position of efficiency which would allow them to reduce their working costs.  This is all very well in an industry making television sets, motor cars, washing machines or refrigerators, where that could be considered permissible, but in an industry which is concerned with the provision at the lowest possible cost of our daily bread, it seems to me to be the height of irresponsibility on the part of the flour millers that they have not yet seen fit to examine their own industry in order to find out in what way it could be brought to its maximum level of efficiency.</P>
    <P>The average cost varied between 12/8d. and £1.15.1d.  Obviously, that is an appalling range of discrepancy between the lowest and the highest. The Committee report shows that there must be a considerable measure of inefficiency in mills for which the consumer is paying.  That is the most important thing.  The profits do not suffer.  The flour millers continue to take their profits.  They merely put an increase on the price of bread.  I think any State company would hasten to introduce an efficient costing system so that they would be able to weed out the inefficient from the efficient.  This has been neglected by the flour millers.</P>
    <P>There is another situation which arises every year&mdash;we are at present engaged in it&mdash;and that is the disputation which goes on between the Department of Agriculture, the farmers and the flour millers over this question of a fair price for the wheat and the test for the millability of wheat.  The millers consider they are to be the final judges on the suitability of wheat for the mills and for making into bread.  Consequently, of course, the farmer is completely in their hands.  He appears to have <Col N="215" /> little or no right of appeal.  He has no redress that I can see, readily available to him, at any rate.  Consequently, the millers have the final say and that, I think, is most undesirable.  If a State company were formed, we would have a situation in which farmers' representatives would have an equal say with everybody else.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the decision as to millability, the definition of &ldquo;millable&rdquo; wheat is clearly so imprecise in its wording as to be open to practically any interpretation at all. Wheat must be commercially clean, in sound and sweet condition and capable, having regard to the methods customarily used in the milling industry for the cleaning and conditioning of wheat, of being milled into flour suitable for human consumption.  That could be interpreted and is being interpreted by the millers any way they want to and the farmers can do little or nothing about it.  No attempt has been made by the millers to devise a more precise test or definition of millability in order to try to make it possible for the farmers to know exactly where they stand every year with their crop.</P>
    <P>We have another position developing in the milling industry which I consider is undesirable and which should be changed, that is, that a large sector of the flour milling industry is controlled from outside the country.  These people outside the country have little or no interest in or appreciation of the implications of their decisions and failure to increase efficiency.  So long as they can take a fair profit, a good profit or a fat profit, they do not mind what the consequences for the consuming public are.</P>
    <P>The flour milling industry has also failed in another respect.  In spite of the considerable capital assets, equipment and machinery available to it, it has played only a negligible part in the development of the industrialisation of the country over the years.  It simply developed the provision of animal feeding, which was easy enough.  Very little trouble was involved there.  It is now advancing out <Col N="216" /> into what, to my mind, is also undesirable, an attempt to control the bakery trade.  In the report of the Flour and Bread Committee of 1956, there is reference to a developing monopoly situation.  Sixty per cent.&mdash;a most undesirable feature&mdash;of the milling capacity is now in the hands of two milling companies.  At page 84 of the report, they say:</P>
    <P>It is significant that the two milling companies which have recently taken steps to acquire bakeries belong to the two groups, referred to in Paragraph 40 of the Flour and Bread Inquiry, which together control two-thirds of the nominal capacity of the milling industry&mdash;one of the groups in turn being in effect controlled by an English company.</P>
    <P>They go on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If present trends continue, these two groups might eventually dominate not alone the milling industry but also the baking industry.</P>
    <P>That is the development which is clearly worrying many people in the bakery trade.  They are to be gobbled up by these very powerful milling industries and eventually there will be a complete monopoly, not only in the milling industry but also in the bakery trade.</P>
    <P>We think it is time that the Government stepped in to stop this development of a monopoly position before it has gone too far.  We could clearly reach a position in which these two companies could absorb the whole of the milling capacity and then a takeover bid by the English company for the Irish company would leave the English company in complete control of the production and distribution of the flour milling industry and the bakery trade as well.  That seems to be a most undesirable prospect.  I cannot see why the people of Ireland cannot themselves take over&mdash;establish a State company, take over the industry and establish their own monopoly so that any benefits accruing from the monopoly position come back to the consumer, the taxpayer and the people.</P>
    <P>The other failure on the part of the flour milling industry is that it has failed to develop and expand in the industrial <Col N="217" /> field.  It is now faced with a reduction in consumption&mdash;whatever the reason is unimportant at the moment&mdash;in the consumption of bread. Yet the industry has an increasing milling capacity.  It has made no attempt whatsoever to diversify its industrial interests and is now confined to a very narrow field.  This narrow field is getting progressively narrower. That seems to me to be a situation which the industry could have anticipated. The millers should have anticipated it and taken steps to see that they developed their activities, so that if a contraction did come about, they could have expanded in another way.</P>
    <P>The millers failed to take any part in the expansion of exports, or even to try to take any part in the expansion of exports.  It is true that it is difficult to expand exports in such a trade, but it is possible to do it and they have failed to take even a small part in the drive for increased exports.</P>
    <P>With the increase in the percentage of native wheat in the grist for flour milling, there is a very high percentage of temporary employment.  Men are out of employment for a large part of the year and the millers have not attempted to organise their industry so as to employ their workers for the whole round of the year.</P>
    <P>The milling industry has made no contribution to the development or organisation of research into the problems of wheat growing in our particular atmospheric conditions, the problematical weather.  The position, as we are told by those millers, is that the person who grows wheat by conacre, the telephone farmers, as they have been called, is the person who grows the worst wheat and we are told by the Minister for Agriculture that he does not know how much wheat is grown by conacre.  Nobody has attempted to find out how much wheat is grown by conacre and apparently that is the worst kind of wheat.  This seems to me to be another failure on the part of the millers.</P>
    <P>I do not know how a private company could control the types of farmer who grows wheat except by the contract system.  Under Comhlucht <Col N="218" /> Siúicre Éireann, it has been found possible to develop the contract system, but that is a semi-State company and does not present the grave dangers which would arise if these millers were allowed to control the acreage of wheat permitted to any particular farmer which would give them something in the form of a monopoly.  There is a position already existing in regard to agencies which is part of the restrictive practices operated by these people.  This is the case where a particular miller cannot buy in a great wheat growing area because an agent has it tied up and will not allow him to get supplies. That increases the costs because that man has to go to another area to get his supplies or buy dried wheat from a drier who has a surplus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  In relation to the bakery trade, it is clear to one studying the costs in that trade that there is a great variation in those costs.  There must be inefficient bakers and some solution must be found for that problem.  The Committee stated that it was obvious that inquiries into the matter of the production and selling costs of bread must concentrate as much, if not more, on selling than production.  It seems to me to be difficult to leave out the milling trade and not take in the bakery trade, particularly in view of the latest development of the existing position, of the millers taking over the bakeries. If we establish a State company for one section of the industry, we are justified in establishing it for the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment standing in the names of Deputy Desmond and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;these commodities&rdquo; in the fifth line and substitute &ldquo;flour&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In doing so, I should like, first of all, to express the view that this question of bread and the price of bread as it affects the poorer sections of the community has been a matter of concern for many years.  A very large percentage of our community, particularly those on the lower income level, such as those in receipt of social welfare benefits, rely to a great extent for their diet on bread and margarine.  In those circumstances, it appears to me only reasonable that the State should, through some form of public company, some form of State concern, take some greater responsibility for endeavouring to assure this section of the community, and the community in general, that this particular article of diet will be available to them at prices that they can afford to pay.</P>
      <P>It is true, I think, that the consumption of bread has been going down for some years.  One wonders whether that reduction is effected by the fact that so many families have been leaving the country over the years, having regard to the fact that in recent years the trend has been, not for individual members of a family to go, but for whole families to go.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this matter, apart from the desirability of ensuring that the consumers can purchase adequate supplies of bread.  It is an aspect which is very frequently the subject of debate in this House, the aspect of national policy regarding the growing of wheat.  It has been accepted as national policy for many years that we should increase the percentage of home-grown wheat and various methods have been used to further it. From the point of view of the consumer, to some extent, there has been a form of compulsion because of regulations which provide that a certain percentage of the grist must be obtained from Irish wheat, and there have been efforts made to subsidise the growing of wheat by our farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is accepted that a basic item of <Col N="220" /> diet, such as bread, should be provided for the consumers at reasonable cost, and if it is to be our continued policy to encourage the growing of wheat, it must be obvious that there should be an acceptance of the necessity to establish proper machinery to realise these objectives.  In that connection I submit that the machinery existing at present, so far as the milling of wheat and flour is concerned, is not the most desirable for that purpose.  Over the years, the flour milling industry has been the subject of a number of inquiries, and not just for the sake of holding inquiries. They have been held because there has been a very widespread suspicion that the flour milling industry has been becoming a monopoly and that its control and the profits from it are passing into the hands of people outside the country.  Indeed, there has been very widespread suspicion that the industry has not been operated for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>These inquiries have been rather exhaustive, but, so far as the ordinary layman is concerned, they have not produced many effective results.  A number of recommendations have been made but whether they have been of any value to the consumer or producer is, even to-day, a subject of very great doubt.  Ownership of the industry has tended to become concentrated in very few hands and the bakery industry has been brought into line with it to an extent that, in the course of a few years' time, it may well be impossible to dissociate one from the other, to separate flour milling from the baking of bread and its distribution, with the result that a future inquiry may produce no more effective results than previous ones.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, and because we are dealing with the basic question, it is surely desirable to do some rethinking. If it has been shown to be beneficial in general ways to the community as a whole to have organisations such as the Irish Sugar Company and Bord na Móna, surely it is valid to argue that this industry should be examined with a view to its transfer out of the hands of those whose main concern it is to make a profit and into <Col N="221" /> a semi-State undertaking whose concern it would be to ensure its healthy development and service to the community?</P>
    <P>We hear frequently in this House and we read almost daily in the newspapers of contention between the flour millers and the farmers who grow the wheat.  There never appears to be agreement on whether things are being operated in a reasonable way.  If a semi-State organisation were set up, aside from ensuring the proper and efficient production of flour, proper conditions of employment and proper safeguards and protection to the workers in the industry, the farmers might be in a position to operate on a basis such as exists at present and which appears to give reasonable satisfaction between the Sugar Company and the Beet Growers' Association whereby those who wish to produce beet are reasonably assured that there will be a contract for its production.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the motion in so far as it applies to the flour milling industry and having regard to the fact that in the type of development that is taking place in industry at the present time in this country&mdash; its gradual and accelerating development of mechanisation leading almost to automation&mdash;the setting-up of a State-sponsored company could ensure the protection of the workers engaged in the flour milling industry.  To-day, as the monopoly grows, mills are closed down.  Those employed in smaller mills have no protection.  They are left on the labour market and can only join those others who leave the country in search of employment.</P>
    <P>In circumstances where proper and efficient development of the milling industry might necessitate some contraction in the labour force, at least it would be possible to follow the example which has been shown by C.I.E. since its reorganisation.  The workers in the industry would then have some protection afforded to them.</P>
    <P>While there appears to be a sound case in present circumstances for taking this monopoly private enterprise <Col N="222" /> control of the milling industry away from it and applying to that industry a type of organisation based on service to the community, and in particular based on the efficient production of flour, there is some difficulty regarding the question of the bakery industry and the distribution of bread.  Flour milling interests have entered increasingly in recent years into the actual baking of bread.  Nevertheless, a very large number of smaller concerns have been giving reasonable employment and providing a service to the community in the baking and distribution of bread.</P>
    <P>It appears that there would be very little hope under present circumstances of making the change envisaged in the motion without disrupting and adversely affecting the living of a very large section of the community.  Bread is baked in places other than large bakeries.  Even at present it is baked in smaller units.  It is delivered even to shops which take bread from the larger bakeries.  In many cities and towns it is delivered direct to the consumer by people employed on the distributive side of the trade.</P>
    <P>I feel that at this time there is no justification for thinking in terms of taking over the whole machinery, which has slowly been developed over the years, of baking and distribution and converting it into an organisation such as the Sugar Company.  I do not think the system would permit its changeover without injuring severely many small interests involved.  I am of opinion it would be quite possible to take over the private interests of the flourmillers and it is quite clear that in the course of the years changes will take place in the baking and distribution of the bread.</P>
    <P>I feel the justification is not here at this stage to ask the House for support for a motion to take into semi-State hands the baking and distribution of bread.  While the baking of batch bread may be concentrated in the larger bakeries there is also the baking of brown bread, brown cakes, and so on, which are also a part of the diet of people.  In many cases, this article of diet is baked in very small home <Col N="223" /> bakeries and is available for direct sale for consumers in towns and villages.  If accepted, the motion would affect not only those concerned in the larger industrial undertakings but those concerned in the much smaller undertakings.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of distribution, the problem of the bakery is an old one which is not easily solved.  I do not think the motion would solve the many difficulties, the many problems and the complex situation in the bakery industry.  The motion, if amended, would read as follows:</P>
    <P>Having regard to the paramount importance of flour and bread as the staple diet of our people, and the necessity to bring these commodities within the reach of all the people without hardship to them, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the national interest and the common good require that the production and distribution of flour should be taken over by a State corporation on the general lines of the Sugar Company, such corporation to be non-profit making and all its shares to be held by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The prime concern is to endeavour to ensure that the poorer sections of the community are protected because they have to rely on bread to a great extent as a staple article of diet.  Over the years, this House has failed to give them protection by way of price control; and the Government, apparently, do not propose to introduce legislation to protect them.  In the past, by the removal of the subsidies, they have, in fact, brought about increases in the prices of foodstuffs.  The time has come when the House should place on record its view that steps should be taken to have the flour industry operate for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion as on the Order Paper, stripped of its verbiage, means simply that the House supports the nationalisation of the flour milling and bakery industries in this country. In making arguments for such a course, it is very easy to introduce a <Col N="224" /> lot of sentiment and make arguments based on dietary considerations, but it is necessary to have regard to the economic factors involved in such a proposal.</P>
      <P>I take it that the proposer of the motion and the proposer of the amendment will agree that, in the event of any such nationalisation proposals being implemented, there should be some compensation for those engaged in these two aspects of the supply and marketing of flour and bread?  If they do, then they must have regard to what the cost of such compensation would be and how the money which would have to be made available could be raised by the State.  Neither of the two speakers applied themselves to an appraisal of what that cost should be and of what the existing capital assets of the bakery and flour milling industries comprise at present.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, the proposition would mean the raising of funds by the State and of creating public debt amounting to between £12,000,000 and £14,000,000 to pay over to the flour milling and bakery trade so as to acquire their present businesses.  I shall refer later to how these estimates were arrived at.  However, the effect must be looked at also.  The first effect to be sought for is whether there would be any increase in the country's productive capacity as a result of such a take-over. Having paid by way of compensation sums of from £12,000,000 to £14,000,000, one must immediately ask: to what purpose would these huge sums of money be subsequently applied?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposing the motion, Deputy Browne said that to some extent the financial interests in the flour milling industry and bakery trade were exercised by persons resident outside this country.  Therefore, it is perhaps not unreasonable to presume that some of the money that would have to be paid for the take-over of these two industries <Col N="225" /> would find its way to sources outside the country and there would likely be a net loss to the resources of this country.</P>
    <P>This Government have no doctrinaire views about nationalisation.  As Deputy Dr. Browne said, the question of ethics does not arise in his motion because there is evidence, from both sides of the House, of nationalisation of certain industries.  But there is an essential difference in this case compared with some of the examples he gave.  For example, Bord na Móna and Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann are State companies, but they were formed for the purpose of undertaking a job that private enterprise had not been able to do, or had certainly shown no signs of being competent to undertake. Therefore, strictly speaking, there is no analogy between the two cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we all bought loads of turf from the local farmers in the old days?  That was private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It was private enterprise, but the production of turf on such a small scale is not the same as the production envisaged by Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>The question would have to be considered whether the advantages likely to accrue would be worthwhile, and no Government would be prepared to undertake such a take-over, unless substantial advantages were likely to accrue.  In the case of these two industries, it is possible that there would be few advantages and many disadvantages in their nationalisation. It is true that many flour millers would welcome nationalisation.  As the proposer of the motion said, there has been for some years a decline in the consumption of flour.  He referred to the paradoxical explanation of this decline in the suggestion that we are a particularly prosperous country.  I do not think anybody ever suggested that we here are a particularly prosperous country, but the suggestion has been made&mdash;with, I think, some justification&mdash;that, by reason of the increase in the standard of living which has been evident over a number of years, the consumption of flour has declined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> That has been borne out by examination of the consumption of flour and other food commodities in other countries, particularly by the F.A.O. in Rome in respect of its examination of the consumption of bread and flour in Europe.  All the countries of Europe, over a number of years past, have decreased their consumption of bread and flour and therefore it is nothing of a phenomenon in this country.  By reason of that decline in consumption, most millers, not only here but in other parts of the world, have excess capacity and that is one of the reasons why it is not illogical to assume that flour millers here would welcome nationalisation and with it, the taking over by the State of some or all of their excess capacity.</P>
    <P>An assurance of having their businesses purchased as going concerns by the Government would naturally be attractive to the millers who are most apprehensive of competition because they are the ones who will first be most likely to close.  It is estimated that there is about thirty per cent. excess capacity in this industry and under nationalisation, the State would be paying for that excess capacity and it would be acquiring productive assets thirty per cent. or so in excess of requirements.</P>
    <P>To examine the effect of nationalisation on prices, would, I think, be an important exercise in this study.  I do not think it can be said that nationalisation would reduce prices; on the contrary, it is more than likely that it would increase them.  When this motion was put on the Order Paper, there were 33 flour milling establishments in the country and approximately 700 commercial bakeries.  Competition has reduced that figure of 33 to 31 at present, but the book value of the assets employed by those firms engaged in flour milling is approximately £6 million.  The replacement value would obviously be much more. The book value of the bakery trade is similarly estimated at about £6 million and assuming that compensation were to be paid solely on the basis of the book value, without any compensation for disturbance and other factors, there would have to be paid at least £12 <Col N="227" /> million in cash to take them over.  A more realistic figure would perhaps be £14 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It would probably cost about £14 million to compensate those whose business would be taken over in the event of nationalisation and to raise that sum would require repayment of interest at about 6 per cent., or about £1½ million a year.  This would, of course, impose a very heavy capital burden on the community.  The Deputy suggested that nationalisation would mean that the profits would go towards making the industries more efficient or towards raising wages or reducing the price of bread.  The profits out of these two industries are estimated to be in the region of about £1 million so that an immediate increase in bread and flour prices would result in the event of nationalisation because of the extra £½ million it would cost to run these industries.  It would probably mean an increase of 2/- per sack of flour or 1d. in the 4-lb. loaf.</P>
      <P>I should mention that these profits were held by the committees of inquiry to which the Deputy has referred as being in no way excessive and in fact the Lavery Committee, dealing with the profits of the bakery trade during the period of the subsidies, said that for a long period the profits they were permitted to draw were held at too low a level and recommended, at one stage, that they should be compensated for that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy suggested that a uniform costing system would be necessary, first of all, to see whether the industries were being efficiently run and, I take it, ultimately if this motion were acceptable, to ascertain what measure of compensation would be payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> I should like to remind the Deputy that uniformity of costing was recommended by the Lavery Committee against the background of subsidisation, and I think it is fair to say that the Government set the committee to that task purely for the purpose of measuring to what extent subsidies were being properly applied.</P>
    <P>Assuming, as I think it more than likely, that bread and flour would cost more if nationalisation came about, the question would then be raised: could such high costs be offset in any way by economies?  I have said that there is already&mdash;I do not think it is disputed&mdash;about 30 per cent. excess milling capacity and by reason of the decline in consumption of bread, it is not unreasonable to assume that there is at least that much or even more excess capacity in the bakery trade. Economies could of course be achieved by rationalisation, by the closing of mills and bakeries which are not required to meet the needs of the community. It is estimated that there are 3,000, or a few more or less, employed in the milling industry and approximately 3,500 in the bakery trade. Elimination of excess capacity, therefore, would mean the disemployment of roughly 1,000 milling employees and 1,500 or so bakery employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should people stop eating bread just because there is nationalisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proceeding on the basis of roughly the present consumption of bread and flour.  I have suggested, and I think it can be proved that I am right, that no reduction in bread and flour prices could be effected merely by nationalisation and I have indicated that against the £1 million profit that both sides of the industry are taking at present, it would cost £1½ million per annum to remunerate the capital necessary to compensate those at present engaged in the milling and bakery industry.  That would immediately indicate that in order to find £½ million extra per annum, there would have to be an increase in bread and flour prices or economies would have to be achieved otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> I am now dealing with how such economies could be achieved and one of the methods, of course, is rationalisation. That would mean the closing of the less efficient mills and bakeries and, of necessity, the disemployment of the numbers I mentioned&mdash;about 1,000 flour mill workers and 1,500 bakery workers.  Such action, of course, action brought about by deliberate acts of a Government, would involve compensation arrangements for these workers.  It is an accepted principle that people who have been disemployed by direct legislative action of the Government are entitled to some measure of compensation.  I do not know to what extent the disemployed workers in these two branches of the trade could be compensated but even if we took a figure of £1,000 as being fair compensation&mdash;I am not suggesting that it is; it could well be much more and may be less&mdash;a figure of £1,000 per head of these people would amount to £2,500,000 increased burden on the community that nationalisation might bring in its wake.</P>
    <P>The idea that nationalisation could reduce flour prices is based on the assumption that far too high profits are being made at the present time. Flour prices were controlled between 1939 and 1957 because they were being subsidised then.  During that period there were many consultations between the millers and the authorities responsible for the subsidies.  Most of these consultations and inquiries, such as those conducted by the Lavery Committee, related as I have said, to the reduction of subsidy rather than to the reduction of prices, but during the course of these consultations and during the course of one of these inquiries the Lavery Committee reported that the profits millers were permitted to take certainly did not err on the side of generosity or, if they did, they erred very little.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We can prove that when we get an efficient costing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1957 the method of subsidisation has, of course, ceased but the policy has since been directed towards the promotion of <Col N="230" /> competition.  As I said at the outset, two mills have closed even since this motion was put down by reason of inability to measure up to competition. That was in 1958.  Another mill has closed down in the present year&mdash;the Midleton Mills.  Two mills in Cork have amalgamated into one in order to achieve greater efficiency, the St. John's Mills and National Flour Mills.</P>
      <P>I have argued in the House on a number of occasions about the effectiveness of the competition that I suggest is taking place and the very good reasons for it.  It is naturally in the interests of the mills to ensure, so far as they can, that the level of consumption of bread and flour will be at least maintained and so far as possible will be raised.  Therefore, it is obviously not in their interests to raise the prices of bread or to be so indifferent to efficient methods of production as to permit bread and flour to be on sale at prices that are beyond the reach of the ordinary people, if they can avoid it.  It is reasonable to assume that they try to avoid putting bread beyond the reach of the average person, be he in the middle or the lower income group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Even for a vital necessity because, as I have stated&mdash;I think the Deputy's question is taken out of the context of my argument&mdash; with the increasing standard of living in the world people, as Deputy Browne himself said, are turning to other forms of food and therefore it is in the interests of flour millers and bakers to promote in the minds of the people the idea of the value of bread as against other types of food that they would otherwise buy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> I should like, however, to point out that notwithstanding the attempts at maintaining or increasing the consumption of bread through the present campaign of advertising and other methods, there is not a very wide margin for competition in the industry when one realises that at the present time the Irish native wheat represents about 80 per cent. of the raw material and that has to be bought at prices which are fixed by the Government. There are other charges such as freight, cost of sacks, depreciation and such like which vary, I understand, very little as between the millers.  So much for flour.</P>
    <P>In the case of bread, prices were controlled from 1936 to 1957 and, as I have already stated, the Lavery Committee reported that for very long periods prices were kept far too low and that restitution was due to the industry.</P>
    <P>No doubt, concentration of all bakery activities in a few large mechanical bakeries would reduce factory costs but at the expense of employment. Assuming that this were done, even at the expense of employment, one would have to take into account the counter-balancing cost of distribution and, in the long run, it is very doubtful that, even by nationalisation in this manner, even by cutting out the smaller bakeries and concentrating on the larger ones, as would be an inevitable result of nationalisation, the people would get their bread any cheaper.</P>
    <P>These are some of the problems arising out of the existence of excess flour-milling capacity, but I do not think it can be claimed that the problems could be solved more easily by nationalisation rather than by present operations.</P>
    <P>In reference to excess capacity, Deputy Dr. Browne suggested that the millers themselves have never made any attempt to invade the export market but, of course, he ignores the fact that the market immediately open to us for bread and bread products is in Britain, where they already have a very high excess capacity of their own.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> There is, of course, I understand, a small export from the Donegal mills to the Six Counties and, to the extent that we have increased our exports of confectionery and biscuits, the flour millers have contributed to that export by making available flour which is milled from imported wheat.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume, having regard to the success in the competitive foreign markets that our biscuits and confectionery products have enjoyed, that the contribution of the millers to that success has been efficient.  At least it is an indication of the extent to which they can produce flour efficiently for this purpose.</P>
    <P>It is true, perhaps, that the millers have not used that excess capacity otherwise.  Naturally, I would be glad to see that they could do so by employing their plant and their buildings for other purposes if it were feasible.  I do not know whether it is or not but having regard to the fact that they have such excess capacity I am sure it is a matter they must have considered from time to time and rather than let such plant lie idle, if they could use it profitably otherwise, they would be glad to do so if they were in a position to find an alternative form of industrialisation.</P>
    <P>To summarise, on the two main aspects, first of all, the costs of nationalisation and whether, in the long run, flour and bread would be any cheaper as a result, I think it is clear that nationalisation would not effect any reduction in the cost of either flour or bread.  It would be more likely to necessitate an increase, if a process of rationalisation is necessitated by the excess capacity that now exists.  It could be as easily dealt with in present conditions as it could be by nationalisation.  An important point which must be considered is that it would mean collecting from £12,000,000 to £14,000,000&mdash;perhaps not less than £14,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is 30 per cent. excess capacity in the flour milling trade and presumably in the bakery trade as well.  It is possible that some of those 1,500 persons have already lost their employment, but assuming 30 per cent. over-capacity exists in both sides of the trade, that would mean there would be 1,000 redundant workers on the milling side and up to 1,500 on the bakery side, if that excess capacity were eliminated, as it is suggested it would have to be, under nationalisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposed to a socialist solution for some of our economic problems and, in that regard, we are opposed to the suggestion in the motion that bakeries should be nationalised.  We do, however, accept the amendment that flour ought to be brought under Government control for the reason that, for a number of years, the State has assumed responsibility for paying a guaranteed price for wheat.  Taking one year with another, that has resulted in excess supplies of unsuitable wheat and, at the same time, <Col N="234" /> the consumer has been obliged to pay an artificially high price for flour and bread.  It seems, therefore, that, from every angle, the present arrangement is unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>Excess quantities of unsuitable wheat are being supplied to the mills, which, in turn, the millers reject as unsuitable for manufacture into flour.  The difference between what that wheat is sold for, for animal feed or other purposes, has to be met by the Exchequer. On the other hand, the consumer of flour and bread is obliged to pay a high price for flour.  We feel, therefore, it is desirable that that situation should be re-examined and that consideration should be given to bringing the flour industry under Government direction.</P>
      <P>This matter, as is well known, has been the subject of two examinations in recent years, first, by the Flour and Bread Committee which reported some years ago, and secondly, in 1956.  The various aspects affecting the industry were examined in great detail on both of those occasions and certain conclusions were reached.  It is our view that there is no case for the acquisition of bakeries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We believe the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government should watch with the greatest care the widespread acquisition of small bakeries which has developed in recent years.  Small bakeries have been acquired by certain interests and the virtual disappearance from some towns of privatelyowned and privately-run firms is, in our view, not in the best interests either of effective competition in the industry or of the towns in which these industries&mdash;specialised and in many cases family-run&mdash;operated efficiently and provided employment in small towns.  The situation which has developed in recent years has meant that these small bakeries have been acquired by larger concerns and, in certain instances, bread is now brought very many miles by van from central depots or central bakeries and sold over a wide area.  That is a tendency that should be watched closely and, <Col N="235" /> if necessary, steps should be taken to prevent further development along those lines.</P>
      <P>It is an illusion to imagine that merely by nationalising an industry, it becomes more efficient.  That is one of the socialist myths which have been exploded and they themselves have come to accept elsewhere in recent years that it is no longer valid.  I strongly believe that in certain circumstances the State should operate and run industries.  There are very many examples in this country of the efficient and effective running of State concerns established to operate particular undertakings&mdash;the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna, C.I.E. and many others come to mind&mdash;but where private enterprise is already operating, as it has operated for a long time so far as bakeries are concerned, there is no justification for State intervention.</P>
      <P>Where State intervention in this case is justified is in connection with the acquisition and direction of the flour milling industry because of the fact that the State has already assumed responsibility for payment of a guaranteed price for wheat.  The result has been that over a period the excess quantities of unsuitable wheat have involved the Exchequer in meeting further charges.  In turn, the consumer has been obliged to pay an artificially high price for bread and flour.</P>
      <P>Experience in recent years justifies further examination of the present method by which wheat is grown and the present system under which the State guarantees a price to the producer and accepts responsibility for losses, if excess quantities of unsuitable wheat are produced.  The guaranteed price should be paid for millable wheat and suitable inducements should be offered to the producers, but some system should be adopted which will enable excess quantities to be avoided. An effort should be made to operate a system which will prevent the accumulation of large excess quantities such as have arisen in recent years; almost every second year that situation has developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> It is an illusion to suggest that the acquisition by the State of bakeries would mean cheaper bread.  On the other hand, it does seem somewhat strange that the flourmilling interests should publish advertisements recommending people to eat more bread.  I have always held the view that cheaper bread and cheaper flour are best possible advertisements.  They will advertise themselves and it does not require expensive advertisements in the newspapers to convince people they should eat more bread.  If the flourmillers directed their attention towards providing cheaper flour, the bakeries would be able to produce cheaper bread and to sell cheaper flour.</P>
    <P>We support the amendment in the names of Deputies Larkin and Desmond, but we are opposed to the suggestion in the motion that bakeries should be acquired.  It is in the national interest that this whole question of flourmilling and the arrangements under which a guaranteed price is provided for wheat should be reviewed. The present arrangements are regarded by all concerned as unsatisfactory.  It seems that the State and the consumer are both paying for excess quantities of an inferior commodity.  At the same time, the advantages of a cheaper commodity are denied to the consumer and the State, at both ends, has to accept responsibility.</P>
    <P>Some revised arrangement by which a guaranteed price would be paid for a certain quantity of millable wheat should be substituted, but the suggestion that control in respect of flour and bread should be taken over entirely, as is envisaged in the motion, does not meet with our approval.  So far as bakeries are concerned, I should like the Minister and his Department to pay particular attention to the development whereby certain concerns have acquired a number of bakeries and centralised them into a single concern. That, in our view, is not in the interests of anyone concerned in the bakery trade.  The employment of some workers may be endangered by it; the prospect of cheaper bread has been largely eliminated; and the effect of competition which should provide an incentive is being jeopardised by it.  That matter was the subject of <Col N="237" /> examination when the Lavery Committee reported and the developments since then indicate that it is a matter that should be kept under close review. We are in favour of the amendment and opposed to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard any case made yet against this motion. I listened carefully to the Minister in his contribution to the debate and I must confess to a feeling of great disappointment that he seemed to take a matter of such vital importance to the wellbeing of the community in such a casual fashion.  He produced certain figures&mdash;and I doubt very much whether they can be substantiated&mdash; in connection with the question of compensation to the millers themselves and referred to the danger from nationalisation if uneconomic mills had to close down.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal first with the milling end of the question.  I am glad to note that Deputy Cosgrave, although he is not in favour of part of the motion in connection with the bakery trade, is in favour of Government control over the production of flour. That is only a logical statement on his part, in view of the fact that he was a member of a Cabinet which, I am sure, discussed time and again the problem of the farmer, as far as the growing of wheat was concerned and that of the consumer, as far as the price of bread was concerned.</P>
      <P>From reading the Lavery Report, I believe that the Government in office who set up the Committee which brought out that report were very much in favour of the State taking control of the Milling industry. Changes have taken place in that industry since 1956, changes that were becoming apparent even in 1956.  There have been greater developments in the past few years and I refer to the gradual taking over of the bakery industry by the milling concerns themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great anxiety has been displayed here that the small bakers throughout the country would be likely to be put out of action through the nationalisation of the milling and bakery industry <Col N="238" /> but the simple fact is that at the moment the milling industry itself is gradually putting the small bakeries out of existence.  A great percentage of the major bakeries have fallen into the hands of the milling industry so that under the present trend there is a greater danger.  With the milling industry left in the hands of private enterprise there is greater danger to the bakery industry and to the small bakers if this trend is not arrested now. The only way to arrest that trend in my opinion is to take the steps outlined in the motion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne pointed out that the two milling groups in this country between them mill over 60 per cent. of our national requirements of wheat. These two groups, namely Odlums and Ranks, actually carry out the milling requirements of 61 per cent. of our requirements.  That in itself does not constitute a monopoly but the really sinister point behind the power exercised by those two groups is that not alone do they control the milling industry as such but to a great extent they control grain storage, the importing end of it and the provender end of it.  As I pointed out they are also gradually gaining control of the bakery part of it.  Although the two groups mill over 60 per cent. of our national requirements between them, the same two groups control almost the entire grain trade and their tentacles reach into all aspects pertaining to the milling industry.</P>
    <P>The so called independent groups in the milling business to-day are only independent in theory.  In actual fact, they are dependent for their existence on importers who in turn are controlled by the two groups to whom I have referred.  Therefore, it means that behind the scenes practically the entire flour milling industry is controlled from the importation stage to the storage end of it, the provender end and the bakery end, by two major groups.  One of these groups is controlled from outside this State, namely Ranks.  In the national interest it is a highly undesirable state of affairs that such a monopoly should be in the hands of two groups.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> There seems to be a feeling in this House that it would be wrong for the State to interfere in a matter where private enterprise has held sway for so many years.  In my opinion there is a far greater justification for the people, through a State body, owning and controlling the flour milling industry than there is for the people owning the production of electric light or controlling their railways.  Moral considerations, in my opinion, do not enter into this at all.  There can be no dispute on that by any member of this House because already, as a Parliament, we have in various other fields given authority to the State to set up State or semi-State bodies to exploit, develop and control, in the national interest, industries and various forms of development which are not at all as important as the production of a vital commodity such as bread.  If the present trend is allowed to continue within a few years the remaining flour millers and bakeries, which are independent at the moment, will be absorbed.  That is the aim of the two groups I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is one significant omission with regard to the amount of control they exercise and that is that, so far, they have not been allowed to control the actual growing of wheat.  Although personally I am completely in favour of setting up the contract system for the growing of wheat, just as we have a contract system for the growing of beet, under present circumstances while control of the flour milling industry lies in the hands of these two groups it would be disastrous to bring in a system of contracts and allow the milling interests, as they are, to exercise that control.  If that position is arrived at, and that is what these milling groups are aiming at, then the entire community can be held up to ransom by these people.</P>
    <P>At the moment the Flour Millers Association are sending their public relations officers around to every agricultural committee suggesting to them that it would be a far better proposition to have control exercised over the growing of wheat and pointing out that, as far as the small farmer is concerned, he is not getting a fair crack. <Col N="240" /> But the millers are not worried about the small farmer or the conacre man. They are solely interested in getting control of the whole milling industry, right from the sowing and growing of the wheat.  If the Government are not prepared to accept the motion, I hope that the farmers' Deputies who are members of the Government Party will ensure at their Party meetings that the Government will not fall into the trap which has been prepared for them by the millers, namely, the setting up of a contract system for the growing of wheat and leaving that control to be exercised by the monopoly which has been operating here over the years.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out that two groups, namely Odlums and Ranks, are the key groups in so far as the flour milling industry is concerned.  We shall first take the Odlum group.  I understand from inquiries that I have made&mdash; certainly the information was not available from Government sources&mdash; that the Odium group controls eight mills in this country to-day and that those eight mills represent over 30 per cent. of our total milling capacity.</P>
    <P>The same group control three large bakeries in Dublin and one in Waterford. In addition to that&mdash;and this is of great importance&mdash;they also control 23 grain stores.  These grain stores are in various parts of the country and I do not propose to delay the House giving details of where they are, but it can be taken that ranging from Sligo over to Portarlington, down to New Ross, up to Dundalk and, of course, Dublin, they have this grain storage accommodation.  They have it in the midlands, the south and to a less noticeable extent in the west. In addition to that, this same group control the port grain installations in both Dublin and Waterford.  As well as that, they have six subsidiary companies which are officially known as importer-distributors, but which, in fact, are brokerage houses which import and export on behalf of Odlums. These brokerage houses are part of the Odium group.  These houses in turn reach out their tentacles to control four provender milling companies as well.  It can be seen, therefore, that the ramifications of the Odlum group are widespread.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> The other group&mdash;the Rank group &mdash;is in a similar position.  They have five mills and they again control over 30 per cent. of the total milling capacity within the State.  The result of all this is that the supposedly independent flour mills, bakeries or provender mills are cornered and their continued existence in business depends on their cooperation with one or other, or both, of the groups to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, one notable exception at the moment, that is, Bolands, who are millers as well as bakers.  It is believed throughout the trade at the moment that within a very short time the same fate awaits that independent company as that which overtook another one, Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien, some years ago. When the cornering of the shares of that company have taken place, then we can say goodbye to any independent milling group in the country.  Complete control will then be in the hands of the two companies to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Take what Deputy Dr. Browne dealt with&mdash;the consumers' point of view.  It would be reasonable to expect that, as a result of the monopoly created, the take-over of these bakeries and the increasing control exercised by these groups, greater efficiency would have ensued and that a consequent result of that increased efficiency would be a reduction in the price of bread, but, in fact, it is the other way about.  In spite of the excuses that all these amalgamations are taking place in the name of efficiency, we have had nothing but a constant increase in the price of bread over the years.</P>
    <P>On the bread price alone, in spite of the fact that these people maintain they are highly efficient, we find that on the figures given by the millers, the selling cost and overheads on the 2-lb. loaf amount to 4¾d. and that in the same 2-lb. loaf, the cost of native wheat is only a little over 4¼d.  Therefore, the selling costs, namely, the transport costs and overheads are almost as high as the cost of the native wheat in the 2-lb. loaf.</P>
    <P>Where is the efficiency there? Deputy Cosgrave spoke about some <Col N="242" /> bakers travelling long distances and said it was a matter upon which an eye should be kept.  Keeping an eye on this thing is not worth a damn, unless you are prepared to take action and what action can we take?  I am going to give a specific example and the Minister may take a note of it.</P>
    <P>In the village where I was born in South Roscommon, there are three shops.  It is only a small village.  In the week, twelve bakeries visit that village.  Twelve different bakeries bring bread to that village.  There is no difference in the price offered to the shopkeepers by any of these bakeries.  Sometimes the bread van calls and may sell a dozen loaves and the next time they call, they may sell half a dozen loaves.  Can anybody tell me what is rational or sensible about a situation in the trade whereby twelve bakeries can call to a small village like that offering the same fare, the same product, at the same price and with no competition?</P>
    <P>Is that not where the costs come in? The cost of transport and overheads on a 2-lb. loaf amounts to over 4d.  Can we do anything about that?  Is it any use asking us to keep an eye on the situation?  What is the step that can be taken and should be taken in a case like that?  If a concrete suggestion were put forward on the question of nationalisation, then I would fall in with it but in order to reach that stage, you must first take over control of the milling industry.  The milling industry in turn at the moment controls a great percentage of the bakery trade and you must take over at least that proportion of the trade which is in the hands of the millers.  Then logically, after that, you must make the necessary arrangements to ensure that this overlapping and wild-cat competition is brought to an end.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt that if the proper steps were taken by the Government to control this alleged competition to the extent to which I have referred, namely, where 12 different bakeries send their vans to one small village, the result would be a reduction in transport costs and the price of bread could be brought down by at least one penny on the 2-lb. loaf.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> I make that statement and I defy the Minister to produce figures that will in any way prove that my figures are wrong.  It is open to any Deputy to say that employment is being given to 12 different drivers.  I am not denying that, but there is also the fact that 12 different vans are being used, that those vans are imported, that their tyres are imported, that their fuel is imported and that, to a great extent, the money so spent is going out of the country.</P>
    <P>In spite of the alleged increased efficiency which should have taken place, due to the take-over by the two major concerns, there is anything but increased efficiency because the price of bread has gone up.  That is the consumers' end of it.  As far as the producers are concerned, we have, at harvest time, the annual row.  There is an annual harvest war between the millers and the farmers who are growing wheat.  The position is beyond contradiction that there is no proper interpretation of what the millability of wheat means.  The 1956 report urged on the Government the absolute necessity of deciding once and for all what millability means and also urged that the decision on that should not rest with the millers but with the State.  No effort whatever has been made in that regard and to this day we find the millers deciding what wheat is millable.  We find the position that lorries bring in wheat to one mill which rejects it as unmillable and that same wheat is taken to another mill and accepted as millable, so that the farmer is completely at the mercy of the miller.  I have no great sympathy with the telephone farmer or the conacre farmer, but the farming members of the Fianna Fáil Party should realise that the very men who sent them into this House are being exploited by the flour millers.</P>
    <P>Not alone is the producer being hit in the production of wheat but of much wider implication is the fact that these two milling companies have a stranglehold on the feeding stuffs of the nation.  The poultry and pig industries which should be of major importance in the west of Ireland are <Col N="244" /> not allowed to flourish because of that stranglehold and until it is removed, there is no hope of proper development or full use being made of the bacon factories in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In addition to that side of it, these two groups have the control of all port and storage facilities.  Practically every aspect of the trade&mdash;the import and storage, milling and brokerage ends of it&mdash;is being gradually taken into the hands of these two groups. That means that a monopoly has been created, a monopoly that deals with one of the most important items on the table of the ordinary person.  That monopoly should not be allowed to exploit the poorer sections of the community and the fact is that the monopoly is not giving an adequate service to the farmer, either with regard to the wheat itself or the grain needed for feeding purposes.  As far as the consumer is concerned, there is complete dissatisfaction with the ever-increasing cost of bread.  Surely it is not suggested that a State body charged with responsibility to the community rather than with exploiting the community would prove less efficient than a monopoly of the nature I refer to, a great proportion of which is controlled from outside this country?</P>

If these Deputies have any interest in the welfare of the rural communities from which they come, it is too bad that they would not bring pressure to bear on the Government to realise that the control exercised by the milling groups is disastrous for the farmers of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Cosgrave has emphasised, we are opposed to any suggestion that there should be nationalisation of the bakery trade or of the distribution of bread.  I think Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan have been bitten by the socialist bug and that that accounts <Col N="245" /> for the terms of their motion which advocates a semi-State body to control flour milling and also the production and distribution of bread. As Deputy Cosgrave has said, we greatly regret the tendency of the small bakeries to disappear which has manifested itself.  We would prefer to see the bread trade in the hands of the local baker catering for his neighbours and the growing centralisation of that trade has for us, I think, very considerable dangers.</P>
      <P>It does appear that a situation has been reached in the flour milling industry which would justify the establishment of a State concern to operate it.  Much the best system for getting the most efficient operation and the most economic production is private enterprise, under the spur of open competition.  If that system obtained in the flour-milling industry in this country, we should be glad to see it maintained.  The fact is that it no longer obtains in the flour milling industry and that that industry is in the hands of small group amongst whom no element of competition survives and whose profits, so far as I am aware, are still practically guaranteed by Government interference.  They are entitled to charge a certain profit on their operations which are guaranteed to produce a certain dividend, not only on the nominal capital of their enterprises but on the total capital invested in them.</P>
      <P>Anybody who reads the Lavery Report will realise that once one gets into the maze of calculations to determine what is the total volume of capital invested in the industry and to disentangle all the various operations, one gets hopelessly lost.  It is true that the whole machinery of handling grain, both home-produced and imported, and its manufacture, is now controlled by a small close-knit group, and it seems to me that in those circumstances it is better for the community to control it and to be responsible to the community, rather than that such a monopolistic group should control so vital a product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the sound principle is that if a product is essential to the community, and if its production has <Col N="246" /> evolved in such a form as to leave it in the hands of a virtual monopoly, then the State should take it over.  If the product is not essential, then I do not think it matters a fiddle-de-dee whether it is produced by a monopoly or not and, if a product is essential, but there is effective competition and free enterprise in its manufacture, then I think it is much better to leave it the way it is.  In the flour milling industry, the product is essential but it has become a virtual monopoly and, in those circumstances, I think the State would not only be justified but well advised in operating it on the same basis as the sugar industry, the peat industry and all the other public services a modern community now administers in the interests of the community itself.</P>
    <P>Anyone who wants to learn the details of this trade will find them all set out in the Lavery Report and I remember the awed admiration with which I used to study, when Minister for Agriculture, the operations of handling grain, the charges made for bagging and for housing it, for unloading it, for unhousing it and for debagging it.  These operations were carried out by independent firms, but, when you began to examine home who the independent firms were, you discovered to your admiration that the directors of these firms which were engaged in the business of housing and unhousing, bagging and debagging, were all directors of the flour milling industry itself and they had managed to build up an extraordinary structure of cost and profits, all of which used to be very carefully examined by conscientious civil servants in the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I well remember our Government urged upon them that there should be some uniform costings procedure established at all the mills and machinery was set up to achieve that purpose.  I think it was in 1951, but, when we left office, that whole project was abandoned and, so far as I know, much the same complicated structure as then existed still exists.  I reached the conclusion when grappling with these complexities that the plain truth was that the only way the <Col N="247" /> abuses, which, in my opinion, undoubtedly existed, could be effectively remedied was to establish the flour milling industry as a public service under a board responsible to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am not at all sure that Deputy McQuillan is right in going on to say that the same conditions apply to the provender milling industry, because, unless things have changed since I was intimately concerned with it, there is a real element of competition in that industry, and my present experience leads me to believe it is still possible to shop around between one provender mill and another and get rival quotations so that the same degree of price fixation is not present and, of course, it is much easier for anybody to engage in the provender manufacturing business than in the milling industry.  So far as I know, any man to-day who is prepared to provide a suitable premises&mdash;and they do not require to be very elaborate&mdash; is entitled as of right to get a provender milling licence from the appropriate Department and to set up business in the morning and, so long as that continues to be a fact, the danger of monopoly does not exist.</P>
    <P>The great difficulty in connection with the milling industry is that the capital cost of installing flour milling capacity is very great and, though there may be a theoretical right in people to get a licence to mill flour, the likelihood of anybody seeking such a licence in modern conditions is very remote.  I do not believe that it is practical or desirable to recapitulate to the House all the contents of the Lavery Report.  Anyone who is sufficiently interested in all these matters should read the report, which is quite a considerable document, but I think any reasonable man who peruses it carefully will realise what the true situation is and will agree with the view that we have long ago reached a point when the organisation of the milling industry on a national basis is more than justified.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister said one of the only means of effecting economy in the event of such a thing taking <Col N="248" /> place would be to close down some of the smaller mills.  I do not believe that is true but I do believe some of these small mills could be effectively employed as provender mills and it is that kind of thing that a socially responsible organisation, primarily interested in the welfare of the community rather than their own welfare, could reasonably and responsibly undertake.</P>
    <P>I believe real economies could be effected and I do not agree with the Minister that the only result of acquiring the industry and operating it on a national basis would be to increase the price of bread.  In fact, I think the reverse would be probably true.  I believe if this thing were properly done, there would be, not a drastic reduction, but some reduction in the price of flour and bread.  What is much more important, a guarantee in future that the obligation would be placed upon such a body to make a reduction in the cost of flour and bread its first consideration would avoid the possibility of gradual increases in flour which are threatening to arise, if the industry is left in the hands of the present monopoly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but I do not think it is an insuperable difficulty. Private enterprise will run and often hold its own against State enterprise and one acts as a spur upon the other.  I do not believe the problem is insurmountable.  I remember considering it when the matter was under consideration before.  One of the problems that did create difficulty was to detach flour mills from their annexed bake-houses. Some large mills have bakeries closely associated with them.  That problem is becoming even more complex since I last considered it because a great many bakeries have since been bought by milling concerns.</P>
      <P>Let justice be done though the heavens fall.  I think you can read into that a dark and sinister purpose which I do not believe is there.  I believe the milling industry began to buy bakeries when the production capacity of the mills here began to outstrip demand; I suppose there was something sinister in it.  The mills did not like having to go out to purchase the trade of the independent bakeries by competition.  Therefore, what every mill did was to try to buy as many bakeries as it could so as to have a certain outlet for its flour.  In that sense, they were trying to destroy competition and in that sense, I suppose there was an evil element in their development.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from that, it is thoroughly unsound to try to concentrate the whole production of bread in this country in one pair of hands, whether it is the State or otherwise.  If you concentrate all the baking capacity in one pair of hands, you are inviting the possibility of a very serious situation arising if all the bakeries are closed down for one reason or another at the one time.  The community is entitled to protect itself from the possibility of being held up.  If a State organisation is using flour, there are always means of getting it if circumstances make it impossible to mill it on the spot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister were as long in the trade as I am, he would see it very vividly.  If the Deputies who put down the motion reflect on the trading implications of it, they will realise their motion suggests that every shop in Ireland that handles bread should be prevented from handling it and that bread should be distributed only through State shops.  That is all my eye and Betty Martin.  That is simply the Socialist bug that happens to have bitten the two Deputies concerned. I suppose we must excuse them if these bugs carry them somewhat further into folly than they would otherwise travel.  I do not believe either of them meant what they said in that part of their motion. It just fitted into the broad circle of Socialist approach to things which they have adopted and is, of course, nonsense.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, if the amendment proposed by Deputies Larkin and Desmond, which operates to confine the proposal to flour-milling and to exclude the distribution of bread and flour products, is adopted, we would be prepared to give our general approval to the motion as so amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Leader of the Opposition, I suppose in the circumstances of this debate, the most apposite remark I can make is that half a loaf is better than no bread at all so far as his offer to support part of the motion is concerned. As far as we are concerned, it is a considerable advance.  I could nearly look forward to the time when Deputy Dillon might be Taoiseach and might be able to put even that part of our motion into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the bakeries, we were concerned, on the distribution side of our motion, to emphasise that the indictment against the milling and <Col N="251" /> bakery interests was really established by the Lavery Commission.  Here is the relevant quotation:</P>
    <P>It is obvious therefore that the search for economies in the production and selling costs of bread must concentrate as much if not indeed more on selling as on production and administration costs.</P>
    <P>We felt that was a good enough reason for putting this second part of the motion down.  We felt we would have an opportunity of hearing the views of the House on the ways in which we could reduce the distribution and selling costs of bread.</P>
    <P>With all respect to Deputy Cosgrave, I do not think his suggestion that we should keep an eye on the bakeries or distributors is very valuable.  If it is a valid suggestion in respect of the bakeries, why not suggest we keep an eye on the millers and hope they will learn the wisdom of their ways?  On the question of the possibility of closing-down small bakeries, according to the Lavery Report, it does not necessarily mean that with a State company, the industry would go out of business.  The least cost per sack of flour in a list of bakeries, taking the lowest cost, was in the eighth smallest bakery.  The second lowest was in the third smallest; the third lowest in the ninth; the fourth lowest in the twenty-first; the fifth lowest in the fourteenth; the sixth lowest in the smallest; and the seventh lowest in the second smallest.  The Lavery Report says that &ldquo;Whatever generalisations one can make about the bakery trade, at least one cannot say that the largest bakeries have the smallest costs.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had the time I would point out that there are very great discrepancies between the efficient and the inefficient bakery. That is something which must be looked into, in order to reduce the cost of bread.  Our other difficulties arise from the fact that the tentacles of <Col N="252" /> these two major companies have extended to many of these small private bakeries&mdash;some of them family concerns&mdash;and they are being gobbled up.  As the Committee reflected, &ldquo;If present trends continue, these two groups might eventually dominate not alone the milling industry but the bakery industry.&rdquo; Therefore, it seems quite proper that we should keep an eye on the bakeries, since it is not going to help the small bakeries which will be absorbed gradually by these mammoth companies and put out of business.</P>
      <P>That really brings us to the point of the comments of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on our motion.  It is obvious that we have to face the problem of reducing the cost of bread.  Deputy Dillon is wrong. This is not a doctrinaire Socialist proposition; it is a proposition designed to reduce the cost of an essential commodity of the community. To do that we had a number of propositions which we put to the House and which, we believed, would increase efficiency and thereby reduce costs.  The first was the elimination of the necessity for paying dividends. There was the attempt to take profits given in stevedoring, storage and drying; the attempt to establish a proper contract system for farmers to see there is not surplus production; to establish millability standards; to see that the conacre farmer is made secondary to the ordinary farmer and to try to get a rationalised distribution of flour to the baker and bread to the consumer.  Also, the prime purposewas the establishment of a proper costings system.  With that we would be able to determine which was the-efficient mill and which the inefficient; which was the efficient bakery and which the inefficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we would be faced with this problem of rationalising production, as the Minister suggested.  But have we not to face these problems?  If there is an inefficient mill or an inefficient bakery, there are two things one can do: first, make it efficient by various improved business and administrative methods, which is the obvious thing to do.  If this is not <Col N="253" /> possible, then you cannot surely justify the retention of an inefficient unit in our economy.  If the Minister holds this view&mdash;that he thinks we should not look at the inefficient mill or inefficient bakery lest we would have to put it out of business&mdash;is that to be his policy in relation to our entire industrial economy?  Are we to carry that kind of uneconomic industry, or is the consumer going to carry it? Who will have to carry it?  If it is an uneconomic unit, we should try to make it economic if possible.  If not, then we have to face the fact that we cannot carry these uneconomic units as a form of relief work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I hope I shall have another opportunity of dealing with it.  That is the only interpretation I can put on it.</P>
      <P>On the question of the efficiency of nationalisation, Deputy Cosgrave was very contemptuous.  He said this question was one of the exploded myths&mdash;that nationalisation is more efficient.  I do not want to deal with that at any great length, but it seems to me that one of the wonderful achievements of propaganda is the blind refusal to see the obvious and face the fact, which is the failure of private enterprise in other countries: America, with six per cent. unemployed, Britain with mounting unemployment, and the position here at home with consistently high unemployment figures under a predominantly private enterprise system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that people can continue to defend private enterprise against nationalisation in those circumstances continues to amaze me.  Deputy Cosgrave knows quite well of the remarkable achievements of Aer Lingus and the transatlantic Airline, Bord na Móna, the E.S.B., Irish Steel &mdash;all these wonderful examples of what Socialist enterprise, if Deputy Dillon wants it that way, can achieve. The case has been made so many times that I continue to be amazed at this continuing adhesion to private <Col N="254" /> enterprise, despite the decay it has brought about in our society.</P>
    <P>On the question of compensation, I would say £12,000,000 has to be found. But £12,000,000 had also to be found for the shareholders of the G.S.R. and the G.N.R. when we decided as a community that the most efficient transport system could be run under C.I.E.  In that case, we accepted the principle of the establishment of a State company and of finding the capital for it.  I would favour the payment of compensation, particularly to the foreigners, with some form of national development bond on the same lines as, say, Land Bonds, which would mature in 20 to 25 years' time and would be non-transferable.  In that case these people would have the privilege of allowing the compensation which they should get to be left in circulation in the community and thus help us in our plans for national development.  I do not see why the Minister should be so terribly frightened of this question of compensation. If the problem is one worth tackling, then the matter of compensation is one which I do not think is insuperable.</P>
    <P>The Minister dismissed the question of the emotional appeal we made about the reduction in the price of bread.  If that does not worry him, could I put the point to him that if he could bring about a reduction in the price of bread, he would bring about a reduction in the cost of living and, in addition, a reduction in the cost of production?  Is it possible that this more &ldquo;cash register&rdquo; argument might appeal to him and that in that way we might improve our own over-all national position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that, of course, is that we deliberately decided' to nationalise the two transport compannies, the G.S.R. and the G.N.R., because they were run extremely badly, extremely inefficiently and at great cost to the community by two private enterprise organisations.  The reason we took the decision to extend <Col N="255" /> State control to these companies was because we thought the undertakings would be run more efficiently and at less cost to the consumer, the person using our transport.  In fact, that has transpired.  Whatever defects there may be in the present C.I.E., in my view it is infinitely more efficient than the two companies which preceded it.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister would seriously suggest that C.I.E. should revert to the G.S.R. or the G.N.R.  I do not think he would seriously suggest that private enterprise would run C.I.E. more economically or more efficiently.  I do not think he would seriously suggest that a private company would run Aer Lingus more efficiently or economically than it is being run at the moment.  I do not think it would be suggested that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann should be handed over to some private monopoly so that they would run it more efficiently, or that Irish Steel Holdings should revert to the private people who could not make &ldquo;a go&rdquo; of it before it was made a State Company.</P>

      <P>It will only take a few minutes; I have nearly finished.  In this matter of nationalisation, the problem always arises of the position of the workers in the subsequent State organisation, but in relation to bread, as I pointed out to the Minister during the debate, people will go on eating just as much bread and using as much flour after nationalisation as they did before it.  The workers will find just the same opportunities under State enterprise as under private enterprise. The same number of deliveries will <Col N="256" /> have to be made to the same number of shops and virtually the same number of mills will be required, but we must face this question.  Where we have inefficient enterprise, we must face the necessity to rationalise the position and find alternative employment for those who may be disemployed as a result of that rationalisation. At the same time, the question of compensation, which so much concerned the Minister where the mill owners were concerned, also applies to the workers so that any workers disemployed should preferably be reemployed and certainly compensated for the loss of their employment.</P>

      <P>As health authorities do not make separate returns to my Department of their expenditure on dental services, the compilation of an up-to-date statement of the total expenditure by health authorities on such services would necessitate asking each health authority to furnish specially, particulars of its expenditure on these services in the current period.  This would involve delay but if an estimate based on available data would suffice for the Deputy's purpose a figure of £130,000 may be taken as representing health authorities' expenditure on dental services in the current financial year. To this should be added the outlay on dental services provided under the Dental Benefit Scheme of the Department of Social Welfare.  Consequent on the recent easement in favour of insured adolescents of the conditions of qualification for dental benefit and the increase in fees granted to private dentists participating in the Scheme, expenditure on the Dental Benefit Scheme is now running at £290,000 a year.</P>
      <P>Taking estimated outlay by health authorities together with expenditure by the Department of Social Welfare, the total annual cost of public dental services is, therefore, of the order of £420,000 a year.</P>

    <P>The number of Civil Service pensioners who retired on or after 1st November, 1955, is 1,087.  Particulars as to the ranges of such pensions are not available and would have to be compiled specially as would the more detailed particulars requested by the Deputy in relation to pre-November, 1955, pensions.  I regret that the labour and time involved in compiling these particulars could not be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The same recruitment regulations apply to Rural Improvements Schemes in Co. Limerick as in all other parts of the country.  They provide for the recruitment of workmen in the following order of preference:</P>
      <P>(1) Recipients of unemployment assistance registered at the local offices of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>(2)  Unemployment benefit claimants similarly registered.</P>
      <P>(3)  Beneficiaries of the scheme who have contributed to the cost, and any persons registered as non-claimants at the local offices of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>(7)  Other unemployed persons in the area, preference being given as far as possible to the most necessitous cases.</P>
      <P>The same preference operates in the case of bog development schemes.  In the case of minor employment schemes, which are in operation only from November to March, recruitment is confined to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Where a work is expected to be of fairly long duration and there is a large number of unemployed persons qualified for employment, the gang may be changed after six weeks, so as to give other men a turn of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume the Deputy's Question is related to the recruitment arrangements made in respect of a bog development scheme in Gortnagross town-land, Rathronan electoral division, which was sanctioned on the 22nd August, 1960, and on which work commenced on 27th September, 1960. The local offices of the Department of Social Welfare submitted on 20th September, 1960, lists of 27 names of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance benefit.  Work was available on the scheme for a ganger and eight <Col N="266" /> labourers only.  As the scheme, costing £800, was expected to last for a considerable period, the panel of workers was changed at the end of the six weeks, the second panel of labourers being selected from lists of 17 names supplied by the local offices of the Department of Social Welfare on 3rd November, 1960.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 16 to 19 together.</P>
      <P>The commercial interests who approached my Department in connection with the proposed new horse meat export company were Messrs.  G. Wolsey &amp; Co. Ltd., London and an Irish national Mr. J.J. Kenny.  I understand that the proposed name of the company is Continental Horse Meat Packers, Ltd., but I cannot say whether the location of the factory premises has yet been finally determined. When the factory is established in accordance with the relevant technical, etc., requirements, it will be statutorily registered for export purposes and only then will the issue of export licences arise.  I understand that the proposed factory capacity will be about 200 to 300 horses per week. Horses for the factory will I presume be bought in the ordinary way of trade.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is necessary and very desirable to bring into this trade a firm with the reputation of Messrs.  Wolsey of London.  They are the largest handlers of horse flesh in Britain.  The importance of a firm of <Col N="271" /> that standing coming into this business should be obvious to everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have, on more than one occasion, made it clear that they would prefer to see the trade in horses converted into a trade in horse meat.  Public statements to that effect were made by the Taoiseach as long ago as January last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time although the export <Col N="272" /> of horse-meat had for some years been permitted subject to suitable safeguards, only one application for a licence for the establishment of an abattoir had been made and no commercial exports of horseflesh had taken place.  Certain developments have, however, taken place since then.  There are at present two factories engaged in the production of horse-meat for export, and, as recently announced, a new company has been formed to engage on a large scale in the slaughter of horses and the processing and export of horseflesh.  Work will shortly commence on the erection of the necessary processing plant, which will conform to my Department's technical requirements.  It is expected that the company will be able to go into production next spring.</P>
    <P>These developments indicate that, at an early date, it will be possible to substitute a trade in horse-meat for the existing trade in live horses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.  One of the reasons for the Government decision referred to is to ensure that the millers will have no financial inducement not to use the highest possible quantity of native wheat in their flour milling grists.  It is clear that it is in the national interest that this should be so.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the device to which the Government have resorted of requiring the millers to pay an artificially high price for imported wheat is being used as a justification for increasing the price of flour and bread, and that means the section of the community for whom bread and flour are staple articles of diet are being compelled to pay a higher price for bread and flour in order to compensate for the bad harvest this year?  Further, does he not think it would be more equitable if these compensatory provisions were borne by the Exchequer and not by the neediest and weakest section of the community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In view of the facts that a large number of persons at present in receipt of Military Service Pensions receive less than £1 per week, that the services of these people played no small part in the foundation of the State and that their numbers are now appreciably reduced by the effluxion of time, Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that the past services of these people should be more generously recognised and calls upon the Government to introduce forthwith amending legislation to ensure a reasonable standard of living for them in their declining years.</P>
      <P>Had I followed the usual procedure in seeking an increase for a certain section of the community, I would have tabled a number of Parliamentary Questions to find out the number of persons in receipt of military service pensions, the annual expenditure on such pensions, the percentage expenditure on each person and other such matters. The Minister, with the vast resources at his disposal, would then quite rightly attempt to produce rebutting figures and the debate would develop into a lesson in mathematics rather than a constructive effort to achieve improvement for the persons concerned. Accordingly, I do not propose to follow this line but rather to appeal to the Dáil sense of moral justice in regard to the men so shockingly treated by successive Governments since its foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting of the first Dáil took place on 22nd January, 1919.  I may be incorrect, but I think that of the members of that assembly only three sit in Dáil Éireann today, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and Deputy Mulcahy.  They must recollect that when the Democratic Programme was read out on that occasion and accepted with enthuasism by the members present, a guarantee was given that the aged and infirm of our community would no longer be regarded as a burden upon the State but rather as <Col N="289" /> people entitled to the nation's gratitude and consideration.  The men on whose behalf I speak have not grown aged and infirm in the ordinary way. But for their self-denial and self-sacrifice, this State would not be in existence today.</P>
    <P>Yet, in spite of that undertaking given on that historic occasion, we find many of them living in conditions of abject poverty.  As a result of the country's economic programme, it has been found desirable to impose a means test for those in receipt of social benefits, but that does not justify the imposition of such a test on men who suffered hunger, deprivation and imprisonment cheerfully in their youth in order that our children might grow up in a free Irish community. The attitude of the Civil Service is seen at its worst in its dealings with these men.  Last year, the Minister announced certain increases in military and other service pensions and pointed out that they were justified on a cost of living basis.  It later developed that if an unfortunate pensioner was in receipt of another pension, the latter was cut with the result that he got nothing at all.  This was in spite of the Ministerial statement that the increases were justified on a cost of living basis alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how hard they try, those who are not directly involved or who are not personally aware of these great personal sacrifices cannot make a full contribution to the House on this matter.  The present Minister, as well as many members of the House, were yet but infants at that time, if they were even born.  I accordingly appeal to the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance who, by reason of their position and long service, must have great prestige in the Cabinet, to see that this appalling situation is at last set right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that other efforts should be made to alleviate the situation of these men.  That may be so, but I am in no way ashamed of the terms of this motion and there should <Col N="290" /> be no necessity for me or any other member of the Dáil to speak on this motion here today.  Accordingly, I leave it to the conscience of the Dáil to decide whether or not my motion should be implemented in full.  I believe that this House, down through the years, has paid only lip service to the members of the old I.R.A.  I believe the time has come when we should forget politics, good, bad or indifferent, and try to rectify the wrong done to that particular section of the community down through the years. I am sure the Minister is aware of this, but it is rather surprising that the members of the Old I.R.A. who did not apply for military service pensions until 1934 have lost 10 years pension rights just because, on principle, they would not apply under the 1924 Pensions Act.</P>

      <P>That is very strange. I shall accept the Minister's word but, for the life of me, I cannot follow that line of argument.  I do not intend to delay the House unduly as I know there are many Deputies anxious <Col N="291" /> to give their views on this interesting and, I hope, important motion.  I deliberately moved it as an individual so that members on all sides of the House could see it was not moved for a political motive.  It stands solely in my name; I believe the House should forget Party politics in order to do good for those who made it possible for us to sit in Dáil Éireann today, and I hope the Minister will at least rectify the wrongs that have been done to those people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting Deputy Tierney, I should like to say that this generation has proved itself to be as loyal, self-sacrificing and national as any that went before.  The tribute paid to its young members this week is more than proof of that.  However, I should like it to be made known to the vast majority of our people, who may not be aware of this, that at least five-sixths of the recipients of military service pensions who had service in the Old I.R.A., the Citizen Army, Cumann na mBan or Fianna Éireann, after taking into consideration the six per cent. or five per cent. increase granted in 1953, are in receipt of an average sum of £16 14s. per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Éireann was the first military organisation of the century in this country.  It was a training unit, an organising source for the Volunteers, and of its members there are not more than 100 in receipt of pensions at present.  When one thinks that in Dublin, with its Dublin Brigade, its brigade council, its various battalions and battalion councils, company officers and men, there are not more than 30 of these pensioners, one shudders to think what will happen when the records of the Military History Bureau are opened in 50 years' time and the public realises that only 30 Dublin members of that organisation had performed service in so far as pensions were concerned.  It may be considered even at the moment that, <Col N="292" /> unless one has a pension, one's services were negligible.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government may say that to increase pensions at this time would cost some thousands of pounds but I wonder, even if it cost £1,000,000, would the public not feel satisfied they were liquidating what can only be termed a national debt to these men?  On Sunday morning last the Minister and Deputy MacEoin attended the commemoration services for McKee, Clancy and Clune and they saw the remnants of the Old I.R.A., the Citizen Army, Cumann na mBan and Fianna Éireann who were present.  They were in a better position to judge than I, because they were on the rostrum, but I doubt if more than 700 of those veterans were present.  Many of them who did turn out taxed their physical capacities to the limit.  Would anyone suggest that, if an insurance agent were present, he would feel happy to present any of those veterans with a policy for a further 20 years of life?  Consequently, I appeal to the Minister and the House, even at this late stage, to consider whether there is need for amending legislation.  According to what the Minister said, some of these people would not qualify under the 1934 Act and that suggests there is need for amending legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out to Deputy Carroll that the motion relates to those already in receipt of military service pensions and asks that amending legislation be introduced to ensure them a reasonable standard of living?  The question of those who have not qualified for pensions cannot be relevantly argued on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, Sir, but I am merely putting it forward as a basis to justify increases for those who are at present in receipt of pensions. I mention these factors so that there may be a justification for future national expenditure to compensate those who gave services that money could not buy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the position that existed 40 years ago.  The average earnings were, let us say, £3 to £4 per <Col N="293" /> week.  A craftsman had something like 2/- an hour.  One year's internment or one year's active service denied a person the opportunity of continuing his craft or profession.  There were others who were continuing their education in college or elsewhere or who were serving their period of apprenticeship. Apart from anything else there was a disruption in their lives.  As a result of the recent increases, a great many of these men receive only £10 per year.</P>
    <P>Let us go back 30 years and break in between the 1924 and 1934 Acts. These persons have not been compensated for, literally, their loss of money. None of them went out with a mercenary viewpoint.  Contrast the treatment meted out for military service across the water, or, indeed, anywhere in Europe or in the U.S.A.  The sacrifices of those people could not be compared because they were paid for their service. They were paid soldiers.  Therefore, in respect of the appeal for unanimity, I urge the Minister to do what he can.  He may not be in as close contact with the problem as his very good parent.  At the moment, there are recipients of military service pensions in this city and what they are getting would not buy the bread we were talking about earlier today.</P>
    <P>I make this speech in no controversial spirit.  I urge that the present Minister for Defence and the former Minister for Defence should strive to be as helpful as possible in this regard and that the right thing should be done by the people concerned.  There is not a Deputy who does not support that plea.  There is not a Deputy who does not feel utterly ashamed that, having been sent by the people as a messenger to this House, he has not been able to do more for that section of our community on whose behalf I am speaking now.</P>
    <P>In another 20 years the people mentioned in the motion will have departed this life.  Possibly that will happen in many cases much earlier. I trust that no matter how hard he may have to strive to achieve this very desirable objective, the Minister will ensure that no member will receive less than £1 per week which is £50 per annum and that that £50 per annum, <Col N="294" /> or whatever the sum may be, will not be subject to income tax or any assessment of the means test.  I trust the Minister will do away with those restrictions in this connection.  Here is a suggestion, as a step forward in the right direction.  Would the Minister consider some gratuity at this stage that would compensate those who have been affected by this Bill and other Bills sponsored by this Government and other Governments?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to that of the seconder of the motion in urging that the Minister should review this matter.  The Minister stated, which is true, that a number of people qualified under the 1934 Act who did not qualify under the 1924 Act.  When he or his predecessor was moving that Bill he could have made it retrospective to 1924 if he had so desired but he did not do so.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything we may say to the contrary, I feel Deputies are pushing an open door when they make appeals to the Minister in this matter.  I believe he is anxious to meet our demands.  The only way we can get him to do so is by passing this motion.  This House is supreme. If this House passes the motion the Government must either implement it or refuse to carry out the decision of the House.</P>
      <P>Appeals for fairer treatment for the Old I.R.A. have been made on many occasions and to all Governments here.  On every occasion it was a question of the cost, and things were always done piecemeal.  While this motion does not permit of any reference to it, beyond a passing remark, I suppose, there is dissatisfaction with the amount of the pensions and dissatisfaction with the whole system. However, that is a matter for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know the Minister's views or the Government's intentions regarding this motion.  In my opinion and in the opinion of my colleagues, the Minister should accept the motion and the Government should give effect to it.  As has already been said, the numbers of these people are getting <Col N="295" /> fewer every day and, from now on, funerals will be more prevalent.  I only hope my own will be as far away as I can make it.  I shall try to keep it back as long as possible but there is no doubt that it is coming.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carroll said the people for whom we speak will all be gone in 20 years' time; he is a bit of an optimist.  In 20 years' time we shall be museum pieces.  Any Old I.R.A. man who can hold the fort for another 20 years will have everything showered on him and more power to him; I hope he will get it.  The Government will do penance at a late stage but it will be no good to those who are suffering today.  The Minister will tell us that the Government have, in effect, put this motion into operation because of the special allowances provisions of the Act and that, in that way, they are guarding against undue hardship on the members of the Old I.R.A. who are well down financially, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept the motion in principle and that, when he comes to implement it, he should do so in a most generous fashion, keeping in mind all the rights and responsibilities of the people who have suffered so much.</P>

      <P>The case I should like to make is one for those who have no pensions.  However, I am confined to the terms of the motion. The real sufferers are the people who got no pensions.  I must say that the main sufferers are those who took the anti-Treaty side.  They got a raw deal. I shall not enlarge on that point now but I intend to put down a motion shortly covering that aspect of the matter.  It was a disgrace that men who went through the Civil War&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The case for an increase has been stated.  As has been said, our numbers are dwindling and in 20 years' time, there will be only a couple of old fogies left.  Since our number is dwindling every year, the saving effected could be made to benefit those of us still left.  In that way, the increase would not cost the State much extra.  The present pension is miserably small.  I support the motion and, in addition, I hope that something will be done for those who got no pension at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to support the motion and ask the Minister to give it his favourable consideration. None of us wants to be talking about pensions since we know that there are people in the country in a very bad way.  I felt humiliated when the Pensions Act came out in 1924 and these men were offered £6 per year.  Miserable as it was, they were glad to get it because they needed it.  In 1960, we should be in a position to do justice by the few surviving men.  The motion asks that we give them at least £1 a week for the next few years.  I was against all pensions, except pensions for disabled people, <Col N="297" /> but since our Government saw fit to bring in pensions Acts, I think it is only right that the underdog should be given consideration.  I do not worry about the officers, who came out of it very well, but the ordinary private came out of it badly.  Many of them felt they were a drag on the community, although they did as much as or more than many of the officers who are drawing big pensions to-day.  Many of them did heroic work which has never been known and never will be known.</P>
      <P>The people are sick and tired of hearing about pensions for the old I.R.A.  Thirty years ago, we should have ended all this squabbling.  We all knew in our own localities those who were entitled to a pension, and we should have united at that time in order to do justice by them.  We have a chance now to unite and give the few survivors the few shillings to which they are entitled.  I remember 25 years ago seeing 1,000 survivors at the funeral of an old colleague, but to-day at such funerals the remaining survivors come hobbling along.  They tell us they are to sick to take part in the procession, but nevertheless they come long distances to honour an old comrade.  It would not break the State to be a little generous with these people in the last few years of their lives.</P>
      <P>These people are silent sufferers. None of them asked me to speak for them, because they have given up hope long ago.  However, when I heard an old colleague was bringing in this motion, I was stirred by it and felt it would not be right if I did not say a few words on behalf of these people. I would ask the Minister to realise what these men went through in the old days.  They were grinned at; jeered at and laughed at.  That all happened because we had a squabble between ourselves.  Had that not happened, nobody would have dared open his mouth against those men.  But many people did open their mouths, and opened them loud and wide.  I would ask the Minister to be generous enough to say he will do something for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended three funerals out of the <Col N="298" /> workhouse of old I.R.A. men.  We had to put our hands in our pockets to pay for the coffins.  I felt most humiliated and sad to think these men had to go into the workhouse.  That should never have happened, but there are many such men in our workhouses today awaiting the last call.  It is a sad state of affairs that this nation should allow even one of those men to suffer that humiliation.  When they went out in the old days, they were not thinking of money or pensions.  They went out to make a national sacrifice and their only glory was that they would die fighting, and this is the way the nation has treated those of them who have survived.  I think that is scandalous.</P>
    <P>In 1924, a man who had served seven or eight years was offered £6 a year for life.  When we look back on that, we feel they should have flung it back into the faces of the first Government and into the faces of the second Government as well.  It was a disgrace to offer them such a low pension.  Some of these men took big risks at that time, out in the fields, perhaps, or behind the ditches preparing to attack a barracks, compared with the people who were content to sit comfortably at home.  They suffered a lot and suffered in silence and all we ask of the Minister is to be reasonably generous and to give the few remaining men in the lower grades nothing less than £1 a week. It would be despicable to offer them anything less.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues, I appeal to the Minister as the son of an old I.R.A. man and as one who himself knows that many in this country today are gladdened when they think of what is happening and how, due to their efforts, Irishmen can sit here and discuss the affairs of the State freely and that we can, as a free nation, send our young men out to fight and perhaps die in the Congo for Ireland. Those are the things these men suffered for and the least we can do is to give them reasonable conditions for the few short years they have left.</P>

      <P>Listening to some of the speakers on the other side of the House, one would imagine that they must not realise that there is a <Col N="299" /> special allowance for every old I.R.A. man now.  I welcome any advance towards improving the lot of the old I.R.A. man but no Party in the House has gone so far to meet the needs of the old I.R.A. as the Fianna Fáil Party.  The greatest step forward ever taken was taken by Deputy Traynor as Minister for Defence when he introduced the special allowances.  No old I.R.A. man today who has service and has certificates and a medal need be a pauper.  All the Act specified as necessary was three months' service prior to the Truce in 1921.  If the pensioner is married, he gets over £100 a year; if he is single, it goes up to about £90.  To my mind, that was the greatest advance made and it embraced a number of old I.R.A. men of whom Deputy Sherwin spoke, men deprived of pensions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Over a long number of years and under various Ministers for Defence, including the present Minister, we have tried to improve the lot of the old I.R.A. men in every way. This motion suggests that the lowest pension should be £1 a week.  I agree with that, but we have been doing a good deal more than that, a good deal more than the motion intends. We have even been twice as generous as the motion envisages.  While I welcome the spirit that prompts the motion or the spirit that prompts anybody to agitate to get more concessions for the old I.R.A., I want to make it clear that we have been even more generous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think it would be fair to say that everybody in the House and, in fact, throughout the country, would welcome at any time <Col N="301" /> any advance that can be made towards increasing old I.R.A. men's pensions. It is true that when one examines the history of this, one finds that nobody joined the movement in the old days for the purpose of getting anything out of it.  Nobody ever thought of that, but as time went on, one had to admit that numbers of our young people neglected to provide for their own material welfare in the future because of the voluntary sacrifice they made in the cause of the country's struggle for independence.</P>
      <P>Time went on and the realisation came that many of those who rendered exceptional service to the country and its people were finding themselves in the position where some help was necessary.  As these people grew older and as the cost of living increased, their circumstances bore more heavily on them.  If we just accepted that aspect of the problem, one would welcome the most generous treatment of the old I.R.A. members.  It is also true to say that as year follows year, the number of pensioners decreases. Even if an increase is given from time to time, as there has been, it does not necessarily follow that there is an increased expenditure of State funds. Every day in the newspapers, we read of the demise of some of these old comrades of ours.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Government are quite alive and sympathetic to the situation.  While in recent times small increases have been given, I do not think the Government have ever said: &ldquo;This is to be the end of what we can do by way of assistance for this deserving element of our population.&rdquo;  I believe that having regard to our resources and to whatever upsurge there may be in the economy of the country this matter will receive consideration again from time to time.</P>
      <P>I do not mean to imply that the feelings I express apply only to me. There are very many members of this House who have had service in days gone by and who feel that this is a matter on which we can be united to do the best we can, particularly as we are now fast approaching the decade in which most of these good people will probably be passing on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> I do not oppose and I do not say I object to the motion.  I am glad to see that it has been proposed with a view to having a discussion and so that, through whatever publicity it gets outside this House, the public will realise that the State has a considerable liability still towards those people.  We are very alive to the tragedies that overtake members of our State forces in present activities.  We are glad to see that steps will be taken and are being taken to make the necessary provision for the dependants of casualties.</P>
    <P>Coming back again to the type of person covered by this motion, there can be no question that they are genuine people.  In the operation of the Military Service Pensions Acts, there had to be very definite scrutiny, examination and confirmation of the service of an applicant for a pension. Therefore, it is important that we should re-examine the position of most of these people.  I am not dealing with the arrangements for special allowances which are necessary from a different angle; I am referring purely to pensions.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to agree with the movers of the motion that there should be a maximum or a minimum.  There should be flexibility and the question should be examined from time to time and the pensions brought into line with the circumstances of the vast majority of these State pensioners and the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I do not think that people can grumble or would want to grumble.  I remember that when the 1934 Act was introduced, a number of individuals who had very considerable active service did not want to apply for a pension because they felt that they had not joined up for the purpose of getting any recompense whatsoever.  It was pointed out to these people that there were very many who were not in such favourable circumstances and to whom assistance of this kind was very helpful and very necessary and that it would be unfair to have them pointed out as a less fortunate element who, because of their circumstances, were forced to accept pensions.  Therefore, all those who had service and who <Col N="303" /> qualified applied so that there would be no difference or distinction created.</P>
    <P>We are not unique in this country. If there is anything unique about us, it is that we have been less generous with people who served the country and helped it to secure its independence than any other nation in the world has been towards its military personnel.</P>
    <P>I again recommend to the Minister that he might have regularly put to him the numbers who are enjoying these pensions, the rate at which these pensioners are ceasing to exist and payment is ceasing; that there might be a minimum amount of money fixed by the Department of Defence which could be paid by way of pensions from year to year; that there should not necessarily be a Finance sort of approach to this part of his Vote but that on the death of a pensioner, there should be an examination as to how the saving thus arising could be applied by way of added benefit to those who remain.</P>
    <P>In spirit, I welcome the motion.  I understand it; I appreciate it.  While it may not be possible for the Minister to accept it in the form in which it is put, I am sure we shall hear from him that the matter will be reviewed by him from time to time in the hope that better pensions for the old-I.R.A. will be brought about in time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall say only a few words because I know that this matter is very much in the mind of the Minister and is examined from time to time.  I speak <Col N="304" /> only for those who have very small pensions, perhaps a few shillings per week.  Many of them in the days of their youth and vigour gave their services for the cause of their country and, consequently, if they got into the public services or other employment are retiring now at 65 with much smaller pensions than they otherwise would have had.  In that way, the blow is falling on them now.</P>
    <P>Consequently, we all would favour, if it can be done, their cases being given special consideration.  In some cases, persons are retiring on smaller pensions than they would have had because their years of service to the nation in the Volunteers cannot be taken into account for superannuation purposes.  Many of them lost opportunities of securing appointments of one kind or another or perhaps of getting into the professions.  Those matters should now be taken into consideration in their declining years. Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the subject matter of Questions Nos. 15 to 20 on today's Order Paper which deal with the export of horse meat from this country.  I should like to say that, as I understand it, early this year, there was a campaign, which achieved considerable publicity, to demonstrate that our arrangements for the export of live horses to the Continent were cruel and inhuman. This country and those who engage in that business were held up to a good deal of public odium.  The Government acted very properly at the time.  They instituted a thorough investigation into the charges and the general methods of carrying horses and later reported that every precaution was taken to ensure that the animals did not suffer any ill-treatment or cruelty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That report was supported by two British organisations interested in the welfare of animals: the Blue Cross Society and the Dumb Friends League.  Subsequently, it was pretty well demonstrated that the hysteria <Col N="305" /> responsible for the campaign was largely based on false information, or that it was deliberately intended to mislead the public as to the actual and true position.  It could appear from the Government's recent announcement that the strictures and criticisms of people on the other side of the Channel and, to a certain extent in this country, had some justification if the Government are now to reverse their findings and their views of last January and February and to restrict, totally or almost totally, the export of live horses to the Continent and elsewhere.  That is one aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the aspect of the existing factories which have been set up, at some considerable expense, to process, to a limited extent, at economic prices the available supplies of horses.  The Minister is aware that there has been considerable difficulty in finding markets for the various parts of the carcases in England and on the Continent because the various rules and regulations which are sometimes altered very rapidly do not make the search for markets very easy. However, the fact is that the Department held up for a considerable time &mdash;I think I am correct in saying for almost a year&mdash;the export of forequarters to England where there was an existing market.</P>
    <P>There are two factories, one of which was established with the assistance of funds raised by a voluntary committee and the other by a group of businessmen with their own capital. I think I am correct in saying they have been processing something between 80 and 100 horses per week. To my knowledge, neither of these factories was consulted in regard to-this new development, nor were any interests representing the farming community, who are vitally interested in this new development, consulted.</P>
    <P>The Minister was cautious enough this afternoon at Question Time not to hazard an opinion as to the effect, or possible effect, on the price of horses, if these regulations come into effect, drastically curtailing the export of horses.  I do not think it needs a great deal of imagination to suggest that if <Col N="306" /> you prohibit to a large degree the export of anything&mdash;any item, whether it is live horses, live cattle or anything else&mdash;the market at home is bound to be depressed.</P>
    <P>Again, I think it is a safe assumption that the farmers will not, in future, receive as much for their horses for export as they have received up to now.  One of the difficulties of the factories operating in this country has been to procure horses at an economic figure.  That figure is something like half the price which the farmers have been getting for what one might call well-fleshed animals suitable for export to the Continent for slaughter.  It may be that this new concern will find a market which has not up to now been available to the existing factories but, if so, it has been kept a very carefully guarded secret.</P>
    <P>However, there is a third point with which I am more vitally concerned. One of the factories established to enter into this trade was established near the city of Limerick.  At the time, there was a good deal of publicity associated with the granting of the licence, and estimates of the possible employment were made which proved, in the event, to be substantially inaccurate and far too optimistic. Quite an amount of employment has been given directly to the butchers and packers and indirectly to the processing companies through the Limerick factory.  As Limerick has not been favoured with the establishment of industries to any degree in recent years&mdash;I think two small factories have been established in three years&mdash;anything that would threaten the extinction of an existing industry is a matter of serious concern to the people of Limerick.</P>
    <P>By and large, I think the Minister, before taking unto himself these powers to regulate and restrict the export of horses, should at least have given the existing factories an opportunity of consultation with regard to the various factors involved.  I think also that the farming community have some right to be consulted with regard to the possible effect of these proposals. It is quite possible that my fears <Col N="307" /> in this regard are groundless, but, based on the available supply of horses are the general needs and the capacity of the existing factories.  As I say, I may be quite wrong, but it seems to me that the two existing small factories will be placed in jeopardy by this new and apparently very substantial undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the point of view put forward by Deputy Russell.  It is a very sudden decision and, in the words of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday, it seems to be a mystery affecting to a very great extent the horse trade in general.  It appears to be a decision which was taken behind backs.  No one seemed to get any notice of it until we read a few lines in the newspapers before last weekend, and yet we find an order made today, making certain regulations and creating a complete change in the horse trade as we have known it.  Horse fairs in the past have been famous in this country.  A large number of people are dealing with horses in one way or another.  The Government consulted commercial interests engaged in the production and distribution of horse flesh without even discussing this matter or consulting the people already engaged in this business.</P>
      <P>The Minister has, I believe, made a very bad move.  The factories which have been set up and licensed are capable of dealing with the remaining horses in this country, and I mention the remaining horses because the number of work horses becoming available for export and slaughter is dwindling.  The horse is being replaced by the tractor and the result is that farmers are not rearing foals of the Irish draught-horse or work-horse type in the rural areas.  It is not economic for them to rear a horse unless they can use that horse in connection with farming activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I cannot see a bright prospect for any factory being set up here with the idea of a large number of horses being available regularly for the production of horse meat.  In the course of his reply to day, the Minister <Col N="308" /> said that the slaughtering capacity of the existing factories was 250 horses per week, which represents about 12,000 horses a year.  Does the Minister seriously think that when the existing factories have disposed of 12,000 horses a year the people concerned in this new factory with whom he has had discussions will have a substantial supply of horses available to them?</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's Order, a licence must be issued in respect of each horse to be exported.  He has interfered in this Order with the delivery of these horses on the other side. Generally speaking, horses exported from here are landed at three places, Amsterdam, Antwerp and Dieppe.  The Minister says in this Order that the horses must be slaugtered within 30 miles of the port of embarkation. When horses are landed at Amsterdam they have to travel more than 30 miles to be slaughtered.  The horses landed at Dieppe have to be travelled as far as Paris which is much more than 30 miles from the port of embarkation.  In other words, the Minister has decided to interfere with an export trade which was landing horses in good condition at Amsterdam, Antwerp and Dieppe. Antwerp is now the only place which will qualify under the Minister's Order.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the Minister has decided to put an end to the export of live horses for horse meat production but earlier this year, as Deputy Russell mentioned already, he put the ship-owners and the factory owners to considerable expense in complying with regulations which he made to ensure that horses would be very comfortably transported.  Having made those regulations, he makes an Order now which virtually puts an end to the export of work horses.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stipulates in the Order that only in special circumstances will a horse aged over seven years be allowed to be exported.  The Minister knows very well that the working capacity of an ordinary farm horse lasts up to the age of ten years, up to which period he is sturdy and in good health.  He knows very well that any farmer who has a horse aged <Col N="309" /> seven years has a horse in its prime. He has barely got the horse started into useful work on his farm but now the Minister proposes to insist on the animal being slaughtered here instead of permitting it to be exported.</P>
    <P>Very careful regulations have already been made regarding the physical condition of horses before they are exported.  No disabled horse may be exported.  It must be a healthy horse, capable of working and fit to travel.  In spite of these regulations made within the past 12 months, the Minister has made an Order which follows the lines of the British Act of 1937.  In 1937 in Great Britain regulations of this kind were made but the position in Great Britain differed very much from the position here. Nevertheless the Minister is following almost to the letter the British Act of 1937 relating to the export of horses.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to mend his hand if possible.  It is wrong to give what will be a virtual monopoly because in the long run it is the people who will have the horse to sell who must suffer, apart from those who derive a living in the normal way from the sale of horses from one farmer to another and for different purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to understand the attitude of Deputies who have addressed themselves to this matter.  If my memory is correct when the Order permitting the export of <Col N="310" /> horse flesh was first made in 1957 it was the intention and the hope that our export trade in live horses would disappear and that in its place we would have what is now not only aimed at but appears to be within our reach.  When that Order was made in 1957 the announcement provided as follows:</P>
      <P>Any person will be permitted to engage in the trade subject to compliance with conditions to be determined by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Any person will be permitted to engage in the trade provided his premises comply with the regulations and standards set up by the veterinary people of my Department.  It was, in fact, a source of disappointment to some Deputies on the opposite side&mdash;I do not know whether it really was a source of disappointment to them but they so expressed themselves&mdash;that this dead meat trade in horse flesh had not developed.  They &ldquo;skitted&rdquo; the Minister for Agriculture and the Government because as they said there was no appearance of this trade developing notwithstanding the announcement I have mentioned regarding the decision of the Government at the time.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Russell is aware that in accordance with that announcement I could not prevent, if I tried, or if I wanted to, a concern from coming in here as this concern proposes. Subject to these conditions I have not the right to prevent them.  The question of the capacity of the two existing concerns does not arise and could not influence me in that respect.  If you take the capacity of our meat factories that capacity is far more than adequate.</P>

      <P>It is far more than adequate, yet the factories are there.  I remember, when acting for a former Minister for Agriculture, meeting a deputation from the Deputy's own constituency regarding the establishment of a factory that has since developed.  I tried to persuade them not to go ahead because I thought at the time&mdash;I may have been wrong&mdash; that it was not a wise decision or a <Col N="311" /> wise investment, but even after I had tried to persuade them not to go ahead I said: &ldquo;Look here, having said all this, the decision is yours.  If you provide premises that satisfy the requirements of our veterinary people, I cannot stop you.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The same applies in this case but apart altogether from that aspect of this matter I am pleased to see this firm coming in here.  I am pleased for the reason that I gave at Question Time.  They are the best known people in Britain dealing with horse flesh.  They have contacts with the European trade and they have an organisation which it is not easy to come by.  Now, from the point of view of the effect that the Order I have made will have on prices, horses will, under licence, be exported from this country subject to the condition mentioned by Deputies.  The stipulation as to the place of slaughter after arrival was deliberately decided by me and, I would say, wisely decided.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan mentioned the fact that we were going to slaughter all these horses.  That number of horses is leaving the country now anyhow and the question arises is it better policy that they should be slaughtered here and develop this trade than to let them out of the country in the traditional way with all the hazards?</P>

      <P>The Minister said &ldquo;develop&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned the figure which was to have the effect of leaving us without horses in a short time.  If horses are leaving in the numbers mentioned by the Deputy will it not have the same effect if the horses are slaughtered here? As the Taoiseach said 12 months ago, and I am sure it was stated by other public men even before that, this was the sort of development which we would like to see taking place.  We selected the age of the animals as <Col N="312" /> seven years because it is possible to know the age of horses up to seven but not after that.  The very fact that horses under seven years can be exported under licence has, and will continue to have, an effect upon the price these concerns will pay for older animals for slaughter here.  I think that too is a useful provision because, while I could not say, and in fact nobody could say, what effect the making of that Order will have on the price of horses here, I was certainly anxious, while providing for the slaughter of horses in Ireland and building a trade with Britain and the Continent for horse flesh through the activities of reputable concerns, as best I could to protect the price structure as it is.  To some extent the fact that horses up to seven years can be exported will ensure that.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that first of all I could not have prevented this concern coming in here.  They first made an approach to our representatives in London and afterwards they discussed these matters with my Department. Finally, we agreed on this plan.  As I say, as far as I am concerned I welcome them and I could not have stopped them.  They are very welcome because I believe that a firm like the firm I have mentioned is vital so far as the development of this trade on a proper basis is concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not see why it should have the effect that Deputy Russell appears to fear.  I do not see why this organisation should not be capable of handling the horse flesh provided through these two concerns which I named.  Indeed, I think at present some of the business is being done with the firm the name of which I gave at Question Time today.  I am satisfied that it is a very desirable thing for this trade and I do not foresee any of the unfavourable consequences some Deputies fear.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 30th November, 1960.</P>
